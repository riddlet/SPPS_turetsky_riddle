Violence {erupted}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/mbvd/vigils-and-vandalism-in-a-st-louis-suburb-after-police-shot""> Sunday night in Ferguson, Missouri, a day after {police killed}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/police-in-missouri-reportedly-shot-and-killed-an-unarmed-tee""> an 18-year-old identified by local media as Michael Brown.

Though police have not yet provided details about the killing, witness reports indicated Brown was unarmed. The ensuing chaos Sunday included looting and vandalism. Police responded by deploying SWAT teams, tear gas, and hundreds of officers.

Much of the outrage after Brown’s killing focused on race. The St. Louis area — which includes Ferguson — has a long history of racial tension and strife, and the local president of the NAACP issued a statement after Brown’s killing saying he was “slaughtered” by law enforcement.

A {racial profiling report}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf""> from the {Missouri Attorney General’s Office}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/""> offers a glimpse into the way different races are treated by police in Ferguson.

The results seem to show that, at least when it comes to vehicle stops, black residents are disproportionately targeted by police.

The data — which comes from {the U.S. Census}<hyperlink=""http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/29/2923986.html""> — also shows that the city is almost one-third white, with small percentages of other races.

That means blacks represent 86% of all traffic stops last year. And despite representing nearly a third of Ferguson’s population, whites only made up 12.7% of the stops performed by Ferguson police. The remaining stops involved people of other races.

The report reveals that there were 521 arrests in 2013. Of those, 483, or 92.7%, involved blacks. A mere 6.9% involved whites, according to the report.

The contraband hit rate for the general population in Ferguson is 22.59%. The rate for blacks, however, is slightly lower, at 21.71%. That means about one in five blacks who are stopped are caught with contraband.

But whites have a significantly higher contraband hit rate: 34.04%. That means more than one in three whites who are stopped get busted for contraband.

The report does not offer explanations for these numbers, but does offer racial breakdowns for things like charges, searches, and other things.

The organization has been on the ground in Ferguson since Thursday. It sent a 13-person human rights delegation to the city in the wake of the Aug. 9 police shooting death of Michael Brown.

Jasmine Heiss, a senior campaigner with Amnesty and part of the team in Ferguson, said the use of the “cross-functional team” — which she said included community trainers, researchers, and human rights observers — was “unprecedented” within the U.S. for the group.

On Saturday, after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and put a curfew in place in Ferguson, Amnesty International USA’s executive director, Steven W. Hawkins, issued a scathing statement.

“We criticize dictators for quelling dissent and silencing protestors with tactics like curfews, we’ll certainly speak out when it’s happening in our own backyard,” he said. “The people of Ferguson have the right to protest peacefully the lack of accountability for Michael Brown’s shooting.”

[tweetbegin 500838813833637889 tweetend]

In an interview Sunday afternoon, Heiss said because of limits police placed on Amnesty’s access, “It was very difficult to see anything once the curfew went into effect last night.”

It was “impossible,” she said, for Amnesty to make any sort of judgment about whether actions taken by the police after the midnight curfew went into effect were proportional or necessary. She called it emblematic of “the overall lack of transparency in this investigation.”

Heiss noted the group’s long focus on criminal justice, including the use of excessive force, in the U.S. The group’s {Rights for All}<hyperlink=""http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR51/035/1998/en/0440cd04-da99-11dd-80bc-797022e51902/amr510351998en.pdf""> effort in 1998, which included {follow-up proposals}<hyperlink=""http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR51/147/1999/en""> for change in 1999, preceded specific investigations into the {Los Angeles}<hyperlink=""http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR51/076/1992/en/d2ae229d-f6f3-458a-ab03-666a103e7382/amr510761992en.pdf""> and {Chicago}<hyperlink=""http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR51/168/1999/en/6911d657-e013-11dd-adf6-a1bae6c1ea26/amr511681999en.pdf""> police operations.

In terms of specific cases, she noted that the group called for similar action by officials after the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida. The group there, she said, had called for a “thorough, impartial, swift investigation — with transparency,” emphasizing that a key tenet of that is “the family is kept informed” about the investigation.

On Sunday, after the team examined the situation in Ferguson, Amnesty International USA released three recommendations going forward:

• A prompt, thorough, independent, and impartial investigation into the shooting of Brown must take place. Brown’s family must be kept informed throughout the investigation. Under international law, police officers suspected of having committed unlawful acts must be held to account through effective investigation, and where warranted, prosecuted.

• All police departments involved in policing the ongoing protests in Ferguson in response to Brown’s death must act in accordance with international human rights standards. Any human rights abuses in connection with the policing of protests must be independently and impartially investigated, and those responsible held accountable.

• A thorough review of all trainings, policies, and procedures with regards to the use of force and the policing of protests should be undertaken.

",08/14/14,02/29/16,"St. Louis County medical examiner will not confirm the report that Michael Brown had marijuana in his system when he died.

The St. Louis County medical examiner’s officer told BuzzFeed Monday that their autopsy showed Michael Brown died from gunshots wounds, but “we’re not confirming the number, direction, or toxicology.”

{The Washington Post is reporting}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/county-investigation-michael-brown-was-shot-from-the-front-had-marijuana-in-his-system/"">In a statement, Gov. Jay Nixon said there will not be a curfew Monday night and the National Guard’s mission will be “limited.”
Last night, Ferguson, Missouri experienced a very difficult and dangerous night as a result of a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community. As long as there are vandals and looters and threats to the people and property of Ferguson, we must take action to protect our citizens.
Following coordinated attacks last night both on civilians and law enforcement officers, I signed an executive order directing the Missouri National Guard to help restore peace and order in Ferguson. The Guard’s immediate and limited responsibilities under the direction of Colonel Ron Replogle of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, are to provide protection, and ensure the safety of our Unified Command Center, which was the target last night of a coordinated attack. The Guard will concentrate its resources on carrying out this limited mission.
Missouri National Guard Brigadier General Gregory Mason will oversee Guard operations in Ferguson under the overall command of the Missouri State Highway Patrol.

With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard. We will not use a curfew tonight.
Again, I join the people of Ferguson, and all Missourians, in strongly condemning the violent acts we saw last night, including the firing upon law enforcement officers, the shooting of a civilian, the throwing of Molotov cocktails, looting and a coordinated attempt to overrun the unified Command Center.

We are all frustrated and looking for justice to be achieved regarding the shooting death of Michael Brown. As the dual investigations continue into what happened nine days ago at Canfield Green, we must defend Ferguson from these violent interlopers so that the peaceful protests can operate in peace and the search for answers and justice can continue. that Michael Brown had marijuana in his system when he died according to a person “who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.”

The St. Louis County medical examiner said they were aware of the article, but would not confirm the report that Michael Brown had marijuana in his system when he died.

A police helicopter circled overhead, its spotlight sweeping back and forth.

Then I heard the sound of shattering glass: A rubber bullet had been fired through a window of McDonald’s, which until then, had been one of the few sanctuaries on West Florissant Avenue.

Now I didn’t feel safe anywhere.

State troopers in riot gear and armored trucks moved south on West Florissant, firing flash grenades and tear gas canisters at a crowd of protesters who only minutes before had been chanting, “Fuck the police.”

In a panic, I turned to the crowd of officers behind me — some with arms folded, others holding batons — and sought an explanation: The state-imposed curfew wasn’t set to begin for another three hours. Where were we supposed to go?

The response: “You better get the fuck out of here.”

I’m a reporter, not a revolutionary, so I fumbled around for my car keys, yelled out to my friend and former colleague Justin, and we hopped into my rental car. Leaving through the front entrance wasn’t going to work: The streets were roiling with hundreds of panicked people and the flash bombs were even closer now. So I tried an escape route behind the restaurant, hoping I could slip down a back street that would lead us away. But a dumpster prevented our exit. We would have to get out of this on foot.

In the parking lot, a teenage boy in a white T-shirt and long black sweatpants was writhing around in pain. He screamed that he was on fire. A woman tried pouring water on his face, but it didn’t work. A smell like a fevered man’s sweat hung in the air — tear gas.

An older black man, probably in his fifties, a hat somehow still perched on his head, protested to no one in particular: “They didn’t give us no warning. They just started shooting. There’s babies in the street.”

It was true: Families and older protesters, who usually left around this time on previous nights, were caught in the crossfire. No longer were the police making a distinction between peaceful protesters and the younger, rowdier mobs that took over the street after nightfall. We were all potential anarchists and hooligans.

Days earlier, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson, a black native of Ferguson who had been put in charge of the police response, promised to enforce the curfew without trucks and tear gas. And even though police had broken that promise on Saturday night, Johnson remained popular on these streets. Sunday morning, he had apologized to the family of Michael Brown, the black teenager who was fatally shot last week by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. It was a moving speech that earned him widespread praise. Even in this community, grown so cynical about the police, Johnson was credibly selling himself as an agent of change. What had happened?

I fell into the teeming mass of people, most of them black, all of them confused. We were being flash-bombed and teargassed back to the south on West Florissant, giving us few options for escape. The most hotly contested sections of the street — in and around the QuikTrip that was burned down during a riot here last week — have no side streets and have been lined with metal gates that penned us in like cattle.

Most of us continued our retreat on West Florissant, the bombs and gas chasing us to some undetermined location. Some peeled off and ran to their homes in the neighborhoods that line the street. A relative handful — teenagers hopped up on adrenaline and hatred for cops — advanced forward. “We ready!” one yelled, “I’m gonna shoot one of these motherfuckers.”

In the commotion, I was separated from all of my friends and colleagues, and my phone ran out of power (I had gone to McDonald’s to recharge it). The streets seemed unusually dark, the lights coming mostly from car headlights. It had been an awfully long time since I felt that vulnerable.

By now, no one cared that I was a member of the media. I was just a black man among hundreds of them. I looked at their faces, scanning for anyone I might know. Some of them had tattoos, or gold teeth, or extravagantly manicured beards. They reminded me of my cousins or friends that I lost touch with. I wondered what police saw when they looked these men in their faces? Did they bother to look them in their faces? I wondered if the police could tell any of us apart.

Ahead of us (or behind us, as it were) was Chambers Road. At the intersection, I could see the flashing lights of police vehicles — another group of officers were, as Johnson would later say, acting to “protect lives and property.”

Just then, Justin tapped me on the shoulder, and, for a moment, I felt relief. We spotted a middle-aged white man with glasses and a notepad — a member of the media. I told Justin we should stick close to him. Our proximity to his whiteness might get us out of this, safely. I asked him where he worked. He offered a curt response then assiduously avoided us.

We were almost at Chambers. The officers who were stationed at a nearby convenience store were yelling at us. “Stop running or we will shoot you!” They pointed their guns. I slowed down and raised my arms. “I’m with the media!” I yelled. “What do you want us to do?”

Justin and I crossed to the far side of the street — to make it harder for them to shoot us if they got an itchy trigger finger. I grew increasingly desperate as I realized that nothing could protect me, not even those sworn to do so.

Alongside us was a black couple, likely in their forties. The man led the woman by the arm and made panicked arrangements for a ride. “Please, Jesus, come get us. Now!” Behind us was a group of boys, none older than 18, who took the opportunity to smash the glass of an auto parts store.

“Damn!” I yelled at them. “Don’t do that shit. They’re going to shoot us.” The officers kept their guns on us as we walked briskly into the parking lot of a large grocery store. People were hurriedly getting into their cars, skidding their tires to get the hell out of there. I realized then that we didn’t have a way to escape. Or even a way to call someone for help — Justin’s cell was also out of juice.

I saw a blonde white woman getting into a minivan. Something about her — the well-worn sweatsuit? the lack of makeup? — made me think she was a mother. I approached: “Can you please help us?” She didn’t even hesitate: “Get on in.”

Her name is Stacy Graham. She and her three children — ages 14, 9, and 7 — live 35 miles away in Jerseyville, Ill. “So much for the curfew, bitches,” she joked when we got into the car.

Stacy had come to Ferguson to visit her family and show her support for the Brown family. She was wearing a T-shirt that had Brown’s face on the front and the slogan “Murder is murder” on the back. Her support comes by blood: A black man, currently serving a nine-year prison sentence, is the father of her three children. “I worry that society has already deemed them doomed because of the color of their skin,” she said.

When we arrived in front of the hotel, I offered Stacy $10 for gas and for all the trouble. “It’s not about that,” she told me. I insisted and put the money in her ashtray. She got out of her minivan and hugged us long and hard. “If you need anything, call me.” We said that to each other.

About an hour later, Justin and I caught the end of Johnson’s press conference on cable news. He offered thanks to his troops for a job well done. Then he read from a script and rarely looked into the cameras.",40,NA,NA,NA
Buzzfeed,buzz6,http://www.buzzfeed.com/joelanderson/is-race-an-issue-in-ferguson-depends-on-who-you-ask#.yfEzRQoxP,Is Race An Issue In Ferguson? Depends On Whom You Ask,Joel Anderson ,08/16/14,02/29/16,"In that book and a follow-up edition that focused on life in town after the 1920s, the black contributions to Ferguson receive only a few passing mentions: slaves freed by merciful plantation owners, a Baptist church founded by former slaves in 1880, and a school that opened for black students in 1885 — though high school-aged children were forced to travel nearly 20 miles because the local high school wouldn’t accept blacks.

Mostly, the books are a tribute to the prominent white families and business owners in town: the Schmidt Bros Confectionary on Church Street, Bindbeutel’s Market, Kienstra Coal and Feed Company, to name a few. Only three black people, none of them identified, none of them women, can be found on the pages of those books.

The town’s white majority didn’t begin to dwindle until the 1970s, when white residents fled St. Louis and its inner suburbs, including Ferguson. By 2000, blacks made up half of the city’s population, and whites had dropped to 44%. Those trends continued through the 2010 Census, which found that more than two-thirds of the city was black and that whites made up less than 30%.

“I grew up here, and it’s always been a very diverse community,” said James Knowles, mayor of Ferguson since 2011, who is white. “So for people to come out and say that there’s some long-standing anger or there’s a history of racial tension is absolutely ridiculous,” he said. “There’s not a black-white divide in Ferguson.”

The mayor and the rest of the local government epitomize the black struggle to have a voice. Ferguson has rarely had more than one black city council member at a time. In April, voters elected the first black school board member — but earlier in the year, the then all-white board had ousted the area’s first black superintendent.
“The power structure is run by pretty much all white people,” said Don Calloway, a former Missouri state representative who is black and whose district included part of Ferguson. “All of these black people are basically under white rule.”

But it’s Ferguson’s police department that has received the most scrutiny, in part because of its paltry number of black officers and documented racial disparities in traffic enforcement. Last year, Missouri’s attorney general found that blacks made up 86% of all traffic stops in Ferguson despite being roughly two-thirds of the driving population. That data also showed Ferguson police officers were twice as likely to search and arrest blacks during these stops as they were whites.

“It’s part of the overall system letting us know that there’s no love for black people here,” said Kerry Woods, who lives in nearby Jennings but came out for Wednesday’s protest. “It’s a good ole boys system.”

On the other side of town, along a street with only a handful of black homeowners, Don Chisholm empathized with the desire for justice in the investigation into Brown’s death but was pained by the racial tension surrounding the case.

“I think the race relationships have always been good here,” said Chisholm, who has lived in Ferguson since 1965. “There’s no strife between the races. And I think these protests are going to damage that.”

Chisholm then echoed a sentiment common among nearly a dozen white residents interviewed by BuzzFeed over the past few days: “I wonder, are these professional protesters or people who really live here in Ferguson?”

The protesters, Tries reasoned, “they aren’t Ferguson residents.”

To counter the image of Ferguson as a town beset with racial division, sisters Laura and Elizabeth Knight staged their own demonstration along North Florissant Road on Thursday. About a mile away from where Brown supporters were rallying outside of the city’s police station, they hoisted “I heart Ferg” signs at passing motorists.

“This isn’t directed at any person,” said Laura, a recent graduate of Knox College in Illinois who hopes to move back to Ferguson. “I just love my community, and I’m proud to come from here. We’ve seen a lot of things on TV, but we don’t see enough positive.”

“I think you can be angry at things going on in a place without being angry at the place you live,” Elizabeth said.

Mayor Knowles did acknowledge one division in his town: that between homeowners and renters. “We have a divide, unfortunately, between people who stay here and people who live here,” he said. “We’ve got to find a way to integrate those people into the fold.”

Brown was fatally shot at a large apartment complex, Canfield Green, just off West Florissant Avenue. Brown was on his way to visit his grandmother, who lives in an apartment there.

Back at Prime Time, barber Toriano Johnson and others remembered Brown — a regular customer — as a lumbering teenager who didn’t say much. But at 6-foot-4, and built like an offensive lineman, Brown was hard to miss when he came through the doors of the shop.

What did Johnson think would come of Brown’s death? “I think it’s going to lead to the dismantling of the police department and the city government,” Johnson said. “Then we can start over. That’s what’s got to happen for us to all come together.”",32,NA,NA,NA

Buzzfeed,buzz8,http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/republicans-after-ferguson#.vt4D8kw2Y,Ferguson Is The Beginning Of The End For Conservatives’ “War On Crime”,Evan McMorris-Santoro ,08/19/14,02/29/16,"The crisis in Ferguson, Missouri has become the unlikely coming of age moment for the growing portion of the conservative movement that sees heavy-handed police forces, and their expensive military-style equipment, as the latest target in their half-century campaign against big government.

Libertarian Kentucky Senator Rand Paul stunned many on the ground in Missouri when he denounced the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in the pages of {Time}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police""> last week, writing that “if I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.”

His words built on a decade’s intellectual foundation laid by conservatives like the anti-tax campaigner Grover Norquist, one of the leaders in a campaign to break with decades of tough-on-crime posturing, and the race-baiting that has at times accompanied it, and to instead make common cause with liberals and black leaders to slash budgets for arming police and jailing young men for non-violent offenses.

The movement, led by the Texas-based Right on Crime, has helped pass bipartisan prison sentencing and recidivism legislation — mostly in red states — that has drawn {praise and support}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/inside-the-weirdly-bipartisan-very-optimistic-world-of-priso#2miyq0m""> from progressives. But Ferguson has given its leaders the opportunity to draw a surprising line in the sand, and in interviews with BuzzFeed Monday, its leading figures sided clearly with the largely peaceful protesters even as much of the conservative media focuses on images of violence and looting in the St. Louis suburb.

“What’s happened recently and recent events — tragic as they are — you’re beginning to see a national discussion and reevaluation of what makes sense, what works,” said Chuck DeVore, a former California Republican legislator, tea party Senate candidate, and current top official at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which houses Right On Crime.

“I think if you were to go to Ferguson, it would be interesting to find out how many of these young men have been in prison, or have family family members who have been to prison, or friends who have been in prison,” DeVore said, citing large-scale imprisonment as a factor in the frustration at the justice system exploding in Ferguson.

Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and a central strategist in the long conservative campaign to cut government spending, said the campaign against steroidal policing is a natural fit for the movement.

“On the right on this one, they’re saying, ‘I don’t know that’s happening here…and by the way what are all those things that look like tanks doing?’” Norquist said of Ferguson.

He also said Republicans like Paul have a political opportunity that Democrats lack — to ignore the tough-on-crime constituency of police and prosecutors.

“On the crime stuff, a Republican can stand up and challenge the aggressiveness of the cops,” said Grover Norquist, top dog at Americans For Tax Reform and a supporter of criminal justice changes. “Democrats are surrounded by the images of people who defend Mumia or whoever that guy is who killed those cops.”

Criminal justice issues also offer a rare slice of possible common ground for America’s divided, paralyzed legislature, though the impact of the past week in Ferguson on Washington’s legislative calendar remains hard to predict. Members of Congress coming back to Washington from their August recess will face a number of legislative efforts to demilitarize police forces on both the {federal}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/democratic-congressman-will-introduce-police-demilitarizatio#2miyq0m""> and {state level}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/conservatives-pushing-to-disarm-federal-agencies-hope-democr#2miyq0m""> stemming from Ferguson.

But for Washington’s Republican debate over criminal justice, Ferguson is already altering the landscape, say conservative supporters of shorter prison sentences, an end to the drug war, and an end to militarized police forces. Since the Republicans took control of the House in 2010, the libertarian-leaning conservative wing of the party that’s successfully pushed criminal justice system changes on the states has been shut out of the Washington debate for the most part by {powerful veterans}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/younger-republicans-try-to-drag-their-party-into-the-21st-ce#2miyq0m""> with 1980s “tough-on-crime” pasts. Now, the Right on Crime lobby sees a shot at a defining moment.

“If our policies were in place,” DeVore said, Ferguson might not have some of the divides he sees as at the root of the turmoil this week.

“Perhaps there would be lower unemployment,” he said. “Perhaps there would be more two-parent households.”",12,NA,NA,NA

Buzzfeed,buzz10,http://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/25-images-from-the-worst-night-of-violence-in-ferguson#.cyrrKX4XzM,25 Images From The Worst Night Of Violence In Ferguson,Tasneem Nashrulla ,08/18/14,03/02/16,"The worst violence in a week rocked Ferguson, Mo., Sunday night.

Police and protesters clashed again Sunday, hours before midnight curfew went into effect.

Armed riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a large group of protestors who marched toward a police command center in the parking lot of a shopping mall. Protesters threw back gas canisters and rocks at the police. Police responded to reports of multiple shootings, looting, and throwing of Molotov cocktails.

The violent chaos prompted Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to {deploy the National Guard}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/lisatozzi/live-coverage-fury-in-ferguson""> early Monday to help “restore peace and order.”

Following are scenes from Sunday:

The highly militarized police response to the protests in Ferguson has been widely observed — and widely criticized. Writing for Business Insider, {former Marine Paul Szoldra}<hyperlink=""http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8""> catalogued the military weaponry on display in Ferguson, then observed that “this is not a war zone […]. This is a city outside of St. Louis where people on both sides are angry.” Journalist Glenn Greenwald {wrote Thursday}<hyperlink=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/14/militarization-u-s-police-dragged-light-horrors-ferguson/""> that the events in Ferguson are “the destructive by-product of several decades of deliberate militarization of American policing.” And soldiers have {begun}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench/status/500028880749883393""> to draw {startling comparisons}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/BFriedmanDC/status/499728733830676480""> between their own armaments and those of the police.

The police weren’t always this militarized. In fact, American cops appearing and acting more like soldiers is a relatively new development.
The first SWAT teams were {organized in Los Angeles in the late 1960s}<hyperlink=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323848804578608040780519904""> as a {reaction to the Watts Riots}<hyperlink=""http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/12-2013/will_the_growing_militarization_of_our_police_doom_community_policing.asp#four"">, but militarization took a great leap forward in 1990, when Congress passed the {National Defense Authorization Act}<hyperlink=""https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/hr2461/text""> (NDAA). The act allowed the military to transfer excess gear from the Department of Defense to local police agencies for “counter-drug activities.” A few years later, the ball that began rolling with the NDAA became the 1033 program.
The program gives local police departments access to military-grade equipment like {M16 rifles}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/Weapons.aspx"">, military {aircraft}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/Aircraft.aspx"">, and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) {vehicles}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/Vehicles.aspx"">.

The Ferguson police participated in the 1033 program.
Michelle McCaskill, a spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency, {told USA Today}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-michael-brown-militarization-column/14006383/""> earlier this week the Ferguson Police Department had participated in the 1033 program. Most recently, police in the St. Louis suburb received two vehicles, a trailer, and a generator in November from the Department of Defense.

Other St. Louis area police agencies have participated as well, though a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Public Safety {told Newsweek}<hyperlink=""http://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537""> the heavy black vehicle seen in numerous photos near scenes of violence did not come from the program.

The Ferguson police aren’t alone. In fact, the program turned over nearly {half a billion dollars worth of military gear}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/default.aspx""> to thousands of police departments in 2013 alone.
According to the {Defense Logistics Agency}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/default.aspx"">, “more than 8,000” law enforcement agencies participate in the program, which has also distributed $4.3 billion worth of gear since it began.
Many states, {including Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.dps.mo.gov/dir/programs/cjle/dod.asp"">, have online systems to facilitate participation in the program.

According to {a recent study on militarized policing}<hyperlink='https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf"">, SWAT deployments tended to result in more use of force. The study also found that SWAT teams overwhelmingly impact minorities.
The study — conducted by the American Civil Liberties Union and released in June — paints a dire picture of militarized policing in the United States. It argues that militarization encourages police officers to adopt a “warrior mentality,” then chronicles numerous cases in which SWAT depolyments have killed and injured innocent bystanders. The study further found that “there is almost no oversight of SWAT at the state or local level.” Federal oversight also is lacking, the report adds.

The report echoes some of the concerns {raised last year}<hyperlink=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323848804578608040780519904""> in the Wall Street Journal by Radley Balko, author of {Rise of the Warrior Cop}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1610392116/?tag=buzz0f-20"">. Balko also noted that SWAT teams in smaller cities have proliferated. Last year the Associated Press also {reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=207340981""> on the lack of restraint in the military giveaway program.

The growing militarization of police forces may “doom community policing,” {according}<hyperlink=""http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/12-2013/will_the_growing_militarization_of_our_police_doom_community_policing.asp#four""> to the Department of Justice.

In a {report}<hyperlink=""http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/12-2013/will_the_growing_militarization_of_our_police_doom_community_policing.asp#four""> from 2013, the Justice Department raised concerns about SWAT teams, as well as other military-style uniforms and training. The report decries the “us versus them” mentality that these developments have created in American police forces.

Observers of the chaos in Ferguson this week seemed to agree. Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday in a {statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-854.html""> that the Department of Justice would offer assistance so local police didn’t have to rely “on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.” He also expressed concern over “the deployment of military equipment and vehicles.”
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul went even further, {responding}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> to Ferguson in Time by saying that police militarization makes it “almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them.”",13,NA,NA,NA

The police chief remained stoic, until he heard she was a State Senator. Then, with a shocked look, he responded “I hope not.”

Brown’s public memorial will be held at Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis and Rev. Al Sharpton will be giving a eulogy.

The Glendale, Mo., department announced in a statement yesterday that they suspended Matthew Pappert, who has been an officer since 2008, after “several very concerning and

St. Louis County police on Thursday released information on the 204 people they had arrested since protests began.

Nine of the arrested were from Ferguson, and a majority came from St. Louis, Jennings, Florissant, and other surrounding areas. A handful of people were from cities out of 

state, including San Francisco, New York, and Chicago.

More than half of people arrested were suspected of refusal to disperse. About 30 were expected to be charged with burglary or possessing stolen goods. One man from Austin, 

Texas, was arrested three times for failing to move; a man from St. Louis suburb Creve Coeur was arrested twice.

The data does not include arrests made by the Ferguson Police Department or other agencies.

Governor Nixon orders National Guard to begin pulling out of Ferguson.

“I greatly appreciate the men and women of the Missouri National Guard for successfully carrying out the specific, limited mission of protecting the Unified Command Center so 

that law enforcement officers could focus on the important work of increasing communication within the community, restoring trust, and protecting the people and property of 

Ferguson,” {Gov. Nixon said}<hyperlink=""http://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/gov-nixon-orders-missouri-national-guard-begin-systematically-withdrawing-city-ferguson"">. “As we 

continue to see improvement, I have ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin a systematic process of withdrawing from the City of Ferguson.”

On Monday, Gov. Nixon ordered the Guard to carry out the specific mission of protecting the Unified Command Center in Ferguson, which had been the target of a coordinated, 

planned attack the night before. Missouri National Guard Brigadier General Gregory Mason is overseeing Guard operations in Ferguson under the overall command of the Missouri 

State Highway Patrol.

Since that time, the situation has greatly improved with fewer incidents of outside instigators interfering with peaceful protestors, and fewer acts of violence.
Meanwhile, the unified command, which includes officers from the Missouri State Highway Patrol, St. Louis County, St. Louis City and other jurisdictions, will continue its 

mission to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness while protecting the rights of all peaceful citizens.

Capt. Ron Johnson held a news conference at 1:30 a.m., and said fewer “agitators” were in the crowd Wednesday night. He said in total six people were arrested — much less than 

last night’s 47 arrests.

“This was not a conflict-free night,” Johnson said, noting an officer was hit with a bottle that was thrown. He was not seriously injured.
Johnson also acknowledged the the crowd was much smaller and said he thought Attorney General Eric Holder’s presence helped calm tensions.

Michael Brown’s mother viewed her son’s body Wednesday for the first time since he was killed, before meeting with Attorney General Eric Holder.

Holder held a private 20-minute meeting with Michael Brown’s family, who asked about the investigation process. He said it would be “fair and independent,” according to the

representative was not aware that the building wasn’t zoned for occupancy and if it was it would need an occupancy permit. The representative escorted the officers to the 

location and voluntarily opened the building with a key. It appeared that five to seven people were sleeping in the facility but no one was present. Officers on the scene 

advised there was no animosity between the police or the representative of the church. The representative stated that he would advise the individuals to leave.

I can remember being stopped on the New Jersey turnpike on two occasions and accused of speeding. Pulled over…. ‘Let me search your car’… Go through the trunk of my car, look 

under the seats and all this kind of stuff. I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me.

according to Chief Dotson.

Regarding the victim, Dotson said, “I believe he’s 23, we’ll verify that, we haven’t been able to contact the family yet.”

Dotson said that St. Louis police will have a “very strong presence tonight” in the part of the city where the shooting occurred.

“The full resources of the Department of Justice have been committed to the investigation into Michael Brown’s death. This inquiry will take time to complete, but we have 

already taken significant steps. Approximately 40 FBI agents and some of the Civil Rights Division’s most experienced prosecutors have been deployed to lead this process, with

Suspect told officer, “Shoot me, kill me now,” chief says.

St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Chief Sam Dotson said a 23-year-old black man with a knife was shot and killed by a police officer in St. Louis.

According to police, the man took items from a store. When a clerk told him he needed to pay for what he had taken, the man started throwing the items, pacing the street, and 

talking to himself. The man was reportedly brandishing a knife, and did not respond to officers’ verbal commands to drop his weapon, he said. When the man got within four feet 

of one officer, both cops fired their guns.

The suspect was acting erratically and came at one of two officers with a knife, saying, “Shoot me, kill me now,” Dotson said.

A large crowd gathered at the scene, not far from Ferguson, according to reports, with people questioning the need to shoot the man.

Asked whether the events in Ferguson affected the speed which the chief provided information about his incident to reporters, Dotson said this is “how we do things normally 

here, putting out as much information as we can as soon as we can.”

Attorney General Eric Holder: “Selective release of sensitive information” is “troubling to me.”

Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement after his meeting with President Obama on Monday:
As I informed the President this afternoon, the full resources of the Department of Justice are being committed to our federal civil rights investigation into the death of Michael Brown.

“During the day today, more than 40 FBI agents continued their canvassing of the neighborhood where Michael Brown was shot. As a result of this investigative work, several new interviews have already been conducted.

“Moreover, at my direction, an additional medical examination is being performed on the body of Michael Brown. This autopsy is being performed today by one of the most experienced medical examiners in the United States military. I am confident this additional autopsy will be thorough and aid in our investigation.

“In addition to updating the President on these developments, I informed him of my plan to personally travel to Ferguson Wednesday. I intend to meet with FBI investigators, and prosecutors on the ground from the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney’s Office officials about the ongoing investigation.

“I realize there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to Michael Brown’s death, but I ask for the public’s patience as we conduct this investigation. The selective release of sensitive information that we have seen in this case so far is troubling to me. No matter how others pursue their own separate inquiries, the Justice Department is resolved to preserve the integrity of its investigation. This is a critical step in restoring trust between law enforcement and the community, not just in Ferguson, but beyond.

“In order to truly begin the process of healing, we must also see an end to the acts of violence in the streets of Ferguson. Those who have been peacefully demonstrating should join with law enforcement in condemning the actions of looters and others seeking to enflame tensions.

“To assist on this front, the Department will be dispatching additional representatives from the Community Relations Service, including Director Grande Lum, to Ferguson. These officials will continue to convene stakeholders whose cooperation is critical to keeping the peace. Furthermore, as the President has announced, Ron Davis, our Director of the COPS office, will arrive on the ground in Ferguson Tuesday. Ron has been in touch with local and state officials since last week, providing technical assistance on crowd control techniques and facilitating communications between Missouri officials and other law enforcement officials whose communities have faced similar challenges in the past.

Chris Geidner reports the 13 organizations — which include the ACLU, NAACP, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, National Action Network, and Rainbow Push Coalition — sent the letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday.

President Obama: “No excuse for excessive force by police or any action that denies people the right to protest peacefully.”

Speaking from the White House Monday, President Obama addressed the lingering unrest in Ferguson, Mo.

“It’s clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting,” Obama said.

But he said it’s clear a small minority are not, adding that the looting in Ferguson “undermines rather than advancing justice.”

“There’s no excuse for excessive force by police or any action that denies people the right to protest peacefully,” Obama said. “Ours is a nation of laws for the citizens who live under them and for the citizens who enforce them. So to a community in Ferguson that is rightly hurting and looking for answers, let me call once again for us to seek some understanding rather than simply holler at each other. Let’s seek to heal rather than to wound each other.”

President Obama said he hopes the National Guard deployed to Ferguson will be “used in a limited and appropriate way.”

Asked if there was more he could do for Ferguson, Obama said, “I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events.”

“Part of the ongoing challenge of perfecting our union is dealing with communities that feel left behind,” he said.

“In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,” Obama said. “In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear.”

Addressing the independent investigation into the death of Michael Brown, President Obama said that Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with community leaders.

St. Louis County medical examiner will not confirm the report that Michael Brown had marijuana in his system when he died.
The St. Louis County medical examiner’s officer told BuzzFeed Monday that their autopsy showed Michael Brown died from gunshots wounds, but “we’re not confirming the number, direction, or toxicology.”

{The Washington Post is reporting}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/county-investigation-michael-brown-was-shot-from-the-front-had-marijuana-in-his-system/""> that Michael Brown had marijuana in his system when he died according to a person “who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.”

The St. Louis County medical examiner said they were aware of the article, but would not confirm the report that Michael Brown had marijuana in his system when he died.
In a statement, Gov. Jay Nixon said there will not be a curfew Monday night and the National Guard’s mission will be “limited.”

Last night, Ferguson, Missouri experienced a very difficult and dangerous night as a result of a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community. As long as there are vandals and looters and threats to the people and property of Ferguson, we must take action to protect our citizens.

Following coordinated attacks last night both on civilians and law enforcement officers, I signed an executive order directing the Missouri National Guard to help restore peace and order in Ferguson. The Guard’s immediate and limited responsibilities under the direction of Colonel Ron Replogle of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, are to provide protection, and ensure the safety of our Unified Command Center, which was the target last night of a coordinated attack. The Guard will concentrate its resources on carrying out this limited mission.

Missouri National Guard Brigadier General Gregory Mason will oversee Guard operations in Ferguson under the overall command of the Missouri State Highway Patrol.
With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard. We will not use a curfew tonight.

Again, I join the people of Ferguson, and all Missourians, in strongly condemning the violent acts we saw last night, including the firing upon law enforcement officers, the shooting of a civilian, the throwing of Molotov cocktails, looting and a coordinated attempt to overrun the unified Command Center.

We are all frustrated and looking for justice to be achieved regarding the shooting death of Michael Brown. As the dual investigations continue into what happened nine days ago at Canfield Green, we must defend Ferguson from these violent interlopers so that the peaceful protests can operate in peace and the search for answers and justice can continue.

Attorneys and the forensic team who performed autopsy confirm Michael Brown was shot “at least six times, maybe more,” say the “kill shot” went from back to front.
Attorneys for Michael Brown’s family said Monday that the “kill shot” that struck Brown in the apex of his head went from a “back to front position,” which is consistent with eyewitness accounts that Brown was surrendering when he was shot by officer Darren Wilson.

The experts who conducted the autopsy on behalf of the Brown family, Dr. Michael Baden and professor Shawn Parcells, forensic pathologist assistant, confirmed that Brown was shot at least six times.

French said that he had returned to his car at the time of his arrest in order to shelter from the tear gas.

As night fell, police in Ferguson fired tear gas into crowds. Live video footage showed dense clouds wafting past people running in the streets with occasional explosions lighting up the scene and casting shadows onto the smoke.

“You’re going to see less militarization on the ground thanks to guidance from the Justice Department,” the official said Thursday afternoon.

Agencies from the department are following through on concerns about police tactics first raised by Attorney General Eric Holder in his statement on the Ferguson situation Thursday.

“I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,” Holder said.

Holder promised “technical assistance” to guide local law enforcement to a less militarized presence. The Justice Department official said advice was flowing between Justice Department officials and the St. Louis County police department, the agency in charge of the tumultuous scene Wednesday night. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon changed things up Thursday, placing the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of the Ferguson scene and dismissing the St. Louis County police.

The St. Louis County Police were receptive to federal advice, the official said. The Justice Department has now offered assistance to the Highway Patrol as well, the official said. Essentially, the federal assistance comes in the form of conversations, the official said. Department officials with experience in dealing with large crowds and an angry, divided community reach out to local law enforcement leaders and tell them what they know. In the case of Ferguson, the official said, what they know is to not do anything that will lead to violence.

“Not doing anything that’s going to incite,” the official said, referring to the militarized presence. “They need to scale back on that.”

“Right now the guidance is that they’re using excessive force,” the official added.

Half a dozen Justice Department agencies are helping to calm things in Ferguson. They include: the FBI, which is running an independent investigation of Brown’s death; Community Relations Services, which is helping to facilitate conversations between local leaders, protest leaders, and community leaders at groups like the NAACP; Community Oriented Policing Services, one of the groups helping advise the local cops on the ground in Ferguson; the Office of Justice Programs; the Justice Department’s Civil Right Division and the local U.S. Attorney’s office.

In the short term, these groups are working to create space for dialogue between the protestors and community leaders.

“The long-term goal is to build community trust,” the official said. “How do we heal, how do we bring the community back into the fold? There are a lot more meetings that are going to happen.”",0,NA,NA,NA

past the curfew.

Shortly before 3 a.m., Gov. Nixon condemns the violence in Ferguson and calls in the National Guard, {without informing the White House}

Gov. Nixon’s statement:

Tonight, a day of hope, prayers, and peaceful protests was marred by the violent criminal acts of an organized and growing number of individuals, many from outside the 

community and state, whose actions are putting the residents and businesses of Ferguson at risk. I join the people of Ferguson, and all Missourians, in strongly condemning 

this criminal activity that included firing upon law enforcement officers, shooting a civilian, throwing Molotov cocktails, looting, and a coordinated attempt to block roads 

and overrun the Unified Command Center. These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory, and to the people of this community who yearn for 

justice to be served, and to feel safe in their own homes. Given these deliberate, coordinated and intensifying violent attacks on lives and property in Ferguson, I am 

directing the highly capable men and women of the Missouri National Guard to assist Colonel Ron Replogle and the Unified Command in restoring peace and order to this 

community.

Nixon also called off the midnight curfew after the two nights of unrest.

One of the experts who conducted the autopsy, Dr. Michael Baden, says that Brown probably would have survived all but one of the bullets.

“All of the gunshot wounds were survivable except the one at the top of the head that went through the brain,” Dr. Baden says.

Attorneys for the Brown family say that the “kill shot” traveled from a “back to front position,” which is consistent with reports that Brown was surrendering when he was 

killed by Officer Darren Wilson.

John Lewis said the situation in Ferguson, Missouri reminds him of the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s in the United States. Lewis said President Obama needs to declare martial law to protect protestors and keep the situation from spiraling further out of control.

Here’s Lewis’ full answer to question from Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC about Ferguson:

It is very sad and unbelievable. It’s unreal to see what the police is doing there. First of all, Ferguson, Missouri is part of the United States of America. People have a right to protest. They have a right to dissent. They have a right to march in an orderly, peaceful, nonviolent fashion. And the press has a right to cover it. Ferguson, Missouri, it’s not the Congo. It is not China, It is not Russia. We can do better. It takes me back to the ’40s, the ’50s, the ’60s. To have a city that are majority African-American and only three African-American on the police force. Or to have local police officers refer to the protesters as animals. Or to have people dress in military garment and pointing rifles directly at the protesters. That is only going to incite people. So my own feeling is, right now, is that President Obama should use the authority of his office to declare martial law. Federalize the Missouri National Guard to protect people as they protest, and people should come together. Reasonable elected officials, community leaders and address what is happening there. If we fail to act, the fires of frustration and discontent will continue to burn, not only in Ferguson, Missouri, but all across America.",4,NA,NA,NA

Witnesses {also told Fox 2 News}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/09/man-shot-killed-in-ferguson-apartment-complex/""> that Brown and a friend had been walking in the middle of the street before the shooting.

Brown’s grandmother, Desiree Harris, {told ABC 12}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksat.com/content/pns/ksat/news/2014/08/09/us-police-shooting-missouri.html""> she was expecting a visit from her grandson the afternoon he was shot and had passed him in her car just minutes earlier. Then, when she was at home, she heard commotion outside, went to see what was going on, and discovered that her grandson was dead. “He was running this way,” she said to ABC 12. “When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn’t tell me nothing.”
The investigation at the scene of the shooting was expected to go well into the night.

St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman told BuzzFeed Saturday the officer involved in the shooting was a member of the Ferguson Police Department. Citing the ongoing nature of the investigation, Schellman said he could not confirm Brown’s identity or say if he was unarmed.

Schellman’s department was called in about two hours after the shooting to investigate, and he said he wouldn’t know additional details — including why the officer fired or if there were other weapons involved — until later. Detectives were still at the scene at 10 p.m. CT Saturday. The officer involved in the shooting has been placed on administrative leave, Fox 2 {reports}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/09/man-shot-killed-in-ferguson-apartment-complex/"">.

A picture {posted to Twitter}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/LuhhNate/status/498214303359438848""> purported to show Brown’s body lying in the street.

A video, posted to Instagram shortly after the shooting, also appeared to show a covered body lying in the street.

The incident rapidly prompted outrage from the surrounding community, with a large crowd gathering around the scene of the shooting. The Post-Dispatch {reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/fatal-shooting-by-ferguson-police-draws-angry-crowd/article_04e3885b-4131-5e49-b784-33cd3acbe7f1.html""> that the crowd chanted “kill the police.”

According to Schellman, “hundreds” of people {gathered}<hyperlink=""http://www.kentucky.com/2014/08/09/3373037/missouri-crowd-after-shooting.html?sp=/99/1250/""> at the scene after the shooting. The crowd was so large that detectives were unable to begin their investigation for an hour or more. “It never became a riot,” Schellman said. “I would classify it as a large disturbance.”

He called the outrage in community understandable. “They’re mad and they want justice and we understand that and we want to do a thorough investigation,” he told BuzzFeed.

Much of the anger over the shooting focused on race.

Also on Friday, rapper J. Cole released a song called “Be Free,” which excerpts quotes from Dorian Johnson, an eyewitness to Brown’s killing.

Cole attached this note to the song:

Rest in Peace to Michael Brown and to every young black man murdered in America, whether by the hands of white or black. I pray that one day the world will be filled with peace and rid of injustice. Only then will we all Be Free - Cole

On August 14, singer Frank Ocean weighed in on the crisis in Ferguson, Mo. on Tumblr, {posting this image}<hyperlink=""http://frankocean.tumblr.com/post/94800672736/you-see-that-black-woman-standing-up-there-i""> of Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson speaking at a press conference as Mo. Governor Jay Nixon watches.

At the conference on Thursday, Nixon charged Johnson’s Highway Patrol with overseeing security in Ferguson, following days of chaos after Brown was {shot and killed}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/police-in-missouri-reportedly-shot-and-killed-an-unarmed-tee""> by a Ferguson police officer.

Alongside the image, Ocean wrote:

You see that black woman standing up there? I wonder if she was called to stand behind the governor because she’s black. I wonder if i’m supposed to think Missouri’s gov’t is pro-black because of her being stood up there with those other black men being all black and everything. I wonder if she was off the clock while she stood up there. If she was off the clock..then i wonder if she was getting paid for her time off like the guy who shot Michael 8 times. What’s that guy’s name by the way?

A man with a white banner reading “ISIS here” appeared live on CNN in Ferguson, Missouri, behind anchor Jake Tapper late Monday night.

{The Blaze}<hyperlink=""http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/19/chilling-sign-seen-behind-cnns-jake-tapper-during-ferguson-protests/""> initially reported the banner. Some U.S. commentators have tried to discredit the Ferguson protestors as violent looters, though the large majority of demonstrators have been unarmed and peaceful.

BuzzFeed reached out to CNN for comment. “No, I don’t have any comment about a homemade banner a person holds up in a live shot behind our anchor while we are doing an interview during a protest,” Bridget Leininger of CNN wrote in an email.

The reaction on Twitter was largely not impressed.

Buzzfeed,buzz26,http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/in-ferguson-facebook-cant-deliver-on-its-promise-to-deliver#.hnnX7mbP8,How Ferguson Exposed Facebook’s Breaking News Problem,Charlie Warzel ,08/19/14,03/23/16,"
Last January Facebook aped Twitter’s {trending topics}<hyperlink=""http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/01/finding-popular-conversations-on-facebook/""> as well in order “to surface interesting and relevant conversations in order to help you discover the best content from all across Facebook.” The social network also hired the Wall Street Journal’s Liz Heron to help Facebook form partnerships with media companies and journalists. Just weeks later, Facebook launched FB Newswire, powered by the social content discovery platform, Storyful. Per the Facebook blog post:

News is finding a bigger audience on Facebook than ever before. Journalists and media organizations have become an integral part of Facebook, which is visible in features like Trending Topics, improvements to Pages, and recent changes to News Feed.

But despite these very public efforts, Facebook has largely failed to reflect the centrality of Michael Brown’s murder, Ferguson protests, and police backlash to the American news conversation, or to reflect the importance conferred on the story by both Twitter and editors of publications of all sorts. Facebook’s algorithmically controlled News Feed and Trending Topics have, in certain cases, been behind on Ferguson news (a Trending Topic last night while protesters and journalists were being teargassed, noted that protests were “relatively peaceful”) and often ignored Ferguson altogether. In an informal poll of BuzzFeed’s editorial staff, out of 38 accounts, Ferguson only appeared in Facebook’s Trending Topics 21 times (often well below NFL preseason, Taylor Swift, and ASAP Ferg news).

For many, there’s also a lack of relevant Ferguson coverage in News Feed. One colleague’s Facebook friend — who does not work in media — was so frustrated by the lack of Ferguson news that she created a fake life event saying she was married in order to post her thoughts about the protests. It worked. The fake marriage announcement (which is heavily weighted by Facebook) has stayed near the top of my colleague’s feed for some time.

So what’s to blame? A number of factors, it seems, ones that reflect both Facebook’s design and the user preferences it is so adept at tracking.

It all comes down to the complex set of algorithms, which are designed to show you content that you’re likely to care about. News from pages you’ve liked (the reason for a lot of that preseason NFL news), things that are popular among your friend group — especially when that content is also popular across greater Facebook. If it’s popular in your social graph, there’s a reasonable chance it will also end up in your greater stream (choose your friends wisely!).

If your friends don’t interact with the news, by either commenting or liking it, you’re less likely to see it, meaning that a decent part of the reason people aren’t seeing a glut of Ferguson coverage is that people don’t want to see it. Or that they don’t care. Or that they’re sending some other signal that Facebook takes to mean that the story is undermining their user experience. That, for better or worse, is the algorithm at work.

The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, on the other hand, is a phenomenon that is almost flawlessly tailored to Facebook. Not only does it have friends, celebrities, and a goofy but ultimately warm and fuzzy premise, it also makes use of Facebook’s native video player, a high engagement part of the platform, which is also given weight by Facebook’s algorithms, due to its popularity among users. It’s a perfect confluence factors for algorithmic dominance.

And that’s fine! Facebook and Twitter are still different platforms with different origins and functions. There’s no rule that Facebook has to be a place for second-by-second breaking news coverage and reports from the ground. Nor does Facebook have any moral obligation to force a specific news event upon its users. In fact, it is designed to do the very opposite by design: It wants to give you what you want! And, according to a recent experiment conducted by the {Washington Post’s Tim Herrera}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/08/18/what-facebook-doesnt-show-you/"">, often times that means content that’s more than a few days old.

But to suggest that Facebook is the internet’s best destination for breaking news is, at this moment, disingenuous. Has Facebook surfaced quality Ferguson content in News Feed and Trending Topics? Sometimes! Other times, like last night, it was entirely absent from my News Feed and, save for two posts from the conspiracy site Infowars and a link to John Oliver’s monologue on Last Week Tonight, there was little of value in Trending Topics.

Whatever the quality, Facebook’s importance as a news source is only continuing to grow. A Pew report from nearly a year ago shows that 30% of U.S. adults admit to consuming news on Facebook, a number that’s surely grown in the past year. And there’s little doubt that figures like these numbers have something to do with Facebook’s investment in News over the past year. But despite its intentions, Facebook’s cryptic algorithms remain quite distant from the editorial judgement that seems to be what executives there mean when they talk about news. When BuzzFeed reached out to Facebook for this piece to ask for clarification on Ferguson coverage in News Feed and Trending topics with regard to the algorithm, a spokesperson for the social network could only note that content that appears in Trending Topics have no influence on what an individual sees in her News Feed. Facebook also provided BuzzFeed with a FAQ page for Trending Topics and News Feed.

But one senior Facebook employee appeared to acknowledge that the social network knows it has a Ferguson problem. Facebook product manager, Mike Hudack (who {this past May}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/why-a-facebook-employee-just-scared-the-hell-out-of-the-medi#3qty2ko""> publically lamented the “hollowing out” of most major newspapers and the failure of new internet-native media) commented that the company was “actually working on it,” in response to complaints about the lack of hard news.

Perhaps the change will come in the form of a more prominent FB Newswire, which has done perhaps the best job of any Facebook platform in covering Ferguson. Or perhaps very little will change. After all, Facebook, for the most part, asks us what we want to see and projects that image back to us. For some, Facebook’s shortcomings on Ferguson coverage is a moral issue, for others it’s a {net neutrality issue}<hyperlink=""https://medium.com/message/ferguson-is-also-a-net-neutrality-issue-6d2f3db51eb0""> or a media punditry issue. And for some — and I’d guess a large number — we may have to accept that it’s not an issue at all.",18,NA,NA,NA
Buzzfeed,buzz27,http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/national-black-groups-release-joint-unity-statement-on-fergu#.efGlAZBLE,National Black Groups Release Joint “Unity” Statement On Ferguson And “Police Abuse”,Chris Geidner ,08/18/14,03/23/16,"A coalition of more than a dozen national organizations focused on “the protection of the rights of African-Americans and all Americans” issued a joint statement calling for a “comprehensive federal review” of excessive use of force and racial profiling by police across the country.

“As we all mourn the loss of Michael Brown and remain steadfast in our unyielding support for his mother and father who have suffered a loss no parent should endure, we also continue to call upon the community at large to make sure that this tragedy results in future systemic change to prevent similar tragic shootings and the use of excessive force.”

The 13 organizations — which include the ACLU, NAACP, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, National Action Network, and Rainbow Push Coalition — sent the letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday, an ACLU spokeswoman told BuzzFeed.

The first of the groups’ 14 recommendations is “an independent and comprehensive federal investigation by the Department of Justice of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown.”
But, the statement looks more broadly, noting, “Nothing will be resolved until there is systemic change throughout this nation in the implicit and explicit bias against people of color and particularly African-American youth who are routinely targeted by law enforcement even within their own communities.”

Among the other recommendations are “the universal use of dash cameras in police vehicles,” along with “a final update and release of the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) June 2003 Guidance Regarding the Use of Race by Federal Law Enforcement Agencies” — a step long-sought by advocates — to include five “substantive reforms”:

1) make the Guidance enforceable;
2) apply the Guidance to state and local law enforcement who work in partnership with the federal government or receive federal funding;
3) close the loopholes for the border and national security;
4) cover surveillance activities;
5) prohibit profiling based on religion, national origin, and sexual orientation.

The town has since {been in chaos}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/violence-escalates-in-ferguson-as-police-and-protesters-clas"">, with racial tensions running high and police clashing with protesters.

Students at Howard University in Washington, D.C., decided to show their solidarity with Brown and those who are protesting in Ferguson by taking a photo with their hands raised in the air. According to some witnesses, Brown raised his {hands in the air}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/powerful-images-from-ferguson-after-the-death-of-michael""> before he was shot by an officer to show that he was unarmed.

“We had the option to opt out of the picture, but I chose to get involved because this is a very close issue to my heart,” Megan Sims, a junior at Howard, told BuzzFeed. “Police brutality has got to stop, and the number of young black men killed by trigger-happy police is rising, which breaks my heart.”

Sims {tweeted the photo}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/The_Blackness48/status/499714499688300545/photo/1""> on Aug. 13 at about 8:30 p.m. EST, and it now has almost 7,000 retweets and over 4,000 favorites.

The fall semester at the university officially begins Aug. 25, but Sims explained that she volunteered to help freshmen move in to the dorms. At the volunteers’ mandatory meeting on Aug. 13, the Howard University Student Association said they believed the university should respond to what was going on.

Khalil Saadiq, a student on the Howard Student Association’s advocacy committee, is being credited as the organizer behind the photo. “It was his idea to do the picture,” Sims said. BuzzFeed reached out to Saadiq but didn’t hear back.

Sims told BuzzFeed the student association wanted everyone who was on campus to take a picture with their hands up in solidarity for both Brown and also Mya White. She said that White, a protester in Ferguson who was apparently {shot in the head}<hyperlink=""http://thatsenuff.com/index.php/2014/08/howard-alum-was-shot-in-the-head-in-ferguson-conflicting-reports-on-what-took-place-photovideo/""> by police, is also a Howard alumna.

“I hope people look at the picture and see that the issue is bigger than Mike Brown, bigger than Eric Garner, bigger than so many other young blacks killed by the police,” Sims said. “This issue is about the fact that this country is not post-racial, this country is not just, this country is not free.”",8,NA,NA,NA
Buzzfeed,buzz33,http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/president-obama-urges-calm-and-healing-in-ferguson-missouri#.bhA4YX6Lp,"President Obama Urges Calm And “Healing” In Ferguson, Missouri",Andrew Kaczynski ,08/14/14,03/23/16,"President Obama urged calm in Ferguson, Mo., in remarks Thursday on the escalating situation between police and protestors following the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown at the hands of a police officer.

“I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we’ve seen in the heartland of our country as police have clashed with people protesting. Today I’d like us all to take a step back and think about how we’re going to be moving forward,” the president said. “This morning I received a thorough update on the situation from Attorney General Eric Holder and have been in communication with his team. I’ve already tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI to independently investigate the death of Michael Brown along with local officials on the ground.”

The president added the Department of Justice was working with local authorities to find ways to maintain peaceful protests while avoiding “unnecessary escalation.”
Obama also spoke Thursday with Jay Nixon, the governor of Missouri, who is traveling to Ferguson to make sure public safety is maintained.

“I also just spoke with Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri. I expressed my concern over the violent turn that events have taken on the ground and underscored that now’s the time for all of us to reflect on what’s happened and to find a way to come together going forward. He’s going to be traveling to Ferguson. He’s a good man and a fine governor, and I’m confident that working together he’s going to be able to communicate his desire to make sure that justice is done and his desire to make sure that public safety is maintained in an appropriate way.”

Reflecting on the death of Michael Brown, which the president called “heartbreaking,” Obama urged a transparent investigation from local police into the teen’s death.

“Of course, it’s important to remember how this started. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again. And when something like this happens, the local authorities — including the police — have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death and how they are protecting the people in their communities.

Obama said “there is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Speaking on the arrest of two journalists, the president said police should not be arresting journalist or “bullying” journalists “who are just trying to do their jobs.”
The president concluded by urging calm in Ferguson and saying, “Now’s the time for healing,” adding to let the investigation into Brown’s death run its course to see that “justice is done.”

“Let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law,” he said. “A basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest. A reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman, and child among us and the need for accountability when it comes to our government.”",5,NA,NA,NA

Leaders of the {National Hispanic Leadership Agenda}<hyperlink=""http://nationalhispanicleadership.org/"">, a nonpartisan association of 37 of the leading Latino organizations across the country, sent BuzzFeed statements on Brown’s death.

“Mothers of color should not have to fear that our children will not be safe in our neighborhoods and city streets,” said Jessica González-Rojas, Executive Director at the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health. “The militarization and violent conduct, whether of police or immigration enforcement officials, are issues of human rights and racial justice, and warrant full investigation and accountability measures. My deepest condolences to Michael Brown’s family and all communities facing state violence.”

José Calderón, President of the Hispanic Federation, said Latinos — like Americans of all backgrounds – are collectively outraged at what transpired on the streets of Ferguson.

He said they “stand with all who call for a swift, just investigation to determine how another unarmed black young man was killed by those who are given the solemn responsibility to protect and serve all of us.”

Juan Carlos Areán, Senior Director of Casa de Esperanza: National Latin@ Network, an organization committed to ending violence, said he commended the recent shift in tone towards a response that values and includes community participation. Areán cited the change in security leadership when St. Louis police were pulled from Ferguson streets and {Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiakoerner/tensions-ease-as-highway-patrol-captain-takes-over-security""> was put in charge of the law enforcement response.

Brent Wilkes, executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), said his organization will be vigilant in ensuring that justice and accountability are served.

“Our prayers go out to Michael Brown’s family and friends who, instead of planning a graduation party, are planning his funeral. The pain and anguish of losing a child are unimaginable, especially when the child was taken at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve the community,” he said in a statement.

A spokesman from National Council of La Raza (NCLR), one of the top national Latino organizations, was not available for comment at the time of publication.

Immigrants rights organizations also expressed support, many feeling that it was appropriate for them to join in solidarity with a community — black Americans — who they say have been fighting criminalization for far longer.

“We’ve been fighting really hard to get the president to stop deportations and that has been a criminalization of immigrants and Latinos. It’s high time we join forces with communities that have been fighting police brutality and mass incarceration for far longer,” Marisa Franco of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), told BuzzFeed. “Mike Brown is not the first, but the latest in an epidemic of violence. We say, not one more black person murdered by police, not one more struggle fought alone, not one more life criminalized as we continue our struggle for not one more deportation.”

Felipe Sousa-Rodriguez, deputy managing director of United We Dream said it stands in solidarity with the Brown family and with the African-American community “for whom tragedies like this happen much too often.”

Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, said that especially since 9/11, too much of the focus has been on national security, while African-American communities have been over-policed.

“The level of mistrust and distrust that has been sown, whether against a black man or a ‘suspicious’ undocumented person, is the same with racial profiling, discrimination, and violence,” she told BuzzFeed.

Franco said that while she doesn’t want to conflate immigrant rights and what’s happening to the black community, she said they are born from the same place.

She called on other Latino and immigrant organizations to come out in support of those protesting in Ferguson.

“Latino and immigrant rights organizations need to speak out and offer support for whatever is needed,” she said.
Hincapié said it’s all part of the same struggle.

“I think our duty is about organizations that care about justice, whether immigrant justice, racial justice, social justice, or economic justice, it’s all part of the same struggle,” she said.

“Too much injustice is happening to our young people, especially our black and brown children.”",2,NA,NA,NA
Buzzfeed,buzz35,http://www.buzzfeed.com/mikehayes/ferguson-police-statement-mike-brown#.kp17ld6OL,Ferguson Police Ask Demonstrators Not To Protest After Dark,Mike Hayes ,08/13/14,03/23/16,"The Ferguson, Mo., police department called for an end to the {nightly demonstrations}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/man-shot-and-critically-injured-by-police-during-a-third""> that have {taken place}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/powerful-images-from-ferguson-after-the-death-of-michael""> since an officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager.

Ferguson police suggested in a statement that the decision to ban the protests after dark was due to violence by the demonstrators:

“We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized respectful manner. We further ask all those wishing to demonstrate or assemble to disperse well before the evening hours to ensure the safety of the participants and the safety of our community. Unfortunately, those who wish to co-opt peaceful protests and turn them into violent demonstrations have been able to do so over the past several days during the evening hours. These events are not indicative of the City of Ferguson and its residents.”

The statement put out Wednesday from the Ferguson Police Department was the first official release by the department since 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed Saturday — more than 90 hours ago.

Later on Wednesday, during a news conference, Police Chief Thomas Jackson said police were not imposing a curfew.

“There are some people that come out and after dark it does get a little dangerous,” Jackson said. “We think it is better for peaceful demonstrations to occur during the daylight.”

Jackson also defended his department’s response to the nightly protests. Some demonstrators were hit with tear gas and rubber bullets were fired on Monday night.
During the news conference, {Missouri State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal asked}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/alisonvingiano/missouri-state-senator-says-she-was-gassed-in-ferguson-asked""> the chief, “Do you know if I’m going to gassed again, like I was Monday night?”
“I hope not,” Jackson replied.

Jackson reiterated Wednesday that he would not release the name of the officer who allegedly shot Brown, citing safety concerns. {The decision not to release the name was slammed by attorney Ben Crump, lawyer for the Brown family}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/mikehayes/police-wont-release-name-of-officer-who-shot-unarmed-missour"">.

Jackson said the officer and Brown had a violent confrontation prior to the shooting and the officer was hit in the face. Family and friends of Brown have disputed the police account.

Jackson said the department is trying to soothe tensions in Ferguson. “Apparently, there’s been this undertow that now has bubbled to the surface, and it’s our first priority to address it, to fix what’s wrong,” he said.

The FBI is conducting an inquiry into the shooting and St. Louis County Police is investigating the case.
St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch said Wednesday the case is in the “{information-gathering stage}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-county-prosecutor-we-re-still-in-the-information/article_7fb366f0-2f29-5bdd-b18b-34c9d8c688e7.html"">” and asked people with evidence to come forward.

Buzzfeed,buzz38,http://www.buzzfeed.com/joelanderson/when-will-it-end#.plL6QeLRX,Ferguson: When Will It End?,Joel Anderson ,08/16/14,03/23/16,"At 11:15 Friday night, the rain was coming down harder, and the Mardi Gras-like revelry along West Florissant Ave seemed to be winding down. The live band had long since stopped playing music, the crew of break dancers had collected their cardboard mats, and motorists were moving more smoothly through the streets.

Finally, it seemed, Ferguson was nearing a much-needed catharsis. But within half an hour, the street party had turned into a standoff.

In the parking lot outside the convenience store where Michael Brown allegedly stole a box of Swisher Sweets cigars, police officers, most of them white men, were wearing ordinary uniforms — no SWAT-style helmets or batons. Across the parking lot, hundreds of teenagers, most of them black and male, many shirtless, began to taunt the police. “Pussies!” some shouted. “Fuck yo bitch asses!” An unidentified man tossed an empty liquor bottle in the direction of the police. By the time it shattered, dozens of people were rushing away from the scene, and police were scrambling for their riot gear.

“We got guns too,” one man screamed back at the officers. “Let’s bang it out.”

Today it’s worth wondering if, and when, it will all end. Protests have been scheduled for at least the next three days, and many of the young men who took part in last night’s chaotic scene promised to hit the streets again the following night — some to protest but some just to torment the police.

That might mean a direct challenge of Gov. Jay Nixon’s order, issued today, of a curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. “This is a test,” Nixon said, while declaring a state of emergency. “The eyes of the world are watching.”

But if last night night is any indication, the world may watch another confrontation.

During the evening, peaceful protesters moved easily through the streets, resuming the chant that has come to define their movement: “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” Teenagers parked their cars along the street, listening to music and playfully running around. Some climbed on top of the hoods and roofs of their vehicles, dancing and whooping the night away. A few even gathered outside the scorched remains of a gas station destroyed during a protest earlier in the week, watching a young boy, no older than 7, jump into a break-dancing session.

This seemed exactly what Nixon and federal officials had hoped for the day before when they promised less restrictive enforcement after days of angry, combative clashes between officers and protesters. The police had only a minimal presence on the street throughout much of the night.

But the tenor of the evening started to change as the rain began to fall, and older protesters and families headed home. Left behind was a crowd of young people, many drinking and smoking, mostly men, who became increasingly hostile toward the officers working the streets.

Later, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson, a native of the area who is in charge of crowd control, said officers were confronted by young agitators in the parking lot of Ferguson Market and Liquor. Johnson said he ordered another armored truck over to the store to assist the officers, which only ignited the tension. Three officers were injured in the subsequent melee, Johnson said, and at least one of them deployed a can of tear gas.

Not long after that, police in riot gear stood at the corner of West Florissant and Ferguson avenues, ordering people to go home. That didn’t happen. Instead, some people yelled and cursed at the officers from about 100 yards away — “Fuck the police!” echoed throughout the streets — while others took the opportunity to loot several nearby stores, including some that had been hit earlier in the week.

Several community leaders, including St. Louis Alderman Antonio French and members of the New Black Panther Party, worked hard to prevent the crowd from provoking the officers. Others pleaded with the mob to leave the stores alone and go home. Even rival gang members joined together to protect some businesses and urge calm.

The fracas went on for about three hours, a high-stakes blinking contest, with the city on the precipice of an even more dangerous revolt. Then, around 4 a.m., the officers got into their vehicles and drove away. Johnson said later that no arrests were made.

“We did it, now let’s go,” said Anthony Shahid, a longtime Ferguson resident and leader in the New Black Panther Party. He tried to shoo away the remaining stragglers. “See you tomorrow.”

Left behind were streets strewn with trash, tear gas lingering in the air, and uncertainty about what was to come next.

In a few hours a curfew takes effect. “I’m going to make sure we’re not going to use any force that’s not necessary,” Johnson said.

Ferguson, and the world, will be watching.",21,NA,NA,NA

The survey by the nonpartisan group found blacks said the shooting “raises important issues about race that need to be discussed” by a majority of four to one. For whites, only 37% saw the same issues of race.

The divisions continue in discussion of the police response to protesters in the city, the survey found. A majority of blacks — 65% — said police overstepped in their actions. Among whites, roughly the same amout of respondents said police actions went too far, seemed about right or they didn’t know.

Whites’ thinking on race issues has changed, however, since the shooting death of another unarmed black teen, the survey found.

In 2013, after a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of the murder or manslaughter of Trayvon Martin, 60% of whites surveyed thought race was getting too much attention in the case. Now, that number has dropped to 47% when whites are surveyed about Brown.

Among black respondents, opinions have remained roughly the same.

The survey found other groups of Americans were also divided in how they saw the issue.

Reactions to last week’s events in Ferguson divide the public by partisan affiliation and age, as well as by race.
