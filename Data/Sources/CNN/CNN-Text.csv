A gas station was looted, and police called for additional units to back up officers already on the street, said Brian Schellman, spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department.

Video from the scene showed police in riot gear. No injuries were immediately reported.

""They are sending in more officers to try and get the situation under control,"" Schellman said.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that at least 20 police cars were damaged and that the use of tear gas was a high possibility.

A friend and witnesses say Missouri teen Michael Brown was unarmed and had his hands in the air when a Ferguson police officer shot and killed him, but that account is in dispute.

""The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,"" Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County Police Department, said at a Sunday news conference.

The officer tried to leave his vehicle just before the shooting on Saturday afternoon, but Brown pushed him back into the car, ""where he physically assaulted the police officer"" and struggled over the officer's weapon, Belmar said.

A shot was fired inside the police car, and Brown was eventually shot about 35 feet away from the vehicle, Belmar said, adding few details because he didn't want to ""prejudice"" the case.


All shell casings collected at the scene were from the officer's weapon, Belmar said. He further said the medical examiner would issue a ruling on how many times Brown was shot, but ""it was more than just a couple.""

The account was in stark contrast to those of witnesses who said Brown did nothing to instigate the shooting and appeared to be surrendering when he was killed.

""My son just turned 18 and graduated high school and he didn't bother nobody,"" the young man's mother, Lesley McSpadden, {told}<hyperlink=”http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/09/police-shooting-ferguson/13832083/”> CNN affiliate KSDK.

Ferguson Police cars do not have dash cameras, the department said.

McSpadden was told her son was shot eight times, though witnesses had varying accounts of how many shots were fired. Brown was supposed to start classes at Vatterott College on Monday, she said

Antonio French, the Ward 21 alderman in nearby St. Louis, {tweeted numerous photos and videos}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench”> from the aftermath of the Saturday shooting. Brown was shot shortly after 2 p.m., according to reports.

Hundreds of demonstrators -- as many as 1,000 at the height of the protests, according to police -- converged on the scene Saturday, at one point driving away a police squad car, French said on Twitter.

Scores of police officers lined the street. One of them held the leash of a barking dog, and French said some officers wielded shotguns. One image showed a riot van on the scene.

Demonstrators held their hands in the air and chanted, ""We are Michael Brown."" Others held signs, including one that said, ""No justice, no peace"" and another that read, ""Police stops should not = dead kids."" There were reports that some protesters yelled, ""Kill the police.""

Demonstrators at one point set a Dumpster on fire, according to {CNN affiliate KMOV}<hyperlink=”http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html”>, and Ferguson Police Chief Jackson told KSDK, ""It did get a little tense when, twice, several shots were fired.""

The Ferguson Police Department called more than 100 officers from 15 jurisdictions to secure the scene, KMOV reported.

""We had what probably bordered on riot conditions,"" Jackson said, explaining that it took hours to process the scene, collect evidence and move Brown's body.

Later, according to media reports, about 100 people took their protest to the Police Department in Ferguson, a northern suburb that's about a 20-minute drive from St. Louis. Officers were deployed to ensure the demonstrations were peaceful, the police chief said.

McSpadden had pointed words for the officer who shot her son.

""You're not God. You don't decide when you're going to take somebody from here,"" she told KSDK.

Jackson said the St. Louis County Police Department was conducting an independent investigation, and during the Sunday news conference, Belmar expressed doubts that Jackson would've called his department so promptly ""if he had something to hide.""

The officer who shot Brown is on paid administrative leave during the investigation and will be available to talk to county homicide detectives.

The officer has been with the force six years, Belmar said, adding that he is ""unaware of any other issues that he's been involved in.""

He will be required to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty, Belmar said.

The St. Louis County NAACP is asking the FBI to open an inquiry and said it would conduct its own investigation into the killing.

""We plan to do everything within our power to ensure that the Ferguson Police Department as well as the St. Louis County Police Department releases all details pertinent to the shooting,"" local chapter President Esther Haywood said in a statement.

A Justice Department spokeswoman said Attorney General Eric Holder has instructed the department's civil rights division to monitor the developments in the case.

The FBI said it is assisting police in its investigation and will review the findings.

Federal authorities typically await completion of the local investigation before deciding whether federal action is needed.

Brown was spending the summer in the neighborhood with his grandmother, Desuirea Harris, {she told KMOV}<hyperlink=”http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html”>. She described him as ""a good kid.""

He was walking with at least one other man at the time of the incident, Jackson said.

Witnesses told {CNN affiliate KTVI}<hyperlink=”http://fox2now.com/”> that a police officer in a squad car grabbed Brown while he was walking.

Dorian Johnson said he was walking with Brown in the middle of the street when a police car pulled up. The officer told the teens to use the sidewalk, according to Johnson.

After an exchange of words, the officer shot Brown even after he raised his hands in the air, Johnson said.

The officer ""shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air,"" Johnson told KMOV. ""He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""

The police chief declined to divulge specifics about the case, including what preceded the shooting.

Brown enjoyed music and had recently graduated from Normandy High School in Wellston, his uncle Bernard Ewing said.",0,NA,NA,Many of the hyperlinked articles to local news sources no longer exist. 
CNN,cnn2,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html,"Gunshots, tear gas in Missouri town where police shot teen",Ashley Fantz; George Howell; Catherine E. Shoichet,08/12/2014,10/26/2015,"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- Hours after federal civil rights investigators and the FBI opened an inquiry into the death of a teenager shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, violence flared again in the St. Louis suburb.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN shots were fired Monday night in Ferguson, and police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered in an area where looting occurred Sunday.

""Officers were brought in to quell the hostilities,"" he said. ""Tear gas was deployed.""

The Saturday-night shooting, which left 18-year-old Michael Brown dead, has fueled rising tensions in the town of 21,000 and sparked national debate.
One side says the African-American teenager was surrendering, his hands in the air to show he was unarmed, when the officer opened fire. Authorities counter that Brown had attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun.

After a vigil for the teen devolved into chaos Sunday when violence and looting broke out among some protesters, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks called Monday for people protesting Brown's death to do so nonviolently.

""We have seen young people giving in to violence and frustration and rage. It may be inexcusable. It is not unexpected,"" Brooks told reporters. ""But I say to my young brothers and sisters, note the young man whose rage is your heart, note that he was nonviolent. He never got into a fight. If you want to honor his memory, honor his memory by seeking justice nonviolently.""

{Witnesses to Brown's shooting}<hyperlink=”http://www.kmov.com/news/editors-pick/FBI-SLCPD-continuing-Ferguson-shooting-investigation-270811931.html”>say he was unarmed and had his hands in the air when the police officer shot him.

Authorities tell a different story. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar says the officer tried to get out of his vehicle just before the shooting, but Brown pushed him back into his car.

Brown ""physically assaulted"" the officer, Belmar said, and the teen tried to get the officer's weapon.

Brown was shot about 35 feet from the vehicle, the chief said, declining to provide more details. The officer's name has not been released by authorities.

""The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,"" Belmar said, adding that his department has been called in to conduct an independent investigation.

The Ferguson Police Department said its cars are not equipped with dashboard cameras.

Shell casings collected at the scene were from the officer's weapon, Belmar said.

Monday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the shooting ""deserves a fulsome review"" by federal investigators.

""At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right. I will continue to receive regular updates on this matter in the coming days,"" Holder said in a statement. ""Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.""

Mother: 'No violence, just justice'

The lawyer representing Brown's parents called Monday for a swift investigation.

""We want this investigation to be done fairly, and we make a demand to the Justice Department to come in and help restore trust and confidence in the process of equal justice. ... This family is very distrustful. This community is very distrustful,"" attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters, calling for witnesses to come forward.

Brown's parents urged people to remain calm.

""No violence, just justice,"" the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told reporters.

McSpadden said her son recently graduated from high school and was supposed to start college Monday.

""We can't even celebrate,"" she said. ""We've got to plan a funeral.""

Standing beside the teen's family, Brooks said the NAACP is committed to determining what happened.

""We are committed to this family, committed to seeking justice, committed to being a presence, day-in and day-out,"" he told reporters.

Mayor calls for calm

""Obviously, the events of last night are not indicative of who we are,"" {Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said on CNN}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/08/11/exp-missouri-city-erupts-after-teens-death.cnn”> on Monday morning, adding that Sunday night's chaos was ""not constructive"" and was only ""bringing down the community.""

St. Louis County Police said 32 people were arrested and shots were fired at police.

Monday, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said charges had been filed against about 10 people in connection with burglaries of several businesses.

""What occurred last night, the mob action, we know certainly is not representative of what's going on and what the people in the neighborhood necessarily think,"" he said.

Flanked by several from the community Sunday, McSpadden was {McSpadden was emotional as she shouted}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2014/08/10/dnt-misouri-teen-shooting-protests.kmov”> into a television reporter's microphone.

""You took my son away from me! You know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many!"" she said. ""Because you bring them down to this type of level where they feel they don't got nothing to live for anyway! (They feel) they gonna try to take me out anyway!""

Others who gathered shouted at police.

""We will stay out here as long as you are!"" they screamed at officers.

Many of the officers appeared stoic, watching young men kneel before them and raise their hands up to symbolize surrender, but one officer can be heard on video yelling back, calling protesters ""animals.""

Some in Ferguson are demanding that the name of the officer who shot the teenager be released.

Monday afternoon, Jackson -- the police chief -- said he plans to release the name in the next 24 hours. Authorities want to make sure the officer is in a safe location, he said.

#Iftheygunnedmedown: Twitter Users Say Victim Portrayals Often Unfair

Shortly after the shooting, images of Brown lying in a pool of blood began to circulate on Twitter. Users pleaded with each other to stop sharing negative images and instead use photos that showed Brown for the ""gentle giant that he was.""

The hashtag #iftheygunnedmedown soon surfaced with users asking each other which photo the media might use to tell their story if police shot them.

'Lost control'
""Last night, everything lost control,"" Knowles said Monday.

He was asked about the officer who called protesters ""animals.""

""The officers did their best. They're only human,"" Knowles responded, adding that not every police officer present was from the Ferguson department.

Sunday's gathering became more intense as some people broke windows at a store and began taking things from it. They threw rocks and bottles. Gunshots rang out.

Antonio French, an alderman in St. Louis, said a QuikTrip gas station was looted and an ATM dragged out.

""This QuikTrip is where things started (Saturday) with this case, based on various accounts,"" French said.

The slain teenager and a friend were ""accused of stealing gum from the store or some sort of cigarettes,"" the alderman said.

""People have a lot of anger and are frustrated,"" French said. ""They don't have recourse in the system, and it happens often in this country, and it has boiled over. I think people are angry and looking for a reason to let it out tonight.""

Knowles said he wants to let the independent investigation into Brown's death take its course. He plans to meet with Brown's parents soon and will meet with clergy in Ferguson and African-American leadership in the town.

Whatever the investigation's findings, ""we will deal with that,"" he said.

Multiple gunshots

An autopsy will determine how many times Brown was shot. The medical examiner for St. Louis County, Mary Case, said Monday afternoon the autopsy is complete, but she would not give details and said St. Louis County police will release the information.

Toxicology results on Brown's body are pending.

On the number of times Brown might have been shot, Belmar has said, ""It was more than just a couple.""

""We don't know what happened, and there are lots of conflicting stories,"" Knowles said. ""Unfortunately, there will have to be some time taken to understand what happened. Hopefully, we will get to an understanding, and justice will be served.""

The officer who shot Brown is on paid administrative leave during the investigation and will be available to talk to county homicide detectives.

He has been with the force for six years and will be required to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty, Belmar said.

Crump, who also handled the case of Trayvon Martin in Florida, said Monday that Brown's family is ""devastated"" and doesn't believe that the teenager got into a physical confrontation with police.

Martin, 17, was killed in 2012 by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted last year of murder charges.

The high-profile case sparked a heated nationwide discussion of race as well as debate over Florida's ""stand your ground"" law.

Monday, Crump said Brown's shooting once again highlights ""the senseless death of a young boy of color at the hands of people who are supposed to protect and serve them.""

""Their son was doing all the right things,"" Crump said. ""Graduating from high school, never been in trouble. And for this to happen, for him to be killed in broad daylight ... they want answers just like everybody else in the community.""",NA,NA,NA,"Interesting how some tweets are highly retweeted and favorited, but other with the hashtag mentioned have very little activity.

And I'm tired of thinking that each time one walks by.

I don't begrudge anyone who has the luxury of not knowing what that kind of siege feels like. I just hope they have the decency not to characterize the socioeconomic disparity along racial lines as a card to be played but rather recognize it as a looming element of our cultural fiber.

Last month, Eric Garner, another unarmed black man, died from an illegal police chokehold during an encounter on Staten Island, New York.

Nearly 20 years ago, my son Anthony Baez also died in an illegal police chokehold. Anthony was playing football in the street with his brother when their ball accidentally hit a police car. Instead of addressing real public safety issues, a New York police officer chose to harass my sons brutally.

These cases and many more reveal our country's systemic criminalization and devaluing of black and brown lives.

The list is long.

The investigation is still pending.

These are just some of the dozens of police killings of unarmed Americans by law enforcement over the last decades. These tragedies and injustices happen year after year, and people of color -- primarily black and Latino -- are usually the victims.

Sadly, our communities in New York and elsewhere are almost conditioned to expect these incidents -- the loss of our children, siblings and spouses to excessive violence by those whose job it is to protect us.

New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton's recent comment {dismissing that race was a factor in Garner's death}<hyperlink=""http://www.thenation.com/article/surprise-nypd-commissioner-bratton-doesnt-think-race-had-anything-do-eric-garners-death/""> is a slap in the face to those of us who've lost our children, and it is part of the problem that allows such unjust killings to continue.

In addition to the pain families experience from losing their loved ones, we are also forced to endure additional injustices, when again and again government and the criminal justice system fail to hold officers accountable, and instead the victims are criminalized.

Similar to the response in Garner's case, the New York Police Department {attempted to blame my son for his death}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/nyregion/clash-over-a-football-ends-with-a-death-in-police-custody.html""> by saying that he and his brother resisted arrest.

But what were they under arrest for? Playing football in the street? Even if we hypothetically assumed the officers' allegations were true -- although they were not and a federal court found the officer guilty -- how does that justify killing someone?

With Bratton as police commissioner then and today, we see a similar response.

In many of these unjust killings, New York police detailed victims' past involvement with the criminal justice system to the media, as if that justified their lives being taken by the police. We've seen it with Garner, and we saw it with {Anthony Rosario, Hilton Vega,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/nyregion/07trial.html""> {Patrick Dorismond}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/22/nyregion/mayor-may-face-inquiry-in-dorismond-case.html""> and many others.

Also, district attorneys fail to convene a grand jury or secure a conviction. We must question the closeness of district attorneys to police departments, given their interdependence. In only a handful of these cases, including my son's, the federal government stepped in to provide some limited accountability.

In Michael Brown's killing, the FBI will conduct a parallel investigation to one already under way by the St. Louis County, Missouri, police. Like it did with my son, the FBI review will focus on possible civil rights violations in his killing. That is the only way my son got justice -- when the federal government found the police officer who killed my son violated his civil rights.

Where is the justice for families like those of Ramarley Graham? It's been two years since his death and a year since the Justice Department said it was reviewing the case but still nothing. The family doesn't even know whether the officer responsible for killing him in cold blood has been disciplined or still walks around with a gun and shield.

Those with a badge who unjustly kill and brutalize should be stripped of their badge, their gun, their job and their pension because they have violated the public trust.

A systemic lack of accountability and inadequate discipline allows these incidents to continue to happen.

And now, in the wake of Garner's death, Bratton and the New York Police Department are responding in the same way they always have -- pledges of more training.

It's not training that will prevent this from happening again.

We need accountability for all officers involved that sends a message that this type of brutality is unacceptable and the lives of people of color are equally valued. Systemic cultural and substantive policy changes in police departments -- particularly in New York -- are needed to ensure black and brown communities are not targeted with overly aggressive, {discriminatory ""broken windows policing""}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/summons-broken-windows-racial-disparity-garner-article-1.1890567""> and ""stop and frisk"" policies that promote brutality and violence. Officers should work to understand the communities they work in, not criminalize them.

Police-community relations can only start to improve when individual officers who abuse civilians' rights are held accountable with a zero-tolerance policy for police brutality.

Anything less is just rhetoric, and I fear that these unjust deaths will continue with more families and communities suffering the same pain.",NA,NA,NA,NA
CNN,cnn5,http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1161453,A White Man's Response to Ferguson,Shane Fast,08/12/2014,12/07/2015,"Although I grew up visiting the Atlantic Ocean, I recently traveled to the Gulf of Mexico with my family and recognized an interesting illustration of our society’s view of racism. There is a striking difference between these two bodies of water: clarity. The Atlantic is darker and you can’t see your feet once you’re 12 inches in the water. The Gulf, however, is clear and provides a great view of the ocean floor, even at depth.

While there we heard a common phrase: “I see a sting ray! Be careful, move toward the beach!” My wife and I had different reactions to this. I laughed. She, as a loving mother should, took it more seriously. I explained my reaction: “Kristin, there are also many sting rays in the Atlantic. In fact, we’ve caught them surf fishing, near the shore. It’s a reality that they’re present, but you can’t see them, so you don’t think about them.”

In recent interviews with a writer interested in publishing a story about Rebirth: East St. Louis and the local high school football team, one theme has come up almost each time: my passion for racial reconciliation, and my willingness to confront my own racial biases. One question asked of me was, “Were you nervous to say before a church congregation ({in a message posted on You Tube}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KESUb9huTfQ&feature=youtu.be"">)—that you’re not immune to racial biases and prejudices?”

It was a great question, and extremely valid. Taken out of context, that statement could ruin me, negate over 6 years of efforts in East St. Louis, and potentially end Rebirth.

But there is a reality I cannot avoid: I’m a broken person living in a broken world. Things aren’t what they’re supposed to be and I’m a part of it. Political and economic systems, family structures, and individual self-concepts are all broken, and this brokenness is not without its repercussions.

So, what was my answer? In every corner of our world, racism is present. Perhaps that sounds bold, but if racism is the presence of prejudice and biases—even those fleeting, reactive, racially rooted thoughts all of us have had—then it would be hard to contend that any man has lived his entire life free from any form of racism. It might not be on the surface, but it’s there. In mindsets passed down from generation to generation, in experiences that form a worldview, and in countless other ways, racism is present, and as humans we cannot be unaffected by the culture we live in. It rubs off on us, and in our most honest and transparent moments, we can dig deep into the ways our hearts are tragically wicked.

What’s more, I told the writer, much racism is still present within our society, but it’s more disguised than it has been historically. It’s there, but often you can’t see it, so you don’t think about it.

And by “you”, I generally mean people of the majority culture. The majority culture rarely experiences racism, since it’s driving and dictating the culture. In our nation, the dominant culture is Anglo, or white.

If you’re white (as I am), or you’re of a minority who has largely assimilated into the dominant culture, you understand most of how our society operates. Yes, within the dominant culture there are various subcultures. But, generally speaking, if you’re a part of the majority, you know how to interact in most of the situations you’ll face in your educational and career pursuits.

And because you’re in the dominant culture, doors open for you that you don’t even realize. Many of us reject this idea of white privilege, but it does exist, I promise you. And often those of us who benefit from it don’t even know it exists until someone calls it out.

Now, don’t hear that and think, “Is he saying I’m racist because I’m white?” No! I am certainly not. But there has been error in the majority culture, especially historically, and because humans are still not without fault, errors will continue to be made, but I’m not pointing a finger at anyone in particular.

What I do want to point out, however, is that, unfortunately for the majority of us, it takes an event like this—a teenager’s tragic death, a community’s passionate response, and a nation’s eyes on a suburb of St. Louis called Ferguson—to expose the reality of our world: Racism is not a dead issue.

As I’ve written before ({http://rebirthesl.org/2014/03/04/racial-reconciliation-not-simply-apologizing/),}<hyperlink=""http://rebirthesl.org/2014/03/04/racial-reconciliation-not-simply-apologizing/""> I have great concern that much of our nation views racism as a thing of the past. We frame it in disturbingly realistic movies such as “12 Years a Slave” or “Crash”, we acknowledge its wickedness, and we tragically praise ourselves that we don’t take part in such racism.

And then we marvel that the events taking place in Ferguson are still possible. Sadly, it takes a tragic death, protests, and a riot to force us to confront the reality that racial tensions are alive and well.

I mourn, reaching my capacity for news coverage. I’ve seen firsthand the anguish of mothers whose sons were killed in their teenage years, and I sympathize with the mother of Michael Brown as she voices her pain and the struggles of raising her son to complete high school and pursue college.

But I also want to scream, “Wake up people, why is this so surprising?! We live in one of the most racially divided and charged areas in our nation!” If you don’t believe me, just look at this demographic map of our region (Green dots represent Black residents; Blue dots represent White residents).

The St. Louis Metro area is indeed racially divided, as if there are boundary lines segregating communities. It’s almost surreal, and it will continue to have devastating consequences until residents pursue an alternative: reconciliation.

I love talking about racial reconciliation. Unfortunately, it’s an uncommon concept, although it lies at the core of our God-designed humanity. And until men, women, and children realize that we are made in the image of God, and that all human beings— from every tribe, language, people, and nation—share this same dignity and design, then division will reign, and unity will be tragically absent.

By definition, reconciliation includes “the restoration of friendly relations.” Thus, there is an intentional pursuit of a future where men, women, and children of various races and cultures are in genuine relationship with one another. And their interactions take place in non-obligatory settings and at spontaneous times, just as one would do with a longtime friend.

It’s not easy to cross racial and cultural lines in this way. If someone says it is, they’re lying to themselves and to you. There are countless obstacles, many of which have existed for generations. But there is hope, and there is an unmistakable beauty that’s visible when I and a brother or sister of another color or culture recognizes our own brokenness and the baggage we carry and, rather than burning bridges, we choose to enter into a redemptive friendship.

Racism isn’t something to be dismissed and swept under the rug. It’s something to be brought into the light and be healed by God himself. Jesus died to unite men to God and men to one another (Ephesians 3:14-16). For the sake of our true humanity, may we all be willing to be exposed. This is my hope for myself, my family, and our world.",77,1000,NA,"For the # of social media, it just says the # of shares, and that is literally rounded to “1K” → datachecker did not recognize 1K as a number so Yeji changed it into 1000"

Releasing the name of the officer who shot and killed the teen in Ferguson, Missouri, isn't as important, they say, as protecting the community and the person who pulled the trigger.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN his department decided against releasing the officer's name Monday after social media and phone threats targeted another officer who was falsely named as the shooter.

""We started getting death threats against him and his family, and although that's not most of the people, we took these things seriously,"" Jackson said. ""We think that they're credible threats ... Right now the safety factor far outweighs the benefit from releasing the name, which is minimal.""

Lawyers representing Brown's family blasted the decision, suggesting authorities were protecting one of their own rather than following standard procedures.

""That doesn't give the community confidence. That doesn't make it transparent,"" attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters. ""And remember, we've got a long way to go before this community starts to believe that the police are going to give them all the answers and not try to sweep it under the rug.""

Police should have released the officer's name 72 hours after the shooting, he said. If police are going to ask residents of Ferguson to obey the law, he said, ""then it's got to work both ways.""

Jackson said his office doesn't know yet when it will release the name, but it isn't skirting any laws.

""The prosecuting attorney and the St. Louis County police chief agree that this is the prudent step to take under the circumstances,"" he said.

Witness: I haven't spoken with police

Exactly what led up to Brown's death Saturday is a point of major contention.

Witnesses say the African-American teen was unarmed and his hands were in the air demonstrating that. Police have said that Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun.

As federal civil rights investigators and the FBI carry out their own inquiry into the controversial case, tensions are running high in the town of 21,000 -- }where there's a history of distrust between the predominately black community and the largely white police force}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/12/us/5-things-ferguson-missouri/index.html"">.

Dorian Johnson, who said he saw the shooting, told CNN Tuesday that the officer who opened fire is white.

Johnson said he was walking with Brown in the street when the confrontation erupted.

But police didn't speak to him about the shooting that day -- and still haven't, Johnson said, adding that the officer seemed stunned afterward.

""It's almost like he wasn't paying attention to me anymore. It's like he was in shock himself, and his vision wasn't on anything but my friend Big Mike,"" he said.

Johnson's attorney told CNN that police reached out to him on Tuesday to set up an interview, but they haven't had a chance to talk yet.

Amid protests, calls for calm

The promise of investigations by local and federal authorities hasn't stemmed outrage in the community.

A vigil for the teen devolved into violent clashes with police Sunday as some looted stores. On Monday night, there was chaos again on the streets. Shots were fired, authorities said, and police used tear gas to disperse a crowd.

At a press conference with other African-American leaders Tuesday, the Rev. Al Sharpton urged people in Ferguson not to ""betray the gentle giant"" that Brown was by allowing their anger over his killing to lead to violence.

""Don't be a traitor to Michael Brown in the name of 'you mad,' "" Sharpton said, reminding the crowd that {Brown's parents are planning a funeral for their son}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/justice/michael-brown-missouri-teen-shot/index.html"">, whom they had expected to head to college this week.

Michael Brown Sr., the teen's father, renewed calls for people to steer clear of violence.

""I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way, so we can get something done about this,"" he said.

U.S. President Barack Obama echoed calls for calm, releasing a statement expressing condolences to the teen's family and describing his death as heartbreaking.

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions. But as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" Obama said. ""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.""

""We feel like we can do anything and go anywhere. ... Just because my son is a 6'4"" black male walking down a city street does not mean he fit the profile for anything other than just walking down the street.""

About 63% of Ferguson's residents over age 16 are African-American. Three of the police department's 53 officers -- just over 5% -- are African-American, Jackson said, adding that he's pushed to improve diversity.

Racial profiling is ""strictly forbidden,"" he said.

""Racial profiling is against our policies,"" he said. ""It actually benefits nothing.""

Speaking at a community forum scheduled in the aftermath of the shooting, Jackson said the situation ""has been a tragedy for the city and the country.""

The President condemned all parties involved in the recent unrest.

“There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting, nor is there an excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protestors,” Obama said in his first on-camera statement since Brown was killed on Saturday.

“Now’s the time for healing, now’s the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,” Obama said continued.

A White House official said the President and his advisers have been monitoring the situation since Monday and Obama chose to speak out Thursday on the issue because the ""situation seemed to be not getting better."" As of now, there are no plans for the President to cut short his vacation at Martha's Vineyard, according to the official.

Obama's comments mark a less personal tone than his response to the shooting death of Trayvon Martin two years ago. Speaking in the Rose Garden in March 2012, Obama said “if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.”

The comments were striking to many at the time–seen as a candid moment from a president known for his measured responses. Many comparisons have been drawn between the shooting of Brown and the shooting of Martin, both unarmed, African-American teenagers.

With a few exceptions, Obama has typically been reluctant to wade into racial issues.

In 2009 he got some backlash after he criticized the arrest of African-American Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates, who was arrested outside of his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Obama said that the local police “acted stupidly.”

The remarks led to a fury of controversy, culminating in a beer summit at the White House between Gates and the arresting officer James Crowley.

Several politicians addressed the situation in Ferguson on Thursday, including Rand Paul, who penned an {op-ed for TIME}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/"">, “We Must Demilitarize the Police.”",24,NA,NA,NA
CNN,cnn8,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/13/opinion/omara-michael-brown-police-shooting-racial-injustice/,Poisoned relationship between police and minorities,Mark O'Mara,08/13/2014,12/07/2015,"I recently met a woman, the mother of three black teenagers. She told me that after the Trayvon Martin shooting, she forbade her boys to wear hoodies. She warned them never to walk around with their hands in their pockets. She was terrified that someone would find her boys acting suspiciously and one of them would end up being killed.

This is one hell of a thing to be afraid of. I don't think parents of white kids ever really feel this terror -- not in this way.

I defended the man who shot Trayvon Martin, and I believe that the verdict the jury returned was correct and just. But based on my experience defending young black men in the criminal justice system for 30 years, I know her fears are not without foundation. The shooting of Michael Brown -- an unarmed 18-year-old African-American in Ferguson, Missouri -- reinforces her fears, and it gives me a dull, empty feeling in my gut.

We're hearing conflicting stories about how the Brown shooting happened. Some witnesses say the teenager had his hands up in surrender when an officer opened fire on him. The Ferguson police chief says the officer was attacked in his cruiser, and the first shot was fired inside the car. It's possible both accounts are true, but we don't know.

Here's what we do know: A police officer and a black man interacted, multiple shots were fired, and Michael Brown was 35 feet away from the police car when struck by the shots that killed him. Soon we should know how many times the officer shot Brown, from how far and from what direction. These factors will be critically important in determining whether the shooting was justified or not. Black or white, an officer must be in fear of imminent death or great bodily harm before using deadly force, just like the rest of us.

{What we know about Michael Brown's shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html"">

If Brown was shot from far away, or if he was shot in the back, it would provide strong evidence that he was retreating -- that the officer was not in imminent fear -- and that the shooting was not justified. What we must acknowledge is that we don't yet know enough to be convinced one way or the other.

Now there are cries of ""no justice, no peace"" as evening vigils turn violent, with rioting and looting. ""Justice,"" it seems in this context, can only be found if the officer is convicted of murder. If facts show the shooting to be justifiable, it will not be seen as justice by those making the demands.

Whether my client is black, white, Latino or something else, here is how I want justice defined: Two sides, well-represented, present their cases in an adversarial system; the law is followed and a just result is inevitable. Brown's case will have the added benefit that it will be tried in the ever-watchful view of intense public scrutiny.

{Citing death threats, police won't identify officer in Michael Brown shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/13/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html"">

For many in the black community the reality of the criminal justice system doesn't measure up to the ideal. Many believe that the criminal justice system, from first police interaction to verdict, is infected with a racial bias that taints the possibility of justice as it should be defined. I have long argued in court that such a bias exists; that probable cause didn't exist for this car stop; that hanging on a street corner or sitting on a stoop is not loitering; that ""attitude"" is not resisting without violence.

While the bias does exist, it's not simply a black and white issue. It's rare to find an overtly racist cop, or an overtly racist judge. The bias is nuanced; it's woven into the system, and it builds with each interaction with the system until, at last, it results in unequal justice.

Consider the very first interactions: A cop and young black male interact on the street, and both give the other a bit of attitude. The officer gives some attitude because he's tired of getting attitude from other young men, and the young man gives some attitude because he's tired of getting attitude from other cops. Now, who's at fault?

This, as simple as it sounds, is how it starts. Once the infection begins, it grows quickly. If you want to say the cop's at fault because he's the adult with training, you are right. And if you want to say the young man is at fault for disrespect or mistrust of a cop's authority, you are right.

{Missouri teen shot by police was two days away from starting college}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/justice/michael-brown-missouri-teen-shot/index.html"">

If both sides refuse to move toward the middle, we will all just keep going down this path, and another black family will plan another funeral. Or we can agree that we, each of us, will be better off accepting responsibility for an infection that we cannot defeat individually.

Who makes the first step? The police must. Many police agencies have community outreach programs that are successful. Police officers are in the position of authority, and they have the power to send a message that when they serve a community, they serve all the people of the community equally, regardless of race. To break this cycle, police must recognize there is bias in the system, and they make an effort to treat the people they serve with respect.

In return, we must recognize the risks law enforcement officers take to protect our communities. We must respect their authority. And we must understand the grave reality that the way we engage a police officer can affect whether we walk away, whether we are driven away in handcuffs, or whether we are taken away on a stretcher. This is true for people of every race, from every community -- and unfortunately, with the current bias, it may more true for some of us than for others.

For those who say that talking about this now is an insensitive way to blame Michael Brown for his own death, nothing could be further from the truth. No matter what turns out to have happened that Saturday afternoon, Brown was killed by the infection, by this insidious cycle. Let's see what we can accomplish if we focus on breaking that cycle.",NA,NA,NA,NA

And he was proud to be setting an example for his younger siblings.

He hoped to become a heating and cooling engineer, working on air conditioning, attorney Benjamin Crump, who's representing the teen's family, told reporters.

""Everyone else wanted to be a football player, a basketball player,"" friend Gerard Fuller told the Post-Dispatch. ""He wanted to own his own business. He'd say, 'Let's make something out of nothing.'""

Just a credit shy of graduating high school in May, he earned his diploma on August 1.

""He said he wasn't going to end up like some people on the streets. He was going to get an education,"" Hershel Johnson, a friend of Brown's, told the Post-Dispatch. ""He was going to make his life a whole lot better.""

On Facebook, Brown said he liked the St. Louis Rams, Kanye West's music and comedies including ""House Party"" and ""Scary Movie II.""

Now a message from a friend posted on Facebook describes Brown as a someone who ""was always there for anybody he knew.""

In a Facebook message to a friend last week, Brown wrote: ""If I leave this earth today, at least you'll know I care about others more than I cared about my damn self.""

Brown had been spending the summer with his grandmother, Desuirea Harris.

For every cool-headed account from a reporter, there's been an impassioned Facebook post or Instagram photo from a community member that illustrates, I think, strengths and weaknesses of both traditional and social media.

These days we need both.

After all, it's one thing to hear a news anchor say that police fired nonlethal rounds to disperse protesters on Monday night; it's another to see photos of the pepper balls and wooden pellets and the bloody injuries they caused.

Jon Swaine, a Guardian reporter on assignment in Ferguson, wrote on Twitter that a St. Louis police spokesperson claimed on Monday night ""he didn't know what I was talking about when told protesters claimed they were shot with wooden pellets."" On Tuesday morning, Swaine held some of the pellets in his hand and said they matched protesters' descriptions. The police subsequently confirmed the pellets were fired.

Peinado, the local educator who posted the photo I mentioned earlier, wrote on Twitter that she was ""devastated"" by the use of ""tanks, tear gas, rubber bullets, hand launchers, and sheer intimidation of county police.""

Peinado's photo of the two men holding cell phones was captioned, ""Men armed with nothing but phones ordered to get on their knees. I witnessed tear gas thrown at them.""

The same two men were also shown in a Vine video by Antonio French, a local alderman who was perhaps the most prolific citizen journalist during tense protests Sunday and Monday. French's six-second videos of tear gas in the streets of Ferguson were picked up by CNN and other news outlets -- giving audiences at home a raw, close-up view of the situation.

""For the most part, social media has helped bring home the impact of this death in the local Ferguson community in a way that traditional media probably could not have,"" said David Clinch, the executive editor of Storyful, a company that specializes in finding and verifying newsworthy material on the Web.

There have also been online attempts to hold traditional media outlets accountable. The best example of this is the Twitter hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown, which posed the rhetorical question, ""If they gunned me down, what photos would the media use to portray me and my life?""

{The hashtag was born after a photo of Brown circulated over the weekend.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/NBCNews/statuses/498526729728565250""> Some saw the teenager holding up a peace sign; others speculated that it was a gang sign.

Resentment and disappointment about media portrayals of African-Americans was evident in the commentary about the use of the photo.

Yesha Callahan, a writer for The Root, wrote that Brown's death ""has once again shown that the narrative the media paints surrounding black people in America more often than not includes depicting us as violent thugs with gang and drug affiliations.""

On Twitter, contributors to {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/IfTheyGunnedMeDown?src=hash""> shared pairs of photos -- one stereotypical or unsavory, another showing the same person on graduation day or surrounded by family.

The same site, however, was also a tool for inflammatory rumor-mongering. Monday night, for instance, some Twitter users shared false claims that another citizen had been shot by police.

And, according to local reports, social media erroneously identified a police officer as the one who shot Brown.
""It is very important to be careful in stories like this, when emotions are running high, to make sure that information and content is verified,"" said Clinch, who formerly worked at CNN.

Clinch said he has spotted instances of people sharing images and saying they were from Ferguson, when in fact they were from years-old protests in other states.

But the photo was originally shared on Facebook with a small group of friends -- it went viral with the help of local reporters and television stations. {Some of the volunteers were subsequently interviewed by a local newspaper, the Riverfront Times,}<hyperlink=""http://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2014/08/12/volunteers-clean-up-at-ferguson-quiktrip-get-yelled-at-for-helping-the-white-man""> widely amplifying their act and the message therein.

Witnesses said the teen was unarmed; police say that he had tried to get an officer's gun.

Outrage quickly followed the shooting as many in the town charged that the killing was racially motivated. The teenager was black. The officer has not yet been identified publicly.

Turmoil has broken out, dozens have marched in the street and tensions are high.

As the {story continues to develop}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/12/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t2"">, here's a quick look at its backdrop -- Ferguson, a suburb in the shadow of St. Louis:

1. Are racial tensions getting worse?

Antonio French is a St. Louis alderman who lives near Ferguson. He told CNN on Monday that racial tensions in the suburb aren't unique to Ferguson but part of a larger and wider frustration that has been worsening over time in the area -- a notion that a {Washington Post article explores.}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/08/12/why-the-police-shooting-riots-in-ferguson-mo-had-little-to-do-with-ferguson/"">

""What's happening in Ferguson isn't different from a lot of municipalities out here in St. Louis County ... small municipalities that have large African-American population and very few black police officers,"" French said, adding that there is a disconnect between the people and those who police them.

""Tensions have been rising for years and years,"" he said.

Ferguson is a predominately black community with a mostly white police force. Only three of the city's 53 officers are African-American.

It's a statistic Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson says he's working to improve. He told CNN that racial profiling is ""strictly forbidden.""

""We actually have mandatory racial profiling training that we have to take to be certified,"" he said. ""Racial profiling is against our policies. It actually benefits nothing.""

2. Who lives in Ferguson?

According to the most recent census, 67% of Ferguson's community is black; 29% is white; there is less than 1% Asian and Native American. A little more than 1% of the population is Hispanic or Latino. Its residents are mostly young; the average age is 31. Median household income is about $37,000. Twenty two percent of people in Ferguson live below the poverty line.

3. Where is it?

About 10 miles north of downtown St. Louis, Ferguson is one of many cities that comprise St. Louis County. The first thing you see when you click on the {Ferguson city website}<hyperlink=""http://www.fergusoncity.com/""> is a community family fun fair happening this weekend in the St. Louis suburb of 22,400 and a video that promises to describe the town. Bluesy, folksy music plays while a camera pans down well-trimmed streets dotted with large homes.

4. What do its leaders say?

""Everyone knows everyone. Everyone feels like they're comfortable no matter who they are,"" Councilman Dwayne James says in the video.

Mayor James Knowles describes the businesses that are flourishing -- new lofts, a farmer's market, a brew-and-coffee house. He hopes they will help bring people to the city and encourage them to stay, including the younger crowd from nearby University of Missouri-St. Louis.

""The whole city is kind of like the bar in 'Cheers.' You know, it's the place where everybody knows your name,"" Knowles says.

5. What's the city's history?

William B. Ferguson founded the city in 1894 as a station for a railroad. Ferguson is proud of its history.

""Historic preservation is a big part of what we do in Ferguson because it's one of those resources that cannot be replicated. You can always rebuild a house but you cannot rebuild the integrity and the history that is in some of our historic homes and some of our historic buildings. And so maintaining that's always been a big part of Ferguson,"" the mayor says in the video.",NA,NA,NA,NA
CNN,cnn12,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/13/us/missouri-teen-shooting/,Tear gas fills Ferguson's streets again,Catherine E. Shoichet; Ben Brumfield; Tristan Smith,08/13/2014,01/08/2016,"A new witness in the police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, told CNN that Brown and the police officer tussled at the police car window, then the officer shot the teen multiple times, as Brown backed away.

""What I saw was when Michael and the cop were wrestling through the window,"" Tiffany Mitchell told CNN's Don Lemon. A shot was fired while Brown was out the window. He got free, and the officer got out of the vehicle, followed Brown and shot him, she said.

He raised his hands, and the officer kept firing, she said.

Police fired tear gas at a crowd of protesters late Wednesday for another night, as the group gathered to protest Brown's deadly shooting.

Officers in riot gear then marched toward the protesters near a burned out gas station, which has become the gathering point for demonstrations.

Police announced that they no longer considered the protest peaceful, before they fired the canisters, CNN producer Yon Pomrenze said. People fled in all directions, as the stinging clouds wafted by them.

A separate small group of over a dozen people gathered outside Ferguson's police station holding up signs and chanting protests for a fifth day.

Officer not named

Police have said Brown died in a dangerous struggle after trying to grab the officer's weapon, but witnesses say it seemed a brazen act of aggression by the officer on Saturday, and that Brown was unarmed and not threatening.

On Wednesday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN that the officer had been hit and suffered swelling on the side of his face. He was taken to a hospital and released the same day, Jackson said.

Five days have passed since Brown's killing, and the public still does not know the name of the person who pulled the trigger.

There have been cries of a cover-up.

""That doesn't give the community confidence. That doesn't make it transparent,"" attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters. ""And remember, we've got a long way to go before this community starts to believe that the police are going to give them all the answers and not try to sweep it under the rug.""

Crump was one of the attorneys who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager who was killed in a 2012 altercation with Florida man George Zimmerman.

But Mayor James W. Knowles said police have received death threats against the officer and his family. They want to prevent further violence, he said.

Hackers have gone after his personal information and worked people up against members of government and the police, he said.

Trouble at night

Police have asked protesters to restrict their gatherings to daylight hours, after violence has broken out repeatedly after nightfall. Protests during the day have been peaceful.

Protests on Sunday and Monday ended with clashes with police and looting . Police have made 47 arrests after Brown's shooting, KMOV reported.

""We understand the anger; we understand that people want answers. We understand that we've got a problem, but we're just asking people to be peaceful,"" Jackson said.

The Ferguson-Florissant School District announced that it was pushing back the start of classes this year. School had been scheduled to resume Thursday.

Civil rights

Federal civil rights investigators and the FBI carry out their own inquiry into the controversial case. In the town of 21,000, {there's a history of distrust between the predominantly black community and the largely white police force.}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/12/us/5-things-ferguson-missouri/index.html"">

""Race relations is a top priority right now and, as I said, I'm working with the Department of Justice to improve that,"" Jackson told reporters Wednesday.

Only three of the city's 53 officers are African-American, and Jackson said he is working to change that.

Dorian Johnson, who said he saw the shooting, told CNN on Tuesday that the officer who opened fire is white.

In a press conference, Governor Jay Nixon announced that Ferguson County Police Department and the St. Louis County Police Department would no longer be in charge.

Anthony Gray, one of the attorneys for Michael Brown's family, is pleased with the decision.

""I think what the Governor is trying to do is find some solutions and think out of the box. I agree with him: a shift in approach and mentality is great,"" Gray told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""I do think this would allow us the space we need to perhaps make a change on the street.""

This comes as the Ferguson County Police Department still refuses to release the officer's name to the public - a public that includes Brown's family, which still doesn't know who pulled the trigger.

When asked directly if the family is satisfied with the investigation thus far, Gray emphasized ""not from the local authorities, I need to make that very clear.""  But a private meeting with Justice Department officials gave them some hope today.

""I think they have a sense of comfort that came from those discussions,"" Gray said. ""I think we all left somewhat way more comfortable than we came into the meeting.""

Gray also stressed that the family does not view the death of Michael Brown, and subsequent protests, as a simple ""black, white issue.""

Stunning images Wednesday night showed police officers in full riot gear using military grade-vehicles and firing tear gas canisters towards crowds.

“I sat and watched snipers from the top of armored cars train their sights on demonstrators,” Jamelle Bouie, a staff writer for Slate reporting from Ferguson, told CNN’s Hala Gorani, in for Christiane Amanpour.

“When that happens, when people see it happens, it agitates them – completely reasonably. I don’t think there’s anyone, really, who could experience that and not come away from it a little shaken.”

Michael Brown was just two days away from starting college when he was walking to his grandmother's house with a friend on Saturday. Witnesses say a police officer confronted the two, and after a short verbal dispute shot Brown multiple times, even as he had his hands in the air.

Police dispute that account, and say Brown assaulted the officer, whom they are not naming.

The town has since erupted with protest and increasing violence.

“For the last twenty years, Congress had a program that allows police departments – local and state – to purchase military-grade weaponry from the surplus,” Bouie said.

“What that means is that countless little small towns like Ferguson … have tanks, they have armored vehicles, they have mine-resistant vehicles, they have assault weapons, they have helicopters, they have sniper rifles – they have a whole host of equipment that is really more appropriate for warzones than it is for small-town policing.”

“It makes people less likely to listen, it makes people want to confront, and then it leads to situations where the police feel that they have to use tear gas and use rubber bullets, which is a completely disproportionate response to what was a very peaceful demonstration.”

Ferguson, population just 21,000, is nearly two-thirds black. But you wouldn't know it from the town’s leadership. Its mayor and police chief are white, and of its 53 police officers just three are black.

Civil rights investigators at the Department of Justice are looking into the shooting of Brown, and even the president has been briefed on the matter.

“Places like St. Louis city and St. Louis County are very segregated,” Bouie said. “St. Louis is one of the most segregated areas in the country. And what segregation means in today’s America is that you have communities that are cut off from resources, cut off from jobs, cut off from opportunities, and then also are subject to an unbelievable amount of policing.”

“I’ve talked to quite a few young men here who say that on an average month they’re stopped five, six, seven, eight times by the police, which is just incredible when you think that most people in a year will never have any interaction, period, with the police.”

“One of the things that’s come across to me reporting here is that there are many people of color in Ferguson and St. Louis who don’t feel like they are stakeholders, who don’t feel like the police are here to protect them; rather, they feel that the police are here to protect others from them.”

“So I think first and foremost there needs to be representation; there needs to be a sense that everyone is in this together for anything to move forward.”",48,NA,NA,NA
CNN,cnn15,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teen-shooting-al-jazeera/,TV crew: Police shutdown in Ferguson was 'assault on freedom of press',Brian Stelter,08/14/2014,01/08/2016,"Did police in Ferguson, Missouri, deliberately fire tear gas and rubber bullets at a television news crew Wednesday night?

Photos and videos from the Al Jazeera America camera crew were widely shared in the wake of Wednesday's incident, which Al Jazeera called an ""egregious assault on freedom of the press that was clearly intended to have a chilling effect on our ability to cover this important story.""

The images showed a tear gas canister exploding close to the Al Jazeera correspondent Ash-har Quraishi, who tried to shield himself from the smoke.

Was it intentional? Quraishi's crew members seem to think so.

""We were clearly set up as press with a full live shot set-up,"" producer Marla Cichowski said in an e-mail, responding to questions from CNN. ""As soon as (the) first bullet hit the car, we screamed out loud, 'We are press,' 'This is the media.'""

Cichowski said there's no way to know who ordered police to shoot in their direction.

""But they shined a huge floodlight at us before firing, and I can only imagine they could see what they were shooting at.""

Sam Winslade, the videographer, said in another e-mail message that ""we were fired at from a police MRAP vehicle."" MRAP is shorthand for a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, something usually associated with war zones.

The crew left their equipment where it was, and moved on foot to what they thought was a safer location. ""We sought shelter between houses,"" Winslade said, and then they called 911 and Al Jazeera's New York assignment desk.

A little bit later, another MRAP vehicle approached the area where the crew was seeking shelter.

""We (a group of three) yelled out to the MRAP (that) we were press and we approached vehicle with hands visible,"" Winslade said. ""They opened the back of the vehicle and ordered us inside. Whilst the doors were open and we were outside -- I do recall seeing 'SWAT type' firearms pointed at us. We were helped aboard, and taken back to our vehicle.""

On the way back, Winslade added, they passed what he believes was the MRAP vehicle that shot at them on their way out of the area.

Heightening the confusion, the crew members did not know which police force fired the tear gas and rubber bullets, nor which police force picked them up and drove them back to their vehicle.

On Thursday morning, a representative of the St. Charles County Sheriff's Department told {The Wrap}<hyperlink=""http://www.thewrap.com/police-tear-gas-not-fired-at-al-jazeera-news-crew-intentionally-video/""> that its SWAT team did not fire the tear gas, but did pick up the crew later.

Ferguson Mayor Jay Knowles told CNN Thursday that the St. Louis County police have been ""in charge tactically since Sunday.""

Another camera crew nearby, from the local television station and CNN affiliate KSDK, recorded what happened to the Al Jazeera crew. By Thursday morning, its pictures were being broadcast on CNN and other networks. The {KSDK video}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/14/crews-hit-with-bean-bags-tear-gas/14042747/""> showed police officers placing Al Jazeera's lights and other equipment on the ground.

But something happened in between the tear-gassing and the police interference with the equipment, Winslade said: Local residents came over to the camera position and ""played with the camera on the tripod."" Nothing was damaged, but Winslade's account suggests that the police action might have been intended to deter residents from damaging the expensive equipment.

Al Jazeera America, an offshoot of the Qatar-based international news network that recently marked its one-year anniversary, said in a statement that ""thankfully all three crew members are physically fine.""

""We believe that this situation must be investigated along with those involving our colleagues at other media outlets,"" the network added.

At one point, a siren breaks through the murmurs and the shouts.

In front of them is a young black man, his body prone and alone on the pavement.

It's all in a video, captured Saturday and posted to Facebook a day later, that shows the tense, chilling scene on an otherwise placid summer day in Ferguson, Missouri.

It's broad daylight; the grass is green; the trees are in full bloom. One woman heard on the video recalls having been in the shower when she heard pops. Could it have been fireworks?

""Not this time of the day,"" says a male voice, apparently from the person who shot the video on a cell phone. ""There ain't no fireworks this early.""

Those lined up outside the yellow police tape waste no time discussing, often in expletive-laden terms, what happened. And the video dutifully records it all.

It's not clear who saw what or what exactly transpired. Regardless, a clear consensus emerges among those heard on the recording: The young man in the street -- later ID'd as Michael Brown, an 18-year-old days away from starting classes at a technical college -- was shot dead by a Ferguson police officer.

Authorities would later claim Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun. But in the minutes after the shooting, the irate crowd on the Ferguson street comes to a different consensus, summed up by the video's narrator: ""They just killed this (man) for no reason.""

As Brown's body lay prone -- for minutes with no one, not even a police officer, in the camera's sight -- onlookers quickly establish one key fact amongst themselves: He wasn't armed.

""There is nothing!"" a woman yells out on the video. ""Do you see a gun? Do you see a knife? Do you see anything that would have caused a threat to these (expletive) police officers?""

""They shot that boy because they wanted to shoot that boy.""

If the moments leading up to Brown's shooting were frenetic, the moments afterward -- at least right around his body -- are eerily calm as captured on the continuing video.

For minutes, there is nothing and no one around his body. Just a young man with a white shirt flat on the street, all alone.

A police officer walks by two minutes into the video, and a minute later a man in a black shirt -- who witnesses identify as a family member -- approaches. But he's quickly guided away by officers.

A short time later, a uniformed man -- perhaps a paramedic -- appears to check on Brown. Multiple officers eventually flank his body.

One particularly angry, loud woman cries out: ""Where's the ambulance? Why doesn't somebody help this man? Why isn't somebody helping him?""

To which a man responds, more quietly, to no one in particular: ""They know he's dead, because they are not even trying to get him up.""

Everything about Brown is plain to see.

Until 10 minutes in, when a police officer comes up to lay a small white sheet over his body.

Rand Paul said.

Writing Thursday in an {opinion piece in Time}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1"">, Paul noted that the wild scene of police in tactical gear apparently firing teargas and rubber pellets and pointing automatic weapons at people in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson resembled a “war more than a traditional police action.”

He said there “should be a difference between a police response and a military response.""

All of the details of what occurred are not yet clear. But multiple law enforcement agencies were dispatched to calm the situation prompted by the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, last Saturday.

Residents contend the shooting was unwarranted, and on Wednesday night, police said protesters threw firebombs and engaged in gunfire.

Paul said outrage over the shooting is “understandable,” but there is never an “excuse for rioting or looting.”

Weaving together his Democratic appeal with his libertarian-leaning values, Paul argued that the situation in Ferguson carries racial undertones and underscores a need for smaller government.

He has been actively courting African-Americans as he prepares the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign.

A large part of his outreach includes calling for criminal justice reform, with a focus on nonviolent crime and the war on drugs.

""Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them,"" he wrote in Time.

Moreover, he argued that police forces have become more militarized in recent years. His op-ed cites research that argues the federal government has had a role in the process by giving highly sophisticated equipment to local authorities.

""When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process ... we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands,"" he wrote.",38,NA,NA,NA

""I just reject race-based politics, identity politics,"" King said. ""We're all God's children. We all should be held to the same standards and the same level of behavior.""

Shoichet,08/15/2014,01/11/2016,"State troopers are taking over security in this St. Louis suburb after days of clashes between local police and protesters.

Gov. Jay Nixon said he decided to put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge of security because ""at this particular point, the attitudes weren't improving, and the blocks towards expression appeared to be a flashpoint.""

Lately, the community of Ferguson, which has been the scene of demonstrations and a strong police response in the wake of a weekend police shooting that left African-American teenager Michael Brown dead, has looked ""more like a war zone, and it's not acceptable,"" Nixon said.

Now, authorities -- who've faced accusations that they've used excessive force in response to demonstrations -- will be taking a different tack in an effort to calm tensions, officials said Thursday.

""We're all about making sure that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region, appropriately,"" Nixon said.

Chosen by the state's governor to head up the new security operation, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said he planned to meet with protesters Thursday.

""We are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we're in this together,"" he said.

As groups of protesters grew Thursday night, the demonstrations were calm.

Some said they were prepared for police aggression, despite what authorities have promised.

""Gas me, shoot me, I will stand my ground,"" one protester's sign said.

But Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who was arrested at a demonstration in Ferguson Wednesday, said he's already noticed the new tone.

""Really, it has been the police presence, the heavy-handed presence, which has escalated the situation and I think led to the violence each night. And so it's good to see this new approach,"" he said. ""Already there is a different attitude and a different interaction between the crowd and police, and I am very hopeful for a peaceful night.""

And protesters may be close to getting a response to one key demand.

On Friday, police in Ferguson plan to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, a source close to the investigation told CNN.

Police chief: City is a 'powder keg'

Earlier Thursday, Ferguson's police chief described the city as a ""powder keg.""

""The whole situation is not good at this point,"" Chief Thomas Jackson said a day after clashes in which police fired smoke bombs, tear gas and rubber pellets at protesters who he said had thrown firebombs at police and engaged in gunfire.

Jackson said police would talk about changing ""not only the tactics but also the appearance"" of law enforcement.

U.S. Justice Department officials have also offered to assist local authorities control crowds ""without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement Thursday. The offer has been accepted, he said.

Jackson said protesters also have to do their share by remaining peaceful.

""We need everybody to tone it down,"" he said.

Governor: 'This has clearly touched a nerve'

Ferguson has been the scene of protests since Saturday, when a police officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed. Police say he was trying to grab the officer's gun. Witnesses say the 18-year-old was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot.

And protests over the controversial case have extended beyond the St. Louis suburb. Demonstrators expressed solidarity with Brown and Ferguson's protesters at so-called ""day of rage"" protests across the country on Thursday.

Protesters are angry that police have not released the name of the officer involved in the shooting, and they worry that a cover-up is in effect. St. Louis County police and federal investigators are looking into Brown's death. No charges have been filed.

Although locals say race relations {have long been troubled}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/12/us/5-things-ferguson-missouri/index.html""> between the city's mostly African-American population and the mostly white police force, anger spilled out after Brown's death, resulting in protests, violence, looting and fires.

Brown's death and demonstrations over the case have resonated far beyond that city, Nixon said Thursday.

""These are deep and existing problems not only in Missouri but in America, and this has clearly touched a nerve,"" he said.

President Barack Obama spoke out on the situation Thursday, criticizing how some police responded.

""There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" he said. ""There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.""

Their comments came after a night in which heavily armed police and protesters clashed, two reporters were briefly detained and an Al Jazeera America camera crew complained that police shot tear gas at them.

After ordering protesters and reporters to turn off their cameras, police fired smoke bombs, tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters after some threw objects at them Wednesday, according to media accounts. CNN crews have not been ordered to turn off their cameras during the protests.

Twelve people were arrested -- {including the two reporters}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/13/justice/missouri-teen-shooting-journalists/index.html"">, Jackson said. Two officers were injured, including one whose ankle was broken when a brick was thrown at him.

Cousin: 'We're still looking for answers'

On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri filed a lawsuit seeking the release of the officer's name under the state's open records law.

It's unclear whether the suit will succeed. Missouri law provides a specific exemption barring the release of records that authorities conclude are ""likely to pose a clear and present danger"" to victims, witnesses or others.

Officials say police officers, and others in the administration and police force, have been subjected to death threats.

Neil Bruntrager, general counsel for the St. Louis police officer's association, said the name of the officer involved in the shooting should be withheld until an investigation is completed.

""The moment you put a police officer's name out there, that police officer becomes a target,"" he said.

On Thursday, the shadowy activist group Anonymous published the name of the officer it believes responsible for the shooting. Earlier, the group claimed to have hacked the city servers and obtained dispatch recordings and other information.

Jackson later said the group had the wrong officer. CNN is not reporting the name.

Brown's family members say they're frustrated with the lack of information from police.

The President has issued a call for calm in the wake of a weekend police shooting that left teenager Michael Brown dead.

Hopefully we will not see a repeat of the chaos of Wednesday night, when protesters clashed with police. At this point, we ought to be thinking about what the best outcome for the citizens of Ferguson and the family of Michael Brown will be.

Monday night I was at a reception for civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis where he spoke eloquently about the importance of voting. Anyone in the black community who says voting is a waste of time because ""they don't care about us"" should take a good, hard look at Ferguson, Missouri.

{Almost 68% of its citizens are black}<hyperlink=""http://censusviewer.com/city/MO/Ferguson""> and just under 30% are white. Five of six city council members are white, the mayor is white, the chief of police is white, and its police force has 50 whites and three blacks. (By the way, has anyone seen any black police officers in Ferguson?)

To me the miracle of Ferguson is that the citizens have had the courage to stand up to a power structure that generally does not include them. They are finding the resilience to fight against their oppression, as they appear to have been living in a police state for a very long time. A {Missouri Attorney General report on racial profiling last year}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf""> showed that there were 611 searches in Ferguson: 562 of blacks; 47 of whites; one of a Hispanic; and one of a Native American.

Although whites represent almost 30% of the population, they represent less than 10% of those stopped, according to the report. Many people may think those statistics don't look unusual because they genuinely believe blacks are more likely to commit crimes and should be stopped and searched more frequently. But consider that in instances where contraband was found, a higher percentage of whites (34%) who were stopped had contraband when compared with blacks (22%).

Against this backdrop, the citizen protest Wednesday night over Brown's death, in the face of a militarized response, was courageous. Why? Because the police in Ferguson are clearly out of control. They have tear-gassed and reportedly shot rubber bullets at demonstrators. They have arrested two reporters -- one of whom works for the Washington Post and was wearing his press credentials around his neck at the time, the other from the Huffington Post.

They have pointed high-powered rifles at unarmed citizens in front of cameras; they have refused to identify themselves when making arrests; and they have refused to identify or arrest the police officer who killed Michael Brown. The chief of police says he won't release the name because of fears for that officer's safety.

Now that he is in charge, perhaps Johnson will have confidence in his ability to not only guarantee the safety of the police officer, but also the safety of all the citizens of Ferguson. Witnesses say Michael Brown had his hands in the air when he was shot repeatedly by the police officer. The medical examiner's report will put any speculation to rest; Michael Brown's body will speak from the grave. But what will his legacy be for Ferguson, Missouri, and the nation?

Elected officials don't have to care about black citizens as long as they don't fear them at the ballot box. Every member of the city council who has sat by silently while citizens were treated like second-class citizens should be voted out of office; Michael Brown's death must result in one of the largest voter registration drives in the history of the state of Missouri. That would be a lasting legacy for such a senseless and untimely death.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Since then, King said he has sold as many as 50 guns a day, when he usually sells between five and 10.

He said customers are buying everything from shotguns to AR-15s, {concealable handguns}<hyperlink=""http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/02/news/companies/handgun-sales/?iid=EL"">, popular semiautomatic pistols like Glocks and Rugers, and firearms with high capacity magazines. He said he's also selling a {""boatload"" of ammunition}<hyperlink=""http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/12/news/companies/guns-ammo-shortage/?iid=EL"">.

King said customers told him they're depleting their savings and putting purchases on credit cards in their haste to buy firearms.

""They did not even have this in their thought process until the QuickTrip started burning down in their backyard,"" said King, referring to the convenience store that burned down after the Saturday night shooting of Brown.

Al Rothweiler, co-owner of Mid America Arms in St. Louis, said that sales at his gun store have jumped by 50% since the violence began.

""They're taking personal responsibility for their own well-being,"" said Rothweiler, referring to his customers. ""As much as I think we have a very good law enforcement community, they can't be everywhere for everybody.""

He says he's noticed a significant influx of new customers who have never bought guns before.

Rothweiler said that he doesn't so much fear the unrest, which is taking place 20 miles from his store, as much as he feels ""sadness and disappointment that our society is truly capable of doing such things.""

Despite the economic problems, Ferguson's housing stock is in relatively good shape. The vacancy rate is modest, in line with the rest of Missouri and far lower than many troubled inner cities.

There has been recent investment and renovation in the business district, with new restaurants, retail and other buildings developed in recent years, according to Rebecca Zoll, CEO of North County Inc., the regional economic development association.

""Ferguson's downtown area has actually become a model for redevelopment in older downtowns,"" she said.

""I think the entire community leadership is concerned. Our hearts are broken,"" Zoll added. ""But I think that once the community begins to heal, we have confidence that the customer base will return.""

Many Ferguson residents live in poverty -- about one in five, according to the most recent government estimates from two years ago. The median household income of $37,000 was about $10,000 less than Missouri as a whole.

African-Americans make up two-thirds of the population. And, on average, they're much worse off economically, with a 25% poverty rate that's more than twice that of whites. Their median income is only about 60% of their white counterparts.

The mayor, James Knowles, lives in a home he bought out of foreclosure and is renovating. But the foreclosure rate has plunged even faster than the rest of the nation since the worst of the housing crisis six years ago.

In 2008, the rate was about 1 in every 118 homes in Ferguson, according to {RealtyTrac}<hyperlink=""http://www.realtytrac.com/statsandtrends/foreclosuretrends/"">, which follows foreclosures. That was about four times the national rate. Today, one in every 1,283 homes is in foreclosure, close to the national average.

The dramatic minutes that followed showing a series of confrontations between the driver and officers were caught on a police dashboard video camera and made national news.

The motorist peels away and is stopped again. One of the officers involved is seen on tape firing at the vehicle when the motorist drives away again. The woman is now facing child abuse charges related to the incident, according to {CNN affiliate KRQE}<hyperlink=""http://krqe.com/2014/07/10/trial-date-set-for-woman-in-taos-van-shooting/"">. The state police officer who shot at the car resigned.

Dashboard cam videos like this one have often played a role in documenting interactions between law enforcement and citizens. When those interactions go terribly wrong, as was the case in the shooting death of Ferguson, Missouri, teenager Michael Brown, it seems logical to ask: Where is the video?

There is none, Ferguson's police chief said.

Thomas Jackson says his department has 18 patrol cars. This spring, the department purchased two dashboard cameras and two wearable body cameras, but the equipment hasn't been installed because the department doesn't have the money to cover that cost, he said.

A dashcam and installation runs about $3,000, he told CNN.

The August 9 shooting has sparked days of protests and violent confrontations between police and the community. The details of what happened between the officer and Brown wildly differ from witness accounts and police accounts, leaving many to wonder whether a dashboard camera could have shed light on what happened.

Technology that improves policing

Dashcams have been available widely since the 1980s, though the first attempt to put a camera in a police car occurred in the 1960s.

Mothers Against Drunk Driving's 1980s campaign against impaired driving drove home the need to have video documention of traffic stops. In the 1990s, increased crime related to drugs and more allegations of racial profiling prompted departments to install more dashcams.

But it was the 1991 police beating of African-American Rodney King in Los Angeles that spurred a national discussion about how vital a tool video can be in incidents involving authorities, said {David Harris}<hyperlink=""http://law.pitt.edu/people/full-time-faculty/david-a-harris"">, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied the use of cameras in policing.

A witness to King's beating shot the footage from his apartment window on his personal video camera. The tape was broadcast repeatedly on national television and played a pivotal role in the criminal trial of the officers involved. Their ultimate acquittal outraged many and sparked the L.A. riots.

The images of Rodney King being pummeled into the pavement also stirred debate -- not just among communities, but within police departments who wanted their own recording of their encounters.

Didn't that make sense in an age where it was becoming commonplace for citizens to videotape?

""Back in the day, police officers were initially resistant to using them,"" Harris said. ""They felt like they were being spied on, or that they weren't trusted to do their job. But after awhile, they realized it was the best possible tool to prevent someone from making a bogus claim against them. They realized that if they were doing their job, footage could back them up.""

{A 2005 International Association of Chiefs of Police report}<hyperlink=""http://www.theiacp.org/portals/0/pdfs/IACPIn-CarCameraReport.pdf""> found that cameras aided law enforcement -- improving officer safety, often backing up the officer's version of events, reducing department liability and conveying to the community a sense of transparency.

Some officers reported that they reviewed footage they recorded in order to critique themselves, the report says, and cameras cut down on the number of complaints a citizen made claiming mistreatment after the citizen was informed that there was footage of an incident.

In interviews and surveys of officers with 21 law enforcement agencies across the United States, the vast majority -- 86% -- said cameras did not affect the officers' discretion in handling situations and 89% said it had no effect on their decision to use force. In other words, when they felt that they needed to use force, the camera didn't make them hesitate.

By 2007, 61% of local police departments were using video cameras in patrol cars, up from 55% that were using them in 2003, said {the U.S. Department of Justice}<hyperlink=""http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd07.pdf"">, which has provided grants to help law enforcement buy recording equipment.

But dashcams have limitations, Harris said.

Most only capture what's happening in front of the car. Some don't pick up sound, so officers wear microphones that sync with the cameras, Harris said, and all it takes is a popped hood to obscure the view of a dashcam.

A turn toward body cameras

To address these shortfalls, body cameras are gaining popularity among law enforcement worldwide.

Perhaps the strongest argument for more mobile cameras is this: Everyone has a cellphone and citizens are going to shoot video. Shouldn't law enforcement acknowledge that reality and have their own visual account of an incident?

Officers in the United Kingdom were the first to experiment with body cameras, Harris said. They found that the cameras did more than simply record an encounter; they also had an interesting effect on people who were confronted by police.

""Some people who weren't behaving suddenly started behaving knowing that what they were doing was being filmed,"" Harris said.

Used with apps and other technology, the devices also allowed officers to record and maintain records in real time, which led to faster resolutions of cases.

But sticky questions have been raised.

There are concerns about privacy. Police are called after terrible things happen to people. Could recording expose victims? When do officers begin recording? Only during certain situations or in every situation? Could footage, depending on when the record button is pressed, present a false or misleading account of an encounter?

When does an officer announce that he is recording? Laws governing when and where people can be recorded vary from state to state. Would a person who knows they are being recorded by a police officer be less likely to tell an officer much needed information?

One department's experiment

There are no national guidelines on the use of dashcams or body cameras, said William A. Farrar, the police chief in Rialto, California, a city of about 100,000 in San Bernardino County.

Farrar, a 34-year law enforcement veteran, became intrigued by the use of body cameras in policing while he was on a sabbatical getting his graduate degree at University of Cambridge in England in late 2011.

When he returned full time to the department, he partnered with Barak Ariel, a fellow at the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge, and set out to do a yearlong study. Between February 2012 and February 2013, some of his officers would wear body cameras, purchased with grant funding.

Farrar wrote a policy based on input from his officers and guidance from the Los Angeles branch of the American Civil Liberties Union to assure that guidelines adhered to privacy laws.

""I truly believe that cameras had a positive impact as it relates to increased professionalism -- officers minding their P's and Q's -- and being more sympathetic to what was happening in the community,"" he said. ""At the same time, the cameras also got citizens who interacted with officers to calm down. It mitigated a lot of circumstances instead of escalating them.""

Use of force by Rialto police dropped 60% during the experiment year, Farrar said.

The long-term benefits of having cameras far outweighs the financial costs, Farrar said.

One of the best examples of that came the first week that the officers had body cameras. A call came into Rialto dispatch from a person describing a man who was in a car with a gun. Officers showed up and discovered a man sitting in his car. The man's voice sounded the same as the man who had placed the call, and records showed that later, Farrar said.

But that day, on the street, the man got out and raised his weapon toward an officer, the chief said. And the officer shot him.

""It was a classic suicide-by-cop,"" explained Farrar. ""He called us because he wanted that confrontation.""

If the man holding a weapon toward the officer wasn't caught on body camera, the situation might have been misconstrued because another person -- a witness filming from afar -- also captured the confrontation on video camera and sent it to local press.

On that second video, you can hear a voice saying that it appeared that an officer had, without cause, shot a man in the street.

""We had video that showed what really happened,"" said Farrar. ""It made all the difference.""

CNN asked Farrar for his thoughts about Ferguson's lack of police cameras.

He said he didn't want to criticize another police department.

Law enforcement has faced financial hardship in the past several years. ""Agencies have downsized and reduced staffing and budgets are tight,"" he said.

But, Farrar said, ""at some point every police chief should really ask themselves ... are we doing everything we can?""

Chief: No video of shooting

Chief Jackson has said there is no video of Michael Brown's shooting.

{The two versions of what happened on the afternoon of August 9}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html""> come from witnesses and police, and they are vastly different.

Witnesses say that Brown, 18, and 22-year-old friend Dorian Johnson were walking down a street and an officer drove by and shouted for Brown and Johnson to move to a sidewalk. Johnson has said that they told the officer that the friends were close to their destination and would move.

The officer, Johnson said, threw his squad car in reverse and had a confrontation with he and Brown, at one point opening his car door into them. The officer reached out of his squad car and attempted to choke Brown, Johnson said.

Johnson said that neither he nor Brown were armed. At some point the officer got out of the car and shot at them, Johnson said. The officer fired multiple times, he said, eventually killing Brown.

St. Louis County Police, a separate entity from Ferguson police, is conducting an independent investigation.

Earlier this week, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said that Brown reached into the officer's car and tried to get the officer's weapon. Brown was shot about 35 feet from the police vehicle, according to Belmar, who declined to give more details.

Two witnesses CNN interviewed Wednesday said Brown did not try to get the officer's weapon.

""It looked as if Michael was pushing off and the cop was trying to pull him in,"" said Tiffany Mitchell.

Piaget Crenshaw said that she shot cell phone video of the aftermath of the shooting. She said the officer and the teen appeared to be arm wrestling when a shot went off. The teen broke free, and the officer got out of his car to run after him. ""I saw the police chase him ... down the street and shoot him down,"" Crenshaw said.

No expectation of transparency

The FBI also has opened an inquiry into the shooting.

""Only when the FBI takes control of this investigation will there be any kind of transparency or hope for justice,"" said Antonio French, an alderman in St. Louis, on Wednesday to CNN. ""No one in the community has any expectation that there will be a clear truth of what happened. Could a camera have helped? I don't know. It might have been a start.""

Sixty-seven percent of Ferguson's residents are black. Of the police department's 53 officers, three are black.

""This is about not understanding or relating or being empathetic to the community the Ferguson police department are supposed to serve,"" French said.

Witness Dorian Johnson told CNN the officer was white. Ferguson police initially said it would release the name of the officer but backed away from that this week. Chief Jackson said that threats had been made on social media against another officer who was incorrectly identified as the shooter.

Ferguson has been akin to a ""war zone"" this week, said Gov. Jay Nixon.

A vigil for Brown and non-violent protests against police disintegrated into violence and looting Sunday night. One officer was caught on camera calling protesters ""animals."" There were marches through the town during the day, with people shouting, ""No justice...no peace!"" but by nightfall, violence erupted again.

On Wednesday night, officers were firing tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds. Much of the chaos has been filmed as a national news spotlight is firmly trained on Ferguson.

The night that French spoke to CNN he was arrested. He said police came through a part of Ferguson and began trying to disperse a crowd with smoke bombs. When that didn't work, police warned the crowd and then released tear gas, he told CNN.

French said that didn't work to break up the gathering, so he went to his car to try to drive away.

Police approached his vehicle and pulled him from his car and handcuffed him with zip ties, he said.

Lowery emphasized that he did not want his arrest to overshadow the ongoing protests in Ferguson or the treatment of the protesters. ""I want this to be about the community,"" he said. ""But this arrest is in some ways an anecdote of what's going on here.""

The arrests came amid an already-tense situation between journalists and the authorities in Ferguson, the site of last Saturday's police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old, Michael Brown.

There have been several reports of reporters and the camera crews being told to leave protest areas, but no reported arrests until Wednesday.

They've run roughshod over freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and the right to be {young and African-American}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html""> and presumed innocent.

There has been a vacuum of leadership at every scale of this story. The mayor has seemed {flat-footed.}<hyperlink=""http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2014/08/13/ferguson-mayor-the-african-american-community-has-something-against-law-enforcement-in-many-ways/""> The governor was too long silent, then finally issued a statement, saying he would visit Ferguson. The President has kept his distance since issuing a statement of his own.

Nowhere thus far has there been a political leader like {Robert Kennedy}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6mxL2cqxrA""> in Indianapolis after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., wading at once into the charged scene with physical courage and quiet moral authority -- sharing in grief, naming the tragedy, earning the trust needed to call for peace.

Fortunately -- if that's a word that may be used in this situation -- everyday Americans have been filling this void. Citizens in Ferguson and across Missouri have protested and organized marches and vigils. African-Americans unleashed a wave of commentary on social media, highlighting how swiftly stereotypes can indict and convict black men in the court of public opinion.

Then when journalists covering the story were {manhandled}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z1""> by the police and locked up for reporting the story, Twitter exploded and people across the country -- indeed, the world -- began to amplify their voices in a burgeoning, turbulent virtual square called #Ferguson.

Now libertarians who have long mistrusted the heavy hand of government find themselves in common cause with social-justice progressives who cannot believe that this is happening half a century after the Civil Rights Act became law.

What these citizens from the right, left and all points between are saying is simple: No one in the United States should get away with this kind of abuse of power.

We may disagree on taxes and health care and immigration. But we can agree that the most basic form of civic power -- the force necessary to protect a community -- must in a democracy be subject to the kind of accountability that is utterly missing in Ferguson.

To be sure, some perspective is important: There is still {so much unknown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html""> about the killing. A Twitter wave obliterates context and thrusts forward only the most sensational aspects of a story. And plenty of partisans on the left and right are taking Ferguson as a chance to bash the other side for its failed policies and ideologies.

But let's be very clear. What's happening in Ferguson is not just politics. It's not what historian Daniel Boorstin called a ""pseudo-event."" It's real. It's a spark of anger and alienation that emerged first from African-Americans who bear the petty humiliations and mortal dangers of second-class treatment. Now it's spreading.

In this age of contagion, when pent-up frustration and a desire to change social norms can cascade quickly into tea parties or Arab Springs or marriage equality movements, it's not easy to say where this spark will lead.

And as events unfold, we would do well to ask ourselves a basic question. It comes from the exam that immigrants take to become citizens of the United States, and it is surprising in its simple profundity:

""What is the rule of law?""

Alas, the killing of Michael Brown is awakening many to the meaning of that question -- and to the consequences of ignorance. The rule of law must mean, at the barest minimum, that the government tells us which of its agents has slayed an unarmed citizen. It must mean administering justice in a way that is credible, transparent and responsive to the people. It must also mean an end to the looting in Ferguson.

But it also should have meant that we never got to a scene like Ferguson.

So now it's time for each of us not to be spectators, merely watching the flames in the streets or the pundits on the screen, but to be citizens.

It's time to look around our own communities and consider just how we see and treat each other. How over-martialized and under-professionalized our own police forces may be. How little empathy exists among people of different races and social classes. How so many of our neighbors see ""the rule of law"" as a cruel, cynical joke.

And how we can change all that.

It began with the shooting death of Michael Brown by a local police officer. The shooting seemed questionable, but the feeling in the community was that the police could not conduct a real, impartial investigation. When the police department declined to identify the officer involved, protests began.

If a listener didn't know any better, he would think the description of events unfolding in Ferguson must surely be taking place in Iraq or Afghanistan—combat-armored shock troops shoot tear gas into crowds while snipers train high-powered rifles on groups of civilians from atop heavily armored MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) assault vehicles rolling through and blocking off city streets like tanks.

This is America, but it doesn't look like it anymore.

Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Missouri {tweeted}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/499740253633388546""> in the morning, ""Images & reports out of #Ferguson are frightening. Is this a war zone or a US city? Gov't escalates tensions w/military equipment & tactics.""

{Pictures}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/499690032601772032/photo/1""> and videos tweeted out of the ""war zone"" show what appear to be camouflaged units of soldiers occupying and subduing the outraged civilians of Ferguson—but these are not soldiers, they are police officers.

How could a small local police force act like an occupying military force?

Under what is called ""Program 1033,"" the Department of Defense has been doling out military surplus to police departments for use in causes like the domestic ""wars"" against drugs and terrorism. Billions of dollars of military arms and armament have been distributed to local police departments since the program started in the late 1990s.

This misguided policy leads to inevitable consequences like what we're witnessing in Ferguson. As early as 1999, the Cato Institute warned in a {briefing paper}<hyperlink=""http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/bp50.pdf"">, ""Warrior Cops: The Ominous Growth of Paramilitarism in American Police Departments"" that Program 1033 is a terrible idea.

First, dressing police officers as soldiers is dangerous because the mindset of a soldier is entirely inappropriate for a police officer. Soldiers fight a military enemy; police officers deal with citizens, who are protected by the Bill of Rights.

Second, dressing a cop as a soldier does not make him a soldier, it makes him a more dangerous cop. SWAT teams are not military special forces even if they try to act like them. Police officers simply do not have the training that military troops have, and giving them the arms, armament and attitude of being warriors is {simply dangerous}<hyperlink=""http://www.cato.org/blog/police-misconduct-worst-case-may"">.

Third, if cities really need a SWAT unit, that should be reserved for extraordinary situations beyond the capability of the ordinary patrolman, such as a hostage scenario. Such SWAT units should not be deployed for routine policing calls.

The escalation of conflict in Ferguson didn't have to occur. If the Pentagon hands local cops millions of dollars' worth of {hammers}<hyperlink=""http://www.policemisconduct.net/to-ease-concerns-police-painted-tank-different-color/"">, it should be no surprise when suddenly everything looks like a nail.

CNN,cnn28 ,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/opinion/syed-ferguson-racial-profiling-issue/,Obama needs to lead on racial profiling legislation,Nafees Syed,08/15/2014,01/12/2016," President Obama's remarks Thursday on the death of Michael Brown were an echo of his powerful 2013 speech on {Trayvon Martin's shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/05/us/trayvon-martin-shooting-fast-facts/index.html"">. Notably absent was any mention of race.

A year ago, the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's shooter sparked protests across the United States. Martin was 17 and armed with nothing more than a bag of Skittles candy. Protestors believed that Florida's self-defense law helped enable civilian George Zimmerman to racially profile Martin and justify shooting him in self-defense. Studies had found that whites who kill blacks are {more likely}<hyperlink=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/is-there-racial-bias-in-stand-your-ground-laws/""> to be found justified in ""stand your ground"" states like Florida.

Now, a police officer's fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an African-American, in Ferguson, Missouri has reignited the discussion about racial injustice in America. Brown was 18 and planned to start college this week. Witnesses {said}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/ferguson-michael-brown-shooting-5-things/""> he was shot multiple times when he refused to comply with an officer's order to ""get the f--- onto the sidewalk"" or ""get the f--- out of the street.""

Although the identity of the officer has not been released, a witness who was walking with Brown at the time told CNN that the officer is white. In a primarily black city, only three of Ferguson's police officers are African-American. Facebook and Twitter are abuzz with #iftheygunnedmedown, where young men and women pair a rebellious image of themselves next to a telegenic, shirt-and-tie one to highlight societal stereotypes of minorities.

In response to what has become another debate of national -- and racial -- proportion, President Obama advised on Tuesday: ""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds."" He alluded to the protests and looting in St. Louis. The looting was opportunistic, people taking advantage of a tragedy as a cover for criminal activity. And some of the unrest was a cry for help, desperate acts to get attention from a criminal justice system that has not adequately addressed problems of racial injustice in America.

But there is a major difference between the way the President addressed race in his Trayvon Martin speech and his Michael Brown remarks Thursday. It is representative of the growing disconnect between an administration that has promised to alleviate racial injustice, and a community in which there is a strong sense of disappointment.

After President Obama's lyrical speech on race during his 2008 presidential campaign, minorities and civil rights groups expected the election of a black president to be more than just symbolic. This hope was solidified in the president's selection of the first black U.S. attorney general in 2009.

While his first term reflected a lull in civil rights legislation, President Obama's 2013 speech on {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/05/us/trayvon-martin-shooting-fast-facts/index.html""> promised more. He emphasized the importance of racial profiling legislation, even though Zimmerman was a civilian and such legislation affects law enforcement. He indicated a new focus on such laws and described the one he had successfully passed as a state senator in Illinois. The President also suggested he would work on improving conditions for young black men to succeed and called for the examination of state and local laws like the Florida ""stand your ground"" laws.

However since then, not much has happened. The special nature of state police powers has made federal action difficult. About two dozen states have passed self-defense laws similar to the Florida one that may have {helped lead}<hyperlink=""http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/trayvon-martin/article1953286.html""> the jury to exonerate Zimmerman, but {not one state}<hyperlink=""http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/02/26/3332391/trayvon-martin-years/""> has repealed them.

Even on a federal level, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a Senate Judiciary hearing and Justice Department investigations have produced no solutions on such laws and the racial profiling that is inherent in their enforcement. The Justice Department considered filing a civil rights lawsuit against George Zimmerman, but did not. In addition, the administration has not made a strong effort to rally Congress around racial profiling legislation.

In the meantime, allegations of racially biased actions by police have flitted across headlines, such as the New York Police Department's ""stop and frisk"" policy and chokehold incidents that disproportionately affect blacks.

Social media and activism has brought underreported stories and photos to the forefront: for example, the case of Darren Rainey, a mentally ill Florida prisoner whose skin separated from his body when guards {locked him}<hyperlink=""http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Prison-Chief-to-Assess-Scalding-Shower-Death-266573281.html""> into a 180-degree shower, originally garnered only local media attention. Now the petition to the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate his death has over 160,000 signatures across the nation.

President Obama was right in encouraging talking and reflection, in criticizing Ferguson police for harassing peaceful protestors and journalists, and in involving the Missouri governor in crisis resolution. But he is speaking to an audience that wants more. The president should take proactive measures to address the Michael Brown case in particular, and racial injustice in general.

Unlike the Justice Department's previous investigation, news of which came and went with the news of the Trayvon Martin protests, the FBI and Justice Department's investigation into Brown's death needs to be thorough, transparent and broadcast to the public.

Most importantly, the administration should make racial profiling legislation a top priority. Eliminating racial injustice in the criminal justice system is an almost Sisyphean task because of the many levels -- surveillance, arrest, conviction, sentencing and imprisonment. The roots of injustice are deep and tangled. The factors that lead to tragedies such as the death of Michael Brown are entwined with the human psyche, implicit bias and socioeconomic factors that are beyond the government's control.

Racial profiling legislation in particular is valued because it attacks the issue at its origin. By preventing law enforcement from disproportionately targeting ethnic minorities for investigation, interrogation and arrest, we affect the later stages of the justice system. Through training and monitoring, we change the culture of our police and court systems.

In 2003, as a state senator in Illinois, Obama did {pass such a bill}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/Barack-Obama-and-Racial-Profiling-215986531.html""> with unanimous support. The state legislation called for the collection of data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped -- a measure that can be extended more broadly for a national bill. His bill also trained police departments on professionalization and avoiding racial biases.

The U.S. Congress has been less receptive to such measures. Despite the many cries for change, the efforts of Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. John Conyers to pass the End Racial Profiling Act in Congress have been unsuccessful. But with the same fierce diplomacy that passed healthcare reform through a recalcitrant Congress, President Obama can rally Congress to honor Michael Brown, a promising teenage boy whose tragic death could have been prevented by racial profiling legislation.

Authorities, citing death threats, had refused to release Wilson's name in the days after he fatally shot Michael Brown.

A resident of the St. Louis area, Wilson, 28, has been staying at a secure location since the shooting.

On Friday, Police Chief Thomas Jackson disclosed the identity of the man whose actions sparked sometimes violent protests and thrust the city of 22,400, a St. Louis suburb, into the national spotlight.

It was not known whether Wilson, an officer for six years, has been placed on modified assignment. Jackson told reporters the officer had faced no disciplinary action during his time on the job.

Brown was African-American; Wilson is white.

Hours after the officer's name was released, however, little further information emerged about him. The disclosure of his identity, in fact, was overshadowed by new details from the police implicating Brown in a convenience store robbery that was reported shortly before the shooting.

The claim was immediately greeted with skepticism and anger from some in the community who have accused Ferguson police of attempting a cover-up.

Attorneys for Brown's family released a statement Friday saying they were ""beyond outraged"" over the timing of the robbery allegation, and accused the police of blaming the victim.

""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up,"" the statement said.

Missouri's governor, Jay Nixon, told reporters, ""I think the focal point here remains to figure how and why Michael Brown was killed.

The police chief, before speaking to reporters, told CNN's Don Lemon that the officer was ""devastated"" by what had happened. Jackson has described the officer as well-mannered and respectful.

""This is his community,"" Jackson said. ""He never wanted any of this to happen.""

Documents released by Ferguson police Friday suggested that Wilson had reason to believe he was encountering a suspect in what Jackson said was a ""strong-arm"" robbery at a convenience store.

The documents said Wilson, who was treated for injuries after the shooting, was in the area searching for the suspect when he spotted Brown.

Brown was named in the documents as the suspect in a robbery of a $50 box of cigars.

The suspect roughly handled a clerk trying to stop him before walking out of the store with a box of Swisher Sweets cigars, according to the documents.

A police officer who responded to the robbery said he identified Brown as the robbery suspect by comparing surveillance images of the incident to the body of the slain teen. The images, showing a large man grabbing a smaller man by his shirt, were included with the documents released Friday.

Jackson said that on the day of the shooting, the officer had responded to a call about a sick person before receiving a call about the convenience store robbery shortly before noon. Wilson had received a description of the suspect over the radio and tried to stop Brown on the street, Jackson said.

The documents said four to six shots were fired.

Authorities previously had not mentioned reports of a robbery in the area.

Long-simmering tensions between residents, police

Police have said Brown was killed in a struggle for the officer's gun. No one has disputed that Brown was unarmed, but witnesses said he was shot as he tried to distance himself and raised his hands into the air.

Brown, an African-American, was days away from starting college.

The shooting sparked protests and isolated looting incidents, and police response with rubber bullets and tear gas, and arrested dozens of people. Many in the community demanded to know the name of the officer involved in the shooting.

Residents complained about long-simmering tensions between the mostly African-American community and predominantly white police force.

CNN,cnn31,http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/15/news/economy/police-militarization/,Local police get billions in military equipment,Chris Isidore,08/15/2014,01/13/2016,"Local police departments are looking more and more like small armies, stocked with billions of dollars worth of military-grade equipment.

The Department of Homeland Security pumped $1 billion into local law enforcement last year, according to a report from the ACLU, while the Department of Defense kicked in another $449 million worth of equipment for police forces.

The extent to which local police in the U.S. have become militarized came into focus this week as heavily armed police faced off against protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, which itself received two Humvees from the Pentagon last fall.

The scene ""resembles war more than traditional police action,"" wrote Sen. Rand Paul, a potential Republican presidential candidate, {in an opinion piece for Time}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/"">.

Attorney General Eric Holder also expressed concern. ""We must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community,"" he said. ""I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.""

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson denied his department has become militarized.

""It's not military, it's tactical operations,"" he said on Thursday. ""That's who's out there, police. We're doing this in blue.""

The Defense Department began arming local police with surplus equipment in 1997 as the Cold War wound down. Since then, the DoD has distributed more than $5 billion worth of vehicles, weapons and other supplies. Separately, after 9/11, a Homeland Security program launched providing cash grants to help small towns and big cities alike prepare for terrorist attacks and other disasters.

Critics say that local police don't need much of the equipment. For instance, twenty mine-resistant, ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles were distributed to police departments all over Missouri in the last eight years, although none went to Ferguson.

""An MRAP is built to withstand armor-piercing bombs. This is not something that we need in American communities,"" said Kara Dansky, who authored the ACLU report on militarization. ""Increasingly the police are trained to view the people in the communities that they're supposed to be protecting and serving as enemies.""

Some experts worry all this heavy equipment could lead to the use of more deadly force than might otherwise occur.

""You bring out the equipment, you add to the likelihood that you might be shot at,"" said Tom Fuentes a former FBI assistant director and a CNN Law Enforcement Analyst.

Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin said in a written statement Friday that Congress established the program out of concern that local law enforcement agencies were literally outgunned by drug criminals. But he said his committee will review the program to determine ""if equipment provided by the Defense Department is being used as intended.""

But others say there can be a legitimate need for the supplies, and that anticipating who will need it is impossible in advance.

""When it comes to equipment like this, it's better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it,"" said Mike Brooks, a CNN law enforcement analyst.",NA,NA,NA,NA

""They're firing rubber bullets,"" a reporter with KARG Argus Radio is heard saying on video. ""They're attacking reporters; they are attacking civilians. They are firing up on the media.""

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said pepper bullets were used. A CNN crew also found spent crowd-control stun grenades lying in the street.

All the details of what happened amid protests over a police officer's fatal {shooting of an unarmed teen}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html""> have yet to come in. Multiple law enforcement agencies from the city, county and state levels have been dispatched to calm the protests. In the chaos, it was not immediately clear which agencies did what exactly -- though Ferguson Mayor Jay Knowles did say Thursday that St. Louis County police have been ""in charge tactically since Sunday.""

Change is coming. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced Thursday the Missouri State Highway Patrol will head up security because ""at this particular point, the attitudes weren't improving.""

Even if things turn around quickly, though, it won't erase the memories from this past week or end the debate about tactics. Chief among them are decisions like deploying heavily armed officers and using military equipment, which some experts say helped to make a bad situation even worse.

Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honore knows a thing or two about this kind of thing, having been dispatched to New Orleans in 2005 to lead recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina. What authorities in Ferguson should have done, he said, is have ""front line policemen"" to face protesters, not a SWAT team.

""The tactics they are using, I don't know where they learned them from,"" Honore said Thursday on ""CNN Newsroom."" ""It appears they may be making them up on the way. But this is escalating the situation.""

What should police do with unruly protesters?

{Sen. Claire McCaskill}<hyperlink=""http://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/media-center/news-releases/mccaskill-in-ferguson-time-to-de-militarize-this-situation"">, D-Missouri, echoed that view Thursday, saying her ""constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right.""

""This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution,"" she added.

Police said they responded with force only after the Molotov cocktails were thrown at them, and news photos showed some young men in the crowd lighting them.

Yet Alderman Antonio French of St. Louis disputes this sequence, saying police started the violence and protesters responded.

Joey Jackson, an HLN legal analyst, said if there are some protesters who are unruly -- unlike the majority -- then police ""need to isolate those people and perhaps respond to them as opposed to firing upon the crowd in general.""

But the chief said police can't possibly go through the crowd and just remove certain individuals.

""If the crowd is getting violent, and you don't want to be violent, get out of the crowd,"" he said of protesters.

Mike Brooks, a former Washington police official who now serves as HLN's law enforcement analyst, cautioned against rushing to judge police over Wednesday night's fighting. ""If there were, being thrown, rocks and bottles and Molotov cocktails, then they had to respond in kind,"" he argued.

But Brooks also said he has serious questions about the arrest of two journalists inside a McDonald's by an officer who, according to reports, refused to provide his name.

""Why did the police come in and ask them to leave?"" Brooks asks. If there were a problem, it would be ""up to the manager, the general manger of that establishment, to ask them to leave. I want to know what department these officers were from. And if I ask an officer, 'What is your name and badge number,' that officer better give it to me.""

Critics of the law enforcement response include Attorney General Eric Holder, who said ""the scenes playing out in the streets of Ferguson over the last several nights cannot continue.""

Some blame lay with protesters, he said. Even though ""the vast majority ... have been peaceful,"" others have been marred by violence, looting and antagonizing of law enforcement.

Yet law enforcement's aim should be to ""reduce tensions, not heighten them,"" he said. That means respecting ""at all times"" the rights of those gathered to express sympathy with Brown's family as well as the ability of journalists to report the story. (Two reporters were detained and then released without charges Wednesday.)

""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" Holder added.

Throughout the week, authorities in Ferguson have said the armored vehicles and weaponry have been in place to keep the peace.

Yet civil liberty advocates and others disagree, saying the response in Ferguson is symptomatic of larger, disturbing trends in law enforcement.

In {an extensive report}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf""> issued weeks ago, the American Civil Liberties Union stated ""American policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized, in large part through federal programs that have armed state and local law enforcement agencies with the weapons and tactics of war, with almost no public discussion or oversight.""

""Militarization of policing encourages officers to adopt a 'warrior' mentality and think of the people they are supposed to serve as enemies,"" the report added.

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver is among those who don't think such equipment makes sense in Ferguson. He told CNN he and Rep. Lacy Clay want to personally urge Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to institute ""very stringent requirements"" whenever military equipment is disbursed, including special training of police.

""I think the heavy equipment probably should go to only cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, where there is always a threat of some kind of a terrorist attack,"" Cleaver said. ""But in middle America, you don't need leftover equipment from Iraq.""

Veterans critical of police response

Josh Weinberg, an Army veteran who focuses on security issues for the Truman Project, contends that police sometimes do ""need high-powered weaponry"" and other tools to go after ""up-armored"" and heavily armed criminals.

""It's really scary,"" he says.

But that doesn't mean the way Ferguson police used some of that equipment made sense, he argues.

Videos showed ""a bunch of guys on top of an armored personnel carrier,"" Weinberg said. ""When we're rolling around in Afghanistan and there is a threat of being shot, you don't sit on top of an APC. That defeats the purpose.""

Weinberg says it's unfair to the military to call what happened in Ferguson evidence of ""militarization,"" saying U.S. soldiers are well ""trained in escalation of force.""

The police apparently ""had their weapons up and pointed at protesters who are obviously unarmed,"" he said. In the military, he learned that ""your force posture matches the threat. You only raise your weapon if there is a threat that requires lethal force.""

With a pointed weapon, Weinberg said, ""you could make a mistake, maybe get startled, put your finger on the trigger and shoot somebody who doesn't deserve to be shot.""

And threatening people unnecessarily can increase the tensions and danger, exacerbating the situation, he says. ""A crowd kind of has a mind of its own that develops over time, depending on what threat they perceive.""

Weinberg isn't alone. ""As someone who studies policing in conflict, what's going on Ferguson isn't just immoral and probably unconstitutional, it's ineffective,"" Army veteran Jason Fritz wrote on Twitter. Fritz is now senior editor of War on the Rocks, which analyzes national security issues.

His was one of the tweets included in a {storify}<hyperlink=""https://storify.com/AthertonKD/veterans-on-ferguson""> being shared widely online Thursday morning, with this line at the top: ""The general consensus here: if this is militarization, it's the s***iest, least-trained, least professional military in the world, using weapons far beyond what they need, or what the military would use when doing crowd control.""

In another, author and former Marine logistics officer Jeff Clement wrote: ""Our (Rules of Engagement) regarding who we could point weapons at in Afghanistan was more restrictive than cops in MO.""",NA,NA,NA,NA
CNN,cnn33,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/us/missouri-teen-shooting/,Ferguson police chief: Officer didn't stop Brown as robbery suspect,Greg Botelho; Don Lemon,08/15/2014,01/13/2016,"The Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown didn't stop him because he was suspected in a convenience-store robbery, but because he was ""walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic,"" the city's police chief said Friday.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson -- hours after documents came out labeling the 18-year-old Brown as the ""primary suspect"" in the store theft -- told reporters the ""robbery does not relate to the initial contact between the officer and Michael Brown.""

So why did Ferguson police opt to release surveillance video of the convenience-store incident Friday -- the same day they named, six days after the shooting, the white police officer who fatally shot the African-American teenager -- if the two situations aren't related?

Jackson said he distributed the store videotape ""because the press asked for it,"" noting he couldn't withhold it indefinitely.

The chief added ""we needed to release that at the same time we needed to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting,"" though he didn't elaborate on why. Identifying the officer was one key demand of demonstrators, along with pressing for other details on the shooting amid allegations of a police coverup.

The flurry of details Friday added intrigue and, in some ways, anger to a case that's spurred protests in the St. Louis suburb and beyond among those upset by Brown's shooting and what they decry as a heavy-handed police response afterward.

Brown's family wasn't told ahead of time anything about the robbery or store surveillance video, family lawyer Benjamin Crump told CNN's Jake Tapper. Regardless, whatever happened there doesn't matter, said Eric Davis, a cousin of Brown's mother.

""It's a diversion, and it's an attempt to smear Michael's character,"" said Davis, who added the family has ""not been happy"" with the Ferguson police department's handling of the case. ""... It (should be) more about what happened on Canfield Drive, where Michael was executed.""

The man heading security in Ferguson amid the unrest -- Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson -- stated the robbery and shooting of Brown ""are separate issues.""

""I told (Chief Jackson) I think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go,"" he told CNN on Friday evening. ""Today is about taking care of this incident here, getting to those facts that are there, and Michael Brown and his family.""

Hours earlier, in video captured {by CNN affiliate KSDK}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/media/cinematic/video/14113873/capt-ron-johnson-reacts-to-release-of-information/"">, Johnson emphasized authorities have an obligation to be upfront, not to say ""some things and now everybody says, 'what does that mean?'""

""I think if we're going to give answers, we need to not give hints,"" Johnson said. ""We need to say it.""

Chief: Police officer involved in shooting 'a gentleman'

Police identified the officer who shot Michael Brown as 28-year-old {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/justice/ferguson-missouri-cop-profile/index.html?hpt=hp_t1""> -- a six-year police veteran, including four years with the Ferguson force. Authorities had refused to name him, citing threats to his safety.

The fact they have now done so satisfies a major demand of protesters. But many remain perturbed that additional details have not come out about Brown's shooting.

What the police chief did do on Friday was express ""every confidence"" in Wilson, who had one side of his face swollen in his encounter with Brown, according to authorities.

""He (is) a gentleman ... a quiet officer,"" Jackson said. The entire situation is ""devastating, it's absolutely devastating"" to Wilson.

Much more information was provided about the reported convenience store robbery.

That includes the surveillance video, which shows a large African-American man pushing aside a smaller man who seemingly tries to stop him, then leaving the store. Crump said the larger man ""appears to be"" Michael Brown.

Newly released police documents claim the teenager roughly handled a clerk trying to stop him before walking out of the store with the box of Swisher Sweets.

The cost for the box of cigars, according to the documents: $48.99.

Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, told CNN that Wilson confronted Brown for being in the road, not the robbery.

""I guess that is when he might have seen ... evidence and connected it"" to the robbery, Jackson said -- without explicitly tying the two incidents together himself.

Relative: Actions 'fueled the distrust' toward police

A key complaint of protesters has been -- while police have said the shooting occurred during a struggle for the officer's gun -- witnesses say the officer shot Brown as the teenager stood with his hands in the air.

Tiffany Mitchell, who saw what happened, told CNN that ""it looked as if Michael was pushing off and the cop was trying to pull him in."" Instead, a shot went off, the teen broke free, and the officer got out of the vehicle and ran about 20 feet in pursuit, she and co-worker Piaget Crenshaw said.

Another man, Dorian Johnson, said he was with Brown at the time of the shooting and that police shot Brown without provocation.

""We wasn't committing any crime, bringing no harm to nobody, but my friend was murdered in cold blood,"" he told {CNN affiliate KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/"">.

Jackson confirmed to reporters Friday that Johnson, at least, ""did not commit a crime and was not complicit in a crime.""

The information released Friday seems unlikely to quell the anger in the eastern Missouri city or elsewhere. Eric Davis, speaking for Brown's family, expects the opposite will be the case -- even as he stressed that any protests must remain peaceful.

""This (police) chief ... is just inciting the crowd and making everybody angry,"" Davis said. ""It just fueled the distrust that was already out there for the Ferguson police department.""

Yet there were also some who said the robbery is not necessarily irrelevant to what happened next.

""A robbery doesn't justify shooting Mike Brown, but it definitely changes your perspective on his mindset at the time of police encounter,"" read one Twitter post from @OneTermTooMany.

'Police chiefs are watching'

The full, complicated story has stirred an intense, nationwide discussion on race in the United States, and on the shooting itself as well as the response to demonstrators afterward. Accusers accused some protesters of violence and looting, while many on the other side have ripped what they call an over-the-top, militarized police response.

So what's next?

There's still the possibility that action -- including, potentially, criminal charges -- could be taken against Officer Wilson. Then there's the potential for political fall-out affecting Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon or Ferguson's police chief.

And there's still a lot of anger about the shooting and the ensuing police response, and there are many angry people on the streets. A major rally is set for Sunday to demand action by authorities.

""This situation has been handled very badly,"" civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said Friday from Ferguson. ""People here must turn their pain into power.""

Undeterred by rain, people still made their voices heard Friday night on the streets of Ferguson -- some raising their hands up high, like they say Brown did before being shot dead by Officer Wilson.

""It's tragic what happened, but we're all united and working together,"" said Tiffany Greene. ""It's not a race thing, it's a right-or-wrong thing.""

The scene -- which mixed in chants and sign-holders with live music -- was a stark contrast to earlier in the week. Police used tear gas, rubber bullets and armored equipment, and accused some protesters of throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails.

One demonstrator, Charla Griffin, noted the peaceful and communal nature of Friday's gatherings, saying, ""We're having a good time in the name of Michael Brown.""

It's seemingly no coincidence that things calmed calmed significantly Thursday, which was the day the state highway patrol took over security. Rather than confront protesters, Johnson figuratively and literally has embraced them.

Talking later to CNN, the highway patrol captain said he thinks this whole ordeal -- as it relates to race relations between communities and law enforcement, as well as how authorities respond to protests -- ""will create change throughout our nation."" For example, he expects there will be talk about diversity training and tactics.

CNN,cnn34,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/justice/ferguson-missouri-police-community/,"Michael Brown shooting, protests highlight racial divide",Ray Sanchez,08/15/2014,01/13/2016,"Before Saturday's police shooting of an African-American teenager, Ferguson, Missouri, was known as one of hundreds of municipalities designated by a {national nonprofit as a ""Playful City USA,""}<hyperlink=""https://kaboom.org/playability/playful_city_usa""> a place where children are supposed to have access to more opportunities to play in their communities.

But the shooting death of {Michael Brown, a college-bound 18-year-old, by a police officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/10/justice/missouri-police-involved-shooting/""> has brought national attention to the mostly black community for another reason.

Witnesses and residents say the young man was unarmed. Police say he tried to take an officer's gun. Authorities, citing threats and safety issues, have refused to identify the officer. Protests have turned violent. Tensions remain high after isolated looting incidents and dozens of arrests in the St. Louis suburb of 22,400.

To locals and longtime observers, the tension has been brewing since the 1970s, when Ferguson underwent a racial transformation.

Once predominantly white, the city became overwhelmingly black as white families moved out during the racial integration of public schools. At the same time, many African-American families started to move to Ferguson from St. Louis and surrounding communities.

""This whole situation has been boiling for a while,"" said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who lives five miles from Ferguson. ""It's not just the death of Michael Brown but the way it's been handled by the local government and the response to the community's outrage that forced this to boil over.""

A white man's response to Ferguson

On Thursday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon acknowledged long-simmering tensions between the community and police.

""This feels a little like an old wound that has been hit again,"" he said. ""The key to this is ... ultimately getting to some of these deeper problems. These are deep and existing problems not only in Missouri but in America. This has clearly touched a nerve, and that nerve is not merely from this horrific incident that happened just a few short days ago.""

Advocates for effective policing contend that law enforcement should reflect the diversity of the community it polices. When that is out of balance, however, an incident such as the Brown shooting can cause tensions to boil over.

What's happening in Ferguson today is a perfect example, said Beryl Satter, a history professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey.

""This is what happens when you have massive racial change in a community and the power structure remains in the hands of whites and the police force acts as this sort of mediating force between the white power structure and what is now a black community and has very little empathy or knowledge about that community.""

Racial disparity

Two-thirds of Ferguson's population is black, and yet the mayor is white, and so are five of the six city council members.

The police chief is also white. There are only three African-Americans on the 53-person police force.

""This all gets back to segregation,"" Satter said. ""The school boards, the police force, the juvenile courts remain the same. The population changes before the power structure changes. ... It happened across the country when there was very rapid resegregation of a town, a neighborhood or a city.""

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson admitted Wednesday that diversity on the force was a ""constant struggle"" but said race relations were a top priority for his department. He also said the officer who shot Brown was assaulted before opening fire on the young man.

According to a 2013 report released by the Missouri attorney general, African-Americans are not under-represented in crime statistics. They accounted for 93% of arrests after traffic stops, 92% of searches and 86% of traffic stops.

The St. Louis area has always been one of the most racially segregated regions in the country, according to Satter and other experts.

It was in St. Louis that a federal judge in 1847 returned Dred Scott to slavery in a decision upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that African-Americans were not American citizens and could not sue in federal court.

Deadly race riots erupted in East St. Louis in the early 1900s. The looting and angry protests that followed Brown's death, Satter said, are part of the ""historical lineage of violence and segregation.""

While all the facts surrounding the Brown shooting have yet to come out, Satter said, the disconnect between the community and law enforcement can have lasting effects.

""It's just a terrible spiral of oppression,"" she said. ""The reaction of rioting in response to police brutality is classic. It's so personal. Other kinds of oppression that black people face, say in the school or other places, it's not on your body. It's not as personally invasive. But police brutality hurts in a sharper, more profound and immediate way. People can relate to what happened to this boy.""

Racial profiling training

Jackson told CNN this week that he was working to improve the diversity of the force. Racial profiling, he said, was ""strictly forbidden.""

""We actually have mandatory racial profiling training that we have to take to be certified,"" he said. ""Racial profiling is against our policies. It actually benefits nothing.""

David Klinger, a criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and a former Los Angeles police officer, said that a more diverse police force doesn't always translate into better police relations with a community.

""If the cops are not treating the citizens appropriately, is it a question of the cops not doing their job right because they're not trained well or they're knuckleheads or they hold racial animus?"" he said. ""Who knows? But if you bore down and it turns out that there's racial animus, then you have a real big problem on top of the lack of professionalism, because that's a flashpoint in our society. We have a rough history in America regarding race relations. And the police, unfortunately, have been on the wrong side of that.""

Dan Isom, retired chief of police in St. Louis and a criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said the diversity of the police rank and file and command definitely affects community relations.

""When you look across the nation, it's not uncommon for police departments to have a racial makeup that is not consistent with the community,"" he said. ""You don't have a political or community push for improvement until something like the Michael Brown shooting happens.""

According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, about a quarter of police officers across the nation were ethnic minorities in 2007, compared with a sixth of officers in 1987.

Isom hopes the tragedy leads to change.

""There are so many questions to be asked beyond just the shooting,"" Isom said. ""Certainly, the police department's makeup, the relationship with the community. Hopefully, this brings a bigger conversation: Why does this happen in the African-American community? What are the deeper issues we have to resolve between communities and police?""

Other factors about Ferguson need to be considered, observers said.

According to the 2010 census, community residents are mostly young; the average age is 31. Median household income is $37,000: about $10,000 less than Missouri as a whole. About one-fifth of Ferguson residents live in poverty.

African-Americans are much worse off economically than whites, with a 25% poverty rate that's more than twice that of whites, according to the most recent government estimates from two years ago. Their median income is only about 60% that of their white counterparts.

""Ferguson's black community is a very transient community, living in rental housing,"" said French, the St. Louis alderman. ""Not many people register to vote, and even less participate in elections. ... People are living day to day out there, and part of their daily existence is negative encounters with the police. They want to be heard. They want their frustration to be recognized.""",NA,NA,NA,NA
CNN,cnn35,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teen-shooting-captain/,New head of Ferguson security: 'How would I feel?',Dana Ford; Ray Sanchez ,08/15/2014,01/13/2016,"One day after leading a peaceful procession of demonstrators along the streets of his native Ferguson, Missouri, State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson turned a outdoor news conference into an impromptu community forum.

""I'm here to make sure they hear what I'm talking about,"" Johnson, standing with Gov. Jay Nixon and others, told reporters Friday.

He stepped away from the microphone and moved closer to members of a community still seething after Saturday's racially-charged police shooting of an unarmed black teenager.

""Move in a little closer,"" he implored residents who had gathered behind reporters. ""Come in closer.""

For the man tapped Thursday to restore order in the restive St. Louis suburb where sometimes violent protests were met with a heavy handed police response, the mission is personal.

""The people of our community need to hear what I'm saying,"" he told the crowd. ""They have questions. This isn't about Ron Johnson... It is about the people that live in our community.""

State troopers took over security after days of clashes between protesters and local police, who have been accused of using excessive force -- including rubber bullets and tear gas -- in response to the demonstrations.

On Thursday night, Johnson and other officials marched with the protesters and, in his words, they ""walked and shook hands and talked to people and listened and promised that we're going to communicate better.""

""Last night was a great night,"" he recalled. ""There were no calls for service. We did not deploy tear gas. We did not have road blocks. We did not make any arrests. It was a good night. People were talking.""

At Friday's news conference, residents expressed skepticism to details released by Ferguson's police chief implicating Brown as the ""primary suspect"" in a convenience store robbery moments before he was killed. Johnson said he would brief residents about the claims after meeting with Police Chief Thomas Jackson.

But he urged residents ""to make sure that we don't burn down our own house, that we don't go down there and vandalize our own buildings...That doesn't prove a point. That does not solve the issue. That hurts this community, and that's what I don't want.""

At one point in the news conference, a man who said he was the father of seven children talked about his kids being ""scared to death"" of the police.

Johnson responded more like a pastor than a law enforcement officer: ""When I got home, my daughter said, 'Daddy, were you scared?' I said, 'Just a little.' She said, 'Daddy, I want you to remember when Jesus asked Peter to walk with him in the water. When Peter got scared Jesus picked him up and said have faith.' Today, we need to be just like Peter.""

On social media, people praised Johnson's handling of the situation.

""Capt. Johnson. Inspiring. What an incredible night this is in #Ferguson,"" one person tweeted.

Music impresario Russell Simmons tweeted: ""When police know the community and come from community, the relationship can be transformed overnight. Well done Capt. Johnson. #Ferguson""

When Johnson took over security in Ferguson Thursday, the suburb has become a flashpoint.

""A young man lost his life and so I grieve for that family because I have a son,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""We're going to look at this from a personal standpoint and if that was my son -- or that was my friend -- how would I feel?""

Earlier in the day, he told reporters in St. Louis that he grew up in the area and considers it both his community and home.

Ferguson has been the scene of protests since Saturday, when a police officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed. Police say he was trying to grab the officer's gun. Witnesses say the 18-year-old was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot.

Although locals say race relations have long been troubled between the city's mostly African-American population and the mostly white police force, anger spilled out after Brown's death, resulting in protests, violence, looting and fires.

""It means a lot to me, personally, that we break the cycle of violence, diffuse the tension and build trust -- showing the utmost respect for every interaction with every citizen,"" Johnson, who is African-American, told reporters.

""Moving forward, I'm confident that the patrol and police resources present here in Ferguson will do just that.""

The new head of security said he is committed to the new approach.

He stressed the importance of not focusing on the past.

""We're going to start from today. We're not going to look back in the past,"" Johnson said. ""We are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we're in this together.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

One side says the teenager was surrendering, his hands in the air to show he was unarmed, when the officer opened fire. Authorities counter that Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun.

The St. Louis suburb of 21,000 {was wracked by violence}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html""> as protesters outraged over the 18-year-old's shooting faced off with police.

Although there were reports that some demonstrations were peaceful -- protesters held up their hands, as Brown reportedly did, and others demanded a fair inquiry, chanting, ""No justice, no peace"" -- there were also reports of fires, looting, vandalism and attacks on police officers.

As federal civil rights investigators and the FBI carry out their own inquiry into the case, tensions are running high in Ferguson, where there's a history of distrust between the predominately black community and the largely white police force.

Brown was African-American. Police have not identified the shooter, but a witness told CNN on Tuesday that the officer who opened fire is a Caucasian male.

The dispute between distraught Ferguson residents and police isn't likely to be settled soon.

One thing is sure, though: What police say was self-defense by the yet-to-be-named officer doesn't jibe with the accounts of those who say they saw the encounter.

Here's what CNN has learned:

Brown was spending the summer in the neighborhood with his grandmother Desuirea Harris, {she told CNN affiliate KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html"">. She described him as ""a good kid.""

Family members say he was a recent graduate of nearby Normandy High School and was going to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday.

Brown and a friend were walking to Harris' house, his mother and grandmother said, when a Ferguson police officer confronted them.

This is where the stories part ways.

Dorian Johnson, 22, told CNN that he and Brown were walking in the middle of the street when a white male officer pulled up and told them, ""Get the f*** on the sidewalk."" The young men replied that they were ""not but a minute away from our destination, and we would shortly be out of the street,"" Johnson said.

The officer drove forward but stopped and backed up, almost hitting the pair, Johnson said.

""We were so close, almost inches away, that when he tried to open his door aggressively, the door ricocheted both off me and Big Mike's body and closed back on the officer,"" Johnson said.

Still in his car, the officer then grabbed Brown by his neck, Johnson said. Brown tried to pull away, but the officer kept pulling Brown toward him, he said.

The officer drew his weapon, and ""he said, 'I'll shoot you' or 'I'm going to shoot' "" and almost instantaneously fired his weapon, hitting Brown, Johnson said.

Johnson and a bloodied Brown took off running, and Johnson hid behind the first car he saw, he said. The officer got out of his car.

""I saw the officer proceeding after my friend Big Mike with his gun drawn, and he fired a second shot and that struck my friend Big Mike,"" Johnson told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""And at that time, he turned around with his hands up, beginning to tell the officer that he was unarmed and to tell him to stop shooting. But at that time, the officer firing several more shots into my friend, and he hit the ground and died.""

""We wasn't committing any crime, bringing no harm to nobody, but my friend was murdered in cold blood,"" he {told KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/St-Louis-County-PD-holding-press-conference-Sunday-morning-270638431.html"">.

Witness Tiffany Mitchell was picking up Piaget Crenshaw for work when she saw Brown and the officer ""tussling through the window."" Mitchell and Crenshaw concurred with Johnson, saying Brown appeared to be trying to pry himself away from the officer's grasp. Brown had his hand on the police cruiser, trying to push himself away, Mitchell said.

Mitchell reached for her phone to record the encounter.

""I didn't get the video because a shot was fired through the window so I tried to get out of the way,"" she said.

After that shot, Brown broke free from the officer's grasp, both women told CNN, and started running, but he only got about 20 feet from the squad car by Crenshaw's estimate.

""The cop gets out of his vehicle shooting,"" Mitchell said. ""(Brown's) body jerked as if he was hit from behind, and he turned around and he put his hands up. ... The cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground, and his face just smacked the concrete.""

Added Crenshaw, who said she was watching the incident unfold from a nearby balcony, ""The (officer) actually shot kind of carelessly. They shot my neighbor's building that was on the opposite side of the police car. They then later came and removed that bullet. ... Anybody could've been standing right there.""

That Brown was unarmed is undisputed -- St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said every casing found at the scene was from the officer's weapon -- but he said at a Sunday news conference that Brown was not an innocent victim.

""The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,"" Belmar said, adding that Ferguson police asked his office to investigate the case.

Without revealing what led to the dispute, Belmar said the preliminary investigation showed that the Ferguson officer tried to exit his vehicle, but Brown pushed him back into the car, ""where he physically assaulted the police officer"" and struggled over the officer's weapon, Belmar said.

A shot was fired inside the police car, and Brown was eventually shot about 35 feet away from the vehicle, Belmar said.

The officer was taken to an area hospital where he was treated for a ""swollen face,"" Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said, adding he had not personally seen the officer's injury.

He was released the same day. Jackson said he has spoken to the officer, who was ""very shaken about what happened that day and the aftermath. ... He's hurt.""

It's unclear how many times Brown was shot. Mitchell said it was ""more than about five or six"" times. Johnson said it was more than three, and Brown's mother said she was told he was shot eight times. Some witnesses said they heard as many as 10 shots. Belmar said only that it ""was more than just a couple.""

The chief didn't explain how Brown got so far away from the car or whether he was surrendering. He said he was declining to disclose certain details because he didn't want to ""prejudice"" the case.

The officer is on paid administrative leave. There's no word on when authorities will identify him, but Belmar said he has been with the force six years and is ""unaware of any other issues that he's been involved in.""

He will be required to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty, the chief said.

CNN,cnn37,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/opinion/hill-obama-brown-ferguson-race/,"Obama, can't you see black anger in Ferguson?",Marc Lamont Hill,08/15/2014,01/13/2016,"Over the past two days, President Barack Obama has finally weighed in on the tragic shooting of Michael Brown, as well as the wave of protests that emerged in its aftermath. In an official White House statement on Wednesday and a brief speech from Martha's Vineyard on Thursday, the President played his usual role of ""the uniter,"" preaching calm and healing to the American public.

I wish he'd just said nothing.

To be clear, I didn't have any unrealistic expectations for Obama. I didn't expect him to pump a black fist in solidarity or scream ""fight the power"" from the makeshift press room. I didn't even need him to take a clear side on the issue. I did, however, expect him to tell the truth. Instead, the President delivered a polite but ultimately dangerous message to the American public.

Noticeably absent from President Obama's remarks was the issue of race. Despite Ferguson being 68% black, Ferguson's police force is nearly all white. {Blacks in the town comprise}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/14/ferguson-police-department-details/14064451/""> 86% of all vehicle stops and 85% of all arrests. Over the past week, black residents of the town have complained of racial harassment from law enforcement. That, combined with the {trend of unarmed black men being the victims of extrajudicial killings<hyperlink=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/police-shootings-michael-brown-ferguson-black-men"">, makes the racial implications of Brown's death quite strong.

Even if one were to believe that Michael Brown's killing had nothing to do with race -- a naïve position at best -- the wave of protests and debates that emerged after it happened have been undeniably racial. By not mentioning this racial dimension, the President reinforced the immature notion that racism can be defeated simply by pretending it doesn't exist.

Rather than leading the nation into a new level of racial understanding and dialogue, the President took the safe path through the door of post-racial rhetoric.

Obama has also placed the highest priority on remaining calm. While this may seem reasonable on its face, particularly against the backdrop of rioting and looting, his words failed to acknowledge the legitimacy of black anger. Black people die violent deaths way out of proportion to their numbers, sometimes killed by rogue cops and even more often each other. Why would we not be angry?

But unlike black-on-black violence, which is tragic but typically punished through proper legal channels, killings of unarmed young people by law enforcement continue to happen with impunity. Instead of acknowledging the legitimacy of black anger over this, the President simply told us to calm down and stop looting. In doing so, he joined the chorus of far too many politicians and civil rights leaders who understate and trivialize righteous anger in order to show the public that they have ""the people"" under control.

Perhaps most frustrating, however, was the president's insistence on using the language of equivalence when describing the rioting. Similar to his {""Philadelphia Compromise""}<hyperlink=""http://constitutioncenter.org/amoreperfectunion/""> speech on race back in in 2008, where he ignored the legacy of white supremacy and placed the racial frustrations of white and black Americans on equal historical tiers, Obama chided both black rioters and Ferguson police with the same moral tone.

The President ignored the fact that the militarized Ferguson police force were the antagonists of the unrest, in both shooting the unarmed Brown and then using excessive force during the protests. In doing so, he (perhaps unwittingly) supported the narrative in some quarters of well-intentioned police officers whose hands were forced by violent natives.",NA,NA,NA,(1/13) need python for saving pic gallery
CNN,cnn38,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/16/opinion/omara-trayvon-martin-michael-brown/,Ferguson and the lessons from Trayvon Martin,Mark O'Mara,08/16/2014,01/13/2016,"I believed we had learned lessons from the {George Zimmerman case}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/05/us/trayvon-martin-shooting-fast-facts/index.html""> in how to better handle cases like the Michael Brown shooting. Zimmerman, you'll recall, was charged with shooting Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in Sanford, Florida, in 2012. I was Zimmereman's lawyer. That case caught national attention for the shooting itself, but almost more for the way law enforcement was perceived to have mishandled it and for the racial animus it exposed over how young blacks are treated in the criminal justice system.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure that all of the right people have learned all of the right lessons from that case. Now, as the days drag on in Ferguson, Missouri, it seems that some involved, particularly in the law enforcement hierarchy, are not handling the Michael Brown case better than the Zimmerman case. In fact, this time it's being handled worse.

Some observations on Ferguson:

The social media response has been amazing. An event these days -- whether it be the Michael Brown shooting, the Donald Sterling uproar, the questionable death of Kendrick Johnson in Georgia -- gains a life online via social media, keeping it in the forefront of our national conversation. Though there are down sides, one of social media's strong positives is that it allows for an open, quick and national discourse. With the crackdown on the press in Ferguson this week, it was {citizens with cell phones}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/tech/social-media/ferguson-hands-up-igotthetalk/index.html""> who provided pictures and helped set the editorial agenda.

The Ferguson Police Department has fallen far short of expectations. While we still don't know -- and likely won't for a while -- what exactly happened and why the officer fired those fatal shots, the way the Ferguson police department reacted was poor and made matters worse, not better. A sensitive response -- informed by an awareness that this shooting would lead to a powerful, communitywide reaction—would have acknowledged the trauma inflicted on the entire black community.

While I still maintain that the integrity of the investigation is paramount (if charges are being considered, we must make sure that the witnesses were not tainted by leaked information or coached in their answers to the perceived events), the police mishandled the situation in important ways, and in ways that undermined or destroyed the black community's faith that this would be handled properly.

The name of the officer who shot Michael was finally released Friday. {He is Officer Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/justice/ferguson-missouri-wilson/index.html"">, a six-year veteran of the department. It was time to do this. At least now that point of frustration has ended. But the decision also to release the videotape of the previous robbery event in which Michael Brown was suspected was a further insult to the sensitivities that exist in this now cultural event. If it had to be done, it should have been well separated.

We shouldn't forget that the law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, from the Justice Department and the FBI to the St. Louis County Sherriff, had already had the officer's name, his background, his disciplinary record, his medical records--and are still gathering the other information necessary to begin drilling into who he was before this shooting and what happened to him during it. The coordinated interaction between these agencies is a good definition of transparency, not piecemeal distribution of snippets of information.

The police chief's decision to come out with a statement early in the investigation defending his officer was a poor decision, as it polarized an already tense environment and was insensitive to Ferguson's African-American community.

How the police reacted to the civil unrest is a mixed bag. While law enforcement agencies have both the right and the obligation to maintain civil order and peace, they must do so in a way that is sensitive to the issues that are being addressed in protests.

I do not have a concern with an appropriate police presence, and I believe police should act to stop destruction of property or the use of the protest for personal gain or profit, such as looting stores. That said, nothing justifies use of an aggressive police presence without proper cause. There was no basis for a military-style response, even though the law enforcement could justify it by looking at their textbooks. This did not warrant a textbook response. This warranted -- demanded -- a response that carried the respect appropriate in such difficult times. We also now know that a lesser response, as has happened since estate police took over, worked to lessen tensions.

At the very least, I sincerely hope that the police agencies involved maintained their own video log of events witnessed and reacted to by law enforcement. If those actions were necessary in response to threats or inappropriate actions from protesters, I would give the department deference. But they are going to have to justify tear gas and rubber bullets, and that will be tough to do in a situation as socially charged as this one.

There will be and should be, a review of police activities in response to the shooting; not to place blame, but as a learning tool. We were dangerously close to a meltdown in Ferguson. We now look back at how Seminole County, Florida, handled the Zimmerman matter and must acknowledge they did a better job than Ferguson.

The protesters, setting aside for a moment the looters and hooligans, have acted in a very appropriate and responsible way. Our country was built upon the concept of seeking appropriate redress of actions by our government. It is not only allowed and appropriate, but it is ingrained in our national fabric and the nation would be weaker without it.

The people who take advantage of a situation that allows them to loot and steal -- which they continued doing early Saturday -- should face significant consequences. Not only have they committed individual crimes by their actions, but they have desecrated the very purpose of the respectful protesters and in doing so damaged the national perspective of the protest itself. Their actions distract attention from the important, underlying reasons for the protest and threaten to turn the process into a dangerous, counterproductive battle between themselves and the police presence.

The response Friday night and early Saturday by law enforcement was restrained; they deserve credit. Even more so, the protesters who tried to block the looters stand as testament to the true purpose of their involvement: peaceful pleas for change.

The governor of Missouri should have taken stronger action and done so much sooner. While he may have hoped that this incident could be addressed properly at the local level, Gov. Jay Dixon should have realized that wasn't going to happen by the end of the first 24-hour period. At that point, having an elected official unconnected with the police department involved would have given the proper appearance of impartiality and would have put the strength of the entire state behind this event.

I'm very glad that Dixon finally became involved in the process, and I believe his presentation to the church affirming the state's commitment was necessary. His promise to handle this matter to the end, in a transparent way, and to seek justice wherever that may lead, was the right position for the governor to take. (P.S.--Don't try to make jokes about how you look on camera when you're dealing with a national tragedy.)

President Barack Obama should have a voice in the public reaction to this event, but he needs to be circumspect in his presentation. I have, in the past, expressed my chagrin that Obama injected himself into the Zimmerman matter -- not because he involved himself with a national tragedy, but because he took a side in a pending case where he should be very reluctant to do so. I appreciate his more inclusive and tempered response to this troubling shooting.

Traditional media have handled this case well. Across the board, media outlets have presented a number of well-balanced reviews of the relevant issues. The traditional media learned a good deal from the Zimmerman case: Reporting on the Michael Brown shooting has been much better founded in both the rules of evidence, the rules of the court and the statutes that deal with such issues as self-defense, ""imminent fear of great bodily injury,"" and police procedures. The media have learned to understand the subject and the applicable statutes before commenting on the case.

There has also been a greater level of fairness in reporting, and also a necessary acknowledgment that precious few facts are available yet. The media have asked the right questions, but have hesitated to fuel speculation. And that is the essence of responsible reporting.",NA,NA,NA,(1/13) need python for saving pic gallery

Jay Nixon on Saturday declared a state of emergency and implemented a midnight to 5 a.m. curfew in Ferguson, where the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager sparked a week of protests and sporadic looting.

""I'm committed to making sure the forces of peace and justice prevail,"" Nixon said at a community meeting. ""If we're going to achieve justice, we first must have and maintain peace.""

But the meeting at a local church at times was tumultuous.

People repeatedly interrupted Nixon, shouting, ""You need to charge the police with murder!"" and ""We want justice!""

And some residents said law enforcement officers had instigated the violence with their military-like tactics.

State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, in charge of security for the town, praised local citizens who tried to stop the looting of several businesses early Saturday. He said law enforcement would not be heavy-handed in enforcing the curfew.

""We won't enforce it with trucks, we won't enforce it with tear gas,"" he said.

But at least one resident was skeptical about whether the curfew would work.

""It's an intimidation thing. And you're basically suppressing people who still have questions that need answers,"" said Carissa McGraw, who has joined protests throughout the week. ""You have people who -- at this point -- do not care what authorities say right now.""

Michael Brown killed a week ago

Ferguson, a town of about 22,000 people near St. Louis, entered the national consciousness on August 9 when a white police officer, identified as Darren Wilson, shot and killed and Michael Brown, 18, on a city street during the middle of the day.

Accounts of what happened vary widely. Police said Brown struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon. Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer.

Since then, Ferguson has become a tinder box, with regular street protests, an influx of heavily armed law enforcement officers and intense media coverage.

A new development in the investigation popped up Saturday when a Brown family lawyer, Anthony Gray, said that Michael Baden will conduct a second autopsy on the the teenager's body. Baden is a high-profile pathologist who testified in the O.J. Simpson, Phil Spector and Drew Peterson trials.

Early Saturday morning, before sunrise, a fragile peace was shattered when looters again targeted neighborhood businesses while law enforcement in riot gear largely looked on without intervening.

Some protesters tried to stop the looting, at times standing in front of one convenience store and preventing others from doing more damage. Police, criticized days earlier for being too aggressive with protesters, now drew the ire of merchants who told CNN they weren't doing enough.

""You still have a job to do now, and now you're not doing your job,"" Tanya Littleton said of police after thieves broke into her beauty supply shop in the St. Louis suburb and made off with bags of hair extensions worth hundreds of dollars.

At noon Saturday -- the hour that police say {Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/justice/ferguson-missouri-cop-profile/index.html?hpt=hp_t1""> shot Brown a week earlier -- protesters outside the police station silently raised their arms into the air, mimicking Brown's purported actions right before he died.

Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson joined loud but peaceful crowds that marched in the street carrying signs saying ""Mike Brown is our son"" and ""The whole world is watching Ferguson."" They chanted ""Hands up, don't shoot"" and ""Hey hey, ho ho, killer cops have got to go.""

Looting earlier in the day

The looting began at the Ferguson Market and Liquor store, which has become part of the case. Minutes before Brown was shot, police say, a man fitting his description allegedly stole cigars and roughed up a store clerk as surveillance cameras recorded.

Ferguson police released surveillance video of that robbery on Friday, but then emphasized that Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft, but because Brown and a friend were ""walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.""

Release of the video on Friday angered some, who say police were using it to distract from Brown's killing and make him look bad.

As protesters took to the streets early Saturday, more than two dozen people blocked off the convenience store with cars. Police with riot gear, tactical rifles and armored vehicles were nearby, commanding them through loudspeakers to free it up.

Instead, bottles flew, mayhem erupted, and looters ransacked the store, which the owner had boarded up. It was the first of at least three stores raided.",NA,NA,NA,NA
CNN,cnn40,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/16/us/ferguson-balance-security-first-amendment/,"In tense Ferguson, trying to balance security, protesters' rights",Greg Botelho,08/16/2014,01/13/2016,"On the one hand, there's the need to respect and protect people's constitutional right to congregate and express their opinions. On the other, there's the need to make sure all people and all property are safe and secure.

But, if and when these responsibilities' conflict, where do you draw the line?

That's a question authorities in Ferguson, Missouri, are having to answer this weekend. In fact, they've had to answer it every day and night since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer.

The shooting stirred anger, indignation and emotional, expansive, racially-charged protests. At times, these protests have been followed by looting -- as happened overnight Friday -- and confrontations with police.

""If there was an easy way to separate those who hurt from those who helped, we would. But it's hard,"" Gov. Jay Nixon said. ""And sometimes, especially at night, we can't.""

Acknowledging ""the balance is important"" between maintaining security and protecting the First Amendment right to free speech and peaceable assembly, Nixon on Saturday decided that -- for five hours daily, at least -- security will take precedence. He's instituted a curfew for Ferguson to last between midnight and 5 a.m.

""This is not to silence the people of Ferguson or this region or others, but to contain those who are drowning out the voice of the people with their actions,"" Nixon said. ""We will not allow a handful of looters to endanger the rest of this community.""

His decision stirred instant indignation among many gathered at the community meeting where he announced it. Some screamed out that authorities' priority should be to provide justice to Brown's family, not to clamp down on those calling for it.

Carissa McGraw is one of those protesters who don't think the curfew makes sense, accusing authorities of being focused more on intimidating people than addressing their core concerns and calls for justice. The order might further fuel residents' animosity by giving the implication that police don't trust them to be on the streets.

Beyond that, McGraw simply thinks having a curfew won't work -- and, in fact, might make things worse for community-police relations if it leads to confrontations.

""They're not going to do this,"" McGraw said of people abiding by the curfew. ""You have people who -- at this point -- do not care what authorities say right now.""

Rebuilding trust seen as key

The shooting of Brown spurred animosity among Ferguson residents toward their police force. The fact that Brown was black while the man who shot him, officer Darren Wilson, is white added fuel to the tension.

The police response in the days afterward didn't help, with some criticizing it as too militarized and heavy-handed. Nor did Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson's decision to release video and documents calling Brown the ""primary suspect"" in the robbery of a box of cigars from a convenience store, only to add hours later that this robbery wasn't related to why Wilson confronted the teenager.

Multiple officials -- from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who has been overseeing the security in Ferguson since Thursday -- have spoken about the need to rebuild trust in the community for law enforcement.

But as community members' shouting down of Johnson and the governor at a meeting Saturday illustrated, it hasn't happened yet. Far from it.

The situation did appear to calm significantly Thursday, when Johnson literally and figuratively embraced the protesters rather than confront them. Then came Friday night and early Saturday morning, violence that McGraw said she believes was ""instigated by the police officers themselves (who) were in their militant stance against the people.

""At that point, the people were like, 'Wow, we're supposed to have our freedom. We're supposed to be able to do this. And you're still being very aggressive.' ""

Ex-FBI official: 'No choice' but to have curfew

There are also those who think police weren't aggressive enough as men looted stores around Ferguson overnight Friday. While some activists criticized authorities for using armored vehicles and tear gas in one instance, on the other side store owners ripped police for not stepping in and arresting those responsible.

Not being as aggressive could invite more criminal acts in Ferguson, claims Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and CNN law enforcement analyst.

""If I was a police officer on the street once again in that situation, I'd be scared that the message went out to all the hooligans in the greater St. Louis area, if you need a new TV set or you need something, come to town because we're not going to stop you when you start looting stores,"" Fuentes said.

""That's a horrible message to send.""

In Fuentes' opinion, authorities had ""no choice"" but to institute and enforce a curfew. A full week in, the situation has not gotten much better -- as the unrest overnight Friday shows.

As Cincinnati Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell said, ""There is no excuse for looting to be going on six days later in a community in the United States.""

If people go after more stores, what are police supposed to do? If they throw rocks or Molotov cocktails at police, what's wrong with having them wear riot gear and armored equipment? And, the bottom line, how long can this go on before authorities step in and clear the streets?

If the protesters aim to get their message out and, in so doing, get justice for Michael Brown, then ""we must first have and maintain peace,"" Nixon said. And having a curfew should help in that regard, he argued.

""The eyes of the world are watching,"" the governor added. ""This is a test of (whether) a community -- this community, any community -- can break the cycle of fear, distrust and violence and replace them with peace, strength and ultimately justice.""

Cincinnati chief: Some residents must 'stand up'

Will Ferguson pass that test? Will residents and the police come to see other as being part of the same solution, rather than seeing each other as the problem?

A big part on how that relationship turns out might depend on what happens with officer Wilson, including whether he's charged and/or convicted in Brown's shooting.

But beyond that, the most important thing all parties must do is talk, Blackwell said. Really talk.

""Their needs to be words of healing,"" the Cincinnati police chief said of what police and other officials must express. ""There needs to be a strategic dialogue that is aimed at resolution and reconciliation.""

It's not all on police, though. The people of Ferguson -- especially the leaders among them -- also have a responsibility to speak up, act out and take care of their community, according to Blackwell. That means working with police as partners, not as adversaries, for the common good.

""There needs to be some people that stand up,"" Blackwell told CNN. ""... The people in Ferguson that stand for justice and stand for peace need to be in the trenches with law enforcement, right now.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Protesters locked hand in front of the police line, while some urged the crowd to remain peaceful.

The police presence rose significantly, as did tensions.

Until then, the streets had been calm, as a much smaller crowd milled about, holding signs and chanting.

A few hundred people walked up and down a small area past journalists' cameras. And as hours passed, the crowd thinned down to a few dozen.

""Hands up! Don't shoot"" was their mantra, as it has been every night. But many of the demonstrators added a second chant: ""We protesters, we don't loot.""

Police cars with flashing lights stood by every block of so apart.

Officers in body armor congregated at a car wash alongside an armored vehicle.

Even the police seemed surprised. Said one state trooper. ""Can we be peaceful? That's all I'm saying.""

Things must change

Leaders in the Missouri town insisted earlier Tuesday that things must change. Ten days have passed since a white police officer's shooting of an unarmed black teenager triggered emotional, expansive protests that have increasingly devolved into violence.

The state highway patrol captain tasked with maintaining security characterized what's happened in those 10 days as an embarrassment -- to Ferguson, to Missouri, to the United States.

In a statement Tuesday, Ferguson leaders vowed to rebuild the city's business district, parts of which have been ravaged by looting and unrest. They promised to recruit more African-Americans to join the police in their largely African-American community, a relevant point since the Ferguson Police Department is overwhelmingly white. And they signaled their intention to raise money so that all officers and police cars would be outfitted with vest and dash cams.

Those cameras are significant because they could have helped clear up many questions surrounding Michael Brown's death: Was Brown executed by a police officer while holding his hands in the air, as some activists claim? Or was Brown shot after rushing at Officer Darren Wilson, who fired fearing for his own life, as detailed in an account on a radio show?

Sides remain dug in

Without any known video of that August 9 shooting, both sides remain dug in. The Brown family's supporters are as passionate as ever, some saying they lose more and more trust for law enforcement with every armored truck on the road and tear gas canister fired into the air.

Wilson, meanwhile, has gotten more and more support of his own in recent days.

Supporters held a rally in St. Louis this week, and as of Tuesday, nearly 900 people had donated more than $33,000 to a fund for Darren Wilson, according to a {GoFundMe page}<hyperlink=""https://www.gofundme.com/SupportOfficerWilson""> set up to collect donations.

The situation on the streets of Ferguson itself has deteriorated in many ways.

From Monday into Tuesday, at least 74 people were arrested for failure to disperse. Two others were arrested on weapons charges and another person for interfering with an officer.

In addition to this, two people were shot -- not by police, authorities said. Four officers were injured.

Outside agitators

Police and protesters blamed agitators -- including many from outside Ferguson -- for the shots and violence. According to the jail records, many of those arrested were local residents. Others came from New York, California, Texas and Alabama.

""What we are dealing with right now are two groups of people,"" Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal said. ""One, protesters who are peacefully demonstrating, expressing their First Amendment rights. And then we have a smaller group of people who have been infiltrating themselves in the crowds and creating all of this unrest.""

But many have criticized the police response.

Gen. Russel Honore, who handled crowd control in the chaos that ensued after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, joined them late Tuesday.

""You're there to protect people,"" he told CNN's Don Lemon. ""They need to sense that from you."" Looking at crowd members through the scope of a gun sends the wrong message, he said.

CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes agreed on that point.

""The overall presence was too aggressive,"" he said.

But he agreed with the use of tear gas and rubber bullets.

Looters and hooligans caused trouble that called for the response, he said. They used protesters ""as human shields.""

Demands for prosecution

Many civic leaders worry the unrest is taking away from the main message of the protests: accountability for the officer who shot the 18-year-old Brown.

Brown's parents believe the only real way out of this situation is for Wilson to be charged.

""Justice,"" the late teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told {NBC's ""Today""}<hyperlink=""http://www.today.com/news/michael-browns-mom-justice-will-bring-peace-ferguson-1D80081288""> show. ""Justice will bring peace, I believe.""

A grand jury could begin to hear testimony from witnesses and deciding whether to return an indictment in the case as early as Wednesday. That's the same day that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to visit Ferguson to check in on the Justice Department's civil rights investigation into Brown's death.

The independent autopsy was conducted by high-profile pathologist Michael Baden. Baden testified in the O.J. Simpson, Phil Spector and Drew Peterson murder trials.

Family attorney Daryl Parks did not provide additional details about the preliminary results.

However, the New York Times, reporting on the same independent autopsy, reported that two of the bullets struck Brown in the head. The other four struck him in the right arm -- and all six were fired into his front.

""This is bound to escalate tensions,"" the Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN. ""This is a very provocative report.""

Even before the release of this latest information, the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson has been a racially charged tinderbox.

Clashes once again

Late Sunday night, a day of peaceful protests devolved into a night of gunfire, Molotov cocktails and tear gas.

Officers fired tear gas into a crowd of hundreds of protester, including children, who were marching toward a police command post despite an impending midnight curfew. Authorities also struck at least one defiant protester with rubber bullets.

St. Louis County police said several protesters had thrown Molotov cocktails toward the officers before authorities shot tear gas toward them.

The violence escalated through the night as shots were fired toward police. Officers had to take up a defensive position behind vehicles.

""That is a lie. It was no fight, it was no shots fired,"" a very upset protester, Lisha Williams, told CNN. ""The only ones who fired was police. All we did was march to the command center to fall to our knees and say, 'Don't shoot.' And they started shooting.""

The scene was a far cry from a packed church earlier Sunday, where hundreds of people gathered for a two-hour rally demanding justice for Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager shot dead eight days ago by a white police officer.

""I'm astonished at this reversal of mood,"" Jackson said. ""The mood was so positive.""

Cousin: Brown killed without reason

A cousin of Brown told the church audience that Brown was killed without reason.

""What I want y'all to remember is that Michael Brown was not just some young black boy. He was a human being ... ,"" Ty Pruitt said. ""He was not a suspect. He was not an object. He was not an animal. But that's how he was killed.""

Michael Brown's parents -- Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. -- appeared on stage at the rally at Greater Grace Church with attorney Benjamin Crump but didn't address the audience.

""What we're really asking for is simple justice,"" Crump said. ""We're not asking for anything extraordinary. They just want what anybody else would want if their children were shot down in broad daylight.""

Crump said there would be an independent investigation in addition to the federal and local probes already under way.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson spoke to the 1,300 people in the congregation and said he had a heavy heart.

""The past 24 hours have been tough for me,"" said Johnson, who took over security in the town on Thursday after what many saw as an overly aggressive police response by the local authorities. Johnson said he met with members of the Brown family and was moved to tears.

Protests had turned violent on Saturday night as well after a curfew began. One male was shot overnight Saturday, authorities said. It was unclear how old he was or who shot him. The victim was in critical condition Sunday.

Officials said state highway patrol officers didn't fire any shots. They did fire tear gas to get to the wounded victim, Johnson said early Sunday.

A third autopsy

Brown was shot to death August 9 by a police officer after a confrontation as the teen walked down the street. Accounts of exactly what happened when Officer Darren Wilson stopped Brown vary widely.

Witnesses said they saw a scuffle between the officer and Brown at the police car before the young man was shot. Police said Brown struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon.

Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer.

The renewed tensions came after the preliminary results of an autopsy that Brown's family requested were released, as was a new account of what allegedly happened in the moments immediately before the teenager was killed by a local police officer.

Evidence in the shooting death could be presented to a grand jury as early as Wednesday.

And as the situation in the St. Louis suburb was being watched and talked about across the country, it continued to draw comments from numerous quarters -- including the White House.

""We have all seen images of protesters and law enforcement in the streets. It's clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting. What's also clear is that a small minority of individuals are not,"" said President Barack Obama.

""While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting, or carrying guns, and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos,"" he said, in a call for calm.

""Let's see some understanding"" rather than confrontation, and ""let's seek to heal,"" the President said.

The protests in Ferguson also prompted {Gov. Jay Nixon to call out the National Guard}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/18/us/missouri-ferguson-national-guard/"">.

Officials temporarily detained several people, including news photographer Scott Olson and longtime activist and Holocaust survivor Hedy Epstein.

Dueling narratives

The officer who killed Brown says the teenager rushed at him full speed in the moments before the shooting, according to an account phoned in to a St. Louis radio station and confirmed by a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation.

According to the version on {KFTK}<hyperlink=""http://www.971talk.com/"">, phoned in by a woman who identified herself as ""Josie,"" the altercation on August 9 began after {Officer Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/justice/ferguson-missouri-cop-profile/""> rolled down his window to tell Brown and a friend to stop walking in the street.

When Wilson tried to get out of his cruiser, Brown first tried to push the officer back into the car, then punched him in the face and grabbed for his gun before breaking free after the gun went off once, the caller said.

Wilson pursued Brown and his friend, ordering them to freeze, according to the account. When they turned around, Brown began taunting Wilson, saying he would not arrest them, then ran at the officer at full speed, the caller said.

Wilson then began shooting. The final shot was to Brown's forehead, and the teenager fell two or three feet in front of Wilson, said the caller, who identified herself as the officer's friend.

A source with detailed knowledge of the investigation later told CNN the caller's account is ""accurate,"" in that it matches what Wilson has told investigators.

But accounts of exactly what happened when Wilson stopped Brown vary widely.

Witnesses said they saw a scuffle between the officer and Brown at the police car before the young man was shot. Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer.

Piaget Crenshaw said she was sitting in her home when she witnessed the shooting. She captured video of the aftermath, including images of Brown's body lying in the middle of the street.

Crenshaw said Brown was running away from police and then turned around. She said that was when Brown was shot.

Police provided a different narrative, saying Brown struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon.

Parallel investigations

A grand jury will hear testimony from witnesses and decide on whether to return an indictment in the case, Ed McGee, spokesman for the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, said Monday, stressing there is ""no time line on this case.""

In addition to that proceeding, the Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Brown's death. Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Ferguson this week, to meet with investigators there.

""I realize there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to Michael Brown's death, but I ask for the public's patience as we conduct this investigation,"" the attorney general said in a statement.

""The selective release of sensitive information that we have seen in this case so far is troubling to me. No matter how others pursue their own separate inquiries, the Justice Department is resolved to preserve the integrity of its investigation.""

Autopsy findings

An autopsy conducted for the family of Brown found no evidence that he struggled with Wilson before his death, according to the pathologist in charge of the examination.

Dr. Michael Baden conducted the autopsy after an official examination by the St. Louis County medical examiner's office.

Forensics consultant Shawn Parcells, who assisted Baden, said the findings are consistent with witness reports that Brown may have been shot as he walked away and that he was shot again with his hands up.

The family autopsy found that Brown was shot at least six times, including two shots to his head. Three of the bullets may have re-entered his body, causing additional damage, Baden said.

One of the bullets entered his head and came out through his eye; another -- likely the fatal wound, Baden said -- struck Brown on the top of his head and caused irreparable damage to his brain.

Family attorney Benjamin Crump said Brown probably would have been either kneeling or bending forward when he was struck with those bullets.

Brown had abrasions on his face consistent with falling onto the ground, Baden said.

He cautioned that he needs access to autopsy results, including tests on Brown's clothes and X-rays, before making some conclusions.

But Crump said the autopsy already offered more than ""ample"" evidence to support Wilson's arrest.

""What does this autopsy say? That the witness accounts were true, that he was shot multiple times,"" Crump told reporters.

Attorney General Holder said a third autopsy was being conducted Monday by medical examiners from the U.S. military.

Devolution of protests

Another family attorney, Anthony Gray, implored protesters to remain peaceful.

""I can see that there is a very disturbing divide that is developing in our community,"" he said Monday. ""This is not what we initially came to the community and called for.""

The situation remains so unstable that the {Ferguson-Florissant School District}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/FergusonFlorissantSchoolDistrict""> has canceled classes for the rest of the week.

The Missouri National Guard was in Ferguson under orders from the governor to restore peace.

Nixon issued the order early Monday after what began as peaceful protests spiraled into disarray after two civilians were shot and injured, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said. He said those civilians were not shot by police.

Some protesters hurled Molotov cocktails at police, and several businesses were vandalized or looted despite the Brown family's call for calm.

""Based on these conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response,"" Johnson said.

Officers fired tear gas into hundreds of protesters, including children, who were marching toward a police command post despite an impending midnight curfew.

Two children were treated and released for exposure to tear gas overnight at St. Louis Children's Hospital, according to a spokeswoman there.

Protester Lisha Williams challenged the notion that protesters provoked officers.

""That is a lie. It was no fight, it was no shots fired,"" she told CNN late Sunday. ""All we did was march to the command center to fall to our knees and say, 'Don't shoot.' And they started shooting.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

The city has been in turmoil since August 9, when a white city police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in the middle of a street. Protesters and law enforcement officers have clashed in the streets.

Here are the latest developments for Tuesday:

Another night of violence:

Once again, peaceful protests {gave way to angry confrontations}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/19/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1""> with police late Monday night into early Tuesday. After a handful of protesters threw rocks, bottles and Molotov cocktails, security forces responded with tear gas and stun grenades. Most of the demonstrators, however, tried to keep the peace.

St. Louis County jail officials said at least 77 people were arrested, the vast majority of them on refusal to disperse charges. Some of them came from as far away as New York and California. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, told CNN there were 50 to 60 arrests.

Michael Brown's family:

The late teenager's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told NBC's ""Today"" show that the only way to end the unrest is ""justice"" -- which her family and their supporters have repeatedly tied to the arrest of the police officer who killed Brown.

""Justice will bring peace, I believe,"" McSpadden said.

The family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, also announced that Brown's funeral will be held Monday.

Criminal proceedings:

A grand jury could begin to hear testimony as early as Wednesday from witnesses, according to Ed Magee, a spokesman for the St. Louis County prosecutor's office. They'll ultimately decide whether or not to return an indictment against Darren Wilson, the police officer who killed Brown.

Federal investigation:

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will visit Ferguson on Wednesday, in part to check on the investigation being handled by the Justice Department's civil rights division and the local U.S. Attorney's Office.

In an op-ed in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Holder said that a number of federal prosecutors and about 40 FBI agents have already been tasked with looking into the case. He said that hundreds of people have been interviewed and a team of medical examiners will conduct a second autopsy.

Prosecuting attorney protest:

Dozens protested Tuesday outside the office of St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, demanding that he recuse himself in the case. The Mound City Bar Association -- a Missouri-based organization that calls itself ""one of the oldest black bar associations west of the Mississippi River"" -- did the same in a statement.

Some residents and community leaders claim McCulloch has deep ties to the police and has favored law enforcement in criminal cases.

Yet the prosecutor has given no indications that he'll step away.

School closures:

The situation remains so unstable that the Ferguson-Florissant School District said it is canceling classes for the rest of the week. Two nearby districts -- Jennings and Riverview Gardens -- opted to remain closed again Tuesday as well, {according to CNN affiliate KMOV}<hpyerlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Ferguson-Florissant-School-District-cancels-classes-for-the-rest-of-the-week-271774431.html"">.

In light of the closure, the Ferguson-Florissant School District is offering food assistance -- in the form of sack lunches -- to children and teenagers at five elementary schools between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

The investigation:

St. Louis County police are looking into Brown's shooting. President Obama has the Justice Department, including the FBI, looking into the case as well.

The police officer:

Darren Wilson, 28, who has six years on the force with {no disciplinary issues on his record}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/justice/ferguson-missouri-cop-profile/"">, is on paid administrative leave. If he returns to duty, he would have to undergo two psychological evaluations, authorities said. He was briefly taken to the hospital after the confrontation with Brown for treatment of an injury that left his face swollen, according to the Ferguson police chief.

Wilson has garnered more and more public support in recent days. That includes a rally held for him in St. Louis and a {fundraising effort}<hyperlink=""https://www.gofundme.com/SupportOfficerWilson""> that had raised more than $36,000 from nearly 1,000 people as of Tuesday.

Michael Brown's family:

They've hired lawyers and expressed outrage at how the police have handled things, including Friday's simultaneous release of the officer's name and surveillance video from the day of the shooting that showed a man identified in police documents as Brown roughing up a convenience store clerk while purportedly stealing cigars. The family and critics of the department have accused police of trying to damage Brown's character.",0,NA,NA,NA

While the community searched for answers about the killing, answers were slow to come -- both from city officials and police. The name of the officer who shot Brown was not released until today.

Citizens, exercising their First Amendment right to peaceful assembly, protested. The police have responded with riot gear, military equipment and tear gas -- banned in international warfare, but used more than once in Ferguson.

Against this backdrop, President Obama struck the correct tone, telling the country to ""take a step back to think about how to move forward."" He's tasked both the FBI and Department of Justice with independently investigating Brown's death, and he has spoken with Missouri's Gov. Jay Nixon about the details on the ground in Ferguson.

While there was no direct mention of the role of race in Brown's killing and the protests that ensued, the President emphasized the shared values of all parties involved. He urged the local authorities to be transparent and to protect citizens' rights to peacefully protest. He urged local citizens to refrain from looting or vandalism and to uphold public order. And he urged everyone to start the path to healing from this tragedy.

I do hope that we can begin on this path of healing, but the events in Ferguson are a microcosm of larger forces that pervade American society.

First, initial eyewitness reports from Brown's friends indicate that Brown raised his hands and tried to explain he was unarmed, but the police officer began shooting. The tendency to shoot first, ask questions later -- particularly when dealing with young black men -- is an issue the police force must confront.

Second, the subsequent reluctance of the police to release details about such a grave use of deadly force is of concern. In a democratic society, we need the authorities responsible for protecting us and given authority to apprehend us to be responsive and transparent.

Third, when the community has a grievance with the authorities, the authorities' first response should not be an extreme crackdown, characteristic of autocratic countries like Russia. To send militarized units with combat-like gear and weapons into the heart of a suburban community where protests are occurring, is deeply troubling.

Fourth, the tendency of some in the mainstream media to use pictures of Brown that reinforce a ""thuggish"" stereotype has to stop. The twitter hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown has effectively been used to show how the media could reduce an individual to a stereotype with simply one Facebook picture.

The situation in Ferguson is changing hourly, but there is hope. With Gov. Nixon's decision to take law enforcement duties out of the hands of St. Louis County and put it into the hands of other law enforcement groups, there could be a return to effective law enforcement. I'm glad to hear the President will continue to monitor the situation and offer federal support to ensure a transparent investigation.

When one of our communities experiences tragedy, it deserves answers and it deserves the right to express grievances. I continue to pray for the family and friends of Michael Brown and for a community torn apart to begin to heal.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Some on the right view the indictment as a blatant political ploy.

""This is pure politics, I tell ya. This is really a joke,"" Paul told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Monday.

The former Texas congressman made sure to mention that he doesn't ""generally defend our governor very much,"" saying Perry's record on civil liberties and foreign policy is ""a disaster.""

But in this case, he added, ""the abuse of power comes more from the DA's office than the governor's office.""

The case centers on Perry's June 2013 veto of the $7.5 million budget for the unit run by Lehmberg after she refused his demand to resign following her drunken driving arrest and conviction.

The clearest account yet of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson's version of events was phoned into a national radio show Monday. A woman identified only as ""Josie"" called Radio America's ""The Dana Show"" claiming to be a friend of Wilson's, and gave his side of the story.

A source with detailed knowledge of the case says Josie's version accurately matches what Wilson has told investigators.

CNN has methodically and deliberately vetted this woman's account, and offer it because it squares with officer Wilson's account, whose side of the story really has yet to be told.

In the last week, CNN has brought eyewitness accounts from three individuals from the community who say they saw what happened.

It is in the interest of everyone that we hear the officer's side as well.

Josie says Wilson initially saw Brown and his friend walking in the middle of the street, rolled his window down and told them to get over.

When they wouldn't, ""he pulled up ahead of them, and he was watching them, and then he gets the call in that there was a strong arm robbery, and they give the description. And he's looking at them, they've got something in their hands, it looks like it could be what – the cigars or whatever, so he goes in reverse back to them,"" Josie {told Radio America}<hyperlink=""http://danaloeschradio.com/alleged-friend-of-officer-darren-wilson-offers-his-side/"">.

Police on Friday released video which they say shows Brown committing a strong arm robbery at a convenience store, stealing about $50 worth of cigars, minutes before the shooting.

When Wilson tried to get out of his car, Josie said she believes Brown slammed the door back on him, then a struggle ensued.

""As he stands up, Michael just bum rushes him, just shoves him back into his car, punches him in the face. And then of course Darren grabs for his gun. Michael grabs the gun. At one point he's got the gun totally turned against his hip, and Darren shoves it away. And the gun goes off,"" she said.

But the results of an autopsy requested by Brown's family released Monday do not show any evidence on Brown's body that he and the officer tussled.

""There weren't any signs of a struggle. In talking about a struggle, one of the things that the attorneys have also asked for is the medical examination of the officer,"" medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden told reporters.

That is inconclusive – to really make a ruling on a struggle, the examiners would need to see Wilson's medical report as well.

After the initial shot, the woman claiming to be the officer's friend says Brown tried to flee.

""Michael takes off with his friend, they get to be about 35 feet away and Darren, of course protocol is to pursue. So he stands up and yells 'Freeze!' Michael and his friend turn around, and Michael starts taunting him, 'Oh what are you going to do about it?' You know, 'You're not going to shoot me.' And then he said all the sudden he just started to bum rush him, he just started coming at him full speed, and so he just started shooting, and he just kept coming,"" Josie said.

Chris Christie argued people shouldn’t be quick “to make generalizations.”

“Whatever happened in Ferguson, we have a justice system in this country that will be able to make that judgment, and if there are people who need to be held accountable, I'm confident they will be,” the New Jersey Republican said in a response to a question by WNYC’s Matt Katz.

“But I'm not going to get into this business of generalizing against law enforcement officers. It's not right,” he continued.

His comments Friday came one day after Sen. Rand Paul, another potential presidential candidate, said the police response to the racially-charged street protests in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer was an example of how law enforcement has become too militarized.

In an {opinion piece for Time}<hyperlink=""http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/08/14/rand-paul-on-ferguson-police-too-militarized/"">, the Kentucky Republican wrote that there “should be a difference between a police response and a military response.""

While Paul labeled racial tension a crucial element to the recent unrest, Christie, a former U.S. attorney, did not go that far.

“I think it's very dangerous to make generalizations about anybody like that,” Christie said, referring to the reporter’s question about the relationship between police and African Americans. The governor made his comments in a press conference in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

“We have millions of dedicated men and women who are police officers across this country, who work in grave danger every day, who try to make sure they protect innocent people across the country,” he continued. “So I'm not going to get into this game of generalizing and characterizing people in that way.

""Already based on this limited information, people believe it plays into whatever theory they have about what happened,"" CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter said.

""Because these shots were all in the front apparently, that might lend credence to people's theories that Michael Brown was going after the police officer.

""On the other hand,"" Stelter added, ""the shots were on the arms (and head) on the front. Does that mean his arms were up?""

It's a case, he said, where more information is not necessarily better information.

Therein lies some of the risk.

""This is bound to escalate tensions,"" the Rev. Jesse Jackson said. ""This is a very provocative report.""

Accounts unclear

Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead nine days ago by a white police officer.

His mother asked independent investigators who conducted the autopsy on her son's body whether he felt any pain at the time of his death, according to Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump.

She was told that ""he did not suffer,"" Crump said at Monday's news conference.

Accounts of exactly what happened when Officer Darren Wilson stopped Brown vary widely.

Witnesses said they saw a scuffle between the officer and Brown at the police car before the young man was shot. Police said Brown struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon.

Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer.

Last week, the St. Louis County Police Department said an original autopsy found that Brown, 18, died of gunshot wounds. But the department wouldn't say how many times he was shot or any other details.

""We are not specifying how many gunshot wounds at this point,"" the department said. ""The investigation into his death is still ongoing, and the full autopsy is not likely to be released for many weeks because multiple law enforcement agencies are now involved in the investigation.""

The lack of information prompted Brown's family to request an independent autopsy.

A high-profile pathologist

Enter high-profile forensic pathologist Michael Baden.

He has brought his expertise to the stand in a number of closely watched cases.

Baden testified in the O.J. Simpson, Phil Spector and Drew Peterson murder trials. He was chairman of the committee of pathologists that investigated the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

""Bringing him in is a very big development,"" CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said. ""The family wants to know what happened. And why should they just rely upon on what the authorities to tell them?""

Not shot at close range

According to Baden's autopsy, the bullets that struck Brown were not fired from close range, as indicated by the absence of gunpowder residue on his body.

Some of the bullets left several wounds.

One of the bullets shattered his right eye, traveled through his face, exited his jaw and re-entered at his collarbone, according to the autopsy.

The last two shots were probably the ones to his head, family attorney Anthony Gray said. One entered the top of his Brown's skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when he was struck.

More work to be done

Baden intends to do much more than just the autopsy. He may ask questions about the officer's gun as well.

""Is there only the police officer's DNA on that gun. Or if there was, in fact, a struggle, is Michael Brown's DNA on that gun as well? That would certainly say a lot about whether a struggle for the gun took place.""

Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has approved another autopsy on Brown's body, the Justice Department said. The autopsy will be conducted by a federal medical examiner.",0,NA,NA,NA

The company is most well-known for its taser guns that shock people, but it also makes wearable video cameras used by law enforcement.

Investors are betting that {allegations of heavy-handed police tactics}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-ferguson-police-tactics/?iid=EL""> during the Ferguson conflict will spur sales of the video cameras.

The thinking is simple: If the film is rolling, a record will be made of any officer who engages in police brutality. At the same time, the videos could provide another layer of credibility for police by showing what they are seeing when they are out on patrol.

Interest in equipping police with body cameras has {swelled}<hyperlink=""http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/14/technology/security/cameras-on-cops/?iid=EL""> nationwide. Pilot programs using Taser's products are underway in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Detroit, and London. New York may soon follow suit as a result of scrutiny of its controversial ""stop and frisk"" policing.

Even smaller police departments like Rialto, California, a city of 100,000 with a police force of 115, have {been experimenting}<hyperlink=""http://money.cnn.com/video/technology/2013/08/21/t-police-wearable-cameras-rialto-axon.cnnmoney/?iid=EL""> with Taser's cameras for some time.

Taser is one of only main two companies currently making the cameras. The other, Vievu LLC, is private.

Video police reports: It's not just the cameras that are exciting traders. Taser's service includes software that could make it easy for officers to upload audio and visual evidence. In the future, these videos could replace police reports.

Taser could also benefit from strong demand for its flagship electroshock products, commonly known as taser guns. As municipality budget constraints begin to ease as the economy improves, police departments are more likely to stock up on the devices, according to analysts at Dougherty and Company who cover the company.

Taser guns still make up the bulk of Taser's business.

Despite the recent uptick, Taser's stock is still down over 5% for the year.

Brian Ruttenbur, an analyst at CRT Capital Group, warns that even if the wearable camera movement takes off, there will be fierce competition in the space. What makes Taser unique right now is that the company has a partnership with Amazon ({AMZN}<hyperlink=""http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AMZN&source=story_quote_link"">, {Tech30}<hyperlink=""http://money.cnn.com/technology/tech30/index.html?iid=EL"">), the only company providing private cloud solutions at present.

Once they do, more companies will create camera hardware and link up with them.

Google, for instance, already has its Google Glass device. ""There are multiple companies that can provide an even more robust solution,"" Ruttenbur said.

Furthermore, Ruttenbur argues that police departments are notoriously slow at implementing any sort of new technology.

""Taser wants to replace Taser guns every five years, but police officers keep their weapons for 15, even 20 years,"" he says.

Then there's the police unions, which hold a lot of sway and have vigorously opposed the cameras. ""You talk to any police officer on the street, they do not want video on their bodies,"" Ruttenbur said.",0,996,NA,NA

Looting and vandalism have hit some stores hard, but it's the sustained loss of foot traffic that's hurting eateries like Subway and Quiznos in the protests following {Michael Brown's death}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/18/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1&iid=EL"">.

Both restaurants are located near the police and fire station, which have become the hotbed of police and protester activity.

Kathy Osborn, executive director of the Regional Business Council, said around 25 businesses had been directly impacted by vandalism, but countless more are taking a hit to their sales.

""These are very small communities, and a lot of people don't have cars,"" said Osborn. ""[People usually] walk to get what they need. So going out for a quick trip has a greater impact than it normally would.""

The Subway on South Florissant Road has lost about 60% of its daily revenue -- about $1,000 a day -- since the protests began a week ago.

Ali Rafiq, whose parents have owned the shop for 22 years, said they're being hit so hard because the parking spaces in front of the building are being used by protesters and journalists, leaving few spots for customers.

""It's almost more of an issue to go up to people and ask them to move their car and get backlash,"" said Rafiq. ""It's easier to let them park.""

Plus, many of their regular customers work at area corporations like Emerson Electric and have stayed away since the protests began.

""A lot of people assumed we were closed because of the protesters being right across the street,"" said Rafiq. ""Others were told not to come.""

The Subway's average sales per customer have dropped from about $9 to $3. Protesters are more likely to buy something small in exchange for using the restroom (though they can do so for free) instead of a full meal.

Quiznos, located across the street, has seen a 50% decrease in daily sales.

Keith Green -- whose father, Edward Thomas, owns the shop -- said they're now averaging about 60 to 70 customers a day (instead of their usual 100).

""Tension is high,"" said Green. ""[Customers] don't want to venture over, you don't know what can happen.""

Green said they plan to decrease their weekly food supply order by between $500 and $700.

Cathy's Kitchen, which is located in the same building as Quiznos, said they were closed last Monday, but have been open since and have actually seen an increase in customers.

""It's been very packed,"" said manager (and daughter of the owner) Cathy Jenkins. ""We've been getting a lot of support.""

The restaurant, which is one year old, has had about 400 customers a day instead of its usual 100 to 200.

This could be partly due to an initiative, led by the {North County Incorporated}<hyperlink=""http://northstlouiscounty.com/""> in St. Louis, which has been encouraging people to buy from Ferguson stores.

CNN,cnn55,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/17/politics/missouri-governor-nixon-ferguson/,"Ferguson police were 'aggressive,' a critical Missouri governor says",Leigh Ann Caldwell,08/18/2014,02/19/2016,"Gov. Jay Nixon is criticizing the ""over-militarization"" of the police response to protests that have been spurred by the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

Nixon appeared on most of the political talk shows on Sunday, calling the tactics of the St. Louis County Police ""aggressive"" and expressed relief that the Justice Department is conducting its own investigation into the young man's death on August 9.

""There are times when force is necessary, but we really felt that push at that time was a little aggressive, obviously, and those images were not what we were trying to get to,"" he said on ABC's ""This Week,"" referring to the policing using heavily armored military vehicles.

""And in those situations where folks are rolling up heavily armored and they're pointing guns at folks, that's impossible to have a dialogue,"" Nixon said.

The governor, however, offered praise for members of the community who have been protesting Brown's killing during an encounter with police.

Despite a shooting that left one person wounded and the arrest of seven people after a midnight curfew went into effect Saturday night, Nixon said the curfew was implemented peacefully and mostly without incident.

""Thousands of people spoke last night. Thousands of people marched and not a single gunshot fired by a member of law enforcement last night, and the members of community (were) tremendous helpful last night to get through what could have been a very difficult night,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

After days of heavily armed police patrolled the streets of Ferguson with a heavy hand and periodic use of force, Nixon ordered Missouri State Highway Patrol to take over the police response on Thursday.

The head of the Highway Patrol, Capt. Ronald Johnson, is African-American and from the area. He took a different approach than police and dramatically softened the aggressive stance.

Critical words about harsh tactics

Nixon is the latest politician to criticize police tactics that created a war zone atmosphere in Ferguson, a town of 22,000 near St. Louis.

Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said Thursday the situation needs to be ""demilitarized,"" and on the same day, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is considering a presidential run, {released an opinion piece}<hyperlink=""http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/08/14/rand-paul-on-ferguson-police-too-militarized/?iref=allsearch""> on Time's website saying many police departments around the country are too militarized.

Democratic Rep. Lacy Clay, who represents Ferguson in Congress, said on ""State of the Union"" Sunday that ""a militarized police force facing down innocent protesters with sniper rifles and machine guns is totally unacceptable in America.""

U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, also agreed that the reaction of police to protests was imbalanced.

""It appears that they may have reacted a little quickly on that force continuum when they decided to deal with ... the protesters,"" he said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""

While Bernard Kerik, a former New York City Police commissioner, said the show of force was too excessive while protestors peacefully demonstrated, he said the police have a responsibility to protect personal property.

""You can't let thugs take over the city. We saw that the other day. The police had to respond,"" he said on CNN, referring to instances of looting.

On police militarization in general, Kerik said the increased militarization of the police started in the 1990s during the height of the war on drugs and continued after the 9/11 attacks and has continued because of mass shootings in schools and public places.

""It's absolutely needed,"" he said.

Accounts of exactly what happened when Officer Darren Wilson confronted Brown on August 9 vary widely. Police said Brown struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon. Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer.

Nixon also criticized the Police Department's release of a convenience store surveillance video that shows a man fitting Brown's description allegedly stealing a box of cigars just before Brown was killed.

Nixon said he was ""unaware"" the tape was going to be released and ""we certainly were not happy.""

Nixon said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" that the tape release is an attempt to ""besmirch a victim"" and ""to tarnish him.""

""It appeared to, you know, cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street,"" he added on ""This Week.""

Nixon also raised doubts about the special prosecutor in charge of the case, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, who has been asked by Ferguson community leaders, including Rep. Clay, to step aside because of what people say is his impartiality toward the police.

""He's an experienced prosecutor. And this is his opportunity to step up,"" Nixon said on CNN of McCulloch, who has been in the position since 1991. ""It's important we get this right. This is a big matter.""

McColloch has defended the police response and slammed Nixon for sidelining the Police Department and putting the Highway Patrol in charge of security, calling the move ""shameful,"" {according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/gov-nixon-gives-police-control-of-ferguson-situation-to-missouri/article_0806541b-ed48-5d06-9267-323531ad6cf1.html"">.

Offering little confidence to the local investigation, Nixon said he is pleased that the Justice Department is conducting its own parallel inquiry, noting that the FBI is sending 40 investigators.

""That's the kind of independent, external, national review and investigation of this that I think will assist everyone in making sure we get to justice,"" he said.

Nixon's criticism of the Police Department and shaky confidence of the local prosecutor Sunday comes as the Department of Justice announced a {second, independent autopsy would be conducted on Brown's body.}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/17/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1"">

The healing process

As the people of Ferguson seek answers and demand a fair investigation, the factor of race has once again become part of a national discussion that cuts deeply.

""We all know there's been a long history of challenges in these areas (of Missouri),"" Nixon said. ""And our hope is that, with the help of the people here, that we can be an example of getting justice and getting peace and using that to move forward.""

But Nixon admitted that it will be a challenge because of ""deep, long-term wounds"" that won't be easy to heal.

Actor and activist Jesse Williams discussed a dark history that black Americans face.

""Police have been beating the hell out of black people for a very, very, very long time before the advent of the video camera and despite the advent of the video camera there are still a lot of incredible trend of police brutality and killing in the street and justice is never served,"" said the ""Grey's Anatomy"" actor and board member of the civil rights organization The Advancement Project.

On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, who was an instrumental figure in the civil rights movement, called on the police chief and Ferguson's mayor to ""literally apologize to the community.""

Michael Eric Dyson, professor at Georgetown University, said he wants more leadership from President Barack Obama, the country's first black President who was a community organizer in predominately African-American neighborhoods of Chicago.

""This President knows better than most what happens in poor communities that have been antagonized historically by the hostile relationship between black people and the Police Department,"" he said on CBS. ""We need presidential leadership. He needs to step up to the plate and be responsible.""

But beyond the signs, marchers and tear gas, there's the pain and grief of a family. It's a pain Sybrina Fulton knows all too well.

""I wish I had a word of automatic comfort, but I don't,"" she writes in an open letter to Brown's parents.

Fulton has been there. She, too, lost a son in a shooting death that also triggered protests and outrage.

Her son was Trayvon Martin.

""But Michael is much more than a police/gun violence case; Michael is your son.""

Two and a half years ago on February 27, 2012, Fulton's son was shot and killed in Florida by George Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watch captain. The case quickly drew national attention as weeks went by without formal charges.

President Barack Obama publicly addressed the case, as he has in the Brown shooting.

Sybrina Fulton knows the pain of losing a son.
Sybrina Fulton knows the pain of losing a son.
And as is the case with the Brown shooting, protests in support of Trayvon and his family spread nationwide.

Zimmerman was charged on April 11, 2012. Then in July of 2013, he was found not guilty of second degree murder.

In the Brown shooting, a grand jury may begin to hear testimony as early as Wednesday and decide on whether to return an indictment against the police officer who killed him, Darren Wilson.

Claims of character assassination

Meanwhile, key questions in the case remain unanswered and a debate over what we do know plays out in public.

Police have released video of Brown taking part in an alleged convenience store robbery, and a purported friend of the Wilson called into a local radio station claiming that Brown attacked the officer and disobeyed an order to freeze. It's an account that a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation later told CNN matches what Wilson himself has told investigators.

However, both the video and the account of events contrast sharply with what witnesses and family members have said about the incident and Brown's character.

Perhaps in reference to this public debate, Fulton writes the Browns will ""hear character assassinations about Michael which I am certain you already have.""

She adds, ""This will incense and insult you. All of this will happen before and continue long after you have had the chance to lay your son to rest.""

""Honor your son and his life, not the circumstances of his alleged transgression,"" Fulton writes. ""I have always said that Trayvon was not perfect. But no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed.""

Fulton pledges that ""neither of their lives shall be in vain"" and ends her letter with a fiery call to action. ""If they refuse to hear us, we will make them feel us.""

""Some will mistake that last statement as being negatively provocative. But feeling us means feeling our pain; imagining our plight as parents of slain children. We will no longer be ignored.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Ferguson certainly isn't the first time the troops have been called up to quell civil unrest.

According to the U.S. Constitution, the militia can be deployed ""to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions."" And both the president and governors can call up the troops.

Here's a look at other times National Guard members have stepped in during civil turmoil:

WHAT: Hurricane Katrina

WHEN: 2005

WHY: In addition to assisting with rescues, National Guard members were called in to help support local law enforcement.

Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who led Task Force Katrina, said National Guard troops ""were positioned on every block to establish a sense of safety and source of help for the people in need.""

The storm that led to 1,833 deaths also spawned tumult, particularly in New Orleans.

Officers told CNN at the time they lacked manpower and steady communications to properly do their jobs. They said they needed help to prevent the spread of looting and violence that were prevalent in the city.

Honoré said about 50,000 National Guard members responded to Katrina. They ""did not leave communities till people were safe and sound,"" {he wrote}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/14/opinion/honore-sandy-recovery/"">.

WHAT: Los Angeles riots

WHEN: 1992

WHY: When four police officers were acquitted after the beating of Rodney King, a series of riots over five days left more than 50 people dead and a city wracked with racial tensions.

Like in Ferguson, the Los Angeles conflict started with the controversial treatment of a black man by white police. After King led officers on a high-speed chase, he was struck more than 50 times with police batons and suffered 11 fractures.

More than 9,800 California National Guard troops were dispatched to help restore order. Unlike with Ferguson, where Missouri National Guard troops were summoned by the governor, President George H.W. Bush called the Guard into federal service during the Los Angeles riots.

The LA riots marked the most recent time the National Guard was federalized, National Guard spokesman Jeremy Webster said.

WHAT: Kent State University rally

WHEN: 1970

WHY: About 100 Ohio National Guardsmen were called to Kent State in Ohio to disperse an angry crowd of students protesting the Vietnam War.

Guard members fired tear gas, and some students said they were surprised the guardsmen followed them as they ran away.

After several standoffs, 28 Ohio guardsmen fired into the crowd for 13 seconds, wounding nine students and killing four.

The shootings led to a national protest involving more than 4 million students.

WHAT: Little Rock high school desegregation

WHEN: 1957

WHY: In perhaps the most controversial state deployment of National Guard members, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus called on troops to block nine black students from attending Little Rock Central High School.

""That's when I knew that they were just not going to let me go to school ... that they were not there to protect me, too, like the other students,"" {recalled Elizabeth Eckford}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/US/9709/24/little.rock/"">, one of the ""Little Rock Nine."" She was 15 at the time.

The nine black students were taunted and spat upon by a white mob when they attended school.

President Dwight Eisenhower eventually sent more than 1,010 federal troops to Little Rock to ensure compliance with court-ordered integration.

WHAT: Whiskey Rebellion

WHEN: 1794

WHY: A popular uprising broke out against a federal excise tax on liquor and the stills that produced it.

After Pennsylvania's governor said he didn't have enough militia to enforce compliance, Secretary of War Henry Knox called for more than 12,000 troops from Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

But it took two months to get the troops to western Pennsylvania. By the time they reached Pittsburgh, the uprising had been pacified.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Some of the equipment may be military surplus that came from the federal government through a program from the Defense Department's Defense Logistics Agency, which provides military equipment to local police departments across the country.

The DLA's law enforcement support program was created in 1999. ""This is a program legislated by Congress which allows the secretary to transfer some excess military property to local law enforcements,"" said Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby on Tuesday.

Kirby said since 2007 the Ferguson Police Department has received two Humvees, one generator, and one cargo trailer. Over the same time period, the St. Louis County Police Department received six pistols, 12 rifles, 15 weapon sites, an explosives disposal robot, three helicopters, seven Humvees (two used by Ferguson Police), and two night-vision devices.

""It's still up to local law enforcement to determine how and when and where and under what circumstances they use excess military equipment,"" said Kirby, but Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ""has been mindful of the public debate and discussion about this issue and asked his staff this morning about some additional information about this program.""

According to Kirby, Hagel has received an information paper with more details on the program, but has yet to order a formal review. Hagel wants a better understanding of the law and regulations governing the transfer program and what parts of that program are the responsibility of the Defense Department.

The program has been in place for several years with little controversy and attention, but has grabbed the national spotlight with the unrest in Ferguson, where police have used what looks like tactical military gear and vehicles, although it's not clear what equipment may have actually come from Pentagon inventories.

Pentagon officials say a key issue for the department is the fact that once the equipment is transferred, the military has no control over how a local agency uses it.

Many police departments also get funding for military-style equipment from Homeland Security and the Justice Department, which operate programs aimed at beefing up police capability in the event of a terrorist attack.

President Barack Obama called for a review of the program on Monday. ""I think it's probably useful for to us review how the funding has gone, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars to make sure that what they are purchasing is stuff that they actually need.

Of at least 78 people arrested overnight, about one in four came from outside the St. Louis area, according to the St. Louis County jail.

Nearly all the arrests were for refusal to disperse. Two people, both locals, were charged with unlawful use of a weapon. And one man, from Rockton, Illinois, was charged with interfering with an officer.

Among those arrested are residents of Chicago, Brooklyn, Washington, San Francisco, Austin, Des Moines, and Huntsville, Alabama, according to jail records.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson -- who is in charge of security in Ferguson -- had a lower number of arrests, telling CNN there were 50 and 60 late Monday and into Tuesday.

""There are some outsiders, but there are (also) a lot of people who live here,"" Johnson told CNN on Tuesday. ""... So we can't blame (everything) on outside agitators.""

Some say the arrests do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. In recent days, numerous people including journalists have faced arrests after what they described as taking part in a peaceful protest or simply observing it.

People from around the country and even other parts of the world have come to Ferguson to express outrage over the {police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/ferguson-michael-brown-shooting-5-things/index.html"">.

But all sides agree there are a select number of people -- distinct from the majority of protesters -- who are fomenting violence.

""There is a dangerous dynamic in the night. It allows a small number of agitators to hide in the crowd and then attempt to create chaos,"" Johnson said late Monday.

""Protesters are peaceful and respectful,"" he said. ""Protesters don't clash with police. ... It is criminals who throw Molotov cocktails and fire shots that endangers life and property.""

Those stirring up trouble are ""fools,"" said State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal. ""They are a disgrace to this entire movement.""

""What we are trying to address is the intimidation and harassment of police officers onto young people,"" she told CNN. But by shooting guns, throwing Molotov cocktails, and looting stores, these so-called agitators are making conditions unsafe and spurring a crackdown by authorities. ""It completely changes the narrative,"" she said Monday.

""We don't need these antagonizers out here,"" said protester Jerrell Bourrage, who said he grabbed a bottle-hurling demonstrator and told him to stop. ""We need people who can stand out here to the side and still let your word be known.""

Michael Brown's parents spoke out against the violence Tuesday. ""It is a distraction, but we won't let it distract us to the point where we lose focus,"" Lesley McSpadden told NBC's ""Today."" ""We have to remain focused and we have to remain strong and the violence needs to stop. When justice has prevailed, it may regain the trust in the locals, but right now it's really out of control.""

Participants in the protests also blame the authorities for violence. Police have fired tear gas and used stun grenades, angering some who believe the tactics are too heavy-handed and a sign of the dangers of {police militarization.}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-ferguson-police-tactics/"">

The situation presents a difficult challenge for police, said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director who is now a CNN law enforcement analyst. The ""normal, after-midnight clientele of the police -- these hooligans"" mix in with the crowd, he said. ""So, that is what the police have to contend with.""

The police tried putting away the heavy weaponry at one point last week, Fuentes noted. But then, as late night violence broke out in recent days, ""they had no alternative, and they brought them back out.""

But quelling these protests will require a political and judicial solution, he said. ""The political and justice in this country need to find a way out of this that convinces people the right things will be done,"" he said.

The incidents bring the total number of journalists arrested during the mid-August protests to 11.

Other journalists reported being threatened with arrest and affected by tear-gas on Monday night. Authorities tried to restrict members of the news media to a designated area away from the protests, sometimes nicknamed a ""press pen.""

The latest arrests came on the same day that President Barack Obama reaffirmed his support for journalists on the ground in Ferguson. ""Let me also be clear that our constitutional rights to speak freely, to assemble, and to report in the press must be vigilantly safeguarded, especially in moments like these,"" the President said at a Monday afternoon news conference.

A couple of hours later, Getty Images photographer Scott Olson was arrested. Getty, one of the main suppliers of photos to news outlets around the world, immediately condemned the police action.

Olson was released without charge after a few hours. Pancho Bernasconi, Getty's vice president for news, said in a statement that Olson later told him: ""I want to be able to do my job as a member of the media and not be arrested for just doing my job.""

Kerry Picket, a reporter for the conservative website Breitbart News, {was arrested}<hyperlink=""http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/19/breitbart-news-reporter-arrested-in-ferguson/""> around the same time as Olson. She was held for ""several hours,"" the website said.

""Picket was released when it was discovered that the trooper misunderstood directions from his superiors and was told to not allow vehicle traffic through but to allow foot traffic through. Both the arresting officer and his lieutenant apologized to Picket,"" Breitbart News added.

The first arrests of journalists came last Wednesday when Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post and Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post were arrested inside a McDonald's in Ferguson. They were released 45 minutes later without being charged. Three other reporters were detained for a few minutes on Sunday night.

Last week, a number of press advocacy groups decried the initial spate of arrests. The American Society of News Editors called it a ""top-down effort to restrict"" First Amendment rights; the group's president, David Boardman said ""the police have made conscious decisions to restrict information and images coming from Ferguson.""

Of course, Boardman added, ""For every reporter they arrest, every image they block, every citizen they censor, another will still write, photograph and speak.""

Three journalists from German newspapers were also taken into custody on Monday evening. Two of them, {Ansgar Graw and Frank Herrmann of the newspaper Die Welt}<hyperlink=""http://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article131363772/Der-Tag-an-dem-die-US-Polizei-mein-Feind-wurde.html"">, were detained for three hours and then released without any charges.

""I've been in several conflict zones: I was in the civil war regions in Georgia, the Gaza strip, illegally visited the Kaliningrad region when travel to the Soviet Union was still strictly prohibited for westerners, I've been in Iraq, Vietnam and in China, I've met Cuba dissidents. But to be arrested and yelled at and be rudely treated by police? For that I had to travel to Ferguson and St. Louis in the United States of America.""

Another German reporter, Lukas Hermsmeier of the newspaper Bild, was arrested early Tuesday morning, along with Ryan Devereaux, a reporter for The Intercept, an online news start-up best known for covering NSA mass surveillance.

Hermsmeier and Devereaux met Monday when they were seated in the same row on a flight to Missouri.

John Cook, {the editor in chief of The Intercept}<hyperlink=""https://theintercept.com/2014/08/19/intercept-reporter-detained-covering-ferguson-protests/"">, said it was unknown why Devereaux was detained.

""But needless to say, it's an outrage that he was stopped and handcuffed by police in the course of lawfully doing his job on the streets of Ferguson,"" Cook said.

Devereaux's last Twitter message before the arrest came around 2 a.m. ET Tuesday. ""So much smoke in this neighborhood right now, seems like the police succeeded in clearing out the rest of the demonstrators,"" he wrote.

He said around 9:45 a.m. that he had been released. ""Out of jail. Too many still in there,"" he wrote.

Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said at a news conference early Tuesday morning that 31 people had been arrested amid Monday night's protests.

When asked about the journalists, he said, ""In the midst of chaos, when officers are running around, we're not sure who's a journalist and who's not. And yes, if I see somebody with a $50,000 camera on their shoulder, I'm pretty sure. But some journalists are walking around and all you have is a cell phone because you're from a small media outlet.

CNN,cnn63,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/19/opinion/dansky-militarization-police/,The real reason Ferguson has military weapons,Kara Dansky,08/19/2014,02/19/2016,"It used to be billy clubs, fire hoses and snarling German shepherds. Now it's armored personnel carriers and flash-bang grenades. The weaponry has changed, but the target is still the same.

If some of the photos from Ferguson last week were in black and white, you might confuse them with scenes from the 1950s south. White police officers beating black protestors. Young black men lying face down in the street with police officers standing over them with assault rifles.

We have a long history of aggressively policing communities of color in America. Police have treated black and brown people like the enemy for decades. In that context, the recent events in Ferguson in the wake of Michael Brown's shooting come as no surprise. But they go way beyond Ferguson.

What we're witnessing is the militarization of policing, and it has become commonplace in towns across America.

Every year, the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Justice funnel billions' worth of dollars and military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies to help them amass arsenals of combat-ready weaponry, according to our report ""War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing."" Two of the armored vehicles patrolling St. Louis right now were purchased with these federal funds. An estimated 600 police departments have received Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, which are tanks built to withstand armor-piercing roadside bombs. In the years since the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, this sort of federal funding has only become more available for state and local police departments.

We're told that part of the impetus for the federal agencies is to get rid of surplus military equipment. But that's certainly not the whole reason.

At least one third of the wartime weapons flowing to state and local police departments are brand new. The better explanation is that the militarization of state and local police is a deliberate strategy funded by the federal government to aggressively fight the failed ""war on drugs."" As has always been true of the war on drugs, the battlegrounds are disproportionately in communities of color.

This deliberate strategy explains why almost 80% of the paramilitary raids we studied were to search homes (usually for drugs); why SWAT teams forced their way into people's homes using military equipment like battering rams 60% of the time; and why they were 14 times more likely to deploy flash-bang grenades, originally invented to ambush wartime enemies, in drug raids than during SWAT raids for other purposes.

And just has been true for decades, our police's most aggressive tactics are doing disproportionate damage to communities of color. Overall, 54% of people impacted by the paramilitary searches were people of color. Dumping weapons and equipment designed for overseas combat into local neighborhoods is only adding dangerous fuel to the fire of aggressive policing.

It might be tempting to think that the brutal tactics we've seen are the result of a few bad police officers. It might be comforting to think this is a fluke. And that might be partially true. But when the government arms cops like soldiers, trains them in counter-insurgency tactics, tells them they are fighting an enemy, we should expect this type of combustive, tragic result.

But that doesn't mean we should accept the status quo. We need to change it.

It's time for Congress to rein in its support for programs like the Department of Defense's 1033 program that allows the Pentagon to dole out weapons and stop the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security from handing out cash to police departments.

Cutting this funding is part of a larger recognition that aggressively fighting the war on drugs has failed to abate drug use and instead done incredible damage to communities. The federal government must recognize that the funding currently going toward this war can and should be spent on more effective interventions like drug and mental health treatment and housing.

Concurrently, state and local governments should constrain the ability of law enforcement to raid people's homes and police neighborhoods using wartime weapons and tactics. Part of the reason this hasn't happened yet is that many people were simply unaware of how militarized our police have become. The events in Ferguson should dispel any illusions people may have about that.

It's time for the federal government to stop financing a siege on communities of color.",NA,NA,NA,NA

1. Missouri rivalry in play amid Ferguson shooting fallout

Jonathan Martin of The New York Times suggests we keep an eye on two Missouri political power players as the fallout over the Ferguson police shooting plays out.

Gov. Jay Nixon and Sen. Claire McCaskill don’t care much for each other, Jonathan reports.

“You've seen a few hints of this in the past few days in the coverage of the Ferguson story,” said Martin, who believes Ferguson may receive a presidential visit in the not-too-distant future. So will the Missouri politicians play nice then? Not so fast.

“Watch the body language. Watch those two. They basically are the big Democratic figures in that state. And there's a lot of folks in the same state on the same party, they don't get along so well.”

2. Hoping to “Akin’ McConnell in Kentucky

Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post took us inside the tight Kentucky Senate race, specifically a tactical effort the Democratic campaign hopes lures GOP incumbent Sen. Mitch McConnell into a gaffe.

Democratic contender Allison Lundergan Grimes is highlighting differences with McConnell on issues important to women voters.

“What she wants to talk about isn't abortion. It's certainly not Hobby Lobby, because the state she's running in [is] very conservative, fairly religious. She wants to talk about the Violence Against Women's Act, as well as equal pay for equal work,” said Henderson, who added that the Grimes’ camp hopes the constant pressure on McConnell to answer questions about those and other issues will provoke some kind of stumble.

3. A big 2016 week, or is Hamby just hungry?

Leave it to CNN’s Peter Hamby to notice a very busy political week in his favorite place for barbeque: South Carolina.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are heading to South Carolina in the days ahead.

“Rand Paul is going to be in South Carolina raising money for Congressman Mick Mulvaney, Marco Rubio is going to be headed to the Third District, probably the most conservative district in the state, speaking to conservative activists at a BBQ hosted by Congressman Jeff Duncan,” said Hamby.

4. In courting the establishment, Paul is persistent.

Politico’s Maggie Haberman shared inside details of Rand Paul’s latest attempt to win big supporters in the GOP establishment.

Yes, the buzz about the recent Paul sighting in the Hamptons was that he was with actor Alec Baldwin. But Maggie reports a much more important breaking of the bread: dinner with several longtime GOP establishment donors at the home of former Treasury Department official Emil Henry.

To be fair, though, notes Haberman, “It was a meet and greet. It was not a fundraiser. He is not a first date candidate .. for a lot of these donors.""

5. Ohio roots and a thick Rolodex, but does he have what it takes?

Add Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman to the list of  potential  2016 presidential prospects who are getting more active in testing their viability.

Portman was in Colorado this weekend campaigning in that state’s big Senate race, and is due in New Hampshire this week to campaign with GOP candidate Scott Brown. And that’s not all, Portman also will take part in a big presidential tradition in New Hampshire: a politics and eggs breakfast discussion

Many in the party dismiss Portman’s chances, suggesting he is too soft spoken or too moderate. But those close to Portman see a “center-right” void in the current GOP early pack.

And he has a deep Rolodex of friends, ranging from Dick Cheney and Mitt Romney to former New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg and a host of veteran GOP activists in the lead-off presidential primary state.",49,2,NA,NA
CNN,cnn65,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/18/opinion/robbins-ferguson-shooting/,Enough! We need answers on Ferguson shooting,Mel Robbins,08/19/2014,02/19/2016,"What's going on in Ferguson? It's been nine days since Michael Brown was killed, and his family is still waiting for information from investigators about what happened to their young man.

Eyewitnesses and cell phone videos recount the minutes after his death --before Brown lay dead for five hours, uncovered in the street -- but the state can't provide the family with any information?

No state autopsy reports. No witness statements. No grand jury indictment. No nothing. There's something seriously wrong here.

Imagine having to conduct an autopsy on your son while his body lies in a funeral home so you can know how he died before you bury him.

The Ferguson Police Department was implicated in racial profiling in a 2013 Attorney General of Missouri report, so how can anyone possibly think they would want to investigate one of their own in a shooting? The FBI should have been on hand from the beginning.

While the National Guard is deploying to Ferguson, I implore local law enforcement to deploy common sense -- withdraw from the investigation.

State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, appointed to coordinate security operations, has been a tremendously important presence in the community and now we need the same on the prosecutorial side. The attorney general should immediately appoint a special prosecutor working jointly with the Justice Department.

The community needs this.

The first and ""very preliminary"" autopsy results have just been released, and they paint a very grim picture of how Michael Brown died: He was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, according to acclaimed pathologist Dr. Michael M. Baden, who conducted the autopsy at the request of Michael Brown's family. (Let that sink in, the family had to hire a private pathologist to get answers.)

At least one of the bullets appear to have entered and exited several times, shattering Brown's right eye, traveling through his face, leaving through the jawbone and re-entering through his collarbone, said Baden. The final shot was apparently the fatal one, which hit Brown on the top of the head.

With 50 years of experience (he has conducted some 20,000 autopsies), Baden spoke with calming authority about his findings; he said that the state medical examiner was a trusted colleague who would likely make very similar findings. But since Baden did not have access to Michael Brown's clothing (to examine gun powder residue), or X-rays, or witness statements, or toxicology reports (and I can't help but wonder why he wasn't given access to this), he could not respond to the calls for justice in Ferguson.

He said that Brown was shot from anywhere between one foot and 30 feet away. He said bullet wounds to Brown's arms could have been sustained by Brown putting his hands up or making a defensive gesture by crossing his arms. From where I sit, six bullets pumped into an unarmed kid in broad daylight is excessive force.

But that only moves us slightly closer to truth. The eyewitness' accounts vary so widely -- and eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable, often refuted by the scientific evidence produced at trial. At least one witness, Piaget Crenshaw, told CNN that it ""looked as if"" the officer tried to pull Brown into the car, then was ""chasing after the boy"" until Brown turned around and was shot.

But others say Brown was shot in the back.

At the moment, the case hinges on the accounts of two conflicting witnesses: Dorian Johnson and Officer Darren Wilson.

Johnson was walking with Brown when the shooting occurred and {gave this account, reported by MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri"">:

Johnson said a police officer approached as he and Brown were walking in the middle of the street and told them to use the sidewalk. They complied, and the officer began to drive away, but then threw his car into reverse and came back alongside the teens, nearly hitting them.

Johnson said he heard Wilson say something like ""What'd you say?"" before trying to open his car door and slamming it into Brown. Then, Johnson said, the officer reached out and grabbed Brown by the neck with his left hand. The two men struggled briefly, and then Wilson, still in his car, shot Brown once, Johnson said.

Johnson said that he and Brown ""took off running together,"" but Brown was shot a second time ""striking him in the back,"" he said. After the second shot, Brown turned around, putting his hands in the air and saying, ""I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!"" according to Johnson. He said that Wilson then approached Brown and fired several more shots until he ""crumbled into a fetal position.""

As the news conference for the autopsy was taking place, a caller to a St. Louis radio station, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" told listeners she knew Wilson's side of the story. Here is a summary of what she said:

He says the boys were walking in the street, Wilson rolled the window down and told them to get out of street.

Wilson may have called for backup when he pulled over.

He heard the call for the strong armed robbery and saw the teens carrying something that might have been cigars.

He pulled over and when he tried to get out of the car, twice he was pushed back into the car by Michael Brown. Brown then punched him in the face and Wilson reached for his gun.

Brown grabbed the gun and at one point had the gun pushed again Wilson's hip so Wilson pushed the gun away and the gun went off.

Brown and his friend ran and Wilson got out of the car and pursued. He told them to freeze and Brown and his friend turned around.

Brown started to taunt him, then bum rushed Wilson, coming at him full speed. Wilson started shooting.

Wilson said the final shot was in the forehead and Brown fell two or three feet in front of the officer.

A source with detailed knowledge of the investigation into the shooting told CNN that ""this account is accurate.""

Where witness accounts differ, an autopsy can provide certainty, as it will allow us to recreate the crime scene and -- with certainty -- know how far apart the men where, what Brown was doing when he was shot and whether he ever had his hand on Wilson's gun.

There was one important question that Baden could answer for certain. Michael's mother wanted to know whether her son had suffered when he died. Baden assured her that the bullet to the head had rendered him unconscious and in his opinion ""he had not suffered.""

I hope the local authorities recuse themselves from the investigation and turn it over to a special prosecutor with the attorney general. And for crying out loud, hurry up and complete the three autopsies, the investigation and the grand jury proceedings.

Tom Fuentes, a CNN law enforcement analyst, notes that just a few days ago, authorities were out on the streets shaking hands with marchers. Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol ""was like Gandhi, promising to ensure their safety,"" Fuentes said.

But growing violence -- amid protests over the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown by a police officer -- changed the situation.

""Given these deliberate, coordinated and intensifying violent attacks on lives and property in Ferguson, I am directing the highly capable men and women of the Missouri National Guard ... in restoring peace and order to this community,"" Gov. Jay Nixon said in a statement Monday.

Police in the Ferguson area, just like many all over the country, have military equipment, {which they used last week}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-ferguson-police-tactics/"">. So why bring in the Guard at all?

""You don't want extremely tired, fatigued, overtaxed police officers out there day after day, night after night,"" Fuentes said. And state patrol officers who came in from out of town and are staying in hotels, working around the clock, are surely getting fatigued as well, he said.

""You don't need more military equipment; it's more of a manpower issue.""

But there are other reasons it may make sense to replace police on the scene, analysts say.

Members of the National Guard may better follow a ""unified chain of command,"" said Jason Fritz, an Army veteran and senior editor of War on the Rocks, which analyzes national security issues.

In this case, that could be a big improvement. ""I've never seen such a disjointed police effort as this,"" Fuentes said.

Nixon said the Guard will assist Col. Ron Replogle, head of the State Highway Patrol, ""in restoring peace and order to this community.""

In a later statement, Nixon said the Guard's ""immediate and limited responsibilities"" are to ""provide protection, and ensure the safety of our Unified Command Center, which was the target last night of a coordinated attack. The Guard will concentrate its resources on carrying out this limited mission.""

""With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard.""

If military police are among the Guard troops, they'll have special training in crowd control that may help, Fritz says.

Fuentes rejects that idea, saying National Guard troops' training does not prepare them for situations like this. ""It's not their mission to do local law enforcement,"" he said.

But Fuentes and Fritz agree on another big reason it might make sense to bring in the National Guard: Residents are fed up with police.

Marchers have accused police of responding with disproportionate violence against a mostly peaceful crowd. And residents have described protesters helping protect stores from being looted while police did nothing.

Police also infuriated protesters by {releasing a video}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html""> that they said shows Michael Brown involved in a convenience store robbery -- even though police themselves have said it does not relate to the police officer having stopped Brown as he was walking down the street.

By bringing in National Guard troops, Nixon is moving both Ferguson and St. Louis County police out of the way.

""That might be enough,"" Fritz said.",NA,NA,NA,NA
CNN,cnn67,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/19/us/missouri-teen-shooting-holder/,Holder to Missouri in bid to ease tensions over Brown shooting,Evan Perez,08/19/2014,02/19/2016,"After years of causing angst for White House political aides by delving into issues of race, Attorney General Eric Holder is heading to Ferguson, Missouri, as President Barack Obama's top emissary.

The trip on Wednesday to the St. Louis suburb now in the spotlight represents the latest effort by the Obama administration to find a way to calm racial tensions following the police shooting of Michael Brown, 18.

Under Holder, the first black attorney general, the Justice Department has intensified its scrutiny of police departments, launching 20 investigations of police practices and alleged discriminatory enforcement patterns in the past five years.

That's more than twice the number of such probes in the previous five years.

That record is part of Holder's pitch to reassure the local community in Ferguson that the Justice Department will properly investigate the shooting of Brown, who was unarmed, by a white officer, Darren Wilson.

Ferguson has been at the center of daily standoffs between protesters and police since the August 9 shooting. Some of the protests have turned violent.

Holder's visit will focus on the Justice Department's civil rights investigation, which is examining whether Wilson acted properly in using deadly force. The federal probe is separate from a criminal one being conducted by local authorities.

""At a time when so much may seem uncertain, the people of Ferguson can have confidence that the Justice Department intends to learn — in a fair and thorough manner — exactly what happened,"" Holder wrote in an opinion piece for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch ahead of his trip.

""We understand the need for an independent investigation, and we hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in Ferguson,"" he added.

Holder has been outspoken on issues related to disparity in the judicial system and has led efforts to reduce disparities in sentences that statistically have greater effect on racial minorities.

While those efforts have the backing of Obama, Holder's public views on the issue of race haven't always been welcome for the White House.

In his first major speech after taking office in 2009, Holder told a Black History Month gathering at the Justice Department: ""Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.""

Obama criticized the ""nation of cowards"" characterization, saying ""if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language.""

Privately, Holder believed he was right. But he stayed away from the issue for a while.

At the same time, he vowed to reinvigorate the Justice Department's civil rights division, which was the center of controversy over partisan meddling during the administration of President George W. Bush.

That unit enforces a 1994 law approved after the Rodney King beating by police in Los Angeles that makes it unlawful for police to engage in a pattern or practice that deprives people of their constitutional rights.

Of the 20 investigations the civil rights division has launched in the past five years, seven are ongoing, including those against police departments in Albuquerque, Miami, and Cleveland.

As a result of increased scrutiny, there are now 13 law enforcement agencies subject to agreements with the Justice Department. Seven of those are under court-ordered consent decrees, the largest number in the department's history.

Holder has criticized some of the police response to the street protests in Ferguson, while at the same time advocating enforcement against people rioting and looting.

He has sent Justice Department officials to provide technical assistance to police, suggesting less aggressive tactics and avoiding the use of military-style vehicles to deal with protesters.

Among those sent to Ferguson is Ronald Davis, who heads the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. A former police chief in East Palo Alto, California, Davis is African-American and has spoken out about racial profiling by police.

""I am a black man who is subject to increased scrutiny from my community, my profession, and my country because of the color of my skin,"" Davis said at a 2012 hearing.

He added that he is proud to be a police officer, but noted that ""as a black man with a 14-year-old son, Glenn, I know that when I teach him how to drive a car I must also teach him what to do when stopped by the police -- a mandatory course for young men of color.

""I must also prepare him for the bias he is likely to face and the reality that, despite the strength of his character or his contributions to society, there will be those who will attach criminality to him simply because of the color of his skin,"" Davis said.",NA,NA,NA,NA

We know {a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, fatally shot the unarmed 18-year-old}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/justice/michael-brown-missouri-teen-shot/index.html"">, but police and witnesses have given different accounts of what happened in the moments before the shooting. The confusion has fueled protests in Ferguson and, earlier in the week, strong police response in the streets of the St. Louis suburb.

Here are five key questions about the incident:

How did it start?

Brown and Dorian Johnson, 22, were walking in the middle of the street, en route to either Brown's grandmother's house (according to Brown's mother and grandmother) or to Johnson's house (according to Johnson), when a Ferguson police officer confronted them.

Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, told the young men either ""Get the f*** on the sidewalk"" or ""Get the f*** out of the street,"" according to Johnson's accounts to CNN and other news outlets.

The young men replied that they were ""not but a minute away from our destination, and we would shortly be out of the street,"" Johnson told CNN.

The officer drove away but stopped and backed up, almost hitting the pair, Johnson said. He said he wasn't sure what prompted the officer to return. Johnson told MSNBC the officer said something to the effect of {""What'd you say?""}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri"">

""We were so close, almost inches away, that when he tried to open his door aggressively, the door ricocheted both off me and Big Mike's body and closed back on the officer,"" Johnson said.

A caller to the St. Louis radio program The Dana Show, on Radio America, gave what she said was the officer's version of events. Her account accurately matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN.

The caller, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" said that Wilson told her that the two young men were walking in the street and he rolled down his window and told them to get out of the street.

Was there a struggle?

Yes. Everyone agrees on this point, and it's one of the few aspects of the shooting that {police have attempted to detail}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html"">, though the official explanation has spurred many questions they have yet to answer.

The preliminary investigation showed that the officer tried to exit his vehicle, but Brown pushed him back into the car, ""where he physically assaulted the police officer"" and struggled over the officer's weapon, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.

A shot was fired inside the police car, Belmar said. After the incident, the officer was taken to an area hospital, where he was treated for a ""swollen face,"" according to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson.

In Josie's version, Wilson may have heard a call about a strong-arm robbery and saw the young men carrying something that might have been stolen cigars. According to Josie, when Wilson tried to get out of his car, Brown pushed him back in, and then punched the officer in the face. It was then that Wilson reached for his gun, Josie told the radio show.

Brown grabbed Wilson's gun, and the officer pushed it away and the gun went off, Josie said.

The stories don't jibe with at least three witness accounts.

Johnson claims the {officer grabbed Brown by his neck}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/08/13/ac-dorian-johnson.cnn"">, and Brown tried to pull away, but the officer kept pulling Brown toward him, he said.

The officer drew his weapon, and ""he said, 'I'll shoot you' or 'I'm going to shoot' "" and almost instantaneously fired his weapon, hitting Brown, Johnson said.

Witness Tiffany Mitchell was picking up coworker Piaget Crenshaw for their jobs when she saw Brown and the officer ""tussling through the window."" Mitchell and Crenshaw said Brown appeared to be trying to pry himself from the officer's grasp. Brown had his hand on the police cruiser, trying to push himself away, Mitchell said.

Was Brown armed?

No. Again, this is undisputed.

Every casing found at the scene came from the officer's gun, Belmar said, and witnesses say that after the officer initially fired, the two young men took off running.

""I saw the officer proceeding after my friend, Big Mike, with his gun drawn, and he fired a second shot, and that struck my friend, Big Mike,"" Johnson said. ""And at that time, he turned around with his hands up, beginning to tell the officer that he was unarmed and to tell him to stop shooting. But at that time, the officer was firing several more shots into my friend, and he hit the ground and died.""

This matches {Crenshaw's and Mitchell's story}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/08/14/cnn-tonight-piaget-crenshaw-eyewitnesses.cnn"">. Crenshaw told CNN that Brown got about 20 feet away from the police cruiser before the officer shot him again.

""The cop gets out of his vehicle shooting,"" Mitchell said. ""(Brown's) body jerked as if he was hit from behind, and he turned around, and he put his hands up. ... The cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground, and his face just smacked the concrete.""

A private autopsy conducted for the Brown family showed that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

Josie, recounting the officer's version of events, told the radio program that after the first shot went off inside the car, Brown and his friend started running, and Wilson pursued as protocol dictates.

According to Josie, Wilson told the young men to freeze, and the pair turned around.

The officer's account is that Brown started to taunt him, saying he wouldn't shoot him, and then rushed at the officer at full speed, Josie said. It was then that Wilson started firing, Josie said.

She said that in the officer's opinion, Brown ""was on something.""

According to her, the final shot hit Brown in the forehead, and he fell two or three feet in front of the officer.

A new witness, Michael Brady, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday that Wilson fired at Brown after the teen ran about 20 feet.

Brady ran out of his apartment to get a closer look.

Seconds later, he saw Brown doubled over, cradling one arm and beginning to fall forward. He took a step or two towards the officer but did not charge him, Brady said.

Wilson fired three to four more shots at him, he said.

What were Brown and Johnson doing before the incident?

On Friday, six days after the shooting, Ferguson police revealed that Brown was the {""primary suspect"" in the strong-arm robbery}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html""> of a convenience store moments before he encountered police and was killed.

A store surveillance video shows a man pushing a clerk before walking out the front door with a box of Swisher Sweets cigars worth $48.99, according to information released by police.

The Brown family lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that the person in the video appears to be Michael Brown.

Johnson, who was with Brown when he was shot, will not face any criminal charges in connection with the store robbery because ""we have determined he committed no crime,"" Jackson said.

Jackson initially said that the officer who shot Brown was responding to a call about the robbery.

Later, Jackson revised that comment, saying the officer approached Brown not because of the robbery, but because he was ""walking down the middle of the street, blocking traffic.""

Why didn't police identify the officer right away?

It took police six days to publicly identify Wilson.

Police initially promised to release the officer's name but held off, saying they feared for his safety.

On Friday, {police revealed the officer as Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/justice/ferguson-missouri-cop-profile/index.html"">, 28, who is a six-year veteran of the department without any history of disciplinary action.

Wilson is on paid administrative leave, Belmar said, and will have to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty.

Though the officer was promptly released from the hospital, Jackson said he spoke to him, and he was ""very shaken about what happened that day and the aftermath. ... He's hurt.""

Brown's family and their attorneys were infuriated that police released Wilson's identity and allegations of Brown's role in the robbery on the same day.

""The prolonged release of the officer's name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies,"" the family and lawyers said in a statement.",NA,NA,NA,NA
CNN,cnn69,http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/19/politics/missouri-teen-shooting-obama/,"Obama cautious in comments on Ferguson, no visit now",Jim Acosta; Elizabeth Hartfield,08/19/2014,02/19/2016,"As outrage flares and more questions are raised over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, President Barack Obama increasingly finds himself drawn to the center of the discussion.

Obama has spoken publicly twice about the August 9 shooting of the unarmed African-American teen by a white police officer in the St. Louis suburb, as well as the resulting clashes between protesters and law enforcement. He also released a written statement shortly after Brown was killed.

But he's so far been cautious about wading too deeply into the controversy that is the subject of a local criminal investigation and a separate civil rights probe led by the Justice Department.

He has spoken with elected and other leaders, and his public statements have been measured. No presidential visits to Missouri are planned for now although Attorney General Eric Holder is due in Ferguson on Wednesday.

""I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed. Because, although these are, you know, issues of local jurisdiction -- you know, the DOJ works for me,"" Obama told reporters on Monday. ""And then when they're conducting an investigation, I've got to make sure that I don't look like I'm putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other.""

Should Obama be more forceful?

But some believe Obama should be more forceful, especially following community and political criticism of the initial police response to street protests as excessive, and with those demonstrations becoming more violent.

""This President knows better than most what happens in poor communities that have been antagonized historically by the hostile relationship between black people and the police department,"" Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""

""It is not enough for him to come on national television and pretend there is a false moral equivalency between police people who are armed and black people who are vulnerable constantly to this. He needs to use his bully pulpit to step up and articulate this as a vision,"" Dyson said.

CNN political commentator and Morehouse College African-American studies professor Marc Lamont Hill wrote in an op-ed for CNN.com that Obama has ""placed the highest priority"" on people remaining calm.

""While this may seem reasonable on its face, particularly against the backdrop of rioting and looting, his words failed to acknowledge the legitimacy of black anger,"" Hill said.

The White House argues a big speech from Obama on race relations would be difficult right now.

""Pouring gasoline on a fire and lighting the match?"" one senior White House official said.

Administration officials said in their discussions with mayors, civil rights leaders and the Congressional Black Caucus, that they've been told Obama is doing the right thing.

Obama talked to governor

In his statement on Monday, Obama noted that he has been in touch with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, and the state's two senators, Claire McCaskill and Roy Blunt.

The White House emphasized supportive statements it has received from both McCaskill, a Democrat, and more notably, Blunt, a Republican.

""I explained to the President that I've been pleased with my conversations with the attorney general and civil rights division regarding their helpful understanding that they aren't taking over this investigation, but are conducting a parallel review of the events that led to Michael Brown's death,"" Blunt said in a statement on Monday. ""I continue to believe that this is the best possible way to arrive at a transparent explanation that would be largely acceptable to all of those who have been impacted in the community by this tragedy.""

Will Obama visit Ferguson?

Obama also has skirted the question of whether he plans to travel to Ferguson. A senior White House official said such a visit is not in the cards now, but it has not been ruled out.

A visit by the President would tax law enforcement resources necessary for his protection instead of devoting those resources to calming the situation, the White House official said.

The Department of Justice's community policing program director, Ronald Davis, will be on the ground to advise law enforcement on how to deal with the protests peacefully, this official said.

The White House also views what is happening in Ferguson as partly a policing issue. Better policing practices in working with the community and organizing the response to the protests could calm things down, the official said.

Calls for Obama to visit Ferguson aren't likely to ebb soon. On Tuesday, rapper and business mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs released a video on Instagram calling for such a step.

""Obama, for real, get on a plane. It's serious,"" he said.",NA,NA,NA,NA

In a first account of its kind, a caller to Radio America's ""The Dana Show,"" who identified herself only as Josie, told listeners a detailed account of Officer Darren Wilson's side. A source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN it accurately matched what the officer has told investigators.

""He said all of a sudden, he just started to bum rush him,"" she said. ""He just started coming at him full speed, and so he just started shooting and he just kept coming.""

""I can even say without speaking to Darren, without even having heard his statements, that at that moment in time, he was scared for his life, I am 100% positive of that,"" Wilson's longtime high school friend Jake Shepard told CNN.

But accounts of exactly what happened between Wilson and Brown vary widely.

Witnesses have said they saw a scuffle between the officer and Brown at a police car before the young man was shot. Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer.

Facebook support

In a rally organized by the ""Support Darren Wilson"" Facebook page, more than 100 people gathered Sunday in downtown St. Louis to show their support for Wilson, CNN affiliate KSDK reported.

The Facebook group is gaining attention on social media and has received more than 29,000 likes since its creation on August 9. A second Facebook page, ""I Support Officer Wilson,"" is almost at 33,000 likes since its creation Friday.

According to the ""Support Darren Wilson"" page, another rally was set up over the weekend on a bridge that connects Illinois and Missouri. And in a recent post on the page, the group is preparing for another rally this week.

The posts on both pages express frustration about not being heard in the media and allege a lack of support for Wilson and law enforcement.

A recent post on the ""I support Officer Wilson"" page says, ""We started this page to be the voice that law enforcement did not have."" Another post from the same page says that Wilson has overcome a rough childhood himself and that becoming a police officer has helped him to overcome that.

""It has been brought to my attention that Officer Darren Wilson had a very hard childhood and was able to rebound from that childhood becoming a police officer. ... This man is a hero now and has always been a hero,"" one post reads.

Wilson, 28, who has six years on the force with {no disciplinary issues on his record}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/justice/ferguson-missouri-cop-profile/"">, is on paid administrative leave. If he returns to duty, he will have to undergo two psychological evaluations, authorities said.

Shepard told CNN the officer was the ""nicest guy in the world.""

""I could never imagine him even in that situation taking someone's life, let alone taking someone's life with malicious intent,"" he said.

A post from the ""I support Officer Wilson"" page says that Wilson is struggling with what he's done. ""This incident and the death of Michael Brown has been very hard for Officer Wilson and he is not handling it well,"" it says.

Support from friends, families

Many who say they are wives of law enforcement officers have posted stories about their husbands facing similar situations. Others who say they're friends of fallen officers have also posted about the grief they have seen when an officer is killed in the line of duty.

KimC shared her support on the St. Louis Police Wives' Association blog: ""Thank you from a Ferguson resident and friend of the officers here in the community. ... Thank you for the meals, donations to Darren and constant prayers. God bless you all.""

A crowdfunding campaign for the officer is also gaining traction via fundraising websites. A Gofundme.com campaign raised over $10,000 in less than 24 hours and now has a goal of $100,000. And a Teespring campaign, which sells T-shirts to help raise funds, has sold 1,007 T-shirts, breaking its goal of 1,000 T-shirts.

The outpouring is modest when compared with that for the Brown family. A memorial campaign fund set up by Brown's parents has raised over $82,363 in the last five days, breaking an $80,000 goal.",NA,NA,NA,Originally published 08/19/14

1. ROBIN WILLIAMS' DEATH

A doctor, a genie and everything in between: The world lost a comic icon yesterday, his death sudden and unexpected. Robin Williams, who left a lasting impression on both young and old in numerous memorable turns, apparently took his own life, law enforcement officials said. In public and in his movie roles, he was irreverent, he was quirky, he had a motor mouth. In private, he battled demons. He made at least two trips to drug rehab, including a visit this summer. He was 63.

""Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between. But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien - but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit. ""

2. MISSOURI TEEN SHOOTING

Violence flares again: Yesterday was supposed to be Michael Brown's first day at technical college. But the 18-year-old was shot dead by a cop over the weekend. And since then, the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson has been a racially charged tinderbox. Residents say the African-American teen was unarmed and surrendering when the officer opened fire. Cops say he attacked the officer and tried to take his gun. A Sunday vigil devolved into violence and looting. And then last night, cops fired tear gas to disperse a crowd. The feds have opened an inquiry, with Attorney General Eric Holder saying the shooting ""deserves a fulsome review.""

3. RACE TRACK DEATH

Fatal confrontation: One makes millions on the NASCAR circuit, but loves racing against amateurs on dirt tracks. The other had been winning races since he got behind the wheel of a go-kart at 4. The confrontation between the two turned deadly Saturday when three-time NASCAR champ Tony Stewart's car struck and killed Kevin Ward Jr. Ward had gotten out of his car to vent his anger after a tangle with Stewart caused him to spin out. His autopsy said he died of ""massive blunt trauma."" Cops say they're investigating, but so far there's no evidence that a crime was committed.

4. EBOLA OUTBREAK

Desperate times, desperate measures: The death toll from the Ebola outbreak has soared past 1,000, making it the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. This has prompted the World Health Organization to say that it is ethical to offer medications to fight the virus even if a drug's effectiveness or its adverse effects are unknown. The desperation has pushed Liberia's government to ask for scarce quantities of an untested drug from a U.S.-based company.

5. IRAQ CRISIS

The plight of the Yazidis: The face of the 15-year-old says it all. Tears stream down, she looks exhausted, she glances around the inside of a helicopter with confusion in her eyes. The Iraqi air force and fighters with the Kurdish peshmerga carried out a dramatic rescue mission yesterday at Mount Sinjar, taking supplies to desperate Yazidis and ferrying a handful of people out. They were the fortunate ones. Thousands of others are in desperate need of help, trapped without food, water or medical care in the stifling summer heat.

The death of 18-year-old Michael Brown has sparked widespread outrage, not just in Ferguson, but nationwide.

For the second night in a row Monday, police in riot gear clashed with protesters who took to the streets demanding justice for Brown. Micheal Brown's family is calling on the community to refrain from acting out aggressively and protest peacefully.

U.S. President Barack Obama echoed calls for calm, releasing a statement expressing condolences to the teen's family and describing his death as heartbreaking.

Eyewitness account: A new witness in the police shooting death of Michael Brown told CNN that Brown and the police officer tussled with each other before the officer shot the teen multiple times as Brown backed away. Police in Ferguson, Missouri, have said Brown died in a dangerous struggle after trying to grab the officer's weapon, but witnesses say that it seemed a brazen act of aggression by the officer Saturday and that Brown was unarmed and not threatening. Protests have erupted each night since the shooting. Missouri's governor will visit the community near St. Louis today.

2. IRAQ

Humanitarian crisis: A mass evacuation of Yazidis in northern Iraq seems unlikely now that the U.S. has evaluated the situation. Last week, the minority group was chased from the town of Sinjar by ISIS, which calls itself the ""Islamic State"" and was known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Once believed to be in the tens of thousands, the number of Yazidis in Iraq's Sinjar Mountains is ""now in the low thousands,"" the State Department said. Still, the United Nations has announced its highest level of emergency for the humanitarian crisis, saying the 400,000 people on the run from ISIS are of grave concern.

3. MIDEAST

Cease-fire extended: Israel has accepted an Egyptian proposal to extend the current cease-fire five more days, an Israeli government spokesman said today. Earlier, Palestinian officials said they had agreed to extend the truce. Israeli and Palestinian delegations have been talking in Cairo, using Egyptian go-betweens, in hopes of ending hostilities that have killed more than 2,000 people. But there's still lots to work out. Israel says it wants Gaza demilitarized. The Palestinian delegation is demanding an end to Israel's economic blockade on Gaza and the release of prisoners held by Israelis.

4. BODY IN SUITCASE

Intriguing case: An American woman and her boyfriend have been named suspects in the death of her mother after her body was found stuffed in a suitcase, police in Indonesia said. Sheila von Weise Mack had been staying at the posh St. Regis Bali Resort with her daughter, Heather Mack, and the daughter's boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer. The couple say they were taken captive by an armed gang that killed Sheila von Weise Mack. They say they managed to escape. As suspects, police can hold them up to 20 days while they investigate.

5. SEAWORLD STOCK

Rough waters: SeaWorld isn't having a good time these days. Shares of the theme park operator plunged nearly 33% Wednesday after it reported weak earnings and lackluster attendance for the year, especially at its flagship destination theme parks in San Diego and Orlando. SeaWorld Entertainment said it expects revenue to drop 6% to 7% for the year. That's a lot worse than Wall Street expected. SeaWorld has come under fire after the airing of ""Blackfish"" last year, a CNN documentary that exposed the alleged dangers of keeping orcas in captivity.

CNN,cnn74,http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1163362,"Police Chief of Ferguson Makes an Admission by Omission, By: Dionne Wright Poulton, PhD",DrDionne02,08/19/2014,03/09/2016,"In the days following the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, CNN anchors John Berman and Michaela Pereira interviewed Police Chief Tom Jackson. Berman asked Chief Jackson the following question, “What needs to be addressed in terms of police practices?” The chief offered an interesting response, stating that there is a need for his police department to readdress how they use force in situations — specifically with respect to “procedures, weapons, less lethal weapons, and hand to hand tactics.” However, the chief did not mention the most obvious type of training that his police officers need—diversity training. 
The chief, both optimistically and simplistically stated that “Shooting situations always create training situations” and that “police tactics get better and better and are constantly improving.” While this might be true in reference to the aforementioned police tactics, I, unfortunately, do not share the chief’s optimism for improvement since he did not acknowledge racial profiling as a possible influencer of police behavior. The shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by one of his white officers, Darren Wilson, is in of itself a glaring example of how racial bias influences police perceptions and procedures. 
There are conflicting reports about what led up to Michael Brown’s demise, but what we do know is that an unarmed teenager was shot 6 times by a white police officer in a city with palpable racial tensions and a police department that is disproportionately white in comparison to the majority black population. “Shooting situations,” as the chief euphemistically stated, seem to disproportionately involve black men — and increasingly, unarmed black men so the chief’s failure to acknowledge race as a factor impacting the situation in Ferguson is an admission by omission. Race has to be present in this situation. In a recent report shared by the editorial board of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, it was explicitly stated that “Last year, for the 11th time in the 14 years that data has been collected, the disparity index that measures potential racial profiling by law enforcement in the state got worse. Black Missourians were 66 percent more likely in 2013 to be stopped by police, and blacks and Hispanics were both more likely to be searched, even though the likelihood of finding contraband was higher among whites.” 
This report is statistical evidence of racial bias in police practices and yet, the chief failed to point out the obvious training that his department, and many others need. And, even without this report, there is copious research that supports the notion that all of us harbor racial biases, much like the way we harbor biases on the basis of gender, age, height, weight, beauty, etc. Therefore, to believe that police officers are exempt from this natural phenomenon is absurd. And in the case of police officers, to ignore this fact has been proven deadly. 
Nevertheless, while I agree with the chief’s assertion that his police department has to examine their force tactics, my suggestion is to address the problem that exists long before any type of force might be necessary – racial profiling. All police officers NEED to be trained to recognize, acknowledge, and address their racial biases and how these biases influence and impact their perceptions and preconceived notions of black men and people of color in general. So when the dust settles after this unfortunate situation, I hope Chief Jackson will find the courage to first admit that his department has issues with race, and second, begin to train his officers in this area.

What do you think would happen to you when they found you and filed charges, prosecuted, and threw you in jail? 
For how many years? 
Wasn't this kid starting to college the next day? 

Maybe Michael Brown should have taken some advice from actor, Clint Eastwood in his movie, ""Unforgiven"", when asked about shooting an unarmed man: 
""He should have armed himself."" 
The irony is that Washington wants to pass gun laws to restrict who can have them. 
Fat chance of that happening anytime soon when we see what just happened in Ferguson, MO. 
Maybe we all need guns to protect ourselves from those that are supposed to protect us. 
A recent caller to a radio station said that she knew what had happened the day that Darren Wilson murdered Mike Brown. 
Coincidently, this 'friend' of Wilson's story is collaborated by a 'source' who claims to know what Wilson's police report says, before the report has been released to the public.

Police in Ferguson, MO, were able to release the video tape of a strong arm robbery at a convenience food store and now, a toxicology report that suggests the Mike Brown's' reefer madness' could be the reason for charging in the face of automatic weapon fire, but couldn't release Officer Wilson's official report of the shooting, except to Face Book supporters who were inclined to call local radio stations. 
The radio caller says that Mike Brown charged Wilson with his head down (explains the hole in the top of Brown's head, right?) and Officer Wilson, fearing for his life, started shooting until the threat had been eliminated. 
This threat response of policemen is conveniently explained by another psychologist that says it's a natural response of a policeman that can't deal with stress.

When I arrived on the scene, I saw 10-15 demonstrators holding signs from a parking lot in front of the Ferguson Fire House and Police Station.
 
There was a reverend asking a few of the protesters to keep the angry rhetoric to a minimum. These people were angry and the atmosphere was highly charged. Some of the protesters were old enough to remember where they were the first time they heard Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. recite his dream to the Nation.
 
Then I proceeded to say
 
""In the 50 years since Dr. King gave us his Promised Land Vision, there are all too many weed seeds of hatred waiting to germinate within our consciousness, detaching us from our spiritual roots. If we fight hatred with hatred, then we play into the hands of the police and allow ourselves to remain powerless and to be kept in the dark.  On the other hand, if we challenge them to symbolically ""weed out hate"" together by tugging no symbolic weeds, this sets the proper foundation for setting all of us spirits free, allowing us to occupy the dream. This is a win-win situation for all concerned.
 
Along with the signs, I handed out specially produced Sunflower Peace Seeds for the protesters to plant next spring.
 
On July 18th, Springfield, IL mayor Mike Houston had issued a Weed Out Hate Proclamation, encouraging all Springfield citizens to root out symbolic weeds of hatred in solidarity with those suffering in the Middle East.

Fifty years later, Americans again are witnessing similar images, this time from Ferguson, Missouri, near St. Louis. The shooting death of Michael Brown and the subsequent police clampdown on protests in 2014 is frighteningly similar to how law enforcement treated civil rights marchers and the media in 1964. This time, their tools are stun grenades and assault weapons.

And again, the press is not just the witness, we have also become the victims.

Wesley Lowery, a reporter from the Washington Post who just accepted the National Association of Black Journalists' {Emerging Journalist Award}<hyperlink=""http://www.nabj.org/news/174063/NABJ-Awards-The-Washington-Posts-Wesley-Lowery-2014-Emerging-Journalist-of-the-Year-.htm"">, and Ryan J.

When Reilly and Lowery apparently did not move fast enough, they were arrested. They were released a short time later without charges.

Yes, law enforcement officers from America's heartland, sworn to protect American citizens -- black and white -- apparently saw it necessary to defy the first amendment by arresting reporters who were simply doing their jobs. And that is wrong.

2014, meet 1964.

Fifty years ago, the mainstream media failed miserably because its virtually all-white reporting corps did not have the life experience to explain the reasons behind the protest marches. And stories of the attacks on protesters too often were told from the viewpoint of the police.

This created an atmosphere of distrust and hostility and eventually it became unsafe for white reporters to venture into the black community.

So media companies responded by hiring Black reporters to cover what became known as the ""Long, Hot Summer"" of 1967 -- where more than 100 race riots rocked the United States. By the way, that decision eventually led to the creation of the National Association of Black Journalists.

Fast-forward to 2014, when a police officer fired on an unarmed Brown -- who {reportedly}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html""> had his hands raised in surrender. He died of multiple gunshot wounds. The community erupted.

Ferguson police brought in St. Louis County Police to investigate the shooting and to handle the protests. And then all hell broke loose.

Wednesday night, the police used tear gas, smoke bombs and stun grenades to break up what reporters described as a peaceful crowd. Perhaps they were too busy with their assault weapons and tactical vehicles to get around to the dogs and fire hoses.

I have covered dozens of protests. I have always worn my press credentials. I have experienced the acrid, sweet smell of tear gas during the Occupy Oakland demonstrations in 2013. Police have manhandled me. Yet, I have never been arrested.

What planet are these police officers on? Where did they get their training? In what manual is it spelled out that it's OK to arrest and manhandle peaceful demonstrators, much less exhausted reporters simply trying to file their stories and recharge the cell phones at a McDonald's?

Journalists are there to report on the protests. We document those people who break into Foot Locker and beauty supply stores for whatever reason. We report on those protesters who bring backpacks filled with bottles, rocks, hammers and spray paint cans, as well as those who march peacefully through the streets to bring attention to a perceived injustice.

We also report on police behavior, some of which does not always comply with their own police policy. During Occupy Oakland, reporters documented violations of police procedure. The police department later used our reporting as justification for re-training officers.

We can't do our jobs if the police look at us the same as a guy wearing a ski mask throwing rocks. We can't do our job if we are arrested for shooting video of police behavior.

And one note to the St. Louis County Police: You do not have the right to tell reporters to turn off their video cameras. Read the law, please.

What is happening in Ferguson is disturbing for many reasons.

Forget that the police in Ferguson used chemical weapons and blunt force to break up a peaceful demonstration. Forget that Reilly and Lowery were released without charges after being detained. They also said they had been roughed up. Their arrests should send chills up and down the backs of every citizen ... and news manager.

If the police felt it was OK to arrest two reporters for not moving fast enough, you can only imagine how they are treating the residents of Ferguson when the reporters are not there and the cameras are not recording.

So angry in fact that the people have come together to protest the treatment of black people by the police.
 
While there have been many peaceful protests, there have also been some violent and even criminal responses to the shooting. These criminal responses include shootings, throwing objects at police and looting local businesses.
 
In response to the criminal activity, the police have mounted an almost army like response. This response has sparked a lot of criticism and seems to have inflamed the situation in Ferguson.
 
All that being said, the story became less about the actual circumstances of the shooting of Michael Brown and more about the distrust that seems to exist between black communities and the police.
 
So…are these protests helping the situation? When this is all said and done will it affect the change the people are hoping for between the police and this black community?
 
I am inclined to think it will not. I am of the belief that this situation just creates more tension between the races and will not result in the change that would find the police being more equitable in their treatment of the different races.
 
I suppose if the protests had remained peaceful it would have brought the right amount of attention to the issue and could have opened the debate on the issue. From reports on television, the protesting is peaceful during the day but seems to turn ugly once the sun goes down.
 
Some are suggesting that many of the troublemakers are outsiders that are capitalizing on this community’s grief and frustration to gain attention for themselves and steal from the community.
 
Again, does this help the situation or does it just solidify the stereotypes that persist about young black men, about the police, about how whites and blacks feel about each other?

Indications of that are everywhere in Ferguson. Police in these towns are getting much of this combat equipment free of charge from the Pentagon. The Defense Department says just in 2013, nearly $450 million worth of military equipment was given to law enforcement. A defense official says Ferguson Police only got a couple of Humvees and a trailer, but police departments throughout Missouri, which are assisting in Ferguson, got 20 MRAPs and hundreds of M-16 rifles in recent years. Critics say often when they get these weapons, policemen's attitudes change. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Increasingly the police are trained to view the people in the communities that they're supposed to be protecting and serving as enemies.

TODD: Danski (ph) says having well-trained SWAT teams in major cities is necessary, but all too often police in smaller towns, sometimes without the proper training in how to use all this military gear, overreact when conducting minor operations, like serving search warrants. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They will drive up in an armored personnel carrier, raid a person's home, holding assault rifles, holding people at gunpoint, yelling at everyone to get on the floor. This is an extremely traumatic experience. And we've seen over and over again situations like this where people are traumatized and sometimes people are injured and killed. 

TODD: But current and former police say criminals have increasingly more fire power, and law enforcement can't afford to be outgunned. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If people are shooting at the police and committing looting and other violent acts, then the police need to protect themselves. 

(END VIDEOTAPE)

TODD: Now, as we reported, the Defense Department is supporting this program, but it's also making it fairly easy for police departments to get this equipment while it takes you or I, Carol, about four to six weeks, an unending hassle and documentation just to get a passport. The Defense Department says the police department only needs to fill out a one-page form for an armored personnel carrier. 

Carol. CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: Wow. Brian Todd reporting live from Washington this morning. 

The American Civil Liberties Union has been worried about the growing militarization of the police for such -- for a long time. In June it published a report highlighting cases in which innocent people were killed. I want to bring in Vanita Gupta now. She's the director of the ACLU's Center for Justice. 

And, Vanita, first I want to read a couple of stats from your report. This is what part of the report says. ""The amount of military equipment being used by local and state police agencies has increased dramatically. The value of property transferred through a Defense Department program went from $1 million in 1990 to $324 million in 1995, and to nearly $450 million in 2013."" Why is this happening? 

VANITA GUPTA, DEPUTY LEGAL DIR., AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION: Well, part of it is that we have a surplus from the wars that we have fought overseas, and there is a need to figure out what to do with them. And so increasingly we are seeing local police departments getting very easy access to this equipment. And I think a very serious concern for the ACLU is the complete lack of oversight, meaningful oversight and transparency and accountability. We did this report and it was very hard for us to get information about exactly what trails of money and funding and equipment was going to these local police departments, and that should not be the case. 

COSTELLO: Two other things cited in the report that the ACLU found especially troubling was the use of battering rams and the flash/bang grenade. What do you find problematic with their use? 

GUPTA: You know, they're being used for a lot of low-level drug raids, search warrants, usually against communities of color, which should not come as a surprise, since the war on drugs has been targeted -- has targeted communities of color. And these are huge -- have huge potential for risk of violence, for escalating violence. I think that this is a real tragedy and ultimately really undermines the rule of law and the community's perception that police are there to protect them, not to engage in an us versus them kind of combat zone war against them. And ultimately it really undermines the legitimacy of police when those kinds of equipment are used to execute simple search warrants. 

We found that only -- only 7 percent of the cases that we've studied were, for example, SWAT teams used to -- in serious kind of active shooter hostage situations. There is an overuse and a gross potential for overuse when too many small police departments have access and easy access to these kinds of war and military-grade weapons and materials. 

COSTELLO: On the other hand, we did see plenty of looting in Ferguson and there's a question that the people in this country are well armed. Many of them have semiautomatic weapons. Police do face a growing number of people with their own personal arsenals. So shouldn't police be able to gear up to protect themselves and the community? GUPTA: Look, I think there's no question that in the cases, and I will

say, in a -- they were a small minority of cases where police needed to use a heightened use of force to protect against what was happening. But, look, you cannot use -- that is not a rationale for what happened two nights ago in Ferguson, where you saw those images, and that is what troubled the nation, that with peaceful protests, the kind of -- the armored tanks, the rubber bullets, the tear gas, those are scenes from wars and those were used against peaceful protesters. So, you know, while there is no question that police need to be sufficiently geared up in certain kinds of situations, the rise of militarization of the police around the country has really escalated the risk of violence. And there's no justification for it in the kinds of scenes that we saw two nights ago in Ferguson. 

COSTELLO: And I just want to bring our viewers' attention to the image that you're seeing on the right of your screen. We're still awaiting the Ferguson police chief to approach those microphones and release the name of the officer who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown. You can see people gathered around, the press and some members of the community, waiting to hear. And that should happen at any time. I know the ACLU, Vanita, has been pushing for the release of this officer's name, but you're also suing for something else. What is that? 

GUPTA: Well, we also filed a second lawsuit yesterday to ensure that a court makes very clear that police officers cannot demand that people stop recording scenes. And so, you know, look, the protesters have a right to peacefully express their deep anger and anguish about what happened in the shooting of Michael Brown. They have a constitutional right to do so. And the demands of police that protesters vacate, peaceful protesters vacate, that they stop recording, that they were snatching video cameras away, that is unconstitutional. And we filed a lawsuit to ensure that there would be a court ruling that prevented police officers from doing so in the future. 

COSTELLO: Vanita Gupta from the ACLU, thank you so much for joining me this morning. 

GUPTA: Thank you. 

COSTELLO: Still to come in the NEWSROOM, Missouri residents desperate to stay safe turning to gun stores for protection. That sparked a surge of sales in everything from pistols to AR-15s. Joe Johns is following that story. 

Good morning, Joe.

JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Carol.

It's an almost predictable result. Some gun shops in the St. Louis area say firearms are just flying off the shelves as a result of the uproar in Ferguson. I'll have that coming up next. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COSTELLO: All right, we are still awaiting the Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson to take to the microphones to reveal the name of the police officer who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown last Saturday. We understand the chief is on the scene. A larger crowd is now gathering. So let's head to Ana Cabrera. She is at this QuickTrip (ph). 

It's an interesting place to hold this news conference, isn't it?

ANA CABRERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, this has been ground zero many have said. Carol, I want to give you an update. Just in the last seconds I'm hearing that the police chief is walking up to the microphones now. So as soon as he steps in front, he's just beyond my camera, we have a camera, he -- I see him now approaching the microphones, so I want to draw your attention to that microphone.

COSTELLO: All right, let's listen.

All right, so he's having a little side conversation before he takes the microphone. The interesting thing about this QuickTrip, it has become ground zero for this -- the series of terrible nights in Ferguson, Missouri. That QuickTrip was burned down and looted and you see -- all right, let's listen. 

THOMAS JACKSON, FERGUSON POLICE CHIEF: First of all, thanks for everybody for coming out, welcome. Sorry about being late. I know that the time line hasn't really played out like I expected it would, but as some of you are aware, I've had a lot of sunshine law requests for information and documents about a variety of things, some of which is not available to me. I'm here to talk about two things. First of all, the name of the officer involved in the shooting, and then I've had a lot of sunshine requests for information. I'm going to be releasing information about a robbery that occurred on August 9 th , immediately preceding the altercation and shooting death of Michael Brown. 

It's important to note that I have made contact with someone who is in contact with officer's (sic) Brown's family to make them aware of this information being released. What we're making available today are the dispatch records and the video footage of a robbery, a strong- armed robbery with use of force, that occurred at a local convenience mart. I cannot discuss the investigation about the attempted apprehension of the suspect in that strong-arm robbery. That goes to the county prosecutor's office. I won't be taking any questions today right now, not today. I won't be taking any questions here. I want to give this information to you, let everybody digest it, and then later on sometime after noon, he can get together again and then I'll take questions. 

So I just want to give you a little time line of what happened on August 9th. From 11:48 to noon, the officer involved in the shooting was on a sick call in Glen Arc. There was an ambulance present. At 11:51 there was a 911 call from a convenience store nearby, not this one. At 11:52 dispatch gave a description of robbery suspect over the radio. A different officer arrived at the store, where the strong-arm robbery occurred. A further description, more detail, was given over the radio and stated the officer was walking toward (sic), or the suspect was walking toward QuikTrip. Our officer left the sick call, he encountered the, I'm sorry. At 12:01 p.m., our officer encountered Michael Brown on Canfield

Drive. At 12:04 a second officer arrived on the scene, immediately following the shooting, and at 12:05 a supervisor was dispatched to the scene, and subsequent officers arrived. There has been some questions about the calling of an ambulance. The ambulance that was at the sick case on Glen Arc was coming by immediately following the shooting, and they did respond to assess Michael Brown. 

So I'm going to have some police officers are going to be handing out packets that have all the information that was requested and the sunshine request concerning the robbery. We're going to give those packets first of all to those agencies that have made the sunshine request, and then anybody else who wants them. I think we have enough to give out. We've got quite a few. I'm sorry. The officer that was involved in the shooting of Michael Brown was Darren Wilson. He's been a police officer for six years, has had no disciplinary action taken against him. He was treated for injuries which occurred on Saturday. Again, I won't be taking any questions at this time, but the packets will be handed out by officers. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The name? 

JACKSON: The name is Darren, d-a-r-re-n. Wilson, w-i-l-s-o-n. Thank you and I'll see you again soon. 

(SHOUTING) 

COSTELLO: Alright, you can hear the reporters shouting questions at the police chief, but says he's not going to take any questions. He gave out very little information, really. But he supposedly handed out these packets with much more information. Ana Cabrera, you're on the scene. Can you hear me yet? Ana? 

CABRERA: I can hear you, Carol, yes. Do you have me? 

COSTELLO: Did you get one of those packets? 

CABRERA: I have not received one of those packets, but we do have reporters and producers who are there getting those packets from the police chief as he's handing those out. Now remember, the packets of information, as he just mentioned, that he is handing out, have to do with a request, an open records request, that several media outlets have put out there trying to get as much information they can about what led up to the shooting, and the shooting incident itself. 

Now, the information in those packets did not have to do directly with the shooting itself. Could it be related? We'll have to wait and see, but it is about a robbery that happened on the same day that Michael Brown died, and there has been sort of a buzz about a robbery having taken place before his shooting. We now learned that it was at a convenience store that was not this QuikTrip. Many people had believed it had happened at this QuikTrip early on. 

However, the tie-in here is that that robbery happened just within the moments before Michael Brown's death, that dispatch had put out there that there had been a report of a strong-arm robbery at the other convenience store, not far from here, and the suspect in that reported armed robbery had come in the direction of the QuikTrip. So that may be the connection to where we are at, and this QuikTrip is really just blocks away from where Michael Brown was shot and killed, Carol. 

COSTELLO: Alright.

CABRERA So that is the information about that robbery that has been released, and now we also have the name of the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, who was also responding to that robbery earlier in the day. His name is Darren Wilson. He is a six-year veteran of this police department, and the police chief also saying that there were no disciplinary actions taken against this officer in his history of the police department. 

I also know, talking to the police chief the other day, he described this police officer as somebody who is a nice young man, as he put it, who is always respectful, has good manners. Again, no disciplinary problems and that his reaction to what has happened, both the shooting and the protests that have followed, the police chief tells me that he was absolutely horrified. He said nobody wants to go to work and take another person's life and nobody wants to come home knowing that they killed someone. So he said he has been really torn up about what has happened in the community and his own actions of killing somebody, Carol. 

COSTELLO: All right, Ana Cabrera. You stand by. I want to go to Don Lemon. If you read between the lines here, Don, it seems as if the person who committed this strong-arm robbery matched the description of Michael Brown. 

DON LEMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, let me explain what was going on here because it may be a bit confusing to viewers. Why would he be talking about a strong-arm robbery? Why would he be talking about video? So on that same day there was allegedly a robbery at a convenience store and there is videotape, or surveillance video, of that robbery at a convenience store. 

Now, according to sources, they believe the person on this videotape, the surveillance video, is Michael Brown. And they're also saying a strong-arm robbery. What does that mean? Either by force or using a weapon. This convenience store was not the QT, not the one that is burned down, not the one that is close to Canfield Drive, close to that apartment complex where Michael Brown lives. So one would -- you would have to draw the conclusion, as you said, the reason that they would talk about this in this press conference is that they believe that in that videotape that they are going to release because of the sunshine law request, that they believe that Michael Brown is in this video, part of this robbery, and that is ultimately why he was stopped on the street. 

When he talks about a description, a description of the suspect was given, he said the officer was on a sick call 11:48. Then at 11:51, a 911 call came from a convenience store. 11:52, the dispatch gave a description. Then he said a little bit later on, dispatch gave a more detailed description, right? Then at 12:01 the officer left the sick call and then he came into confrontation with Michael Brown on Canfield Drive. The whole reason that they're talking about this is because what he is insinuating here is that Michael Brown was involved in that robbery and the video tape will show that, thus the confrontation happening on the street. Michael Brown losing his life, carol. 

COSTELLO: Alright, and I know CNN has received one of those packets from the police chief. Hopefully we'll get that video so that we can show people what exactly he's talking about. Don Lemon, you stand by. I have to take a break. We'll be back with much more in the NEWSROOM. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COSTELLO: All right. The Ferguson police chief just released the name of the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown. His name is Darren Wilson. He's been a police officer for six years. No disciplinary action taken against him ever. He was treated for injuries on that Saturday when that tragedy happened. The police chief also talked about a strong-arm robbery that took place shortly before Michael Brown was killed. Don Lemon was getting into that for us, so tell us more, Don. 

LEMON: I have some new details. I just want to correct something I said quickly. He said a strong-arm, that means no weapon. That's why it says strong arm. Otherwise it would be an armed robbery. But here's what we have learned. In those packets that they are handing out they say because of the sunshine request, in that - - the video is in those packets. We'll get that on the air very shortly here so be patient and tell our viewers to be patient here. 

In the video, here's what you see, you see, I am told by producers and reporters who have viewed the videotape, that you can see the punch and then stealing of cigars is the accusation. Here's the interesting thing though, according to the witnesses and according to some of the police officers who have given press conferences, they are saying that Michael Brown was approached by the officer for walking in the middle of the street, and they mentioned nothing about a strong-arm robbery. A new development here. 

Some of us have heard about it earlier the possibility of a videotape of a robbery and it believed to be Michael Brown. We did not get confirmation from police on that. It was not reported. Or confirmation from any source on that, that was just a rumor. Now we're finding out from the Ferguson police chief that they do believe that they have video and they think that in that video that it is Michael Brown stealing cigars, punching the store clerk, but not at the QT. Not at the QuickTrip, or the convenience store which is closest to his house. This was at another store. 

COSTELLO: Don, why didn't the police chief come out and say that? Why didn't he just make it clear for us and for the community? 

LEMON: Well, hasn't that been the question that we have been struggling with here about transparency and about getting information. Because it would have been really easy for him in that press conference just then to explain the possible connection without really going into the investigation. All he had to have said is we have information which is in these sunshine request, in this videotape packet that I've given you, and according to that tape, that's in there, it appears to be Michael Brown on videotape at a convenience store in a strong-arm robbery. It would have been very easy for him to say that and not take any questions about that. That's been the question all along. That's a good question for the police chief. I can't answer that for you, Carol. 

COSTELLO: I know. Don Lemon, Pamela Brown, Joey Jackson, Carissa McGraw (ph) stick around. The next hour of CNN NEWSROOM after a break. ",NA,NA,NA,NA

I'm Wolf Blitzer.

You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.

ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.

BLITZER: Let's get right to the breaking news. Major new developments in the case capturing world attention. Police in Ferguson, Missouri have dropped a bombshell, alleging the shooting victim, Michael Brown, was a suspect in a convenience store robbery.

But hours later, they said the officer who shot him, now identified as 2-year-old Darren Wilson, didn't know Brown was a robbery suspect.

All of this has critics accusing police of trying to damage Michael Brown's character.

We're covering all angles of the breaking news this hour with our reporters and our guests.

Let's begin with our national correspondent, Jason Carroll.

He's in Ferguson, Missouri, of course -- so, Jason -- let's get the very latest from Jason.

JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The new security camera video released by the Ferguson Police Department shows a confrontation with a store clerk inside a convenience store at 11:52:00 a.m. last Saturday. According to police, Michael Brown was inside the convenience store with his friend, Dorian Johnson, committing a so- called ""strong-armed robbery."" Police say Brown aggressively pulls the clerk in close to him and then immediately pushes him back into a display rack. Police said he stole a box of $49 cigars.

There were no weapons used, but Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the robbery was not related to the shooting incident that killed Michael Brown.

CHIEF THOMAS JACKSON, FERGUSON POLICE DEPARTMENT: This robbery does not relate to the initial contact between the officer and Michael Brown.

CARROLL: Police say they released the video of the convenience store robbery today because the press asked for it.

Earlier, Chief Jackson described what happened after the robbery.

JACKSON: At 11:51, there was a 911 call from a convenience store nearby. At 11:52, dispatch gave a description of a robbery suspect over the radio.

At 12:01 p.m., our officer encountered Michael Brown on Canfield Drive.

At 12:04, a second officer arrived on the scene immediately following the shooting.

CARROLL: After almost a week of silence, the officer involved in the shooting was identified -- Darren Wilson, a white 28-year-old who has served on the force for six years, and, according to the department, has no disciplinary actions taken against him.

He was treated for injuries which occurred during the altercation on Saturday.

JACKSON: He had no complaints. He was a...

(CROSSTALK)

JACKSON: -- he was a gentle, quiet man. He was a distinguished officer.

CARROLL: Police say Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown in the convenience store and when Brown was shot and killed, will not be charged in the store robbery.

The dramatic developments follow a night of relative calm streets and peaceful demonstrations. To sway the tide of violent altercations, Missouri's governor put state Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson in charge of keeping the peace.

CNN was with Captain Johnson as he arrived on the scene.

CAPT. RON JOHNSON, MISSOURI HIGHWAY PATROL: I want to go down here and kind of and get an assessment of what the mood is.

CARROLL: First, a reallocation of forces.

JOHNSON: And I'm not going to take a chance. I'm going to have you guys turn around and go back to the McDonald's, both of you. And then I'll call you when I need you.

CARROLL: Then came time to meet the demonstrators.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm so proud of you (INAUDIBLE). Appreciate you, sir.

CARROLL (on camera): What do you make of all of this crowd, all of these people surrounding you like this, in this way, supporting you?

JOHNSON: Well, I know the good people that live in this community. And I've lived here 48 years of my life. And so I know we've got good people in this community.

CARROLL (voice-over): But despite the positive influence of Captain Johnson, as details emerge, questions remain.

How did that an alleged unarmed convenience store robbery end in a scene like this?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you see (INAUDIBLE)?

Do you see anything that would have caused a threat to these (EXPLETIVE LANGUAGE) police (INAUDIBLE) because they want (INAUDIBLE)?

(END VIDEO TAPE)

CARROLL: And an attorney representing the Brown family says the release of that have convenience store video changes nothing about what they allege, which is that a Ferguson police officer shot an unarmed man -- Wolf.

BLITZER: Jason Carroll, thanks very much for that report.

Let's go to CNN's Don Lemon.

He's also in Ferguson for us -- Don. I understand you had a chance to speak with the police chief, clarify some of these issues.

What did he say?

DON LEMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, absolutely. Wolf, you and I have been talking about the -- about the inconsistencies that have been going on here with the press conferences and especially what's in the incident reports, as well.

Why did they release the videotape of this alleged robbery on the same day they released the officer's name?

I got some clarification about that.

Essentially what he says is it was not -- it wasn't an easy decision, that he was getting pressured to release the name of the officer and they thought that they would get some lawsuits over that, so they figured they would -- they may as well go ahead and release both of them at the same time.

When I asked him, I said, but you -- you didn't clarify if the two were related.

And it turns out -- and everyone assumed that they were related, and rightfully so, he said.

But he said, you know, he should have done a better job.

And he said it was just no good choice in doing it. He had to do it. And he figured if he was going to have to do one, he should do the other.

The rest of that interview will air tonight 9:00 p.m. Eastern here on CNN, when I host a very special edition of ""A.C. 360.""

I talked to him about other things, as well, Wolf. And there are going to be some revelations about this officer. I asked him some questions about this officer and prior work assignments that you'll want to hear in this interview.

But regarding those inconsistencies and regarding that videotaping released today, the entire community here is upset over that. They're thinking it's a character assassination on the victim and it's essentially blaming the victim.

And you can hear the protests starting to ramp up now behind me. The horns are honking. We're right across from the police station.

Protesters are -- with bullhorns are behind us now. And the family -- a family member of Michael Brown just held an impromptu press conference in front of the police station, as well, reiterating what you read earlier and the family statement and said what the attorney told me here on CNN, as well.

BLITZER: Don, it sounds like the family and their lawyers, they're pretty angry that the police released this videotape, the still pictures, the police report of the robbery -- the alleged robbery at the convenience store. The video showing what they say is Michael Brown, in effect, pushing the clerk, stealing some -- allegedly stealing some cigars and walking out.

They're angry it was released because it tends, obviously, to smear, if you will, to make him look pretty bad.

LEMON: Right.

BLITZER: We show the picture right there of him pushing that clerk aside and then threatening him as he walks out the door with the cigars.

And so they're pretty angry this came out today.

The question is this, what should we be bracing for tonight? LEMON: Well, that's -- that is the question. And I can't answer that question now. But when I spoke to the people earlier, when we were at the QT, where those protests have been emanating from, the bases -- the base of the protests, most people said that they were going to be -- it was going to be non-violent.

You heard Ron Johnson, who is now in charge of this, from the Missouri Highway Patrol saying -- asking for calm and really promising, in as many words, that there would not be violence tonight, or asking people not to be violent this evening, especially after the sun went down.

But also, you know, when I spoke to the police chief about releasing it, you know, the videotape, as well as the officer's name, he said, listen, I knew that there was going to be controversy. I knew that there was going to be some uproar about it. And he said because it was going to be seen as a character assassination and a deflection. But he said that I had no other choice. I just had to -- there was no good choice and that's what I had to do, so I did it and got it all out of the way -- Wolf.

BLITZER: And the lawyers for the family, they are conceding that the man in that video in the convenience store was, in fact, Michael Brown, right?

LEMON: Yes. Yes, the lawyers are conceding that. And point blank, I asked the police chief, the Ferguson police chief, that. And he says he does believe it is Michael Brown.

BLITZER: Don Lemon will be back with us later.

Don, thanks very much.

Let's get some more on the investigation.

Joining us, our law enforcement analyst, Tom Fuentes, and our justice correspondent, Pamela Brown.

What are you hearing from your sources, first of all, Pamela, about Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown?

PAMELA BROWN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we learned today, Wolf, that St. Louis County detectives have interviewed Darren Wilson, that officer involved in the shooting, twice since the shooting occurred, one right after the shooting and then a second, more thorough, longer interview shortly after the shooting, within the next 48 hours after.

So the initial interview was very brief. We've learned -- it was obviously a very chaotic time and traumatic for the officer. And so that was more of a brief interview. And then there was the -- the longer interview.

As far as what the officer said, the officials that I've been speaking with won't share that information. But we know just from what the police chief said earlier this week that the officer's account is that there was a confrontation between him and Brown and they were tussling over the gun. So, of course, that's what we've learned just from what the police chief said.

But what investigators are really going to be focused on and what Tom can attest to is they're going to be looking at did the officer, based on what he's telling investigators, take reasonable action considering the circumstances?

Did he fear for his life?

BLITZER: What do you make of the videos that -- the videotape that has been released from the convenience store showing this alleged robbery, and, if you will, some sort of push back or assault on the clerk?

TOM FUENTES, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, I think the fact that they're conceding that it was Michael Brown, the family is conceding it, it does indicate that he's not an angel, that he would be capable of some violent act, at some level, pushing the clerk as he does in that store. And that maybe he could, you know, also push or get into an altercation with a police officer. So I think that from that standpoint.

But, you know, what -- the big thing that we wanted to know early was, what did Officer Wilson know about those two individuals walking down the street?

Was he aware that they were suspects in a robbery that had just occurred.

BLITZER: The police chief says no, he wasn't.

FUENTES: Now he says no. So now we know what was in -- or what wasn't in Officer Wilson's mind.

But now it adds to the thing, what's in Michael Brown's mind?

If he knows he's had this altercation, if he knows that he did what he did at the convenience store, that could change how he perceives -- he might assume that Officer Wilson knows he has just committed that robbery and that maybe he's going to get arrested, maybe there's going to be more to it. It's not just two guys being told get up on the sidewalk and off the street.

BLITZER: And so the...

FUENTES: So it's very important what's in the mind of Officer Wilson at the beginning of the incident.

What's in the mind of Michael Brown when this thing starts?

BLITZER: Yes. We're never going to know what's in the mind of Michael Brown, because he's dead.

But we -- there are his -- his friend Dorian, was there with him, he's already been questioned. I interviewed him earlier in the week. He told me exactly what he recalls happened. He never told me about what was going on in the convenience store a few minutes earlier. But, presumably, he'll have an explanation of what's going on there.

FUENTES: Yes. I would expect so.

BLITZER: He's one of the eyewitnesses.

FUENTES: Yes.

BLITZER: And the question is, will he be -- will he be telling the truth?

That would be one of the questions, if, in fact, the police officer is charged with homicide, if you will.

The argument being -- and you just heard the lawyers make the argument -- that let's say they did get into a fight in the car, for whatever reason. Let's say Michael Brown was, in fact, trying to reach in for the police officer's weapon and he was shot in the car.

But then he runs away and then he gets his hands up and he gives up. If the police officer then, with his hands up in the air, goes ahead and fires some more rounds, what does that mean?

FUENTES: That means if they can prove that that, that officer is probably going to prison, because when a suspect, even if they're armed, even if Michael Brown had a gun, even if he shot at the police, if he throws the gun down and throws his hands in the air, if that turns out to be true -- in this case, he didn't have a gun. But if he did, even, once the suspect surrenders, it's over. The police officer can no longer be justified in deadly force. And that will be the issue here.

So you really have two issues -- the altercation at the police car where the first shot is fired, but now, down -- you know, further down the street, where Officer Wilson now goes to where Brown is and fires additional shots into him when witnesses say he was possibly surrendering. That's the important thing for investigators -- can they prove or disprove that he was, in fact, surrendering?

BLITZER: Because there are two -- at least two witnesses who say they did see him raise his hands to surrender and then he was shot afterwards.

But forensically, how -- how do you prove that, let's say you don't believe these two witnesses?

FUENTES: Well, that's going to be difficult to prove. There's no video of it that we know of. There's no audio of that altercation that we know of.

Now, you'll have an indication of the first shot, because there would be -- a shot in close proximity at the police car door would leave powder burns. I mean he would literally be burnt from the powder and the flame that comes out of the barrel of the gun.

Now, down the street, it will be a little harder to tell whether or not the police officer was real close to him. And secondly, the autopsy will show whether the additional bullets started as shots to the back. They'll be able to determine entry wounds, if it was to the back first, and then after Brown turns around and supposedly tries to surrender, they'll be able to see entry wounds into his chest...

BLITZER: Yes.

FUENTES: -- as the witnesses say.

BLITZER: Tom Fuentes, thanks very much.

Pamela Brown, thanks to you, as well.

Much more on the breaking news.

The new allegation that Michael Brown was a robbery suspect.

Does that really change anything?

Our legal experts, they are standing by. We'll discuss.

And will there be more protests?

We're going back live to Ferguson for more on what people are saying there now about these dramatic new developments in the case.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BLITZER: We're following the breaking news. A series of bombshell revelations in the Michael Brown shooting, including allegations by police that the teenager was a robbery suspect. But they say the officer who shot and killed him didn't know that. 

The officer's been identified as 28-year-old Darren Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson Police Department. Let's dig deeper with our guests, CNN legal analyst, the criminal defense attorney Mark O'Mara; criminal defense attorney Mawuli Davis; and Ronald Hosko, the former assistant director of the FBI's criminal investigative division. 

Ron, let me start with you. What do you make of the fact that the family has now acknowledged that the individual in that alleged robbery in the convenience store was, in fact, Michael Brown? What does that say about this case? 

RONALD HOSKO, FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, FBI'S CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION: I think it's significant in a number of ways, not the least of which, and Tom Fuentes just mentioned it, it's relevant in what's in the mind of the officer who fired his weapon at Mr. Brown. It's also very relevant what's in Mr. Brown's mind. 

BLITZER: The officer didn't know that the man that he shot and killed had been in that alleged robbery in the convenience store. 

HOSKO: Right. So that's important here. Why was the officer pulling up on Mr. Brown? Why did the encounter start is relevant to the bigger picture here in whether he did wrong or not. 

BLITZER: Because the sheriff, the police chief in Ferguson says he was pulled over -- this is the account of the police chief -- because Brown and his friend were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic. So he pulled him over. 

HOSKO: Assuming that's correct, that is a potential violation of law. And it doesn't mean he doesn't have the right to pull him over or try to move him out of traffic or move him out of being a threat. But it is significant if he didn't hear the transmissions about the strong- arm robbery and he wasn't responding to it. 

BLITZER: Mark, what do you think about these latest developments that the police officer who shot and killed Ron, he didn't know about the alleged robbery at the convenience store. But Brown obviously would know about the alleged robbery. That would be in his mind if he's being pulled over by the cops. 

MARK O'MARA, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Exactly because Michael Brown may have reacted thinking he was being pulled over because of the robbery even if the officer wasn't aware of it. So how Michael Brown is going to react to it is very significant. Whether or not they had any information as to why he pulled him over, if Michael Brown is going to react in some way, thinking he's being pulled over for a robbery, and the officer has no idea what's going on, then it's going to be that miscommunication, and it's going to be even more concern between the two of them when the first interaction starts. 

BLITZER: Mawuli, what's your -- what's your sense of what happened? 

MAWULI DAVIS, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: My concern is that this already does not change anything fundamentally when you deal with someone being stopped for jaywalking and then being fired upon. So what Mr. Brown was doing prior to being stopped by the officer, I think really it doesn't play that much of a factor in the shooting itself. I think that's what we should stay focused on. 

BLITZER: But what if the account by the police officer supposedly he's arguing that, when he pulled him over, that Michael Brown went for his gun and tried to resist. That's when the gun was fired. What about that argument that apparently the police officer in question here is making? 

DAVIS: Well, I think that may allow...

O'MARA: I'm sorry. 

BLITZER: Go ahead, Mawuli. 

DAVIS: I think the problem with that is when they initially engage, if the -- if Mr. Brown is no longer a threat, then there should -- he should not have fired his weapon. If he puts his hands up, he's no longer a threat. The weapon should not have been fired. That's the analysis that I think is it important. 

While we can look at what happened leading up to the fatal shot, I think we still have to look at what happens when his hands are up. If his hands are up and he's shot, that's -- he's no longer a threat and that officer should not have fired. 

BLITZER: Ron, you agree with that. Even if there had been an altercation, some contested fight within the vehicle itself and even if a shot had been fired in the vehicle, once he leaves and once he throws his hands up in the air, he should not be shot again? 

HOSKO: Well, generally, that's exactly true. However, there is a lot of ifs in your statement and Mawuli's. And that's the point of an investigation. What did happen? Not if, if, if. We need to find out what did happen. 

And if there were rounds fired or a gunshot that was fired in close proximity, there's going to be an indication of that. If Mr. Brown's hands were on the officer's gun, there could well be an indication of that. His fingerprints could still be on the gun. 

How far he got away, the distance of the shell casings, is going to be relevant to prove distance. All those factors are going to be brought to bear to give us a fuller perspective of what happened. 

BLITZER: That's why your former colleagues at the FBI are involved in this investigation right now. 

Mark, the -- there are eyewitness accounts who say they did see the Michael Brown raise his hands after he left the vehicle. He was shot once or twice in the vehicle. After he left, he did put his hands up. I guess the point is, you're going to believe those eyewitnesses? 

O'MARA: Well, you know, witnesses can get things wrong. They can hear other witnesses' testimony and decide to bring that into their own. But here's what's going to be very important, and Ron sort of touched on it. The forensics in a case like this are going to be very, very important. 

And here's why, for an example. One of the witness said that the officer was within three feet of Michael Brown when he shot and the hands are up. If that fact is true, then there's going to be stippling on Michael Brown's arms, and it's going to be on the arms as they would be up. And that could be very significant evidence that he did, in fact, have his hands up. If the stippling is on with his hands down or another location, that's going to show something exactly different. 

So we need to wait. We do not know what was going on. I think it was a huge mistake for the cops to release this information piecemeal the way it does. It just allows for speculation. 

You need to wait till the investigation is over. Let the FBI and the other agencies do what they want, because we need to do this transparently. But that doesn't mean let it out every moment you get it. It means that the agencies that are involved should be talking and the families' representatives should be involved and let's do it right the first time. 

BLITZER: Very quickly, Mawuli, what do you want to hear right now? What do you want to hear?

DAVIS: I want to know the distance of the shooting, because the stippling typically is a foot and a half to three feet away. And if there's no stippling, then if this officer is seven or eight feet away, and Mr. Brown is unarmed, then how was he a threat? That's what we need to determine. That's what we need to see. So I agree. There needs to be more evaluation of the evidence so that we can have a clearer picture. But with hands up, that's not a threat. Not at all. 

BLITZER: Mawuli Davis, Ron Hosko, Mark O'Mara, guys, thanks very much. 

Coming up, more on the breaking news. The man now in charge of security at Ferguson reveals how he defused a very, very tense situation. The state trooper, Captain Ron Johnson, talks to CNN's Jake Tapper. Jake is standing by to join us live. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BLITZER: We're following the breaking news. Sources now telling CNN the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown has been interviewed twice by detectives. He's now been identified as 28-year-old Darren Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson Police Department. 

CNN's Jake Tapper, the host of ""THE LEAD,"" is in Ferguson for us. 

Jake, what's the latest over there? 

JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR, ""THE LEAD WITH JAKE TAPPER"": Well, it has been a more quiet period since Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol was appointed to be in charge of security here. And in fact, he has been walking with people. He has been talking to people at a press conference earlier today. He invited community members to come up and sit among the reporters and ask him and the governor questions. 

And in fact, there was one interesting moment. I asked him about today, from yesterday, when he saw some people who looked young men, who looked kind of angry to put it lightly and he directly approached them. Take a listen. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CAPT. RON JOHNSON, MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL: Well, walking behind them I could hear their anger. And you know, I kind of went over to talk to them and just have some discussion with them and really have to give us a chance, and to let them know that I've got a son that looks just like them. 

You know, many of them talked that they had tattoos and things like that. And I told them my son has some tattoos. So I just my son is just like you and I said give us a chance. And I said, you know, there's a new day coming. There's going to be some honest interaction with you. And I said I just didn't want to walk past him. I walked over to them because I wanted to hear what they had to say. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: Captain Johnson trying to directly talk to some young men who looked angry to say the least. But his approach seems to have worked at least for now. Last night, however, boisterous it was, and you can hear the horns honking people showing their support here as people get off work in St. Louis and Ferguson, showing their support but doing so in a completely peaceful way. 

Interesting also, Wolf, this sight here of the Quick Trip Convenience Store that was burned down over the weekend with some of the protests turned violent. People have taken to writing in chalk messages about their feelings about what this week has come to mean to them and among the chance, ""no justice, no peace,"" the people have written down and ""hands up, don't shoot,"" ""RIP Michael Brown,"" one rather poignant statement right here on the ground, ""Black men do matter."" It says right here. 

It's a message that for a lot of members of the community is really what the protests have been all about. Mike Brown and other young men in the African-American community here in Ferguson and across the country, they want the United States' power structure to acknowledge we do matter -- Wolf. 

BLITZER: Yesterday at this time, they were beginning to gather for what turned out to be very peaceful protests. Are we seeing something similar now? 

TAPPER: Yes, it's exactly the same people are boisterous, they are -- they are effusive with what they're trying to say. But so far completely peaceful demonstrations. 

I should note when I say peaceful, I mean nonviolent. I don't mean that it's quiet here. It is certainly not quiet here as anybody watching our coverage last night can attest. It is a rather boisterous crowd. But so far so good. Captain Ron Johnson and his message of talking to people and listening to them really seems to have assuaged many members of the community that there is somebody here now listening to them.

Also the fact that there aren't any more mine resistant trucks, tear gas and rubber bullets being fired at them. That helps, too -- Wolf. 

BLITZER: Certainly it does. All right, Jake, thanks very much. Jake Tapper in Ferguson. 

Let's get some more now with Antonio French. He sits on the St. Louis Board of Aldermen. 

Alderman French, thanks very much for joining us. So what did you make of today's developments, specifically the police chief there in Ferguson, Police Chief Jackson, announcing at his news conference that Michael Brown was actually stopped by that police officer for blocking traffic, not for robbing a convenience store for a box of cigars? 

ANTONIO FRENCH, ST. LOUIS ALDERMAN: Yes, I think what we saw today was just another example of how the local Ferguson officials are really in over their head. While people were expecting and were demanding the name of the officer who killed Michael Brown, that the police chief chose to release that other information at the same time just shows that he really doesn't have a handle on just how tense things are out there. 

I'm really happy that Captain Johnson is now on the ground and taking charge. What we did learn, though, is that the Ferguson police chief didn't consult with Captain Johnson before he decided to release that information at the same time. So, you know, I think it kind of took away a little bit of the good momentum we had from last night. But I remain hopeful that we're going to have another peaceful night here in Ferguson. 

BLITZER: I hope this is going to be a peaceful, as well. 

Alderman, you think that they released -- they obviously released the name of the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown. Do you think they released the other information, the videotape, these pictures, the police reports of the alleged robbery at the convenience store, they released simultaneously it to help that police officer? Is it that what you're suggesting? 

FRENCH: Well, I don't know what the intention was but I know what the result was. The result was that they angered people again. And that's not something we really want to see right now. It served no positive constructive purpose to release that information especially at the same time as you were releasing the information that we were asking for. And in fact, what it really does is help sully the reputation of a dead young man who should be living and going to college right now. 

BLITZER: But when you look at the video, And I'm sure you've seen it, we've all seen it now several times and the family and the family's lawyers have now confirmed that is in fact Michael Brown. He's going in there and allegedly taking cigars, not paying for the cigars, walking out and pushing the clerk, throwing the clerk to the -- the clerk side, as he well then coming back in and threatening him a bit before leaving once again. It obviously does not speak well of Michael Brown. 

FRENCH: Well, this really isn't new information. I posted a video on YouTube and on Twitter a couple of days ago where a young man in his kitchen is shooting this video and explaining what he saw. And he describes that Mike Brown and a friend had just stolen some cigarettes or some cigars from a local place and they were walking home. In the video he said that they didn't think that police were after them. And in fact, they were just walking casually home when they encounter this officer. 

So it's really not new information. And even after the second press conference under questioning the chief admitted it was really unrelated that the officer didn't stop him because of anything having to do with this incident. 

BLITZER: Yes. The police chief in Ferguson said he was stopped because he was blocking traffic. If you will, jaywalking. All right. Alderman French, thanks very much for joining us. We

appreciate it. 

We're going to have much more on what's going on in Ferguson right now. We're standing by to see how the demonstrations develop, what's going to happen in the next few hours. 

Also, Michael Brown's family is calling for calm even as they denounced the police for releasing this video, pictures showing Brown allegedly robbing a convenience store. 

Also there's other disturbing news we're following here in THE SITUATION ROOM. It's breaking in Iraq. We're getting word of a new ISIS massacre. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BLITZER: We continue to watch the dramatic events unfolding in Missouri. But there's some other very disturbing news that's breaking in Iraq right now. We're hearing reports of mass killings and abductions after a new ISIS raid on a Yazidi village about a dozen miles or so from Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq. 

Our Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr is joining us, she has more on this new ISIS threat. 

What have we learned, Barbara? 

BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, a short time ago, the U.S. Central Command announced it did carry out airstrikes in that region after receiving reports that villagers were under attack by ISIS. ISIS now at unprecedented strength and for the U.S. intelligence community, the crucial question, how far will the group go? 

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

STARR (voice-over): This video appears to show Iraqi police taking down an ISIS flag, defiant against the brutal Islamic militants the U.S. intelligence community now calls a credible alternative to al Qaeda. 

After days of U.S. airstrikes, ISIS fighters in Iraq may be in hiding in some places, the U.S. says. Its leader Abu-Bakr Al-Baghdadi may have fled back to Syria. But more than one million Iraqis now on the run from ISIS according to the U.N. It's still grabbing territory and bolstering its ranks across northern Iraq and in next door Syria. 

SETH JONES, RAND CORPORATION: It's now increased to well over 10,000 fighters. So it does appear to have increased in numbers. It appears to be wealthier. 

STARR: The U.S. intelligence community now doing a new assessment. Trying to calculate how many fighters ISIS has including foreign fighters mainly in Syria. And how many may be Americans. 

The worry for the U.S., Westerners trained by ISIS could return home and plot attacks. 

JEH JOHNSON, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We're concerned about those -- this type of organization which is very dangerous and probably wants to try to prove itself in one way or another. Could go further along in its efforts to attack our homeland. 

STARR: U.S. intelligence agencies worry the momentum has brought ISIS thousands of new fighters now armed with heavy weapons from abandoned Iraqi military bases. But ISIS is not unstoppable at least in Iraq. 

JONES: ISIS is not 10 feet tall. It's vulnerable in part because its ideology does not appear to be well supported among Iraq's even Sunni population. 

STARR: An even bigger problem for ISIS, its place in the jihad movement. So far many of al Qaeda's strongest affiliate organizations in Yemen, North Africa and Somalia have not sworn their allegiance. 

(END VIDEOTAPE)

STARR: And many U.S. experts believe that ISIS and al Qaeda will someday fight it out for leadership of the global jihad movement. And that may be very good news for the United States. The feeling is, let them fight it out between themselves. As long as they're fighting, they won't be attacking the homeland -- Wolf. 

BLITZER: Barbara Starr, at the Pentagon, thanks very much. 

So how much should the United States be involved in combating the threat still posed by ISIS? With us now our National Security analyst, the former CIA operative Bob Baer. 

Bob, thanks for joining us. I know you're working to try to bring some Iraqi Sunnis to the United States to make their case, I guess, against ISIS right now. But how much of a threat does ISIS really represent? 

ROBERT BAER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, if it holds on Anbar Province which includes Mosul, establishes flows of income, really sets up an army, continues to grab more equipment, and take more land and hold onto the Mosul dam, it's a threat we've never seen before against this country of the West. It's much more potent than al Qaeda. It's the replacement for al Qaeda. 

So the longer this goes on, the longer it stands to continue, to exist. I mean, we really have to get serious about it and this new election of the new prime minister Abadi is a good sign. The Iranians cooperating with the United States. Now it's a question of bringing the Sunnis who stand against ISIS and get them to start fighting, as well. This is going to be a long-term battle. But there is no choice at this point. 

BLITZER: Because a lot of the Sunnis in Iraq apparently are sympathetic to ISIS. ISIS being Sunni and they're fighting the Christians, the Shiites, the Kurds, the Yazidis. All this other groups. So how do you beat ISIS? What needs to be done? BAER: First of all, we have to arm the Kurds. They have to be able

to defend themselves. They have to be able to hit ISIS all across the north. Secondly, you set up and start arming the Sunnis that are against ISIS. Let them go back in. 

What you don't want, Wolf is a Shia army or a Christian army or Kurdish Army going into the Sunni areas. That will alienate the population more. You let -- make the Sunnis take back their own part of Iraq. And I think that's doable. What we need is a reprise of the awakening which in 2007 destroyed al Qaeda. It's possible to bring that back right now. 

BLITZER: It's going to take a long of time, though. It's going to be a lot of hard work. 

Bob Baer, thanks very much. 

Coming up, we're watching the latest developments on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri. Michael Brown's family now calling for all the people there to remain calm even though it's been a day of some serious anger and lots of confusion. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BLITZER: Good evening. Our eyes on the breaking news as protesters now gathering in Ferguson, Missouri. You're looking at live pictures coming in. Much more of what's going on there and it's coming up in a few minutes, right at the top of the hour. 

Ferguson is just one of the many crises that has been interrupting President Obama's vacation. 

Our senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta is with the president on Martha's Vineyard. 

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Even as President Obama pedaled off with the first family and teed off on the golf courses of Martha's Vineyard, it's been the kind of vacation that could use a mulligan. The clashes in Ferguson, the crisis in Iraq. 

HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Yes, we're looking forward to it. 

ACOSTA: Even an attack from Hillary Clinton CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin summed it all up perfectly. 

JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: The president of the United States who appears to be on the vacation from hell. 

ACOSTA (on camera): Has it been the vacation from hell? 

ERIC SCHULTZ, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Jim, I look around here. I'm not sure I'd use that label. But I do think the president has been juggling both the idea of getting a respite, getting some breaks, taking some downtime and recharging his batteries with staying engaged. 

ACOSTA (voice-over): That means staying in contact with top administration officials Susan Rice and Attorney General Eric Holder, plus a dozen different phone calls with world leaders. 

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar. 

ACOSTA: And two trips in front of the cameras. 

DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: He got fires burning everyone. It's not surprising that the president has to keep on putting on a sport coat or a suit and go out in front of the cameras as he has done. 

ACOSTA: In response to critics who've accused the president of vacationing while the world burns, Mr. Obama's defenders say consider his predecessor. 

The president has taken 125 partial or complete days off. Still well behind George W. Bush's 407, according to CBS White House correspondent and statistician Mark Knoller. 

GERGEN: I think most Americans can give the president a break for going on vacation. It's a tough job. We may not like what he's doing sometimes but he deserves R and R. 

ACOSTA: A few unauthorized photos on this crowded island later posted by the ""Daily Caller"" have found the president cutting a rug on the dance floor and sitting down if not hugging it out with Clinton. 

CLINTON: We have disagreements as any partners and friends as we are might very well have. 

ACOSTA: With the crisis in Iraq and Ferguson cooling down at least for the moment, who knows, the president might actually start enjoying himself. 

SCHULTZ: He's had a few rounds of golf. I wouldn't be surprised if he has a few more before he leaves. 

(END VIDEOTAPE)

ACOSTA: Now the White House is still being secretive about what the president will be up to when he returns to the Washington, back to the White House on Sunday night for meetings there on Monday and Tuesday before coming back to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday night. Aides are downplaying any expectations for major news. 

And as you know, Wolf, that kind of guidance is only par for the course when it comes to covering the president -- Wolf. 

BLITZER: Of course. Par for the course. Key words. 

All right. Thanks very much, Jim Acosta, for that report. 

Coming up, more on the controversial new surveillance video police say shows Michael Brown robbing a convenience store. We're going live to Ferguson, Missouri. What that city is facing tonight. 

You're looking at live pictures as the protesters gather.

slit her 13-year-old daughter`s throat with a razor blade shows up in court smiling and winking like she`s won the mother of the year award. 

Tonight, cracking the mystery of why this woman -- yes, that`s her in court there grinning -- would allegedly do the unthinkable to her own flesh and

Good evening. I`m Jane Velez-Mitchell coming to you live.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ms. Smith, are you able to hear what`s happening here in court today? 

JESSICA SMITH, ACCUSED OF KILLING TODDLER, SLASHING TEEN: Yes, your honor, I am. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Polite, put together, even winking at one point. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The charges against her: in the death of her 2-year-old daughter Isabella and the wounding of her 13-year-old daughter Alana, who 

suffered life-threatening cuts. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Left notes in the hotel room saying her baby, quote, ""didn`t suffer,"" a new detail. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Pointing to Jessica Smith drugging her 2-year-old daughter before the toddler drowned. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Unusually high level of a drug which I understand has a sedative affect. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Accused of harming her daughter the day he was supposed to turn the girls over to their dad. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So many hoping to know what this woman is thinking. 

(END VIDEOTAPE)

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Cops say this 40-year-old mother of two, Jessica Smith, drove her children from their home in Washington state to a hotel in Oregon 

with a plot to kill her beautiful daughters. Police found 2-year-old Isabella Smith dead, lying on a bed. Next to her, 13-year-old Alana Smith 

naked and bleeding, still alive but with her throat slit on both sides. Mommy dearest nowhere to be found. 

Two days and a massive manhunt later, Coast Guard arrested this mother about 15 miles away from the hotel crime scene. And now, shock and 

bafflement as the alleged child killer smiles and -- watch carefully -- she even winks during her court hearing. See for yourself. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ms. Smith, are you able to hear what`s happening here in court today? 

SMITH: Yes, your honor, I am. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You understand what`s happening in this discussion? 

SMITH: Yes. 

(END VIDEO CLIP) 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: You saw that wink. She seems so satisfied with herself. 

Cops suspect she was out for revenge against her ex-husband, who had just been awarded weekend visitation. That`s all, just weekend visitation, 

every other weekend, with their two daughters. 

Investigators say this woman e-mailed a 15-page letter to her ex-husband`s colleagues, detailing their, quote, ""horrible marriage"" on the very day 

cops found her two daughters inside that blood-smeared hotel room. Was this horrific slaughter a scorned woman`s giant vendetta campaign to get 

back at the man who left her after a long marriage? 

What do you think? Call me, 1-877-JVM-SAYS, 1-877-586-7297. 

And please, you can join the conversation by going to my Facebook page or talk to me on Twitter. Yes, we will read the Twitter comments tonight. 

Our Lion`s Den panel fired up and ready to debate. But straight first out to Maxine Bernstein, writer for ""The Oregonian."" What are you learning, 

Maxine, from these court documents, dozens and dozens, maybe even hundreds of pages, just released about a half an hour ago. What have found in them? 

MAXINE BERNSTEIN, WRITER, ""THE OREGONIAN"" (via phone): Actually, the court documents were released in the last two days. And yesterday Jessica Smith 

was arraigned on a grand jury indictment that charged her with aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder in the death of her 2-year-old, and 

attempted killing of her 13-year-old daughter. 

Also yesterday, the state medical examiner released the findings regarding the cause of death in the 2-year-old, Elizabeth`s -- I`m sorry, Isabella`s 

killing. And she found that the 2-year-old died from asphyxiation by drowning. She identified that as the main cause of the toddler`s death. 

Yet, she found what she called an intoxicating level of an antihistamine drug called chlorpheniramine in the girl`s bloodstream, indicating to her 

that the girl was sedated first before she was drowned. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes. And apparently, when they found this woman after a massive manhunt, they found near her some discarded bags, something that 

she had purchased at a drugstore, namely over-the-counter medicines that could have been the antihistamines that she allegedly used to sedate her 2-

year-old daughter before drowning the child, according to authorities. 

Speaking of authorities, I want to know from our panel tonight, did authorities drop the ball? I`m talking about the courts, CPS, police? 

Court documents revealed for weeks the husband had been extremely worried and was demanding a psychological evaluation of his wife, believing that 

she was trying to manipulate the kids, particularly the oldest, the 13- year-old daughter, into hating him. He says he got a very troubling voice mail from his 13-year-old daughter. 

Listen to that voice mail to dad, as read by one of our producers. Then we`ll debate it. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ""I`m so sick, I can hardly talk. I can`t sleep very well, because I`m tormented by the thought of you in our lives. It`s 

terrifying and cruel of you not to respect us.""

(END VIDEO CLIP) 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Lisa Bloom in the Lion`s Den, the husband claimed he hadn`t been able to see his daughters since mid-April, when he moved out of 

the family home and informed his wife he was interested in another woman. He went to court, again trying to get his girls, but he still didn`t get 

the custody. Yes, he was awarded custody. But by that time, those girls were in the hotel room in a blood-smeared hotel room. Could something have 

been done to prevent this debacle? 

LISA BLOOM, LEGAL ANALYST, AVVO.COM: Absolutely. I know from practicing family law every day here in Los Angeles that the system is broken. Judges 

tend to think everybody who`s going through a divorce is crazy. But it`s not true. 

There were warning signs here. Those messages from the 13-year-old, the mother clearly trying to alienate her two daughters from their father. The 

courts should have stepped in and protected these children while they still could have. 

Look at her. I mean, this is a woman who was clearly deranged. I`ve read the lengthy police affidavit. It`s very disturbing. She drowned her 

little 2-year-old. She got the 13-year-old involved in that, and then she slit the 13-year-old`s throat. The courts could have prevented this. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: And I want to clarify: he didn`t get custody. He got occasional visitation every other weekend. That`s what she was so upset 

about. He didn`t get custody, just occasional visitation, Brian Claypool. 

BRIAN CLAYPOOL, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Hey, Jane, I was on your show right when this story broke, and you made a great point. You said, why 

didn`t the judge bring her back into court immediately...

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes.

CLAYPOOL: ... after she missed that hearing? And I think Lisa is right. The courts have to step in. It`s not just CPS. It`s family law judges who 

are missing the boat or they are co-conspirators sometimes with the CPS to not protect the children. There should have been a warrant issued for her 

arrest right when she missed that hearing. And maybe this would have been averted. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Look at the timeline of the relationship between Jessica and her ex-husband. The couple married for 17 years. But way back in 

2000, court documents show the husband, Greg, accused his wife, Jessica, of cheating on him. They reconciled -- they reconciled; they had two 

daughters. 

November of last year, the husband eventually just says, ""You know what? I`m done with this marriage."" 

The couple, however -- and I think this is a very bad idea -- continued to live together under the same roof. Until five months later, this past 

spring, April, Greg moves out. He says he`s met another woman. He`s having coffee with her. He wants to pursue the relationship. 

OK. So let me go to Dr. Jeff Gardere, forensic psychologist. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. I hate that phrase, because I`m a woman. I`d 

like to believe I wouldn`t behave that way. But there seems to be a very clear connection between the husband rejecting this woman and leaving a 17-

year marriage and a campaign that this woman allegedly began to get her kids to hate him. And then ultimately did she attack her own children, 

allegedly, to get back at the father? 

DR. JEFF GARDERE, FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGIST: Look, obviously, anyone who`s scorned, not just a woman, may act out, may want to keep their children. 

The children become pawns in the marriage. 

But Lisa Bloom is absolutely correct. This is a woman who is mentally deranged. We don`t know if it goes to the level of legal insanity. But 

certainly, someone who`s been off kilter for a very, very long time. 

And now when you have such a volatile individual, perhaps with a severe personality disorder, she only decompensates. She gets worse when she`s 

scorned in this way. And then to now not to have the kids just for a weekend and feels that it`s a win for her husband, that kind of personality 

takes that as outright war, and the revenge is exacted on the children. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: It`s unbelievable. But I don`t understand, Midwin Charles, it`s a horrible thing to even ask. But if you`re going to seek 

revenge on the Midwest, why not go after the husband? Why go after your own flesh and blood? 

MIDWIN CHARLES, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Exactly. I mean, I always see in these kinds of cases where divorcing parents use the children as pawns. 

But I`ve never seen a parent go to the extent where they would kill the children just to prove the husband wrong or, in other words, just to hurt 

the husband and keep the children away from the husband. It just doesn`t make any sense at all. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Let`s look at the video from this woman -- OK -- at the hearing. She is in a yellow jail suit but looks like she`s wearing makeup 

and she`s apparently gotten her hair done. And there`s something really sick about her smile. This is a video conference where she`s talking to 

the judge. And look, she`s winking at the judge. Where is the grief for her dead toddler? Where is the concern for the teenage daughter she left 

with a split throat in a hotel room who thankfully has survived and is with relatives tonight? 

Tonight I want to go to our exclusive guest, Rachel Evans. Thank you for coming on, Rachel. I know this is difficult for you to talk about. But we 

want to get inside this woman`s psyche because we don`t understand how someone could allegedly -- she`s pleaded not guilty, even though cops say 

she confessed. But how someone could allegedly drown their own 2-year-old daughter and slit the throat of their 13-year-old. It just boggles the 

mind. 

Now, she babysat for you when you were much younger, about 13 years ago. And she was pregnant with her daughter who is now 13. Did you find 

anything at all odd about this woman when she was babysitting for you? 

RACHEL EVANS, WAS BABYSAT BY SUSPECT (via phone): Absolutely not. You know, we went there daily after school. And we would make cookies with 

her, and she`d comb her hair. She was very nice. I mean, you know, she seemed a little odd, but it wasn`t like a terrible... 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: In what way? What way was she odd? 

EVANS: They isolated themselves quite a bit. But we went to church together. So we would see each other at church. So... 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Who isolated? She -- you`re saying she -- she was married at the time? 

EVANS: Correct. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Because it`s a 17-year marriage. So she -- this is 13 years ago. She was pregnant for the -- for the daughter she`s now accused 

of slicing the neck of. 

EVANS: Yes. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: And the reason we`re asking you is look at her, even her mug shot. She looks like she`s smiling. She looks like she`s up for an 

award.

EVANS: Right.

VELEZ-MITCHELL: She doesn`t look like somebody who should be devastated. 

EVANS: Right. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: What do you make of seeing her laughing in court, smiling in court, winking in court? 

EVANS: You know, it`s just unbelievable. It`s disgusting. And you know, I have sympathy for Greg and Alana. It`s just heartbreaking. How can you 

get over something like that, you know? 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Well, what did you think of their marriage? Did they have a good marriage? 

EVANS: Well, Greg was in school, so we didn`t see much of him. But as far as I knew, yes. I mean, I was only 10. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Did she seem like a lady that gave you the creeps in any way, shape or form? 

EVANS: No. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: I mean, this woman is accused of really the unthinkable. 

EVANS: Yes, I know. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Sedating and drowning her 2-year-old daughter and then putting some kind of numbing lotion on her 13-year-old daughter`s neck and 

then slicing her daughter`s neck, who thankfully survived. That`s not somebody who`s normal. Somebody doesn`t go from zero to 100. There`s got 

to be something going on in this person`s past. 

EVANS: I agree.

VELEZ-MITCHELL: She babysat you. Can you think -- think over the commercial break -- we`re going to take a short break. I want you to think 

about any inkling, any clue that something was off with this woman. And on the other side of the break, we`re going to talk to you and try to get that 

answer, because at this point, I don`t understand it. 

Later, the Dog -- yes, Dog the Bounty Hunter -- is going to join us. He is on the hunt. He`s leading a nationwide manhunt for an MMA fighter accused 

of savagely beating his former girlfriend. This is an incredible story; it`s unfolding by the minute. I`m going to talk to Dwayne ""Dog"" the Bounty 

Hunter in a second. 

But first, much more on this mother accused of murdering one daughter and trying to kill the other. Why is she smiling? Why does she have makeup 

on? What`s wrong with this woman? 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Canon Beach Police Department and major crime teams have arrested Jessica Smith for the aggravated murder of her 2-year-old 

daughter, Isabella, and the attempted aggravated murder of her 13-year-old daughter, Alana. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ms. Smith, are you able to hear what`s happening here in court today? 

SMITH: Yes, your honor, I am. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You understand what`s happening in this discussion? 

SMITH: Yes. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Why is this woman winking and smiling? She`s accused of drowning her 2-year-old daughter and slitting the throat of her 13-year-old 

daughter who survived. 

Now Facebook, comments lighting up. ""She`s got to be crazy. Who in their right mind would do this?"" 

Jessica says, ""I`m sure she`ll come up with posttraumatic stress from her divorce."" 

Debby on Facebook: ""I say she`s setting up her insanity defense."" 

Chris on Facebook says, ""She`s not crazy. She knew exactly what she was doing."" 

Lisa Bloom, legal analyst for Avvo.com, she left the scene. She apparently told her daughter that she was going to kill herself. That`s what the 

doctor said. But a couple of days later, they find her in the woods. She`s got razor blades nearby. Oh -- oh, what a coincidence. She just 

didn`t get around to killing herself. 

BLOOM: Right. And we see that all the time in these alleged murder/suicides where only the murder part seems to take place. 

You know, for everyone who thinks she`s setting up an insanity defense, I can tell you, I don`t see it. As the legal matter, we have to just 

establish that she knew the difference between right and wrong and that she could control her acts. The fact that she fled indicates that she knew 

that what she was doing was wrong. What she did was sick. It was twisted; it was deranged. It was horrific. But I don`t think she meets an kind of 

insanity defense. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Well, let`s go out to the phone lines. Wendy, Maryland, what do you have to say? Wendy, Maryland.

CALLER: I think that this woman needs to spend the rest of her life in prison. She needs to be in a maximum security prison. I don`t think, at 

this point, when you kill your own child that you carried for nine months and then slit your other one`s throat, that you`re going to do anything 

great in society. And I feel that they need to make sure she`s locked away forever. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Dr. Jeff Gardere, what do you make of this smile? There`s something crazy. She`s got, in my opinion, crazy eyes. But could she be 

faking crazy, because she`s already plotting her insanity defense? 

GARDERE: All right, so I think what may be going on here, unless she has a psychiatric history, unless she has a history of some sort of psychosis, 

where she hears things or sees things or a bipolar disorder, it`s very hard for her to get some sort of an insanity plea. 

What could be going on here is yes, she is a very emotionally disturbed individual. Personality disorder, certainly very extreme. But she could 

be malingering. In other words, making it up, now that she`s caught, as part of this craziness, trying to make herself look even crazier by wearing 

that makeup and winking and being very extravagant in her gestures. Or she may really just be that crazy. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Or maybe she`s just saying, ""I got even with you, man! You`re going to leave me? Boy, did I show you."" 

Deserves her day in court. We`re going to have to see what happens. We`ll stay on top of it.

On the other side, we`ve got breaking news in the case of that unarmed teenager shot to death by police in Missouri. Brand-new details just 

coming in about the confrontation between victim, Michael Brown, and the officer, still unidentified, who killed him. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dorian Johnson was with Michael Brown on that day. And he says his friend was unarmed and his hands were in the air when he was 

shot. 

DORIAN JOHNSON, FRIEND/WITNESS: At no point in time did they struggle over the weapon, because the weapon was already drawn on us.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOHNSON: We wasn`t causing any harm to nobody. We had no weapons on us at all. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do we want?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Justice!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Justice!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Justice!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When do we want it?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shot and killed Saturday. 

JOHNSON: The weapon was already drawn on us. 

MICHAEL BROWN SR., FATHER OF VICTIM: I need justice for my son. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Still protecting the identity of the cop who pulled the trigger. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VELEZ-MITCHELL: All right. You are looking at live pictures from Ferguson, Missouri, right now. Authorities, you see them there in riot 

gear. And they have reportedly surrounded some folks. 

That, of course, is tape. That`s tape from the nights of tension and violence we`ve had in the last few days. But there was a live picture a 

second ago where apparently officers in uniform and riot gear have surrounded some protesters, who were sitting in the middle of the street. 

We`re also getting a whole bunch of new information in on this situation still unfolding, all the result of an officer shooting dead an 18-year-old 

unarmed teen by the name of Michael Brown. He was set to start college. He and his friend walking down the street. 

The friend, who`s a witness, said he did nothing wrong, did not provoke a confrontation that ended up with him dead. Now we can tell you, we`re just 

learning that the Ferguson school district has canceled classes tomorrow and Friday because of the tensions. 

We`re also learning that a 911 call, the 911 call, perhaps the key one -- maybe there were many -- about to be released. What will that tell us 

about this confrontation between the police officer and 18-year-old Michael Brown, with Brown ending up dead? 

We`re also getting evidence that the prosecuting attorney is now saying the evidence is going to be presented to a grand jury. A grand jury is going 

to decide whether the officer who fired the deadly shots is going to be charged with anything. For example, a hypothetical might be manslaughter. 

We don`t know. 

And we`re also learning that the justice department is now looking into possible civil rights violations to see if this was an unjustified 

shooting, if this young man`s civil rights were violated. 

All of this as a news conference occurred just a little while ago where a Missouri state senator asked a very provocative question of the police 

chief. Listen. 

It`s coming up. All right. Well, we`ll get to it in a second. 

Look, protesters, Michael Brown`s parents, all demanding answers. Tell us the identity of the cop who pulled the trigger, how many bullets hit 

Michael Brown. How much longer can cops keep these crucial facts secret? 

And here`s something else we`re learning. Police say the officer who fired those deadly shots, he`s very shaken up by the confrontation, and they just 

revealed that he himself is injured. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The officer was taken to the hospital and treated for a swollen face. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you see the officer`s face? 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I did not. What we know from what the county police said is there was a physical altercation inside the car. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VELEZ-MITCHELL: All right. I want to go to Midwin Charles, criminal defense attorney. So much new information just coming in. What do you 

make of the fact that we still don`t know who the officer is, supposedly for his own safety? We still don`t know how many bullets hit this young 

man, even though the autopsy`s done. The authorities still apparently have not interviewed the key witness, the young man who was with Michael Brown 

when this whole incident started. What`s going on here? 

CHARLES: The police chief has said that he wanted everybody to kind of wait and trust in the process and the investigation. But the problem is 

when the police is not -- they`re not transparent with what happened, what it does is it questions whether or not they are going about this 

investigation the proper way. 

How can you get the people in Ferguson to trust: to trust the investigation, to respect the police when there is all this hiding the 

ball? It`s been five days since this young man was shot and killed. Had the roles been reversed, had a police officer been shot and killed, you 

better believe not only would there have been arrests, we would know how many bullets were shot, we would know all the facts, and we would have 

known within hours. 

So there`s an issue as to whether or not they are respecting the life of this man. And I also think that by -- by hiding or protecting him, it 

shifts the focus away from Michael Brown and it just -- and places that focus on the police officer. So now everybody is concerned about this 

police officer`s safety. But we`re not talking about Michael Brown and how he was shot and how he was approached by the police. 

Did they even have probable cause to engage him and his friend? There are so many questions here. And the people need answers. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: And by the way, these are not live pictures but are these pictures, our producer, please tell us. Beg your pardon? Just moments 

ago. This is the scene just moments ago. So the situation remains very tense. And the reason why folks are raising their hands, they`re saying 

basically that he had his hands raised, which is what one of the witnesses said, as some of the deadly shots hit him, that he was unarmed and in the 

process of surrendering. 

Now the officer who shot Michael says the teen was trying to take his gun. But the friend who was right there says the cop cursed at him and that the 

officer was the aggressor. 

Listen to the young man who was with Michael Brown when this whole thing started. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DORIAN JOHNSON, WITNESSED MICHAEL BROWN SHOOTING: As we were walking down the street, the squad car vehicle approaches us. We`re on the side of the 

vehicle and the officer says, get the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) out of the street, verbatim. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Lisa Bloom, this young man, he says he still has not been interviewed by the authorities. He was the guy with Michael Brown. 

BLOOM: Jane, there is no excuse for it. You know, a couple of days ago, I was questioning what the police were doing, questioning their lack of 

transparency. Well, I think those questions are now starting to come to conclusions. The conclusion that perhaps they don`t want to get to the 

truth. 

I know as a practicing attorney when you`re going to interview a witness, you want to interview them yesterday. You certainly want to interview them 

before the media gets to them. 

CLAYPOOL: Jane? 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes? 

BLOOM: Don`t talk about it over and over again. 

CLAYPOOL: Jane. 

BLOOM: You want to lock down their story. The police`s failure to do that is shameful. But they won`t even tell us if Mike Brown was shot in the 

front, in the back or both. It sure seems like they`ve got something to hide. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Brian Claypool? 

CLAYPOOL: Hey, Jane. Yes, Jane, look, the -- I`m a civil rights attorney. I`ve been involved in at least 10 shooting death cases involving police 

officers. Three of those involved young men who were unarmed. And I will tell you, I`m usually anti-police officer. But they are not hiding 

anything. There`s a very important criminal investigation that`s going on. They can`t reveal this information during the investigation. So they`re 

not hiding anything, number one. 

Number two -- 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Wait, wait, wait. You`re telling me they can`t say how many times he was shot? We haven`t gotten the police report. OK? We 

haven`t -- 

(CROSSTALK)

CLAYPOOL: You`re not going to -- Jane. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: The autopsy that has been completed. 

CLAYPOOL: you`re not going to get the police report until the investigation is concluded. And I will tell you, I had a case two years 

ago where I knew this was going to happen. In my case, I went to the morgue and I personally took pictures of where the shots entered and where 

they exited and did a press conference. So I wouldn`t have to wait -- 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: All right. Midwin, I want you to respond to what Brian is saying is that this is all done totally by the book, nothing to see here. 

By the way, these are photographs of the young man who was shot dead, graduated from high school just very recently. Yes. 

CHARLES: I disagree -- I just disagree with that. I think anytime you see anyone who was shot and killed, there are basic facts that are -- that are 

sent to the public. I`m not suggesting that their entire investigation needs to be an open book. Obviously there are certain things that need to 

be done behind closed doors. But when it comes to a shooting like this that has been done under circumstances that are questionable at best, you 

have to at the very least let the public know who the shooter was, how many shots were fired -- 

(CROSSTALK)

CLAYPOOL: You can`t let them know who the shooter is. 

CHARLES: No. They do it all the time. Imagine if that cop was shot. 

CLAYPOOL: No. 

CHARLES: Imagine if that cop was shot. 

CLAYPOOL: Midwin -- 

CHARLES: These -- the rules are not being followed and that is the problem. 

CLAYPOOL: There is a -- 

CHARLES: Everyone deserves to be treated the exact same way. 

CLAYPOOL: Midwin, there`s a privacy right. 

CHARLES: That is not true. 

CLAYPOOL: We tried in California -- 

(CROSSTALK)

CHARLES: Excuse me. He killed someone. He killed someone. 

CLAYPOOL: No. In California -- 

CHARLES: This is not California. This is Missouri. 

CLAYPOOL: You can`t -- 

CHARLES: He killed someone. He doesn`t get to hide. 

CLAYPOOL: Let me finish. If there are credible threats of death on this police officer, he has a state and federal privacy right to not allow his 

name to be identified. That`s the law. That`s why they`re not releasing the police officer`s name. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: All right. Listen, Twitter is lighting up. I want to say -- Elizabeth says, cop`s name should not be released. It would put his 

innocent family members in danger. On Twitter, Russell says, ""It`s sad and disgusting by all accounts."" Matt says, ""Cops are supposed to protect and 

serve, not murder and terrorize."" 

I will say this, I really hope that because it`s being presented into a grand jury, which is a jury of peers, that hopefully that will take the 

politics out of the situation and allow just average citizens to make a determination that is on the side of justice. 

Next, a nationwide manhunt for a very dangerous MMA fighter. He`s known as war machine. He`s wanted for allegedly brutally beating his ex-girlfriend. 

So brutally she can`t get out of her hospital bed. 

And guess who`s on this guy`s tail? Dog the bounty hunter. He`s closing in and he`s joining us live on the other side to give us the latest on how 

he`s going to find this guy and what he does when he finds him.

KENDALL KARSON, FRIEND OF CHRISTY MACK: Her face is very swollen. Her whole eye is closed shut. 

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Christy Mack tweeted photos from her hospital bed claiming her ex-boyfriend, MMA star fighter Jon ""War Machine"" Koppenhaver 

is responsible for the abuse. 

KARSON: He could easily, like, snap her in two in seconds like his biceps are the same size as her legs. 

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Police confirm they are searching for Koppenhaver to arrest him on multiple charges of assault and battery. 

KARSON: He had smacked her before but it had never been something so aggressive. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Tonight, a manhunt in full swing for a mixed martial arts star accused of extreme violence outside the cage tonight. Jonathan ""War 

Machine"" Koppenhaver is on the run after cops say he beat and he brutalized his ex-girlfriend, Christy Mack. 

This is what Christy looked like before she was beaten to a pulp and now this is what she looks like now. Oh my gosh. She shared these photos on 

her Twitter account. The adult film star wrote in detail about what she says happened when War Machine showed up at her apartment 2:00 a.m. Friday 

morning and found her with a male friend. She says War Machine beat up her male friend and forced him to leave. 

Here`s what she said happened next, as read by one of our producers. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In some areas such as my hand, ear and head, he also sawed much of my hair off with his dull knife. After some time, the knife 

broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. 

I believed I was going to die. He had beaten me many times before but never this badly. He told me he was going to rape me but was disappointed 

in himself. After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking. Holding my side from the pain of my rib. Assuming he was finding 

a sharper, more stable knife to end my life, I ran out my back door. 

Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the neighborhood knocking on doors. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VELEZ-MITCHELL: In a moment, we`re going to talk live to the world famous investigator who`s hot on his trail, our good friend, Duane ""Dog the Bounty 

Hunter"" Chapman. Take a look at his show from CMT with ""Dog and Beth on the Hunt."" 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get the back door. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Keep around the house, guys. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hands in the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) air. On the ground now, (EXPLETIVE DELETED). 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Straight out to Dog the Bounty Hunter, Duane Chapman. 

Dog, thanks for joining us. I understand you`re live from an undisclosed location. Are you closing in on this man known as War Machine? And if so, 

how are you going to protect yourself because everybody is saying, including the cops, this guy is violent. 

DUANE ""DOG"" CHAPMAN, STAR OF ""DOG AND BETH ON THE HUNT"": Well, yes, we`re closing in and we use nonlethal weapons. So we -- you know, we don`t want 

to say we want him to resist. But -- let it be. You know, so if he does, then he`s still going to jail, no matter what. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Well, this isn`t his first run-in with the law. This guy is -- got a history. In 2009, he was arrested for felony domestic 

violence. He ended up pleading guilty to a misdemeanor 2011, a 12-page alleged that this guy beat him up and there was a lawsuit and now he`s 

facing seven charges. 

We`ve got to take a look once again at the injuries of this young woman, Christy Mack. I mean, this is brutal. And we`re going to show you those 

pictures in a second. Does it make you angry that this guy who is a trained fighter, an MMA fighter, hits a woman? 

CHAPMAN: Well, absolutely. You know, he -- what has not been let out is that one of those statements was, you know, as he was on top of her beating 

her, she could see her blood, you know, splattering all over his face and into his mouth and she said, Dog, there was no referee to stop it. He just 

kept beating me and beating me. She thought for sure she was going to die. 

So this is what sparked our team to go after this guy. Number one, you know, he`s in our world, the world of the tough guy. OK. So we have a lot 

of friends in the MMA world and they are not like this. He`s like the (INAUDIBLE) MMA guy who uses that, you know, to make it through his life 

and to bully people around. But, you know, his days of bullying is almost over. He`s got a friend waiting for him in prison by the name of Andrew 

Luster. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Whoa, that`s the guy you caught, the cosmetic heir, that you caught down in Mexico. Yes, I remember. I covered you on that story, 

Duane. 

Let me -- let me watch another clip of your show ""Catching Criminals"" on CMT with you and Beth. We`re just going to roll through it and show it 

while I talk because I want to get back to this investigation. You know, this beating that this MMA star is being sought for happened in Nevada -- 

Las Vegas, Nevada. 

Now War Machine is apparently from San Diego. Cops thought maybe he might go to San Diego. But apparently not. So where the hell is he, Dog, and 

how are you going to track him down? He`s been tweeting. So are you able to track his pings or are you going with the credit cards or are you 

talking to his friends? 

CHAPMAN: Well, you know, it`s a new world, new things are happening. And for instance, on social media, on Twitter, we`ve got -- you know, we were 

just figuring it out a minute ago. We`ve got about 400,000 Facebook, Twitter people around waiting for him. We`ve got all the places he`s ever 

been, gyms, restaurants, bars, anything he`s ever done. We`ve got people stationed at every single spot. It`s amazing what we can do now with these 

social networks. Every single person has got a picture of him. Everybody`s on hold. They`re all already to dial in. 

You know, all this guy has to do is make one mistake. The only way this guy can outrun us right now is to starve himself to death. And, you know, 

that will take about 47 days. So there`s no way this guy is ever going to get away. He`s made plans, allegedly, to go to Mexico. We got the border 

covered really strong. 

As you remember us down there in the Mexican border, we made a lot of friends. We`ve got Canada completely sown up. The (INAUDIBLE), he`s got 

pictures every place, you know, the entrance from America to Canada. There`s nowhere this guy could go but to county jail. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: All right. I want you to promise me, Dog, when you catch him, you`re going to call us, we`re going to put you right on the air. 

And a Facebook comment from Doug says, ""Dog, punish him, then lock him up, hunt him down and I hope you do. I hope you catch him."" 

On the other side, we`ve got a surprise guest, a woman you may recognize. She is famous. She is also a friend of this victim. And she is doing what 

she can to help her. Stay right there.

JONATHAN ""WAR MACHINE"" KOPPENHAVER, MMA STAR: I`ll just kill her and then I`ll put rest in peace. 

MACK: Fair enough really. 

KOPPENHAVER: I`ll put rest in peace next. Then like this is a memorial to my dead girlfriend. Don`t know what happened to her. She`s dead. 

MACK: And I honestly I probably deserve it. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VELEZ-MITCHELL: That`s the guy, War Machine, joking about how he would hit, kill this woman, his then girlfriend, now ex-girlfriend. And now he`s 

being sought by police for allegedly beating her to a pulp. 

I want to go out to Kendall Karson in a primetime exclusive. You`re a dear friend of the victim, Christy Mack. And she now has 18 broken bones around 

her eyes, her nose is broken in two places. She says her teeth were knocked out. You are trying to raise money for the $100,000 approximately 

that she`s going to need, she says, in reconstructive surgery. 

How are you raising all this money to help your friend? 

KARSON: That`s correct. When I first heard about Christy`s story and I saw it online and she had gone ahead and given such gruesome details of 

what had happened to her, I was outraged. And I looked for a way to help her and donate and saw that there wasn`t anything out there already set up. 

So since I`ve done fundraising for domestic violence in the past I decided to go ahead and start one for her. 

And it took off beyond my wildest dreams. I never expected it to get this big so quickly. And it`s all been through grassroots efforts within the 

industry and others that have heard about her story all on Twitter. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Well, you`re a good friend. And you know, when you have a big problem who your real friends are. 

I want to go to Jenna Jamison, another friend of Christy Mack and of course a very famous name. Former adult film star. 

I want to thank you for joining us tonight. There were -- I`ve been reading a lot of articles about this whole situation. She had been dating 

-- Christy had been dating War Machine. And then reportedly they broke up. But people are saying online that they warned her, this guy`s bad news. 

That you just saw a clip where he said, I`m going to kill you, that she admits he`s beaten me up many times before. 

What explanation do you have for her staying with him as long as she did? 

JENNA JAMISON, FRIEND OF CHRISTY MACK: I think this is obviously exactly what happens when women are abused. They feel as if they`re threatened. 

They may be killed. Their family may be killed. He`s threatened suicide. She -- the poor girl had been -- brainwashed. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Brainwashed. 

JAMISON: So -- 

(CROSSTALK)

JAMISON: This is what happens with domestic violence. That`s why I don`t understand when so many people out there say, why didn`t she just leave him 

the first time? Well, it`s like grooming a child. When they`re going to molest them. This poor little girl was in love with this man. And he beat 

her within inches of her life. 

I`ve spent many, many hours with her since then. And I have never seen anything so incredibly shocking and so humiliating. What he did to her was 

not just violence. It was something that I can`t even describe. Her teeth are gone. She has no hair left. She`s a shell of a human. 

This man needs to be brought to justice and he needs to stand up and be man. And I`m calling him out. Turn yourself in. Be a man. You think 

you`re a fighter? You can beat up a 95-pound little girl? It`s pretty embarrassing. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Well, if you`re listening, War Machine, do what Jenna Jamison says, turn yourself in. Because guess what, Dog the Bounty Hunter 

is looking for you. You don`t want him to find you. 

JAMISON: So are a lot of people. 

VELEZ-MITCHELL: There`s a lot of people including Dog. 

You know, one of our Facebook comments was that he wanted to eradicate her beauty. She`s a beautiful woman. I hope she gets her beauty back. And I 

really hope this is a message to all women. Man ever threatens violence, get out. Get out fast and forever. 

Nancy next.

WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Good evening, Anderson is off. A lot happening tonight. You're going to hear from a witness to the police shooting that left a young man dead, protesters on the march, and a police department on the hot seat. 

Also, with bombs rocking Baghdad, U.S. airstrikes ongoing, there is new word that more American servicemen and women are heading back into Iraq. 

But we begin with new details coming to light in the death of Robin Williams. And new reminders of what so many people, friends and fans alike are missing so deeply tonight from his comic genius to his human spirit. 

Today, authorities in Marin County, just north of San Francisco, went before the cameras. Ted Rowlands is there for us. He's joining us now. 

Ted, you were there at the news conference. What did the police say? 

TED ROWLANDS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, some of the details were just disturbing. They went into detail how Robin Williams took his life. He did hang himself with a belt near a closet in a room where he was by himself. 

His wife and he spent the night in their home here in Marin County. She went to bed and left the next morning thinking that her husband was just asleep. A personal assistant who was trying to get ahold of Robin Williams then eventually got into the room. She is the one that found Robin Williams and made that 911 call. 

Investigators say there is no note that they can talk about right now. They wouldn't rule it out that it exists but they didn't talk about it. They are going to wait until this investigation is over, and that will not be until the toxicology results are in and that is expected between two and five weeks. 

Also another disturbing detail, Robin Williams did have some cuts on his left wrist and a knife, a closed knife was found near his body, however the initial investigation has revealed that asphyxiation is the cause of death, not those cuts. 

BLITZER: And the next steps in the investigations, Ted, what do we know they are? 

ROWLANDS: Toxicology is number one, and then also, they say they're going to talk to people who were around Robin Williams in the days and weeks leading up to his death. They also confirmed what we had heard, that he indeed was seeking help for depression in the days before his death. 

BLITZER: Ted Rowlands, thanks very much for that report. 

For all his exuberance and manic energy in front of the camera, friends say Robin Williams was actually a very private, very low key person which means that whatever he said publicly about his inner battles with addiction and depression, his admissions, brash and funny as they sometimes could be, obviously did not tell the entire story. 

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ROBIN WILLIAMS, ACTOR/COMEDIAN You get drunk, you go out for Indian food. You wake up in Bombay with a camel licking your balls. Ta-da, you are an alcoholic. 

BLITZER (voice-over): He joked about it then, even though his problem was very real and very serious. For 30 years, Robin Williams battled an addiction to cocaine and alcohol that took hold soon after he became famous in the 1980s. 

WILLIAMS: When I did ""Mork & Mindy"" it was this kind of crazy ride. And I was pretty much on everything but skates. 

BLITZER: In 1982, Williams was with his friend, the actor John Belushi, when he overdosed on heroin and cocaine and died. Williams described that night as frightening and it led him, along with the birth of his first son, to get sober. He spoke about it to ABC's ""Nightline."" 

WILLIAMS: The one thing that cleaned me up was having a kid. That's immediate if that's the thing. You know, and I didn't have any rehab or any -- you know, any groups. So I just -- 

BILL WEIR, ABC NEWS: Really? You did it by yourself? 

WILLIAMS: On my own. Oh, totally. Just kind of took my mother's advice of, you know, vitamins and exercise. When you have a kid, you're pretty awake and smell like piss anyway so you don't need drugs. 

BLITZER: Williams says he was clean for 20 years, though it wasn't easy, especially because of his craving for alcohol. 

WILLIAMS: I was an alcoholic. 

LARRY KING, ""LARRY KING LIVE"": You're a drunk. 

WILLIAMS: Well -- that's nice of you to say. 

KING: You said it. BLITZER: In 2006 Williams checked into rehab, calling his descent

back into alcoholism, quote, ""gradual."" He spoke to ""Access Hollywood"" shortly after he got out. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But you were sober for 20 years. 

WILLIAMS: I was. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What happened? 

WILLIAMS: I drank. 

(LAUGHTER)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you realize that -- 

WILLIAMS: I realized, yes. You keep going with this, you'll wake up in a field with a small animal. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And how does it feel now? 

WILLIAMS: Feels good, feels dry. 

BLITZER: Williams was also battling depression according to his publicists in a statement released last night. But it's something he denied in an interview with NPR in 2006. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So no clinical depression is what I'm taking away. 

WILLIAMS: No clinical depression. No. No. I'm -- I get bummed like I think a lot of us do at certain times. You look at the world and go, whoa, and other moments you look and go oh, things are OK. 

BLITZER: But in 2010, Williams gave an interview to a podcast with Mark Maron, where he spoke openly about his struggles not only with addiction but with thoughts of ending his life. 

WILLIAMS: When I was drinking, there was only one time even for a moment where I thought, (EXPLETIVE DELETED), life. 

MARK MARON: Right. 

WILLIAMS: Then I went like -- then my conscious brain went like, did you really just say, (EXPLETIVE DELETED) life? OK. Let's put the suicide over here in discussable. Let's leave that over there in the discussion area. We'll talk about that. First of all, you don't have the balls to do it. I'm not going to say it out loud. I mean, have you thought about buying a gun? No. What are you going to do? Cut your wrist with a water pick? Maybe. 

BLITZER: His long struggle lasted up until the very end. With Williams checking himself into yet another rehab center just last month. 

(END VIDEOTAPE) BLITZER: Sadly from the depression to the addiction, there is certainly a lot to talk about, especially since so many people struggle daily with one or both of these diseases. 

Here to help us better understand things our chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. 

Sanjay, when someone commits suicide, I think a lot of people start searching for that one reason, that one event that may have pushed them to take their own life but typically it's not that simple, is it? 

DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: No, it's not that simple. And I'll preface by saying look, I don't know that there is ever going to be an answer when you hear these sorts of stories, that's satisfactory, that somehow makes this make sense in some way and it's also important to keep in mind, as we talked about a lot, when you talk about depression, something that Robin Williams was very candid about in terms of his own -- his own disease, that it is a disease. 

That it's a brain disease. And if you think about it like other physical diseases of the body -- diabetes, heart disease -- your approach to it is completely different. It's a disease we can measure the changes in the brain in ways that we couldn't before. 

There is a -- there is a sense that when you talk about why someone with depression who could be adequately treated, who could go through these ebbs and flows where things look really bleak but then get better, why they -- why they resort to suicide. And, you know, it's really unclear but unlikely to be some sort of discreet event and more likely to be the accumulation of various stressors in one's life that someone feels that they just can't get from behind. 

They feel overwhelmed by it, they feel helpless, they feel hopeless and they don't see light at the end of the tunnel anymore but it's usually a combination of all those things -- Wolf. 

BLITZER: Sanjay, a lot of people say the same traits that may have made him a great comedian could also contributed to a suffering from depression. Do you think that's right? 

GUPTA: I do. And I find this area of neuroscience to be really fascinating. This idea that some of the same traits that make someone a genius, frankly, a genius in the sense that they connect things that other people simply don't see. It's part of what makes them, the comedic sort of part of it is that they're just drawing connections that are humorous because other people just don't see those things. It's fascinating what's happening inside the brain. 

They're drawing on different areas of the brain. They're drawing on different experiences. What can happen, though, sometimes, is those connections can be -- can feel very flimsy and at some point, if someone starts to feel the connections aren't there anymore, they're not feeling them, that can be quite jarring and that seems to be a connection between a creative mind and depressive mind. 

BLITZER: It's amazing what's going on, that we really don't even appreciate all that much. 

Sanjay, thanks very much. 

GUPTA: You got it, Wolf, any time. 

BLITZER: One additional note on the subject, if you would like to know more about living with and treating depression, we've got some links to some very good resources up on our ""Impact Your World"" Web page. Just go to the address on your screen. 

Up next, Robin Williams, a comic's comic. A look at his memorable appearances on late-night talk shows and I'll speak with one of his friends, the producer of ""Comic Relief."" 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BLITZER: Robin Williams was very much what you'd call a comic's comic. He was a friend and an inspiration to so many fellow comedians who are now mourning his passing. 

Last night at the end of this show, Conan O'Brien had this to say after just finding out that Williams had died. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CONAN O'BRIEN, HOST, ""CONAN"": We got some news during the show that Robin Williams has passed away, and by the time we aired -- we taped the shows a few hours early and by the time you see this now on TV, I'm sure that you'll know. I am sorry to anyone in our studio audience that I'm breaking this news. This is absolutely shocking and horrifying. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BLITZER: You can hear the audience gasping when they heard the news. Such a shock. Robin Williams was certainly a fixture on late-night talk shows. He had so many memorable appearances throughout his career and kind of the iconic host of late-night television among his fans. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOHNNY CARSON, ""THE TONIGHT SHOW"": You know, in this business there are comedians, there are comics and once in a while, rarely somebody rises above and supersedes that and becomes a comic persona onto themselves. I'm never ceased to be amazed at the versatility and the wonderful work that Robin Williams does. 

JAY LENO, ""THE TONIGHT SHOW"": Please welcome, go on and yell now, everybody. Robin Williams. 

DAVID LETTERMAN, ""THE LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN"": Here's Robin Williams. 

WILLIAMS: They play Australian rules football which is like rugby in a thong. And it's pretty crazy, too. You have a huddle and you have to huddle, the other people holds up with you. And you bury your head in another man's ass, going, where is the ball? You know? 

LETTERMAN: Yes. That's what they told you? 

WILLIAMS: Yes. They said it was a game. 

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: Look at this thing, look, flipper. 

(LAUGHTER)

Right now there is a man saying, what are you doing? 

LETTERMAN: Your mother, your mom is in an exercise video? Is that true? 

WILLIAMS: Yes, it is. And it's -- 

(LAUGHTER)

LETTERMAN: I'm sorry. How did this come about? 

WILLIAMS: I don't know. I guess she didn't take the check I gave her and -- 

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: Mama, please. Here is all the residuals of ""Mork & Mindy."" Please. He does a Mork impersonator. This is crazy. 

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: About halfway through the wedding, they go, no, that's really Mork. It's crazy. 

LENO: Because we all started out together. 

WILLIAMS: Together. 

LENO: And we went to the first taping of this new show, ""Mork & Mindy,"" did -- we all did the pilot. I mean, that went on to be just, just the hugest hit of all time. 

WILLIAMS: I love this show. 

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: Nice to be on your show, Dave. 

(LAUGHTER)

I love these people. I love this show. 

LETTERMAN: Easy. 

WILLIAMS: I have a reservation for 8:00. I figured out how to do George Bush. Basically what you do is you take John Wayne and you tighten up his (EXPLETIVE DELETED). 

My favorite heckle was a guy in an English Club and there was a blind guy sitting in the back of the audience and all of a sudden he went, get off. And he waited one second and he went, is it gone? 

(LAUGHTER)

I am so happy to be doing comedy tonight. 

(LAUGHTER)

Two Jews walk into a bar. 

(LAUGHTER)

Yes. Yes. 

Give it up, people. Give it up, people. Get up. 

Take it in, honey. Take it in. 

(LAUGHTER)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BLITZER: Comic genius, indeed. 

Back in the 1980s, Bob Zmuda produced ""Comic Relief"" which raised money, lots of money for the homeless. It was hosted by Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg. 

Bob Zmuda is joining us now. 

Bob, thanks very much for joining us. The sheer comic genius of this man incredible. I think all of us agree. And to get -- to go along, he had a huge heart. He wanted to help a lot of people in need and you say he was actually the one who insisted the funds you raise go to help the homeless. What was it that drew him to that cause? 

BOB ZMUDA: Well, you know, Robin came from a well-to-do family. He was kind of brought up with a silver spoon in his mouth and I think he always felt that he was given so much and there were so many people out there that didn't have hardly anything. So when we started ""Comic Relief"" with Robin, Whoopi, Billy and myself, and Chris Albrecht 28 years ago, we had to decide on what would -- where would the funds go. 

And Robin -- the issue of homelessness really, really made a lot of sense to Robin, a lot -- to a lot of the other comedians because in show business before a comedian or an actor hits, they are pretty much down and out. You can't really go take any real kind of a job and we heard stories of Jim Carey, of course, lived with his family for about six months in their station wagon with his mother and father. You know, Michael Keaton lived in his car behind a comedy store. And the stories go on and on. So that issue really struck a nerve with Robin, of course, with Whoopi, and Billy, also. 

BLITZER: And he and Whoopi and Billy, they -- I understand that their passion for this cause didn't simply end on the stage, right? 

ZMUDA: No, exactly. You know, of course, they would rehearse sometimes all week before we would do the show live on HBO and sometimes the shows were three and a half, five-hour long, but behind the scenes they would go and visit homeless project sites and that was really amazing. A lot of times without cameras or anyone. And they would just show up. 

The first time we took Robin down to a center down in downtown L.A. and it was a really scary kind of skid row facility. And he got out there, Wolf. It was the only first time I saw him, he couldn't put words together, if you can believe such a thing. He looked at all these homeless people and he was so moved, he couldn't joke. 

He got so tongue-tied in real and afterwards we went back to the director's office, and the director said, Robin, you know, these people are waiting for you to do something funny. He said really? I didn't want to insult anyone. He went back out and he did 20 minutes and killed. Everybody was on the ground. 

Yes, so he was a big -- we raised over $70 million because of Robin, Whoopi and Billy and all the other comedians that joined us. 

BLITZER: That's amazing. Great work. You knew him for 30 years. Give us a few special memories you will always keep. 

ZMUDA: Well, you know, this is what is so strange because, you know, we're all trying to make sense out of this and put the pieces of the puzzle together. And it really goes back to what the doctor was saying before. There is something about the creative person, especially the American comedian. That is an art form all to itself. You're out there by yourselves, it's just you, it's your ego, you know, you're dealing with that audience. 

And Robin was known for his high energy and he always delivered at high energy. And I'm wondering a part of what has happened to him is you had what they talk about, the open heart surgery and there was something -- I've known Robin for over 35 years before he was a star. I used to be Andy Kaufman's writer and he was a huge Andy Kaufman fan and he would come to the shows. 

And -- but one thing, after even 35 years and I would sit down and meet with him about issues of homelessness and whatnot, and I must tell you this, I could not say this about anybody else I've ever met in my life. If you were in a room with Robin one on one, he was so uncomfortable, it was almost like being with a stranger in an elevator. And he just -- and even though you knew him that long, there had to be two or more people in the room and then he snapped -- then you were an audience. 

And without that audience, that's why -- this is shocking to me but at the same time I always sense there was something he was never revealing about himself. He had this dark side that he just kind of kept to himself, and I think also getting older, you know, it's such an energy job. You know, it's like a race car driver. You cannot be driving a race car when you're 64, 65 years old, and I think -- I think it just -- it just all came together at the wrong time. The audience wasn't there. It was the middle of the night, and those dark thoughts started and he couldn't put an end to it. 

BLITZER: I know he shared some of his struggles with you, particularly the addiction problem but you really had no idea he was in such trouble, did you? 

ZMUDA: Well, but here's why, Wolf. This is why. Yes. And he talked to many people, you know, look at those clips you're just showing. He was talking about addiction and he was talking about depression and he was talking about alcohol, but he's making light at it at the same time. So you think, well, OK, Robin has got some problems with this stuff but it can't be that serious. He's joking about it. 

It was serious and he was very good at covering what he was going through. And if anybody gets anything out of this out there with this Robin Williams situation, if you're feeling bad and you have any thoughts like this, you have to talk to somebody. 

BLITZER: You need help, obviously, and despite the stigma of depression or addiction, you need to go out there and it's an illness. You got to treat it. 

ZMUDA: It is. 

BLITZER: Bob Zmuda, thanks so much for sharing some thoughts with all of our viewers. 

Just ahead, we're going to speak with one of Robin Williams' first co- stars, Morgan Fairchild will join us. That's coming up. 

Also tonight, the death of an unarmed teenager Michael Brown. Shot by a police officer in a St. Louis suburb. The announcement by police today that has fueled even more anger and the witness to the shooting, Michael Brown's friend will join us, as well. That's all coming up. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BLITZER: More tributes tonight to Robin Williams including his collaborators on ""Good Will Hunting."" Matt Damon said this, ""Robin brought so much joy into my life and I will carry that joy with me forever. He was such a beautiful man. I was lucky to know him and I will never ever forget him. I truly hope the people of the media can find it within themselves to give his family some privacy during this horrible time."" 

And this from Ben Affleck. ""Heartbroken, thanks, Chief, for your friendship and for what you gave the world. Robin had a ton of love in him. He personally did so much for so many people. He made Matt and my dreams come true. What do you owe a guy who does that? Everything. May you find peace, my friend."" 

And this from former President Bill Clinton, ""Grateful for the life of Robin Williams. A true talent and a wonderful friend. He will be missed by so many."" People of President Clinton's generation and mine were very, very

lucky. We got a chance to see the entire sweep of his talent starting with Mork from Ork. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

WILLIAMS: Well, since we're both friend of Mindy's, why can't we be friends together? 

MORGAN FAIRCHILD, ACTRESS: Look, I think that's a wonderful idea. We should be friends, close friends. As a matter of fact, I think we should celebrate by going out tonight. 

WILLIAMS: OK. 

FAIRCHILD: You want to pick me up? 

WILLIAMS: If you insist. 

(LAUGHTER)

Is that what you do on a date? 

FAIRCHILD: Yes. Well, whatever turns you on. 

WILLIAMS: That did. 

(LAUGHTER)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BLITZER: And joining us now, the first temptation of Mork, herself Morgan Fairchild. 

Morgan, thanks very much for joining us. You worked with Robin Williams very early in his career, in fact, you signed on for your role on ""Mork & Mindy"" before anyone knew about the show, before anyone really knew who he was. So what drew you to him? 

FAIRCHILD: Well, when I first got to L.A., one of my early jobs was on ""Happy Days."" And they were so lovely and so wonderful whenever I was on the Paramount lot, I try to stop by and say hi. So one day I was going over there and Henry Winkler came over and said hey, you've got to go anywhere later? And I said no, why? And he says, stay and watch our guest star, he's amazing. 

So I stayed, I thought for 15 minutes, I stayed the whole afternoon just to watch this Mork thing and just to tell this guy that he was a genius. I just had to stay and tell him that as one actor to another and a few months go by and I get a call from the agent, you know, good news, you got TV movie. Bad news. I said, well, what's the bad news? He said, well, Gary Marshall has this new show and he -- nobody knows anything about it, it's all under wraps. 

And we don't think you should do it. We don't want to give you a contract and blah, blah, blah. And I said, well, what is it? And he says, ""Mork & Mindy."" I said that's Robin Williams' show. And he said, who's Robin Williams? And I said, no joke, Robin Williams was a genius. I'd work for free to work with Robin Williams. 

So I took it against everybody's advice and it was, you know, one of the most fun, creative processes in my whole life. It was a thrill just to walk on the set with him. The first time I was going to shoot the show, it was not on the air. I went over to watch them tape the show before mine. I could see robin over there with his buddies with everything pierced and purple hair and everything looking at me like, Ms. White Bread America.

So the next day, we got up and started blocking and I realized quickly that robin would go off on tangents and everybody would let him go because he was brilliant. He would throw something out and I would throw something back.

So we were pretty soon going like this and he threw me in the air. So it was just always a joy to do that, but I remember him sitting on our living room floor, my sister had gone to school the class ahead of him, sitting on the living room floor before the show.

And said Robin, when this hits, this is going to explode and be huge and you have to watch out for a lot of things. He said no, nobody is going to like this. Nobody is going to care. I said no, you're wrong.

BLITZER: A lot of people, Morgan, have said when he was with a group, two, three, four, five people, he was different than he was with someone just one on one. Did you experience that?

FAIRCHILD: Definitely. He was like that. If there were two people in the room, he had to perform. If you were just one on one, he would be much calmer and just really talk. He didn't feel that need to perform. If there were two people in the room, it was very different.

But as Mork got more and more successful, you know, he was getting pulled in so many different directions. One day he had a green parrot and he had not been going home and I guess, the parrot had gotten mad at him so one day he keep decided to bring the parrot to work.

It would dive from the rafters not at us but at Robin. One day Jonathan Winters was his big idol and one day Gary Marshall and guys had gotten Jonathan Winters to come to the set and he was hiding in Robin's dressing room and we're trying to get Robin to go to his dressing room and he's late and busy and doing all of his antics and wouldn't.

So finally Jonathan Winters falls asleep in the close set waiting to jump out and surprise him in the dressing room. I was so that thrilled later they got to work together because two creative minds like you just don't see.

BLITZER: Morgan Fairchild, thanks for sharing some memories with all of our viewers, thanks very much for joining us. Amazing memories, indeed. A lot happening in the world, just ahead, fresh outrage in the town royaling after the fatal shooting of an unarmed teenager. Why police changed their mind about releasing the name of the officer who shot Michael Brown, that's coming up.

Plus I'll talk to his friend who was there when the bullets were fired.

And there is breaking news as well as the humanitarian crisis in Iraq intensifies, there is a new move by the United States to lend a hand.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BLITZER: In Ferguson, Missouri, a broken promise is stoking outrage. Police officials say they will not identify the officer who shot and killed 18-year-old, Michael Brown. Just yesterday, the police chief vowed to release the shooter's name. Anger over the killing of the unarmed teenager has sparked violent protest.

In a statement today, President Obama said and I'm quoting, ""The death of Michael Brown is heart breaking and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and community at the difficult time.

I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri and across the country to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.

It's the same plea Michael Brown's family has been making even as they grieve. Jason Carroll is joining us now with more on the very latest. Jason, another night coming up there in Ferguson outside of St. Louis. Are more protests expected?

JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we can never be quite sure, Wolf. Last night, for example, impromptu protests turned violent, at least at one point police had to use tear gas and bean bag rounds to disburse the crowd. Police are ready for that again tonight. They are hoping it will not be necessary.

As you know, the family has come forward asking for peace again and so far, so far at least tonight the community seems to be hearing what the family is saying.

BLITZER: At that press conference that the family had, they spoke out passionately. Give us a little more of what they want to happen now.

CARROLL: A couple things, you said at the top, the family at this point wants a couple things, more transparency in terms of the investigation. They want the investigation to be open. They want to know how it's proceeding along.

Second, they do want to see the release of the name of the officer involved in the shooting. The police chief out here did say the name was going to be released today. That's what he told us.

But they changed their minds and said they were fearing for the officer's safety. At some point, the officer's name will be released. It just will not be at this point -- Wolf.

BLITZER: Jason Carroll, thanks very much. Witness accounts are directly at odds with what they are saying. They said Michael Brown attacked the officer and tried to take his gun. Dorian Johnson is an eyewitness. He was feet away when his friend was shot.

Just before we went on the air, I spoke with him and his attorney, Freeman Bosley Jr.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BLITZER: Dorian, first of all, let me say I'm so sorry for the loss of your friend. We appreciate your talking to us tonight. I want you to walk us through what happened on Saturday. You and Michael Brown were walking down the street. So what happened next?

DORIAN JOHNSON, WITNESSED MICHAEL BROWN SHOOTING: As we're walking down the street, the squad car vehicle approaches us. We're on the side of the vehicle and the officer says get the -- out of the street verbatim was his words, and at that moment, I told the officer, my friend Big Mike didn't speak.

I told my officer that we was not, but a minute away from my destination and that we would be out of the street and at that time, me and my friend Big Mike started to walk again and the officer, he seemed like he was driving off, but in a second, he put the car in reverse and he reversed very rapidly at a fast pace.

And he slanted the car to manner that it almost hit me and my friend big mike so we had to step back. We were now front center with the officer inside the vehicle, but we were so close, almost inches away that when he tried to open his door aggressively.

The door ricocheted both off me and Big Mike's body and closed back on the officer. At that time, he reached out the window with his left arm, he grabbed on to my friend Big Mike's throat and is trying to pull him in the vehicle, and my friend, Big Mike very angrily is trying to pull away from the officer.

And the officer now is struggling with trying to hold a grip on my friend Big Mike as he's trying to pull away, and as in a minute, I heard I'll shoot. I'm about to shoot. And I'm standing so close to Big Mike and the officer, I look in his window and I see that he has his gun pointed at both of us.

And when he fired his weapon, I moved seconds before he pulled the trigger. I saw the fire come out the barrel and I instinctually knew it was a gun. I looked at my friend Big Mike and saw he was struck in the chest or upper region because I saw blood spatter down his side.

And at that time, we both took off running. It was almost two or three minutes, we were running and I was able to hide myself behind the first vehicle that was up on the scene, and the officer then got out his car, my friend Big Mike was still running, he ran past me and saw me in plain sight. He said to me verbatim that he said keep running, Bro, and he kept running and I was so scared and fear for my life that my body was in shock. I couldn't move. I couldn't think at that time.

And almost in an instant, my body started rising and I see the officer proceeding after my friend, Big Mike, with his gun drawn, and he fired a second shot and that struck my friend, Big Mike.

And at that time, he turned around with his hands up, beginning to tell the officer that he was unarmed and to tell him to stop shooting. But at that time, the officer was firing several more shots into my friend and he hit the ground and died.

I watched his body until he stopped moving, and then I ran, vomit in my mouth, hyperventilating, not knowing what to do. I just ran.

BLITZER: Did Michael ever try to get the weapon that the police officer had?

JOHNSON: No, sir, that's incorrect. At no point in time did they struggle over the weapon because the weapon was already drawn on us. So we were more trying to get away out of the angle or aim of the weapon besides going towards the weapon because it was drawn at us already.

BLITZER: Did either you or Michael have a weapon yourself? I understand both of you were unarmed. I just want to be precise.

JOHNSON: Yes, we were both unarmed, sir. We didn't have a sharp object on us, nothing. I didn't even have pockets on my shorts. We had nothing on us, no.

BLITZER: Did the police interview you at the scene that day?

JOHNSON: No, the police did not interview me at the scene. He -- it's almost like he wasn't paying attention to me anymore. It's like he was in shock himself, and his vision wasn't on anything but my friend, Big Mike.

BLITZER: Have the police interviewed you since this incident happened?

JOHNSON: No, sir. I have not talked to any law enforcement since the incident.

FREEMAN BOSLEY JR., DORIAN JOHNSON'S ATTORNEY: But Wolf, I do need to say the police department has reached out to us and it's a matter of us scheduling an opportunity to him to get a chance to visit with them. They did reach out to us today.

BLITZER: And what did they say to you?

BOSLEY: They said they would like for us to set up an opportunity for Dorian to come in and be interviewed. Our concern is one of the statements that was made earlier is that he didn't see what had happened, that he had run off when in fact, he did not. And therefore they had reservations about even wanting to talk to Dorian about it when it's clear Dorian is the only person that's a true eyewitness to what happened here.

BLITZER: Did you notice what the race was of the officer who shot your friend?

JOHNSON: Yes, he was Caucasian, a white male.

BLITZER: What would you like us to know about your friend?

JOHNSON: He was a gentle giant. He was big. He was careful. He cared for everybody. He was loving. I loved everything about this young man.

BLITZER: Dorian Johnson, thank you so much for joining us. I know this is a difficult, very difficult period for you. Freeman Bosley, thank you for joining us as well.

There is more breaking news tonight, sadly the passing of another Hollywood great, Lauren Bacall has died at the age of the 89. We're going to pay tribute to her that's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BLITZER: On a night when we're just beginning to miss Robin Williams, the world has lost another great, great talent, perhaps the last star of classic Hollywood. Lauren Bacall as in the ""Big Sleep"" and ""To Have and Have Not,"" as in the first lady of the original ""Rat Pack.""

Lauren Bacall who had that incomparable voice and commanding presence has died. That according to multiple sources including the Twitter account, the Facebook page, the ""L.A Times"" reporting they spoke with an executive of the estate that confirmed her passing. She was 89.

More on her remarkable life from CNN entertainment correspondent, Nischelle Turner.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

LAUREN BACALL: You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.

NISCHELLE TURNER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With those words in the film ""To Have and To Have Not"" audience imaginations soared, the express, downturned face and upturned eyes earned her the nickname the look. The 19-year-old struck the pose because she felt insecure.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, that was what started the look, nerves, just trying to keep my head steady.

TURNER: Bacall was more than a movie legend. She was from Hollywood's golden era and the wife of actor, Humphrey Bogart. ""The Big Sleep"" was among a handful of films they made together, but their love affair was one of Tinsel Town's greatest romances.

Bogart died in 1957 leaving her a widow at 32 with two small children. For a time, she was engaged to Frank Sinatra. When romance fizzled, Sinatra headed to Las Vegas and Bacall fell in love again and married actor, Jason Robard with whom she had a son. She blamed his drinking for their divorce.

BACALL: I don't know if he enjoyed it. He was hooked on it.

TURNER: Bacall was born Betty Joan Persky on September 16th, 1924. Her parents were Jewish immigrants who divorced when she was just 6. As a lanky teen she modelled to earn extra money taking her mother's maiden name, Bacall, adding a second ""l"" to make it easier to pronounce.

Film Director Howard Hawks saw her photograph on a magazine cover, a screen test later and Hawks changed her name.

BACALL: He felt that Lauren Bacall was better sounding than Betty Bacall. He had a vision of his own. He wanted to mold me. He wanted to control me.

TURNER: Big screen or small, even her fellow actors viewed her as a legend.

ADAM ARKIN, ACTOR: John Houston, Charlie Chaplain and she just knows or has been around everyone that has formed what we know of this business.

TURNER: Bacall's film co-stars is who is who, but on Broadway she achieved the most critical acclaim.

BACALL: That was my dream to be on stage.

TURNER: She spent nearly 20 years on the stage starring in ""Cactus Flower, Applause and Woman of The Year"" earning two Tony Awards. In her later years, her film career saw a renaissance. She starred opposite Barbara Streisand in the ""Mirror Has Two Faces"" earning her only Oscar nomination.

And she was still acting in her 80s in such films as ""Dogville"" and ""Birth"" with Nicole Kidman. A diva, a film star, a Broadway jewel and a classic legend of an era gone by.

BLITZER: Nischelle Turner reporting for us. Joining us on the phone, one very lucky guy, the former talk show host, the eternal writer, Dick Cavette. I know you knew her and interviewed Lauren Bacall a number of times. What was she like?

DICK CAVETT, FORMER TALK SHOW HOST (via telephone): She wasn't like anything, Wolf. She was unique. She was just -- if you were at a party, and she was there, she would usually seek me out or I would seek her out and we would laugh and have such a good time that people wondered what was our relationship. We were great friends. I remember way back in the morning when Bobby Kennedy was shot, I put together a quick live show and she was one of the people. Don't they ever assassinate any right wingers? Not long after that George Lincoln Rockwell was shot, but her presence was tangible.

She just -- you knew you were with what you might call a cash customer when you were with her. There was no non-sense, no expectation. She wasn't tough, but she could play tough and sound tough.

BLITZER: She had -- 

CAVETT: Her vulnerability always showed through.

BLITZER: That husky voice was really amazing, so memorable. Give us a little flavor of what she meant to so many people who loved her over the years.

CAVETT: I think to many people, I would love to be her, she. She just was what a lot of young women would like to be, someone that can't be pushed around. Someone that can tell you where to head in as they usually say with a colorful vocabulary if she needed to fall back on it.

I remember doing my shows and she said call, went with her to Africa because it was John Houston and Boggy and said I don't want to go down there with two drunks without my friend on. They comforted each other the whole time they were there.

She was just an invaluable friend. Now, this sounds a little too spooky for creative writing class, but about 36 hours ago, my wife and I in a cab passed the Dakota, I looked up to what I know are her windows and thought I wonder how she is.

And within the short span of time, we found out she isn't. And of course, some idiot will say now, these deaths always come in threes. Well, Wolf, as you know, anything comes in threes if you wait long enough.

BLITZER: Dick Cavett, thanks for sharing some thoughts. She was amazing, an amazing actress and amazing person, Lauren Bacall, unfortunately passed away at the age of 89. We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BLITZER: It's once again been a night to remember, be amazed and touched by the loss of a great, great talent. We remember the actress, Lauren Bacall, who died at age 89, an amazing actress, a commanding presence, and as Dick just told us, a great friend.

And we remember, Robin Williams. This is the photo on display at the national portrait gallery taken in 1979, but Michael Dressler for ""Time Magazine."" It said five months ago he was a complete nobody. He became an overnight star and we're so glad he did.

That's it for me. ""THE WAR COMES HOME"" with Soledad O'Brien report starts right now.

CNN,cnn88,http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1408/18/ath.01.html,Forensic Pathologist Holds Press Conference on Michael Brown Autopsy,Transcript from @THIS HOUR with Berman and Michaela,08/18/2014,04/23/2016,"DR. MICHAEL BADEN, FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST: The -- this will calm community and family concerns over cover up or not being told the truth. And very simple things found on day one of the autopsy, as you know with other sudden deaths, and gunshot wounds and stab wounds, that next day, the autopsy results come out, and answers these kind of questions.

How many bullet wounds? And most important, did my loved one suffer? Pain and suffering is a concern. And we can answer those questions on day one on the basis of the injuries, such as when there's a damage to the brain, bullet wound to the brain, that causes immediate loss of consciousness, at that point. And telling that to a family can often be very helpful at a trying time to a family. 

So that's why we were call. I must say when we were called, Mr. Crump had said they had been trying to get the federal -- the FBI, the federal government, involved without success at that time, and that's why they wanted me to come in. And shortly after we started the autopsy -- whoops, Channel 5, I'm sorry -- after we started the autopsy, then it was announced that they were going to do another autopsy, which is fine, because it shows the interest and the concern the federal government has in this kind of death.

And you're here -- all here because many black men die of accident, of homicide, every day in this country, and rarely -- and never as far as I recall has the President of the United States gotten involved. The only time the president got involved I remember was Charles Manson did his thing and you guys weren't born in those times and he was very upset by it. But not in a civil rights way. 

So I think that understanding what's happening -- and one thing I want to add her though, Mary Case is the chief medical examiner in St. Louis County and she's a very excellent forensic pathologist, and I'm sure her work will turn out to be very excellent when it's released. But again it hasn't been released yet, and the family wants to know certain simple questions that so far we've been able to answer. 

Shawn Parcells is -- has been instrumental in the autopsy evaluation. I don't know if you want to point out anything on the -- on the anatomy of the gunshot wounds that -- that beautiful drawing. 

PROF. SHAWN PARCELLS, PATHOLOGIST ASSISTANT: First of all, I'm Professor Shawn Parcells and I would like to thank everyone for bringing me into this case. And we're here for the family to answer questions about what happened to Michael Brown. And I want you guys to understand that when an autopsy is done, that

we look at the body in an anatomical position. This is the anatomical position. This is not how we stand, how we walk, but medically speaking, we like to describe wounds this way. 

And, as you all know, Dr. Baden and I concluded that he was shot at least six times. We've got one to the very top of the head, the apex. We've got one that entered just above the right eyebrow. We've got one that entered the top part of the right arm. We've got a graze wound, a superficial graze wound, to the middle part of the right arm. We've got a wound that entered the medial aspect of the right arm, and we've got a deep graze wound that produced a laceration to the palm of the right hand. 

Now, these two, where the Xes are, represent what Dr. Baden and I feel are possible reentry wounds. So the wound that hit the forehead right above the right eyebrow actually came out right around the right eye and went back in. And then it exited again right here in the jaw line and came out, and went back in to the right shoulder. That's from one bullet. Now, we have to confer that with the first autopsy. 

This wound right here to the side of the chest is also a possible reentry wound. Now, which wound on the arm that correlates to, we're not sure. We have to correlate all of this with the first autopsy. 

And the other critical point that I want everyone to be very clear on is that this wound to the medial aspect of the right arm, just generally speaking, happened right about here indicate -- OK. So what Dr. Baden and I feel that occurred - and by the way this red mark is showing that same wound, this is not a separate wound. This is showing the same wound, in the same location in that arm, but you are looking at it from the back. 

And as the attorneys were saying, there was a witness statement that said that he was walking away and the gun goes off and he kind of jerks. So the question asked to us was could that wound occurred from him walking away and then he turns around? 

It's consistent with that. However, understand too that, while the shot could have come from the back, because if I'm standing here walking along and get shot from that direction, you see when I pull my arm up, it's in that same general area. The arm is a very mobile part of your body, so it also could have occurred when he was putting his hands up. So I put my hands up and you see where that wound is at. It could have happened if he put his arms across in a defensive manner. We don't know and we still have to look at other aspects of this investigation before we can really start piecing things together. Dr. Baden. 

BADEN: Yes. The attorneys behind me thought that there might be a question among you. We're here to see -- 

QUESTION: Are any of these wounds inconsistent with the witness accounts that Michael Brown was shot while rushing the police officer? 

BADEN: They could be consistent with his going forward or going backward. But they're from the front, and if he was shot going forward, he would collapse right away. The problem -- yes, so it's possible. There are a number of different possibilities to that. 

QUESTON: Can you tell how far away? 

BADEN: The question was how far away. Yes. We can tell certain distance. We can tell the distance from the muzzle of the gun to the body, and the body's clothing. If there's -- the closer the weapon is to the body, the more powder residue there will be on the body and the skin and the clothing. 

In this instance, there's no gunshot residues on the skin surface, so that the muzzle of the gun was at least one or two feet away, the muzzle at the time of discharge. It could have been 30 feet away; it would be the same thing. But in order to be firm about that, we also have to look at the clothing, which we haven't had the opportunity to look at because sometimes the clothing can filter out gunshot residues. 

QUESTION: Doctor, can you say how many times he was actually shot? Becaus you were talking about reentry wounds so -- 

BADEN: There are six bullets strucken, six bullets struck and two may have reentered. And three bullets were recovered at the first autopsy, according to our report. There were the two head wounds and the bullet in the chest stayed in the body and were removed at the first autopsy, from our examination of the body. 

One of the things that's going to be important for us to see is the X- rays, the old black and white X-rays that will show where the bullets were at -- before the autopsy was started. And that's documented in X-rays taken before an autopsy in a gunshot wound case. 

(CROSSTALK)

QUESTION: Do we know those X-rays exist? 

BADEN: Yes. I spoke with Dr. Mary Case and they did all the proper X-rays, photographs, and they should be available at some time. Whether today or whether three or four months from now often depends on what the prosecutor wants to do. That is, Mary Case could have told you everything I'm telling you on day one, but often in an investigation like this, it's not uncommon for prosecutors not to want information released. But I think in my experience, when that happens, it only gets the community more upset. 

QUESTION: I have a question. 

DARYL PARKS, BROWN FAMILY ATTORNEY: Ma'am, are you a member of the media? 

QUESTION: I am not. 

PARKS: Only the media. Only the media. 

QUESTION: Can we get access to the clothing? Are there any signs of (INAUDIBLE) -- 

BADEN: I didn't hear. 

QUESTION: Can you get access to the clothing, and was there any signs of any struggle? 

BADEN: Two things. Access to the clothing. I think, at think at some point, we should -- the defense should have access to the clothing. That depends largely -- the clothing is now, from Dr. Case's advice in the Los Angeles -- St. Louis County police agency normally. They're going to be looking at it. It's up to them when the defense -- not defense, the families will have access to it. So at some time, there will be access to it and the results. As far as the other part of the question was -- 

QUESTION: Were there any signs of struggle? 

BADEN: Any signs of struggle? There weren't signs of a struggle. In talking about a struggle, one of the things that the attorneys have also asked for is the medical examination of the officer who was in a struggle. So signs of injury to the officer, to Michael Brown, are both needed. 

One thing is that there are abrasions around the right side of Mr. Brown's face, rubbing against the ground, which happened as best as we can tell when -- after the gunshot wounds, he fell flat down, unprotected and got those abrasions. Otherwise, no evidence of a struggle and it will be important in evaluation of the case for the medical examiner, for the FBI, for the defense -- not defense, the family to see what happened to the officer. 

QUESTION: Doctor, doctor -- 

BADEN: Yes, over here for a second. 

QUESTION: Can you tell me where the autopsy took place and how long?

BADEN: Our autopsy that we did -- the first autopsy at the county medical examiner, second one was at the -- second one was at the Arthur Lane Funeral Home where the body was delivered for burial, and we did that in the office, and it was about a three, four-hour autopsy, reautopsy. 

QUESTION: How do your findings resemble or differ from the county autopsy results? 

BADEN: Well, we can't answer that until we see the county. I'm -- my impression, having done this some 50 years or so, is that they're going to be very similar. There.

QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) do you expect to happen (INAUDIBLE)? 

BADEN: I think they are available now. The autopsy records are available now. When it's going to be released is probably up to the prosecutor. 

PARKS: Right here. Excuse me. Right here. 

QUESTION: I have a question. (INAUDIBLE) at the end, you said, would it be consistent what police said had happened or witnesses happened? Talk a little bit more about how (INAUDIBLE).

BADEN: Well, the autopsy itself counted as consistent with police or witnesses. There are many different witness testimonies. Many of them seem to line up in one direction, some in another direction. Right now, till we get more information, till we get from a forensic science point of view, can't distinguish -- can't make a definite judgment. 

Now, the lawyers who've interviewed witnesses -- we haven't interviewed, we don't interview witnesses -- may be impressed with some witnesses who seem more -- more trustworthy than others, and as the police are doing too. This is what juries are supposed to do. Juries are supposed to look at the witnesses and tell who is telling the truth and who isn't, but lawyers do that all the time. And so they have more information than we have. 

But right now, from the science point of view, we can't determine which witness, and there are all different kinds of observations made, is most consistent with all of the forensic findings. 

(CROSSTALK)

PARKS: In the green. 

QUESTION: Doctor, you mentioned transparency, you mentioned scientific information, and you mentioned standards (ph). Was there any investigative reason, any scientific reason, why this information could not have been released after day one? Is there any -- 

BADEN: Well, look -- this is a judgment based on -- and this is one of the things that the family was concerned about. Even though we know when an autopsy is done, when any autopsy is done that you guys go to, 95 percent of the information is available right away -- stab wounds, gunshot wounds. Things like microscopic slides and toxicology, which may be of value, but don't determine the cause of death; whether or not a decedent has cocaine on board might be on value to see why an incident happened, but it has nothing to do with the cause of death. 

So I think my impression is that the -- like in most medical exam examiner's offices, when an autopsy is completed, the medical examiner can release it immediately, or most of it, pending the prosecutor's wishes, because if the prosecutor says that that's going to interfere with our investigation, then medical examiners hold up and the families may not know for weeks or months the kind of questions we're talking about. 

BENJAMIN CRUMP, BROWN FAMILY ATTORNEY: Two more. Two more. 

QUESTION: Can you speculate in what order the wounds occurred? 

PARCELLS: I don't think we can -- we cannot speculate exact order of gunshot wounds. Forensically, that's impossible. However, Dr. Baden and I do feel that, because of the two gunshot wounds to the head, indicating that Mr. Brown was bending over as they were coming down, that those two shots were most likely the last two to occur to him. 

BADEN: That's about as far as we can go. 

QUESTION: How about toxicology? 

BADEN: The toxicology results have to be done by the medical examiner at the first autopsy. They get the blood and everything out. Second autopsy, no more blood and there's been embalming fluids, et cetera. So we have to wait for the medical examiner and it depends how quickly they're rushed. The toxicology should be able to be done in a week or two, but oftentimes it gets on the end of the line of all the other cases that they're dealing with and may take months. But that should be available, especially with your concern and the president's concern, it should be available very soon. 

CRUMP: Well, we got a feeling that that toxicology report, like other things, will be released to you sooner than later. There was one question from a non-press person. We wanted to ask it and then we were going to -- yes, ma'am. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you. My question is the four shots that entered his body first, I'm assuming that he could have survived? Am I correct?

BADEN: Yes, he could have all the -- that's good and I should have mentioned something. All of these gunshot wounds were survivable except for the one at the top of the head that went through the brain. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With that being said, and all of us here know what happened to Michael, why hasn't Mr. -- Officer Wilson been arrested? 

(APPLAUSE)

BADEN: You know, who gets arrested, as you know, is a political district attorney decision and it's not a forensic science decision, for good or for bad. 

CRUMP: Thank you all. 

PARCELLS: Thank you. 

MICHAELA PEREIRA, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to @THISHOUR, I'm Michaela Pereira. We're taking an in-depth look at the ongoing dispute over the shooting of 18 year old Michael Brown. I am Michaela Pereira, here in New York. John Berman is off. 

We've just wrapped up a press conference held at the Greater Saint Mark Missionary Baptist Church where we heard from Benjamin Crump, the family attorney, along with Darrel Gates, co-counsel. And then, of course, the forensic pathologist hired by the family, Dr. Michael Baden. He's a preeminent pathologist and has been key in this case because the family, obviously, wanted to have their own independent pathology exam and autopsy. I have got the best in the business joining me right now. We have got George Howell in the St. Louis Suburb. 

Actually let's just listen in for one second and we'll talk with some of our guests. 

BADEN: So we can only tell that -- the direct it's going in, but that direction could be up or kneeling or down, and that depends on other factors which the lawyers know more than we know. 

CRUMP: You want to point out what the last shot -- 

BADEN: Yes. This is the last shot, and this is the only shot that is not treatable. 

QUESTION: What does that mean? 

BADEN: Well, it went in the top and it went slightly to the front, from the middle of the brain to sort of the right side of the brain. 

QUESTION: It stayed in? 

BADEN: Yes, it stayed in and was recovered at -- slightly forward. 

CRUMP: Okay. Thank you. 

QUESTION: Could this have come from behind? 

BADEN: Only if he was double jointed and could -- it's more likely to be consistent with -- 

CRUMP: Either kneeling or bending forward. As Attorney Parks said -- no more questions. Let's go. That is fine. Let's go. No more questions. We've answered your question. 

BADEN: Thank you all. Thank you. 

PEREIRA: All right. It looks as though the press conference has just wrapped up there at Greater Saint Mark Missionary Baptist Church. That last comment was from Dr. Michael Baden who was talking about that shot to the head. 

We know that Michael Brown was shot at least six times, they have confirmed that he was shot six times. They are saying that there could be more. Again, this was a preliminary autopsy report. One done, at the family's behest by Dr. Michael Baden and Professor Parcells. All of the wounds were survivable except for the one at the top of the head. 

I want to discuss all of this, it is really a lot to wade through. We have George Howell in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, also our colleague Don Lemon, who has been on the ground there is also in Ferguson. Joe Johns joins us with more on the investigation, and I have to say this is a great get for us. Leading forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht. Thank you so much for joining us. Here in studio with me is legal analyst Danny Cevallos. Gentlemen, there is so much for us to get through, I think the first

thing we have to talk about, is the fact - And I will address this, maybe, to Don, the first thing that we heard was that the mother of Michael Brown wanted to know three things. Wanted to know how many times her son was shot, heartbreakingly she wanted to know if her son had felt any pain. And then lastly she said what else do we need to give them to arrest the killer of my child. What kind of reaction are you hearing and what do you sense you are going to get on the ground there in Ferguson? 

DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Listen, we've gotten tons of reaction. Some people listened here on loud speakers when they hold these press conferences, and people here, just in the last couple of minutes, before I answer your questions, people have been told here that they are allowed to protest but they have to keep moving. They cannot assemble. They cannot stop. And so that has caused a little consternation. You can see the police presence here for the folk who have gathered here. You remember these big meeting points, no longer a big meeting point. You can protest but you have to keep moving you can't congregate.

Yes, one thing she wanted to know was whether her son suffered. And you heard them say no, he didn't suffer. How many shots? They say at least six shots. What else do we have to do to get the officer arrested? And that's interesting because they are very vehemently called for an arrest of this officer, and there is some concern about that, because - Especially from the people who are here, who are gathering and saying, we don't want to push for an arrest when it's too fast and then it ends up like George Zimmerman, where the outcome is not what they wanted. Those are the three things that you asked me and those are the three answers that I can give you. 

And just so you know, that press conference, what's happening here where I am, the people are being told that they can't congregate and the National Guard, it's going to -- we're going to have to see how all of this plays out in the coming moments, Michaela. 

PEREIRA: Don, actually, if we can, if we still have time later this hour, I would love to talk to you more about that because there is a concern about what all of this information -- what effect that is going to have on the ground there in Ferguson. 

Stick with me for a second. I want to bring in our forensic pathologist. I think we're really lucky to have Dr. Cyril Wecht with us. I want to know, first blush, what did you make of what we heard at the press conference, sir? 

DR. CYRIL WECHT, FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST: Well, it confirms what had been reported earlier. I would point out, as I have already done so in previous discussions, that it was premature to have stated, as I read in the national newspapers this morning, that the shots were all from the front, because the arm can move in different directions. And when someone is running, then you may be struck in the back. And when you look at the body, as the professor pointed, out in a supine position, the anatomic position, then it would appear that shots were fired from the front. With regard to conscious pain and suffering, I disagree. The shots to

the arm, which I think came first, that did produce some pain, obviously. And then furthermore, if the shot that entered around the eye came before the shot that went into the brain, then there was pain there. The shot to the brain, then was the coup d'etat, and there was nothing there after. I don't mean to be critical, I am just pointing out some things that have to be considered. 

PEREIRA: Sure. 

WECHT: The point that I have made, too, is regrettable about this third autopsy. That should have been worked out before. The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology people should have been there. They should have worked together, professional collegiality. 

Because, remember, when you do an autopsy, you are dissecting the body. You are going through structures that have been traversed and damaged. Number two, the second autopsy, you have to do further dissection, so now you have the third autopsy, and things are significantly obfuscated. With regard to clothing, there's no clothing on the head and if the young man was wearing a T-shirt, then except maybe for the top wound on the right arm, the other wounds would not have been covered. I do not know what that garment was. 

And then a very important point is that this boy, 6'3 with a shot coming around the eye and moving downward, exiting in the jaw and entering above the right clavicle, that clearly is downward. You have someone who is falling. If you want to conjecture, what if he was charging like a mad bull toward an officer with a gun, I find that unlikely. Most likely he was already toppling and his head was pitched forward when that shot was fired and moved in a downward trajectory. That all has to be taken into consideration. 

PEREIRA: Doctor, we should point out as the doctor himself mentioned, Dr. Baden mentioned, this is a preliminary report. Give us an idea on when we would expect the full autopsy report, and again there's the county autopsy report. There's this independent report, and then there's also the federal autopsy that will be done. How long until we can expect those results to be completed, the full autopsies? 

WECHT: That is completely unpredictable. Dr. Baden correctly pointed out. That's a decision that's going to be made by the prosecutorial authorities as high as the attorney general of the state and possibly now, with the DOJ involved, by Eric Holder. I assure you that their findings are complete. I'm sure that they have already completed their toxicology findings. They have looked at the slides microscopically. They have the report back from the forensic science lab regarding the clothing. They have it all there. 

As to when it is to be released, that is a matter that is completely unpredictable at this point. It will depend on what the prosecution wants to do. And the same thing will hold true with the third autopsy that is, what is it taking place today or tomorrow, whether they release it. I don't know. 

I think inasmuch as this autopsy has been released, in detail, I think that it would be wise for everybody to step forward and speak from a forensic scientific standpoint as to the findings of the first autopsy, findings of the third autopsy, no conclusions of a legal nature. Nothing to do with whether the shooting was justifiable or so on, that will all come later. But from a forensic scientific standpoint there's no reason why the results of the shooting, the number of shots and the direction, the trajectory, the distance, et cetera, why that should not be released and put on the table in a professional, objective, scientific fashion. 

PEREIRA: You know what, I have to give you hats off. Maybe science should lead this. It seems that passion, and anger, and frustration have led this. I appreciate you saying that. 

Stand by because I want to bring in Joe Johns and Danny Cevallos, if I can do a two-fer here. One of the things that I found very interesting and very telling about what Dr. Baden said was that all of these answers could have been provided on day one in terms of transparency. 

Joe, where do we stand with the investigation? What do we know about the Feds, what do we know about what is going on there on the investigative front? And then I am going to turn to Danny to talk about that as well. 

JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know the Feds are going to do an autopsy of their own as they continue this investigation into the question of whether the civil rights of Michael Brown may have been violated. 

Look, when you listen to all of this stuff from the people there in Ferguson, one thing remains a question and that is whether this is justifiable deadly force by a police officer in the conduct of his duties. That's probably the critical question. An officer is entitled to use deadly force to protect himself or a third person from serious physical bodily harm or death. So you have six shots here, and the question, of course, the critical question is whether this young man was moving forward, if he was moving backward. Those kind of questions have to be left to the investigation and the people in Washington, D.C., who have an interest in this thing are going to be looking to those questions as well, Michaela. 

PEREIRA: All right, Joe. Thank you for that. 

Danny is sitting with me here in the studio. You've had a chance to listen to the press conference, listened to the pathologist, you have listened to our pathologist here. What are some sticking points for you in terms of all this?",NA,NA,NA,NA

Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, police late today revealing the heart breaking details of Robin Williams' death. After a struggle with sobriety and depression, Williams hanged himself with a belt inside the bedroom of his California home.

There is evidence that he had also tried to cut his wrists. There's been a day full of tributes to the great actor. You are looking at a live picture right now of the flowers piling up on Williams' star on the Hollywood walk of fame.

In just a few minutes in San Francisco, the Giants will honor the man they call their greatest fan. One of the landmarks from William's most iconic roles continue through the day today.

The bench where Williams and Matt Damon filmed a scene for ""Goodwill Hunting."" Ted Rowlands is OUTFRONT just north of San Francisco live in Tiburon, California.

Ted, what more can you tell us about the heart breaking news that we learned today of how he took his own life?

TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Erin, we know for sure now that Robin Williams was indeed seeking help for depression before he died. And we also know now for sure that he took his own life.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ROWLANDS (voice-over): According to the coroner, Robin Williams, was found in his home with a belt around his neck.

LT. KEITH BOYD, ASSISTANT CHIEF DEPUTY CORONER: The preliminary results of the forensic examination revealed supporting physical signs that Mr. Williams' life ended from asphyxia due to hanging. ROWLANDS: Williams spent Sunday night with his wife, Susan, according to investigators, she'd left the next morning thinking her husband was still asleep. A personal assistant found Williams at 11:45 a.m. Monday morning.

BOYD: The forensic examination did not reveal any injuries indicating Mr. Williams had been in a struggle or a physical altercation.

ROWLANDS: At comedy clubs across the country tributes to Williams have popped up.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was so shocked when it happened like so tragic.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Robin Williams was honestly just one of a kind.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Robin Williams has passed away.

ROWLANDS: Celebrities in interview and tweets are remembering Robin Williams as a sweet man, a one of a kind comedic and artistic genius. His 25-year-old daughter, Zelda, also tweeting a heart breaking tribute. When you look at the sky at night, you, only you, will have stars that can laugh. I love you, I miss you. I'll try to keep looking up.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

ROWLANDS: What we don't know, Erin, tonight is whether or not Robin Williams left a note. Investigators say they will not comment on that at this time. They also say that the investigation does continue pending toxicology results, which aren't expected for two to five weeks -- Erin.

BURNETT: Ted Rowlands, thank you very much. So many questions out there with why, with so much talent and so many people who have idealized the man that he would take his own life at 63 years old.

Comedians are mourning one of their own. They remember Robin Williams and that includes our next two guests. Actor Andy Dick, he was friends with Robin Williams, and legendary talk show host, Dick Cavett, one of the first to showcase Williams' talents back in 1979 on his late night PBS show. There he is.

Andy, what's your reaction to what the police are saying. So hard when people look at this man -- and people today are describing him to us as sometimes shy and not always comfortable with the adulation that younger actors may have felt around him.

But he had become such a lion in the industry, and to hear this happening at age 63, what goes through your head?

ANDY DICK, ACTOR/COMEDIAN: Yes. Everything. I mean, the man, first of all, 63 is so young, to me. I mean, Dick Cavett's still going strong. I saw Dick Cavett on Broadway, I don't know if you remember. What was that?

DICK CAVETT, FORMER TALK SHOW HOST: Yes. DICK: The vampire transvestite. Rocker horror picture show.

CAVETT: Rocky horror show.

BURNETT: There you go.

DICK: Now you have two dicks on your show.

CAVETT: No waiting.

DICK: No waiting. Seats available. Robin was the first time I met him, I was doing a show in San Francisco, and they came back to my dressing room and they said Robin Williams is outside in line to buy a ticket for your show. I said, first of all, hang on, man, are you sure it's Robin Williams?

And they said yes. Secondly, just bring him in. Don't make him wait in line to get a ticket. I did my show. My show is very much like his, but a poor man's version of what he does because I kind of stream of consciousness. I looked up to that man. Always have.

When I was 12 years old, I would listen to, reality, what a concept. His first album. Over and over and over with my friends on vinyl. And here he is at my show. I went up to him after the show, which is always a little bit like this, just crazy.

I said why did you come to see my show? And he said, I had to. And I think that spoke volumes to me. I knew exactly what he meant, and because I talk a lot about -- I wear my heart on my sleeve and I talk a lot about addictions. I know towards the end he talked about his.

Then we came friends. It was almost like secret friends. He actually took care of me a few times when I was not at my best, and he continued to come and support me when I would do my shows.

BURNETT: And would help you out, which is incredible how he would do that and connect with people who also suffered from some of the same demons he did. Mr. Cavett, I want to play a clip from when Robin Williams was on your show back in 1979. Here it is.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ROBIN WILLIAMS: Look, toys all over the set. Don't be afraid, Mr. Cameraman, we're going crazy. Whoa. Mother gave this so I could write my new book. An ode to Fred Silverman. Let's talk. Props, let's go. Look -- I'm not going to touch that one.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURNETT: I see you laughing there, but looking a bit bemused as well. I mean, did you ever imagine that would be how it would end?

CAVETT: It seems a little odd to say that I'm not totally surprised. Robin probably had one of the most difficult talents to be -- to have living inside you because of its incredible explosiveness and the volatility of it and his almost world class energy. Sitting beside him on two legendary half-hour shows that I did with him on PBS years ago, it was like sitting in the barge with the Macy's fireworks display. You felt this energy exploding all over the place.

The one thing I was sorry with the two shows -- though they were hilarious right from the top. I would have loved to get robin to talk so people could see not only what a great clown he was, but what a personable, super intelligent, thoughtful man he was. But I could never shake him out of the comic mask.

BURNETT: That's amazing. He had to put that on. You know, you said -- you've been open about having to deal with depression yourself and that a number of comedians have come forward and talked about how this has been a struggle for them, Jim Carrey, Rosie O'Donnell are on that list.

Why do you think it is that comedians struggle with depression? Is it because, you said that you always have to feel that you have to be funny and you have to be smiling even when inside you feel anything but?

CAVETT: Depression is a chemical thing. That's not news to anybody. But it does seem to me that it does strike an inordinate number of people in the business. I can give you a list of who's who names, many not known to be suffers and many who are, and suicides in the business.

And I don't know. If somebody would do a great research project on it there's some chemical link between the talented brain and some other aspect of that brain that is susceptible to depression, it would be very interesting.

As Andy knows, people go to booze, to drugs for alleviation. Alcohol is the wrong way to go because although you will feel a little better for a few moments, alcohol, as we know in school, is a depressing of the central nervous system and makes you worse.

There's really no way out except a good treatment. It bothers me to keep hearing the words ""he sought help."" did he get it?

BURNETT: Well, that's a big question. Andy, you struggle with alcoholism. I know even back even 25 years ago, Robin Williams had struggled with some of these issues for a long time. He had sought help. Hurt his personal relationships, hurt his marriages.

What would he say to you that explained how much he was struggling with it and how much he wanted you not to go through what he was going through.

DICK: I continue to struggle with alcoholism. I went through rehab 17 times. I used to be mad when we see guys that I knew that also struggled died and I would actually refuse to do this kind of thing. Now I see it helps.

You know what he would do, to be just very simple about it? He would laugh. You know, I can still hear him laughing with me just sitting one on one or sometimes the only one when I'm on stage, he'd be the only one laughing.

So the gift of laughter was not only -- he gave it by laughing. He was always laughing -- 

CAVETT: Andy, excuse me.

BURNETT: No, go ahead.

CAVETT: Once Robin came off from a club where he had just killed them in New York. We went back into the dressing room and they were still cheering. And he said, isn't it ironic that I can bring all that happiness to those people but not so often to myself.

DICK: I know, I know. That's kind of touching. People will be saying how could he do it? How could they do that to his wife and children? Listen, when you're in deep depression, it's the easiest world to do anything to anybody. You don't care. You can't make intelligent decisions. Your judgment is gone. Your brain foal feels broken and you can't be blamed for what you do.

BURNETT: Thank you both so much.

CAVETT: And people will say what have you got to be depressed about? You're rich, famous, wealthy and successful. That's like saying what do you got have flu about? It's an illness, anybody can get it.

DICK: Can I say one more thing?

BURNETT: Yes, of course.

DICK: I just wanted to let people know that if you have somebody that you love and you appreciate, just tell them because I feel -- I almost feel guilty that I didn't call more often and just tell anybody you love.

CAVETT: Get treatment as fast as you can.

BURNETT: Thanks to both of you. Just that you all knew him, but also when you think he got to 63 and had been fighting and fighting and then succumbed. Did Robin's heart surgery have anything to do with his depression? Doctors out there say yes.

Plus the breaking news, the United States announcing additional U.S. military personnel on their way to Iraq. Is it mission creep? Is it a big military involvement in Iraq?

Is it another Trayvon Martin? The president has gotten involved in a case of an unarmed black teen shot dead by police.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BURNETT: Tonight, the world is mourning the loss of a comedy legend Robin Williams. Police revealing today that Williams hanged himself with a belt inside his California home. There were cuts around the actor's left wrist. It was no secret that Williams battled depression for a long time, but what ultimately was the thing that made him kill himself on this day? 

Deborah Feyerick is OUTFRONT with Williams' own words on his personal struggles. 

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Robin Williams! 

DEBORAH FEYERICK, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Perhaps it was no coincidence that Robin Williams' HBO tour was called weapons of self-destruction. 

ROBIN WILLIAMS, ACTOR: You are an alcoholic. And some people say, Robin, I'm a functioning alcoholic which is you can be one like being a paraplegic lap dancer. You can do it. Just not as well as the others really. 

FEYERICK: And perhaps it was no coincidence either that Williams did that tour in 2009, a year after a major operation. 

WILLIAMS: Please, I've had heart surgery. Thank you. 

FEYERICK: Surgery that he says triggered mood swings. 

WILLIAMS: After the surgery, you get very emotional. It's like we're, people go how are you? 

FEYERICK: For Williams it was all fair game. 

WILLIAMS: When I was growing up, they used to say, Robin, drugs can kill you. Now that I'm 58, my doctor is going, Robin, you need drugs to live. 

FEYERICK: Raw, honest, self-deprecating humor in which Williams shares with the world his struggles with alcohol and drugs. 

WILLIAMS: I had a little problem with alcohol. I wasn't a problem. Everybody had it. But it was the idea -- I was an alcoholic. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You were a drunk. Now, do you think you've beaten it? 

WILLIAMS: No, Larry, it's always there. Yes, I kicked it. No, I'm fine. No, the idea is that you always have a little bit of fear like you have to just keep at it. It's a day by day. 

FEYERICK: In 1992 as a young comedian Williams famously partied with pal John Belushi hours before the blues brother star overdosed on heroin and cocaine. 

WILLIAMS: Cocaine, what a beautiful drug. Anything that makes you paranoid and impotent, give me more of that. 

FEYERICK: He soon quit cold turkey and remained sober nearly two decades until 2003 then relapsed and rehab. Here in 2006 for comic relief. 

WILLIAMS: It is always good for me to come to Vegas after rehab. I love that. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a good time for you. 

WILLIAMS: A good time for me. It is like going to Colombia, you know. Where are you going for detox? Colombia. Just going to take it easy in this 24-hour alcohol town. 

FEYERICK: In 2008 when his second marriage ended as a result of alcoholism, he says, Williams again went to rehab, joking about it with U.S. troops. 

WILLIAMS: I was violating my standards quicker than I could lower them. 

FEYERICK: Wherever he went, it seems there was always laughter. But with that came unbearable pressure. William suffered manic depression. 

WILLIAMS: No, I'm not always fun to be around. And that there is this thing of, yes, the world sees one thing. And what am I like at home, different because I can't always be on. 

FEYERICK: Surrounded by millions who adored him, loved him. Yet in the end could not save him. 

WILLIAMS: Good night! 

FEYERICK: Deborah Feyerick, CNN, New York. 

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BURNETT: OUTFRONT tonight, Dr. Charles Sophy, a psychiatrist who met Robin Williams and Dr. Daniel Amen, the neuropsychiatrist. 

Dr. Amen, let me start with you. You know, from what we know and what you just heard Robin Williams saying there, I mean, obviously, his demons and his addictions destroyed at least two marriages, but he had a supportive family. His daughter adored him. Friends adored him. But the depression took over. What could have happened to trigger this now, after fighting it for decades and decades? He's 63 years old. What would have made it happen now? 

DOCTOR DANIEL AMEN, NEUROPSYCHIATRIST: Well, I think there's actually stacked stresses, so a number of them. What we know is cocaine abuse, alcohol abuse, all damage the brain. The heart surgery that he has, there's evidence that that can damage the brain, aging. And then if you take his show being canceled. You see the stacked stresses that weigh on him so get him to a point where he feels great pain is hopeless and then he kills himself. 

BURNETT: And Dr. Amen, you mentioned the open heart surgery that he had in 2009, that he just referred to there in Deb's piece. Dr. Sophy, you know, he talked about that surgery and how it affected

his mind and emotional state on Ellen DeGeneres' show. And I wanted to play that for you. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

WILLIAMS: With guys, especially, you know, you get this whole thing in we armor up like I'm a dude, I'm a dude. You have a heart surgery and literally they open you up. They crack the box. And you get really vulnerable. You will be like I can't (INAUDIBLE) and you get very emotional about everything. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURNETT: You can talk about something to serious and yet it's funny when he says it. 

Dr. Sophy, is there a link between heart surgery and mental health issues? 

DOCTOR CHARLES SOPHY, PSYCHIATRIST: Absolutely. That's why within the cardiac rehab process, you look at the mental health pieces of yourself. You also are not just getting your body back in shape, you're getting your mind back in shape to be able to deal with the fact that you had something that rock your core that really showed you that wow, I'm infallible. I could die. And there is something that could really do me in that is more powerful. It really wakes you up. And it's very scary. 

And as he was saying, men don't typically emote like that. They want to be tough. And so, with all that, you hide a lot. 

BURNETT: And Dr. Amen, the Cleveland clinic, that's where Williams underwent his surgery, one of the top places in the world. They say open heart surgery patients who have life transitions going on are especially susceptible to depression. So in Williams' case is this even more apropos, the fact that he was divorced twice. He was struggling with addiction, that all of those things would make the heart surgery even more risky? 

AMEN: No question about it. All of them matters. When we evaluate people, we always look at biological, psychology, social and spiritual influences. And if you have trouble in any of those circles, it makes you more vulnerable to depression and all of the consequences of it. 

At the Amen clinics, what we do is we do imaging. And we can actually see the damage or the evidence of those stresses, and most people don't know that, I mean, depression really is a brain disorder and brain rehabilitation can be so helpful, diet, exercise, simple supplements, medication, a newer treatment called transcranial magnetic stimulation. 

There's so much hope to rebuild and repair the brain. But a lot of people, when they get depressed, they get to such a dark place that they lose hope. And they actually lose things, as Dick Cavett (ph) was talking about, empathy, so they don't really understand what this is going to do to the people they love. 

BURNETT: And Dr. Sophy, what about this issue that we've heard and I think our viewers have seen just watching these clips from Robin Williams over the past 24 hours. He was always so funny. And even when someone asked him something serious, he would answer in his mode, right? He would have the comedian side turn on. And the study from the British Journal of psychiatry says comedians that are more inclined to have -- I want to quote it -- high levels of psychotic personality traits. Is there a link between that, between great comedians and depression? And why is that? I mean, is it just as simple as you have to think you have to be funny all the time, but you're still a human underneath it. Is it that simple? 

SOPHY: No, I think there is definitely a link, though. But it is as simple as saying that humor, often times, is used as a defense mechanism for people who are uncomfortable about feeling or uncomfortable where they are emotionally and they don't have the ability feel safe enough to do it in a vulnerable way. They do it in a funny way. And because that ends up becoming like their thing, they end up making money from it, they're good at it, if this becomes a way of life and a self-soothing tool. So yes, it's good to have humor as a mechanism of defense. But however, you can't use it at your own detriment. 

BURNETT: Thanks very much to both of you, Dr. Amen and Dr. Sophy. And for more resources on coping with depression, go to CNN.com/impact. 

Still OUTFRONT, one of Robin Williams' most famous movie, one of my favorite, ""Dead Poet's Society."" I want to share with you my personal connection to the film. We have a wonderful story tonight. 

And more U.S. military advisors are heading to Iraq. How many more Americans are going to be going into Iraq top defeat the terrorist group, ISIS. Is this a war? 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BURNETT: Breaking news. We're just getting word that more U.S. military personnel are headed to Iraq tonight. Approximately 130 new military advisers are going to northern Iraq. That will bring the total number of American military personnel on the ground to more than 900. The advisers are headed to the area where tens of thousands from the minority group called the Yazidis are stranded as they flee religious persecution by ISIS. 

Today, the U.S. military conducted new strikes to get ISIS' position near Mt. Sinjar. That's where the Yazidis are right now desperately trying to get assistance on the top of this mountain. They have been firing ISIS as Yazidis trying to flee the area preventing them from coming off of that mountain, just one day after we brought you the dramatic rescue as the fly mission on the mountain. Our Ivan Watson with the brave and credible reporting as helicopter that was being used to bring aid to trapped Yazidis crashed today. 

Now, the pilot, an Iraqi general, died. Everyone else did survive. Ivan Watson was on that helicopter flight yesterday. And he joins us

now from Iraq. 

And, Ivan, the Yazidis who made it off of that mountain, like some of the ones you met yesterday who were rushing you and so desperate to get any kind of help and assistance, where are they going? 

IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I would say the majority of them, Erin, are sleeping out in the open, basically camping out on roadsides on the medians of highways and in the shells of unfinished and abandoned buildings. We watched thousands of them crossing, you know, some of them, handful got out on those helicopters that were flying off the mountain, an overloaded helicopter of which crashed that had many of these refugees on it, but far more were coming out on foot and were coming across a bridge into Iraqi Kurdistan. And some of those people are just literally camping out on the banks of the river at the border where they walked in. 

These people exhausted. They're tired, hungry. And one of them described how on a marathon march through the desert, he had to bury two of his infant brothers who expired as a result of exposure to the elements. 

BURNETT: I mean, this is just so -- it's impossible to imagine when you hear these things that they're happening in this year 2014, Ivan. But the word that's been thrown out there is genocide and whether that's a risk. And if it is, that that might be the only thing that could justify a greater U.S. involvement. It is such a crucial question in the United States.

From what you have seen in your reporting, isn't a word that is appropriate to use? 

WATSON: Hey, it's certainly a word that the leadership of Iraqi Kurdistan is using a lot, that the members of the different ethnic and religious groups that are being pushed out en masse from their homes, that they're using as well. I -- from my vantage point, I haven't seen bodies, I haven't seen mass murders, but I've certainly seen what looks like a systematic policy of ethnic and sectarian cleansing where people are pushed en masse from their communities largely based on their religious or ethnic identity. 

And these vast numbers of people from a wide variety of different groups, they include Kurds, and Christians and Turkmen and Syrians and Yazidis, there's one thing in common here, they're fleeing one group that's armed that's called ISIS, and they all seem to be getting shelter here in Iraqi Kurdistan, even as its troops are involved in what appears to be an existential battle against the ISIS militants -- Erin. 

BURNETT: Ivan Watson, thank you so much. Ivan Watson doing, as you have all no doubt seeing, incredible and great reporting from Iraq. 

And joining me now is Juan Zarate, former deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism. Juan, you know, now that we hear, we're going to have another 130 U.S.

personnel headed to Iraq, the defense secretary just talking about this moments ago, with the number. We've now got more than 900 Americans on the ground. 

Is this enough to make the difference? Or is this -- when you hear what Ivan's talking about, about a policy of ethnic cleansing, a drop in the bucket and do we need to be more honest, if the United States is going to do something about it, it's going to require a lot more people and combat? 

JUAN ZARATE, SENIOR ADVISOR, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: Well, Erin, I think it depends on what our objective is. If it's to stave off the offensive against our Kurdish allies in Peshmerga, to save the Yazidis on Mount Sinjar, then the airstrikes may help, and some of these additional advisers will be helpful. 

But it's certainly not going to be enough to dislodge ISIS, and it's certainly not going to be enough to defeat them and dislodge them from the safe haven they've created in both Iraq and Syria. 

And so, I actually agree with the latter part of your question, which is, we've got to take a step back and ask ourselves, what are we trying to achieve here? And if we're trying to actually dislodge and defeat ISIS, it's going to take more than 130 additional advisers and it's going to take more than just airstrikes. 

BURNETT: And that -- that, of course, leads to the question of boots on the ground and what ISIS is fighting with. I mean, the Kurdish regional government chief of staff told CNN, I want to quote him, ""ISIS has all sorts of sophisticated weapons."" And, in fact, we've heard reports that ISIS is fighting with a lot of American-sourced weapons that they've gotten from somewhere or from Syria, versus the Kurds, who don't have the same quality of weapon. 

I mean, how sophisticated is their weaponry and how well-armed are they with American weapons? 

ZARATE: Well, ISIS I think has been underestimated. They're well- resourced. They've obviously held territory. They've taken major cities like Mosul and Tikrit. They've overrun Iraqi security installations, have picked up weaponry, the Humvees and the tanks that we left behind for the Iraqis. 

They're also well-resourced. We've talked about this before, Erin. They run a war economy. They've inspired not just donations but foreign fighters to fight for their cause. 

So, this is a real enemy. They're equipped. They have a mission and they need to be pushed back. 

And I'm not sure this requires American boots on the ground but at a minimum, it requires support to the Peshmerga, our Kurdish allies, who are willing to fight and who are currently fighting this group. 

BURNETT: And when you talk about the need for the United States to take a step back and look at things really are, and an honest evaluation of what this might entail, it made me think about this -- the president back in January talked to ""The New Yorker"" about ISIS. And he said at the time, I'll quote him, ""The analogy we used around here sometimes and I think it's accurate is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn't make them Kobe Bryant.""

Now, here's how the Pentagon described ISIS just yesterday. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

LT. GEN. WILLIAM MAYVILLE JR., DIR. OF OPS FOR THE JOINT CHIEFS: They're very well-organized. They're very well-equipped. They coordinate their operations. And they have thus far shown the ability to attack on multiple axes. This is not insignificant. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURNETT: They didn't just get all that ability in a few months. So, why did the U.S. government underestimate them? 

ZARATE: Well, I think part of it, Erin, is that we don't have a footprint on the ground the way we once did in Iraq. And so, we don't have the intelligence infrastructure, the military footprint in Iraq. We've been absent largely from Syria. So, we're a bit blind as to what's happening there, as well, which is where ISIS has really gained strength and territory. 

And so, this is a group that is serious. They're piggybacking off of the al Qaeda narrative and inspiration and even infrastructure. And the reality is as you listen to American officials, there's real concern that this is now becoming a platform for potential attacks against the West. 

So, this is not just a group threatening the Yazidis on the mountain or even the Kurds, this is a group that's becoming an inspiration to the global jihadi movement and that's really what has American officials worried. 

BURNETT: All right. Juan Zarate, thank you.

ZARATE: Thank you, Erin.

BURNETT: And still to come, police brace for violence in Missouri after an unarmed black teen is shot by police. Is this Trayvon Martin all over again? President Obama has weighed in. 

And much more on Robin Williams, including his friendship with a gorilla named Koko. Jeanne Moos has that story.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BURNETT: Breaking news on the unarmed black teenager shot and killed by police in Missouri. 

Tonight, President Obama has weighed in calling the death of 18-year- old Michael Brown heartbreaking. Anger over Brown's death has exploded into chaos and violence. President Obama addressed that in his statement saying in part, quote, ""I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across this country to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.""

Tonight, though, police are bracing for more violence for a second night in a row. Shots already have been fired. Police using tear gas to disperse the crowds. 

As everyone wondering, and now the president has weighed in, is this Trayvon Martin again? 

David Mattingly is OUTFRONT from police headquarters. 

And, David, now the president has weighed in on this, it's very significant. There was another case of white on black violence that did not -- he did not weigh in on, he has in this like he did only in one other case, Trayvon Martin. 

What is this doing to the tension in the community where you are? 

DAVID MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the president's comments today are reminiscent of the personal reaction he had to the Trayvon Martin's case -- Trayvon Martin case. And at that time, the president's comments did have an effect on the demonstrators in Sanford, Florida. They really took it to heart. 

It's a little too early to see what effect it might have here in Ferguson, Missouri, but as you can see the demonstrators are not going away. These people have been outside city hall almost all day today demonstrating. It's just another example of how this case is very similar to the experience we had with Trayvon Martin. 

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MATTINGLY (voice-over): The tragic killing of Michael Brown prompts almost immediate comparisons to the death of another unarmed black teenager. The case of Trayvon Martin might differ in detail but its influence on the Brown investigation is evident. Within 48 hours of Brown's death, national leaders of the NAACP were already in Ferguson, Missouri, framing the killing as the latest in an ongoing national problem. 

CORNELL WILLIAM BROOKS, NAACP PRESIDENT AND CEO: I believe that Trayvon Martin case is a prologue to a sad national narrative where we have young people who are accused of underwhelmingly minor offenses that are often met with a major overwhelming sometimes lethal use of force. 

MATTINGLY: The U.S. Justice Department became involved just as quickly. Attorney General Eric Holder calling in the FBI and U.S. attorneys, but saying that local investigators should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right. 

In the Trayvon Martin case, the Justice Department didn't get involved until after public confidence in the police investigation was lost. A possible mistake not repeated in Missouri. 

CNN contributor Mark O'Mara represented Trayvon Martin's killer George Zimmerman. 

MARK O'MARA, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Without question, we have been sensitized because of the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin matter that it is going to be under a microscope. And quite honestly, in our criminal justice system, it should be. We should be looking at these cases very, very carefully. 

MATTINGLY: Attorney Benjamin Crump represented the family of Trayvon Martin and now speaks for Michael Brown's parents. Crump points to one key difference -- Trayvon Martin was killed by a resident on neighborhood watch. Brown's death is at the hands of law enforcement. 

BENJAMIN CRUMP, BROWN FAMILY ATTORNEY: Trayvon was shot once. But as we understand from these witnesses, this child was shot multiple times, and left on the ground like a dog. 

MATTINGLY: That harsh image now drives angry demands for justice and official promises of transparency, also reminiscent of the aftermath in the death of Trayvon Martin. 

(END VIDEOTAPE)

MATTINGLY: And police in Ferguson prepared again tonight, but not knowing what to expect. The same posture they were in last night when they had that confrontation. The FAA also weighing in today, issuing a no-fly zone over Ferguson, Missouri, for at least the next week saying it's for safety reasons for the police investigation -- Erin.

BURNETT: A dramatic move. 

Thank you very much, David Mattingly. 

And OUTFRONT next, Robin Williams changed one school forever. It just happened to be mine.

And Robin Williams and one special gorilla. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BURNETT: Since Robin Williams' death was announced last night, fans around the world have been sharing their memories about him. And one of our favorite times was the time the comedian met a gorilla named Koko. 

Here's Jeanne Moos. 

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Sure, Robin Williams made us smile. But what made him smile? Tickling an ape? 

ROBIN WILLIAMS, ACTOR/COMEDIAN: I tickle her and she's -- MOOS: It was an encounter he called mind-altering, holding hands with

a gorilla named Koko, famous for understanding sign language taught by her surrogate mom, Dr. Penny Patterson. 

DR. PENNY PATTERSON, SURROGATE MOM: Who is that?

MOOS: Profiled by PBS, the cover girl in ""National Geographic"", and in 2001, Robin Williams asked to pay a visit. 

PATTERSON: She was very drawn to him.

MOOS: She took his glasses and ended up wearing them. She picked his pocket, investigated his wallet, but mostly she asked. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tickle, tickle. She wants you to tickle.

MOOS: And they tickled and tickled and tickled. 

Ellen DeGeneres noted Robin's harry arms. 

ELLEN DEGENERES, TV HOST: Koko, the gorilla -- 

WILLIAMS: She actually looked at me and went, where have you been? 

MOOS: Years later, he was still using the encounter as material but at the time of the visit. 

PATTERSON: He was so quiet and respectful and just present. 

MOOS: Perfect for making a gorilla swoon. 

(on camera): Though this a one-and-only face-to-face meeting, Koko was already familiar with Robin Williams. 

(voice-over): She had watched the documentary he did on dolphins and he watched ""Awakenings"" over and over. 

WILLIAMS: But it was interesting to me, you know, hit on by another species.

MOOS (on camera): Koko is known to have a bit of an obsession with a certain body part. 

WILLIAMS: She did this and her translator said she wanted you to lift your shirt and I lifted my shirt and she grabbed both my nipples. I went, I like you. 

MOOS (voice-over): But their relationship was nipped in the bud. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You don't hit. Sweetheart -- 

WILLIAMS: All of a sudden she grabs my hand and tries to take me in the back, and all of a sudden, I see her translator going, Koko, no, Mr. Williams doesn't want to play bump, bump. 

MOOS: Funny stuff, but try making a gorilla laugh. Back in 2001, Koko was 30 years old and sad about the death of her companionate named Michael. She hasn't smiled in six months until this funny man tickled her fancy. 

Penny Patterson says Koko knew something was amiss. 

Listening to phone calls Monday.

PATTERSON: I just said, Koko, we've lost a dear friend. You remember Robin. 

MOOS: How could she or we forget him? 

Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.

BURNETT: Something miraculous about great how he got her to smile after she had lost Michael.

Well, we want to give you an update on this. Koko's surrogate mother tells us actually that the encounter with Robin Williams and Koko lasted for a couple hours, which was pretty much the longest ever visit that Koko tolerated with a human. 

OUTFRONT next, when Robin Williams came to my school.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates? 

WILLIAMS: There is seating near the front. The concert begins at 5:00. It will be Mozart, Elvis, and one of your choosing. Or just so nice if heaven exists, to know that there is laughter. That would be a great thing. Just to hear God goes, two Jews walk into a bar -- 

(LAUGHTER)

(END VIDEO CLIP) 

BURNETT: It's tough to pick a favorite Robin Williams movie, but mine is ""Dead PoetS Society."" Robin Williams was unforgettable in his role as an inspiring teacher. He filmed that movie at my high school. 

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Captain, my captain. 

WILLIAMS: Sit down, Mr. Anderson. 

BURNETT: ""Dead Poets Society,"" a movie loved by many, and the heart of an entire school -- generations of students and teachers like Eric Kerner, who is a young teacher at a school in Delaware when Robin Williams arrived there to film the modern classic. 

ERIC KERNER, ST. ANDREW'S FACULTY MEMBER: There's great deal of excitement, being able to witness, having a film company on campus and filming here. 

I think my favorite scene is an opening scene where he's orienting his students and has them peer at the images of past students, most of whom already passed away, and Robin Williams kind of lurks behind them as they are learning towards the pictures and he starts whispering, their voices from beyond. 

WILLIAMS: Carpe diem. 

BURNETT: It was more than 25 years ago, but Robin Williams' character, the passionate teacher John Keating, still defined St. Andrews School, my alma mater. The movie poster in the admissions office, pictures of Robin Williams in the main entrance to the school. I'm still so proud of my school's link to Robin Williams. I like, so many other graduates, say did you ever see the movie ""Dead Poets Society"" with Robin Williams? That's where I went to school.

Today, a day after Robin Williams death, the iconic locations from ""Dead Poet Society"" are frozen in time. 

Tad Roach is head master of the school now. When he was young teacher, he spent time during Robin Williams during the months Williams spent at St. Andrews.

Tad tells me he never forgot Robin Williams and director Peter Weir. ""We found inspiration from his depiction of a revolutionary and passionate classroom teacher. But we who are on campus in those days were so struck in particular by the grace of Peter Weir, and the spirit and vitality Robin Williams.""

Together, Weir and Williams saw their visions unfold in the beauty of St. Andrews, pond, buildings and fields. 

KERNER: I was struck by how generous it was and played off his experience of the school and experiences with the students, and very funny and very humorous. But also inclusive, but at the same time, I just still had this impression that he was almost embarrassed to be the center of attention. You know, he was a shy person. 

BURNETT: Robin Williams made carpe diem, a modern phrase brought alive by a man who as a person, not just as an actor, gave a school a soul. 

WILLIAMS: Left, left, left right left. 

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BURNETT: Surely did. It's such a part of that school and it's amazing just to imagine that he's not there anymore.
