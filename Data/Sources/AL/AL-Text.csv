Dear Lord, not again. Not in 2014. Not in the US of A.

Thomas Jackson, the police chief of Ferguson, Missouri, appeared on Fox News last night and b{lamed the violence in his town on ""outside agitators.""}<hyperlink=”http://www.newsmax.com/US/Ferguson-Thomas-Jackson-outside-agitators/2014/08/13/id/588658/”>

And it all came back.

George Wallace came back.

Wallace argued 50 years ago that Alabama never really had racial issues at all. ""We have never had a problem in the South except in a few very isolated instances and these have been the result of outside agitators,"" he wrote in 1964.

Infamous Birmingham Police Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor came back, too. Connor rationalized the use of dogs and fire hoses on black protesters by blaming ""outside agitators."" You might have heard of one.

 ""The city of Birmingham has been under siege from outside agitators led by Martin Luther King,"" Connor said in 1963. ""This bunch has done what they wanted to do, stir up trouble among whites and negro citizens ... What we need is for the president to show sincerity in wanting peace in Birmingham and get the outside agitators to leave us alone, and let us work out our problems locally.""

If those outside agitators hadn't shown up, black people wouldn't want to drink from our fountains and eat at our lunch counters. If those outside agitators had not appeared, black people would not want to vote or to buy homes in our pleasant communities, to go to better schools, to live better lives, to have the same rights as us white folk.

If it hadn't been for outside agitators, black people – let's just say it – would know their place.

That was the Birmingham message then. King had a thing or two to say about it.

In his letter from the Birmingham Jail – still the most important thing written here – he also spoke of the outside agitator.

""Whenever the early Christians entered a town, the people in power became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians for being 'disturbers of the peace' and 'outside agitators,""' he wrote. ""But the Christians pressed on.""

And that has become the message of Birmingham.

It was, I suppose, inevitable that comparisons would be made between these two cities.

All those images, and the human shock and awe. The black faces juxtaposed against a wall of armed officers in riot gear. Birmingham used fire hoses. Ferguson chose rubber bullets and tear gas.

But I wasn't ready to make the comparison. Not yet. I could not fathom how, in 2014, a city could become two-thirds black and maintain a police department that is 97 percent white. But I did not know enough about the incident that led to protest to compare it to anything that took place here.

We won't know if it is comparable at all until the tear gas clears.

Then that police chief opened his mouth, and that old rhetoric of oppression poured out. And my jaw dropped.

Because the lessons of Martin Luther King – the lessons of Birmingham – did not reach as far or as long as I thought. They did not reach Ferguson.

Let us hope – for the interest of right, and of rights, and of Ferguson and beyond – that it's not too late. Let us hope the lessons of King speak not just to the police but to the protesters, or rioters, or whatever they are. You can't stand for justice and violate your own people with gas and military grade weapons. But then, you can't stand for change and tear down your own neighborhood,either. 

In talking of outside agitators such as himself, King issued a warning. To Bull Connor, to Birmingham and the world. To today.

""I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle,"" King wrote in his letter from jail. ""If this philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as ""rabble rousers"" and ""outside agitators"" those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.""

If the world did not learn the lessons of Birmingham, it will all come back.",598,1700,NA,NA
AL,al2,http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/08/a_message_from_birmingham_to_f.html,"A message from Birmingham to Ferguson: Keep protests non-violent, involve ministers, and communicate", Madison Underwood,8/14/2014,5/24/2016,"BIRMINGHAM, Alabama – As protests rack the streets of Ferguson, MO, following the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer on Saturday, many have drawn comparisons to the bloody fight against segregation in Birmingham half a century ago.

And there's a message from those Birmingham foot soldiers and its residents: stress non-violence, involve the ministers of churches, and communicate. And to the police force of Ferguson: open lines of communication to your residents, and listen to their voices.

Non-violence

""It's very important to organize non-violent protests, because if someone does not organize non-violent protests in instances like this, violence runs rampant,"" says {Bishop Calvin Woods, Sr.,}<hyperlink=”https://sewell.house.gov/uploads/Honoring%20Rev.%20Abraham%20Woods%2C%20Jr%20and%20Bishop%20Calvin%20Woods.pdf”> a foot soldier in Birmingham's Civil Rights Movement and the past president of the Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He stressed the words ""non-violent"" as he spoke.

""It is in the best interest of this city that non-violent protests continue on,"" Woods said. ""That gives people hope that something is going to be done about it.""

{Jonathan McPherson}<hyperlink=”http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/10/how_a_chemistry_professor_near.html”>, the first black person to pass the civil service exam to be a police officer in Birmingham, and who guarded Martin Luther King, Jr. when he stayed on Birmingham's ""Dynamite Hill,"" urged nonviolence, as well.

""I certainly would hope that they would invoke the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King, and that is: Be non-violent, be peaceful, and be respectful of legal authority,"" he said in Kelly Ingram Park, the site of many of the Birmingham protests of 1963, on Thursday. ""We are thankful that we have an attorney general who is on top of what is happening {and has already ordered the Civil Rights Division to investigate}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/08/ferguson_mo_police_chief_says.html”>. We are thankful that we have a president who has already expressed himself and urged everyone to be non-violent. So, that is the message from Birmingham – be non-violent, be respectful of legal authority.""

In Birmingham for a meeting of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference on Tuesday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr., asked for non-violence from the citizens in Ferguson.

""They should be marching, but for equity in police hirings, marching for equity in fireman hirings, marching for equity in contracts and in education,"" Jackson {told the Alabama Media Group editorial board}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/08/bentley_blocking_the_hospital.html”>. ""And burning up buildings will not achieve that.""

The police

McPherson was a bit taken aback upon learning that {only three of Ferguson's 53 police officers are African-American,}<hyperlink=”http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-department-diversity-questioned-officers/13976879/”> despite the fact that 67 percent of the city's population is African-American.

""That is what African-American leadership needs to be working on,"" McPherson said. ""And the young people, those who are throwing rocks, those who are looting, can help address that situation by getting themselves qualified. Go down, take the test, and qualify to be policemen. Because that certainly seems to be an embarrassment, when you have a 70 percent African-American population, and you have only three black officers.""

Woods, too, was surprised at the lack of diversity in the police force. ""Well, you see, that's wrong,"" he said, a bit startled. ""They've got to change that.""

One young African-American man on 20th St. in downtown Birmingham Thursday who asked not to be identified said that the situation in Ferguson is ""just messed up."" He compared it to the Trayvon Marvin situation, and said police should be more measured in their responses.

""Think about what you're doing before you act,"" he said.

Andre Smith, an African-American who was downtown on his lunch break Thursday, called the situation in Ferguson ""a sticky situation,"" but was hopeful that justice can emerge.

He said he was skeptical of the way police handled the situation, since it involved ""a kid in flip flops and gym shorts with no weapon,"" he said. ""I can see him maybe getting wrestled to the ground and handcuffed, but being shot two or three times in the chest? I don't know about that one."" He was afraid someone else will be hurt before the protests are over.

Mark Kelly, the publisher of the weekly Birmingham newspaper Weld, was critical of the armored police showing up in Ferguson to handle protestors. Studies show that police in normal uniforms are better able to handle tense crowd situations, Kelly said. ""People react to them [police in armor] in a negative way.""

""The militarization of police is an issue that is very serious, and it gets to whether the police are there to protect and serve, or is it now more of an us vs. them attitude where every member of the public is suspect in some way,"" he said.

{Johnnie Johnson, Jr.,}<hyperlink=”http://www.bhamwiki.com/w/Johnnie_Johnson,_Jr”> the first black police chief in Birmingham, urged the police chief to ""meet with as many community leaders as possible,"" and to open itself to ""all the practices of community policing."" That will let the people of Ferguson get to know its police force better, he said.

Arrests of protestors, when necessary, should be handled in a way that doesn't provoke more violence, Johnson said.

""If you've got protestors, and there's no nightsticks and no beatings, if it requires four officers to pick somebody up and move them to another place, use those officers to do that rather than dragging or whatever,"" Johnson advised.

Using ministers

When protestors show up with violent intentions, non-violent protestors ""have to continue to cry out against it,"" Woods advised. In recent days, protestors have clashed with police, looting and burning a store on Sunday and attacking the militarized police force meant to calm the demonstrations during this week.

In Birmingham's 1963 fight for desegregation, churches were the core organizing force for the protests. Ministers led the protests. They need to called upon again in Ferguson, Woods said. ""Get as many as you can, and they should band together."" Continue the calls for calmness, and non-violence, he urged.

""You can always appeal to the ministers, because they are seen as leaders in the community,"" Johnson, Jr. said. His advice was to the mayor's administration, and to the police chief in Ferguson. ""Appealing to [the ministers] will assist in bringing that sense of solidarity to the community.""

Richard Arrington, Jr., the first black mayor of Birmingham, urged communication between the community and the police force. The communication ""reassures"" protestors that their voices are being heard.

""I think a key to trying to resolve the concerns of the neighborhood and to halt the violence is to keep the channel of communication between them open, to get some assurance that justice is going to be done,"" Arrington said.

The current crisis ought to show the value of a diverse police force, according to Arrington.

""This is another example of the failure of community leaders to see the importance of diversifying the labor force and having issues like that resolved ahead of time before you have trouble,"" Arrington said. ""It doesn't mean necessarily that the incident that occurred wouldn't have still have stirred the anger of folks, even if it had been a black police officer."" (The {Ferguson police chief has not released the identity of the police officer involved in the shooting}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/ferguson_police_chief_will_not.html”>, citing security threats.)

""Non-violence got us over the hump here in 60s,"" Woods said. ""We didn't have the firepower to deal with violence, so we were going up against the elements that were being violent towards us – the dogs biting people, Bull Connor had a tank, being beaten up.""

""I've been beat up myself, spit on, I've been jailed more than once, and not because I was doing anything wrong.""",100,242,NA,NA

Holder said Monday after briefing President Obama on the latest developments in Ferguson,

""As I informed the President this afternoon, the full resources of the Department of Justice are being committed to our federal civil rights investigation into the death of Michael Brown.

""During the day today, more than 40 FBI agents continued their canvassing of the neighborhood where Michael Brown was shot. As a result of this investigative work, several new interviews have already been conducted.

In their comments to a series of stories at AL.com regarding the confrontation, readers are sharply divided. 

Some support the actions of the Ferguson police – both in their handling of the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown and in their reaction to the demonstrations and some looting. 

Some commenters find the shooting unjustified. 

Quite a few readers, even some who seem to doubt the actions or motivations of some of the demonstrators in Ferguson, express fear that police have overreacted, and some say that American police have become overly militarized. 

However, many readers were critical of people who have engaged in looting or burning of businesses during the protests.

Fox 2101: Unarmed people can still pose a deadly threat. I think I'll wait for the facts to come out before I start holding vigils. 

Loggerhead: Police also advised the liberal new media, the officer in question was attempting to make an arrest he resisted and attempted to take the officers weapon. The officer suffered injuries to his face if that's the case he was justified in protecting himself. No mention of the riot, looting, and destroying property. i don't blame the police use what force necessary  to protect themselves. The blacks are playing the race card to cover their action for stealing and destroying property. 

Filmike: 2 eyewitnesses pretty much close this case. The kids were walking in the street. The cop told them to get on the sidewalk. They said they were a block from home, the cop pulled away, reversed, got within a few inches, grabbed Brown, Brown tried to pull away, the cop pulled his gun and shot from inside the car, Brown got loose and started running away, the cop got out and shot Brown in the back, Brown turned around and put his hands up and the cop walked up to him shooting 6 to 8 more shots. Even if Brown reached in to get the cops gun and the cop defended himself and shot Brown, there was no reason to walk up to him emptying his clip. This cop is going to jail. If not, expect more riots. 

Daystar7: Since there has been no evidence released as to the guilt or innocence of the police officers in this case, I wonder what all the black leaders will do if it turns out the shooting was justified?

aturner339: A lot of the problem goes to lack of competence local law enforcement is showing both in handling the investigation and in crowd control. 

Shadooby: The rioters are idiots but so are the armed-to-the-teeth cops with a chip on their shoulder. 

Shadooby: Local police along with many federal agencies have become militarized in this country with equipment from the Pentagon. Our police forces are supposed to protect and defend and DIFFUSE violence, not incite it. They look like an infantry patrol in Afghanistan. 

Doodooham: This should not be a race issue. It's an out of control police mentality issue. Hopefully this is the wake up call to all Americans that the militarization of domestic police forces and their war attitudes have gone completely off the tracks throughout the country. Pack those want to be Call of Duty, steroid heads up and let them fight ISIS instead of Americans on American soil! 

Mortie: Let's destroy our neighborhood because an officer had to shoot a man who was attacking him and trying to take his gun. This will be fun.

The Stig: Police race relations are easy... treat everyone the same regardless of their race, enforce the laws equally regardless of race, pay the most attention to the areas with the most crime.

alprice: As usual the race baiters and the media blur the story. There seem to be two groups; the peaceful protesters during the day, and then the rioting looters at night.",37,14,NA,NA

Hours earlier, the police chief had said race relations were the top priority in the town, where a white police officer fatally shot the black teen. Authorities have vowed to reach across the racial, economic and generational divide in a community in search of answers.
In the streets of Ferguson, though, the polite dialogue heard at community forums and news conferences is nowhere to be found.
Instead, officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, ""Hands up, don't shoot."" Wednesday saw more tense confrontations and further volleys of tear gas from police — this time paired with smoke bombs in response to flaming projectiles and other objects lobbed from the crowd. Protesters faced heavily armed police who at times trained weapons on them from armored trucks.
{Two reporters said they were detained by police}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/ferguson_police_chief_will_not.html”> for not clearing out quickly enough from a McDonald's where they were working, near the protests but away from the more volatile areas. The two, who work for The Washington Post and The Huffington Post, were released without any charges. Both say they were assaulted but not seriously hurt.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that about 10 people had been arrested, {including St. Louis Alderman and Auburn graduate Antonio French}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/st_louis_alderman_--_and_aubur.html”>, who has been chronicling the protests on social media. Police had said earlier they would not have arrest information until early Thursday.
Residents in Ferguson have complained about what they called a heavy-handed police presence that began with the use of dogs for crowd control soon after Brown's shooting — a tactic that for some invoked the specter of civil rights protests a half-century ago. The county police force took over leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the smaller city's request.
County Police Chief Jon Belmar, though, said his officers have responded with ""an incredible amount of restraint,"" as they've been the targets of rocks, bottles and gunshots, with two dozen patrol vehicles being destroyed.
""It's pretty amazing how impressed I am and inspired by these officers,"" he said. ""This is a very difficult circumstance.""
Police had also asked earlier that people assemble in ""an organized and respectful"" manner and disperse before evening.
The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer involved in Brown's shooting, citing threats against that officer and others.
Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson called improving race relations ""the top priority right now"" but also said he won't be pressured into publicly identifying the officer — despite, he said, mounting demands from clergy, computer hackers and protesters.
""We have the right to know, and the family has the right to know who murdered their son,"" said Sahari Gutierrez, a 27-year-old Ferguson legal assistant.
Jackson said he also welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.
Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon cited the ""worsening situation"" in Ferguson in saying he would be in the area Thursday. He asked community members to be patient and calm while the investigation proceeds and urged law enforcement agencies to ""keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press.""
Jackson said the investigation remains weeks away from completion.
Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car.
The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.
Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries.
Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it ""ricocheted"" back, apparently upsetting the officer.
Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.
Among the protesters critical of the police response has been state Sen. Maria Chapelle-Nadal, a Democrat from nearby University City
""I just want to know if I'm going to be gassed again, like I was on Monday night?"" she asked Jackson at a press conference. ""And I was peaceful. And I'm your state senator.""

Ron Johnson's actions as head of security in Ferguson, Mo., has struck a chord in the law enforcement community.
The letter published Sunday on {LawOfficer.com}<hyperlink=”http://lawofficer.com/article/lifeline-training/open-letter-captain-ronald-s-j”> had been shared over 40,000 times on Facebook as of Monday night.
The {St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., has been increasingly in the spotlight}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/what_we_know_about_ferguson_mo.html”> following the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9. The federal government has launched a full investigation with more than 40 FBI agents and President Barack Obama said he is sending Attorney Gen. Eric Holder to the city on Wednesday.
Delmore, a 32-year law enforcement veteran who spent most of his career leading St. Louis area departments until becoming the Alabama beach city's top cop in 2010, is usually reserved but in his open letter he holds nothing back, ripping Johnson's handling of the tense and controversial situation.
While Delmore's entire letter, titled ""An Open Letter to Captain Ronald S. Johnson"" can be found at {www.LawOfficer.com}<hyperlink=”http://lawofficer.com/article/lifeline-training/open-letter-captain-ronald-s-j”>, here's the first half of it:
I have to call you out.
I don't care what the media says. I expect them to get it wrong and they often do. But I expect you as a veteran law enforcement commander—talking about law enforcement—to get it right.
Unfortunately, you blew it. After days of rioting and looting, last Thursday you were given command of all law enforcement operations in Ferguson by Governor Jay Nixon. St. Louis County PD was out, you were in. You played to the cameras, walked with the protestors and promised a kinder, gentler response. You were a media darling. And Thursday night things were better, much better.
But Friday, under significant pressure to do so, the Ferguson Police released the name of the officer involved in the shooting of Michael Brown. At the same time the Ferguson Police Chief released a video showing Brown committing a strong-arm robbery just 10 minutes before he was confronted by Officer Darren Wilson.
Many don't like the timing of the release of the video. I don't like that timing either. It should have been released sooner. It should have been released the moment FPD realized that Brown was the suspect.
Captain Johnson, your words during the day on Friday helped to fuel the anger that was still churning just below the surface. St. Louis County Police were told to remain uninvolved and that night the rioting and looting began again. For much too long it went on mostly unchecked. Retired St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch tweeted that your ""hug-a-looter"" policy had failed.
Boy did it.
And your words contributed to what happened Friday night and on into the wee hours of Saturday. According to the {St. Louis Post Dispatch}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/release-of-information-some-demanded-some-unexpected-changes-dynamics-in/article_0aa34e2b-bd3e-5fb1-81d6-736f98cccfcb.html”>, you said the following regarding the release of the video:""There was no need to release it,"" Johnson said, calling the reported theft and the killing entirely different events.
Well Captain, this veteran police officer feels the need to respond. What you said is, in common police vernacular—bullshit. The fact that Brown knew he had just committed a robbery before he was stopped by Officer Wilson speaks to Brown's mindset. And Captain, the mindset of a person being stopped by a police officer means everything, and you know it.

Michael Brown, 18, was shot multiple times by a police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson over the weekend. 
According to The Associated Press, witnesses say Brown had his hands raised when an officer approached him and shot multiple times.
Authorities said there was a struggle over the officer's weapon before he opened fire. Police are currently investigating the incident but said Tuesday they would not be releasing the name of the officer who shot Brown. 
On Sunday, three dozen protesters were arrested after a peaceful vigil turned to looting and vandalism. 
The AP reports large crowds gathered at a burned-out convenience station grew unruly around nightfall Monday, taunting and throwing rocks at police. Police in riot gear advanced on the crowd, in addition to closing off main roads and entry into the town.

The results on a county basis are commendable in some places and troubling in others. In the state's four largest counties – Jefferson, Mobile, Madison and Montgomery – the police forces closely align with their communities. The racial makeups of counties' forces are all within five percentage points of their communities.
However, in counties such as Sumter, Perry and Choctaw, police forces are disproportionately white. 
As local demographics shift, police forces should strive to represent the communities that they serve. Such adjustment cannot happen overnight, but avoiding wide disparities should be a part of departments' long-term plans.
It should be said, though, that some of the counties with disproportionately white or disproportionately minority police forces have only a few hundred officers.
Red indicates counties in which police forces have an overrepresentation of white officers relative to the county's demographic makeup. Blue indicates counties in which police forces have an overrepresentation of minority officers.
This analysis was done on a county level, which combines local police departments and county sheriff's offices. I used 2010 Equal Employment Opportunity data for the racial breakdown of police forces and 2013 American Community Survey data for residential demographics. These are the most up-to-date data.",640,33,NA,NA

Protests. Allegations of police brutality. Racial tensions. Injustice.
They're words that have haunted Birmingham's past.
Richard Dickerson - president of consulting firm RAD Communications and formerly a senior director of strategic communication for USAID in Afghanistan - spoke about the parallels of St. Louis' unrest to Birmingham's history and how we can address the root issues driving the division in communities.
When you see the images of turmoil coming out of Ferguson, your mind has to flash back 50 years to Birmingham. On social media, for instance, we've seen images of today's protesters paired with those of the civil-rights era. They look identical, down to the presence of canines. What lessons from 50 years ago should be applied to what we see playing out today?
First, we should be honest; we need to be transparent. We need to treat people with a degree of human rights and respect - we all deserve a modicum of respect. And when people haven't been treated with a modicum of respect, well, they react.
We've seen several instances of young black men getting shot. I think there is a lot of anger, there is a lot of frustration and it only takes a spark to set it off.
What are your thoughts on the presence of police during these protests? Now, clearly in no way should looting and vandalism be tolerated, but judging by reports coming from St. Louis, do you think police presence has been too heavy-handed, or are they simply keeping peace the best way they can?
I think it's a very difficult situation. Whether it's St. Louis or Miami, whenever you have someone killed passions run high. Police are there to protect property and lives, but yes, their presence alone will exacerbate tensions. We need community groups, parents, community leaders and others to step in and be part of this - those who have a level of respect in the community who can communicate and push for resolutions.
The problem is, there are so few community leaders. There are so many who take advantage of poor people when convenient, but few who will stand up 24/7, 365 to represent their communities.
If you had a message for the people of Ferguson, a community that's clearly hurting and frustrated in ways that many in Birmingham can relate to, what would it be?
Think before you act. We're losing to emotion. You have to think about the long term. Destroying property, causing others to be harmed is not going to make the situation better.
One of the biggest challenges in life is to be bigger than the moment. When you have been abused, repeatedly, it's really hard but it's necessary.
Police brutality, insensitivity issues, hopelessness issues, poverty issues - the shooting was just the vehicle to bring these and other issues forward. It speaks to the desperate need and the ongoing failure to have any semblance of an urban policy in this country. People are struggling and don't see a way out or up.",4,3,NA,NA

The Department of Justice will also conduct its own autopsy.
Two civilians were shot Sunday, though not by police, according to Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, a Ferguson native who has become the face of law enforcement brought in to calm the situation. Johnson said officers stepped up enforcement – including using tear gas against the crowds – after protesters fired at police and threw Molotov cocktails.
""Tonight, a Sunday that started with prayers and messages of unity, peace and justice took a very different turn after dark,"" Johnson said early Monday morning.

Justice Department plans autopsy
On Sunday it was announced the U.S. Justice Department will conduct a third autopsy on Brown. Dozens of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents have also arrived in the town, {the Wall Street Journal reports,}<hyperlink=”https://www.wsj.com/news/article_email/federal-authorities-wade-deeper-into-teens-death-1408322176-lMyQjAxMTA0MDEwNzExNDcyWjA”> and federal officials are conducting a probe into whether Brown's civil rights were violated.
Federal officials had earlier criticized Ferguson police for releasing a video showing Brown apparently robbing a local convenience store shortly before he was shot. The video's release set off another round of protests in the St. Louis suburb, as questions over the techniques used by police continue to mount.
On Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder talked to law-enforcement officials on how to scale back the militarized presence of police.
""Tell them to remove the damn tanks,"" Holder said, according to the Wall-Street Journal report.
Brown family calls for arrest
Brown's family is calling for the arrest the officer involved in the shooting.
Brown family attorney Daryl Parks said the call comes after an independent autopsy shows the unarmed teenager was shot six times, including twice in the head.
""Why would he be shot in the very top of his head, a 6-foot-4 man?"" Parks asked. ""It makes no sense.""
The family contends Brown was shot from behind and above, though Dr. Michael Baden, who conducted the autopsy, cautioned that several scenarios could have resulted in the wounds. In a widely-televised live news conference Monday, Baden said nothing in the autopsy suggested Brown died during a struggle though police maintained he was killed after he reached into Officer Darren Wilson's car as the two were fighting for the policeman's weapon.
Baden said the autopsy showed one bullet hit Brown on the top of the head and another entered just above the right eyebrow. Four other wounds were all to the arm.

(The wounds) ""could be consistent with (Brown) going forward or going backward,"" Baden said.

""We are all frustrated and looking for justice to be achieved regarding the shooting death of Michael Brown. As the dual investigations continue into what happened nine days ago at Canfield Green, we must defend Ferguson from these violent interlopers so that the peaceful protests can operate in peace and the search for answers and justice can continue,"" Nixon said.

""Let's seek to heal rather than to wound each other,"" Obama said.
The president also said the use of military equipment against protestors – the result of a Pentagon program that allows law enforcement to obtain surplus items – will be examined more closely.
""It's probably useful for us to review,"" the program, he said. The president also said he condemned violence among demonstrators and the aggressive stance taken by police.

The group heard speakers and held hands for a moment of silence at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Civil Rights Memorial near the State Capitol.
Ebony Howard, senior attorney at the SPLC, said it was fitting to reflect on Brown's death at the memorial, which bears the engraved names of people who died in the civil rights movement.
""Black children are still dying for our freedom,"" Howard said. ""And it's senseless. And it's unfair. And it hurts. It hurts so much that every fiber in my being screams that they have to stop killing our children.
""And when I say our children, I don't mean black people, I don't mean white people. I don't mean any particular race or ethnicity. I mean all of our children.""
Pastor Marcus Collins of Lake Elam Missionary Baptist Church in Millbrook spoke to the group and said Brown and others have been ""victims of Barney Fife police officers with itchy trigger fingers.""
Collins said the circumstances of the shooting raised many questions.
""Because he was unarmed, makes us question the police department,"" Collins said. ""Because the investigation is a slow-moving process makes us question the police department.
""Because it was a young African American male causing no harm, no criminal record, family that loved and supported him makes us question the motives of the police department.""
However, Collins also called on young men in Missouri to refrain from violent protests.
""Please, young men, don't feed into the political strategy to stroke fear in white America that all black people are violent,"" Collins said. ""Please do not contribute to the prison pipeline through your violent demonstrations. Because if the parents of slain Michael Brown can hold their heads up with dignity, we can hold our heads up tonight with dignity.""
Araisa Wardell, 14, a student at Robert E. Lee High School, came to the vigil and made a poster that read: ""Justice for Mike Brown: Stop the Killing.""
Wardell said she attended the vigil ""because he got killed for no reason.""
She said there was a good bit of talk at school about it, and that students just want justice for Brown's death.
Police and witnesses have given differing accounts of the shooting of the 18-year-old, who was unarmed.
According to the Associated Press, police say the officer shot Brown after an encounter with Brown and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, attacked him and tried to take his gun. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.
The officer involved was injured, with one side of his face swollen.
Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told reporters that the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.
Protests have been violent in Ferguson, with looters smashing and burning businesses. Police in riot gear have responded with tear gas. 
Some have criticized the police tactics, and today Missouri's governor ordered the Highway Patrol to intervene and take over the situation.
In Montgomery, Wayne Sabel said he came to tonight's vigil ""because of the murder of young black men by police.""
Sabel also said the police response in the aftermath of the shooting was ""absurd.""
""To have a military presence, basically, against citizens who are trying to protest peacefully shows what the police department thinks of the people they are supposed to protect,"" Sabel said.",17,54,NA,NA

Bryant,8/19/2014,2/21/2017,"BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Ferguson, Mo. is more than 500 miles away, but there are clear lessons learned from the unrest in the St. Louis suburb that Birmingham should heed, an activist urged city officials.
Frank Matthews is renewing calls for the City Council to form a citizens police oversight committee in addition to a new request that police officers wear body cameras while on duty.
{Matthews, of the Voters Outcast League, first presented the request at a rally this weekend and restated the call during Tuesday's council meeting.}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/08/birmingham_rally_following_sho.html”>
""This is a good time to talk about the review committee. It won't hurt anything,"" Matthews said. ""There's a lot of brutality going on, and these cameras could be the best innovation that we could have.""
Protests, riots and unrest in Ferguson, Mo. have captured the national spotlight in the two weeks since a white police officer shot a black teenager in the Midwestern town. The aftermath has produced conflicting reports that has polarized the community.
Matthews said Birmingham is not insulated from issues of mistrust between citizens and police that could escalate into turmoil after a high-profile incident.
""It doesn't take much,"" he said. ""This is a good time to think about review committees.""
City leaders should act now, by taking steps to create the oversight board and mandating body cameras, Matthews said.
David Crews, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, called the proposed board unnecessary.
""There are so many things already set in place at the city of Birmingham,"" Crews told AL.com. ""Any high profile use of force is also looked at by the Department of Justice.""
Crews said the Alabama Bureau of Investigation, the Justice Department and the district attorney all have authority to review and investigate police action.
ABI reports are thorough with investigations taking five to six months, Crews said.
""When you've got that many checks and balances in place, it's scrutinized,"" he said.
Conversely, Crews said a citizen panel could add more confusion to a situation by introducing individuals who aren't experts in law enforcement.
""If makes as about as much sense as it does to have me and four other police officers to go to UAB and say were going to have a review board for all the brain surgeons,"" Crews said.
""If you just take an individual and stick them up there to start judging issues of the use of force, they don't have a clue what they're taking about because they're not trained. That's why doctors are evaluated by other doctors and that's why lawyers are judged by the Bar Association.""
The last major call for an independent review board arose in 2011 by then Councilwoman Carole Smitherman.
Smitherman at the time said there were several options of boards with varying levels of authority, and she favors one in which residents would review actions already taken by police authorities. Smitherman proposed a committee of 13 members. If the board disagreed with the action taken by officials, it could call for additional review.
Smitherman is now a Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge.
Councilman Steven Hoyt, chairman of the Public Safety Committee, said he would be willing to discuss the camera idea.
""Anything that's going to help law enforcement and our citizens is something for us to consider,"" he said. ""I don't know, but it might work pretty well because it might modify the behavior of the suspect as well as the police officer.""
Still, Hoyt said information is needed from the police department and Chief A.C. Roper on both suggestions, particularly the review committee.
""I would rather get some feedback at this juncture from the chief,"" Hoyt said. ""We can always create bureaucracy but is it all necessary?""",103,234,NA,NA

And while the taste of the Trayvon Martin verdict still lingers in our mouths, injustices in the African American community have made headline news with an unexpected frequency in the last few weeks. Eric Garner. Renisha McBride. And now, Michael Brown.
 
And while the community of Ferguson, Mo., deals with their grief and outrage, the best way they know how, I feel it most important to address this community, our community, and anyone with an open ear and open mind.

Before there was a Michael Brown, there was a Trayvon Martin, before him an Oscar Grant, before him an Amadou Diallo, and so on and so forth. All victims. All black males. All situations that garnered national attention. All seemingly let down by a system seemingly created to protect them.

Following each incident, public outrage within our communities slammed from coast to coast, offering education (yet again) and insight into a world and culture that is members only. And that is the black experience. Protests, marches, vigils and prayer meetings abounded in states all over this country. Civil rights leaders and organizations called for justice and kept us busy for weeks, even months at a time, staying abreast on what was happening. But to what avail?

 I say that to say this: at a time like no other, black millennials need to step into action. Why? Because every sector in this country depends on the promise and abilities of millennials to lead it into the future.

So what makes the black community's plight any different? The irony in being a millennial in the state of Alabama, the birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement, is that the race conversation among this population has found its way to the obituaries when it was once front page news.

Especially now that football season is beginning and the words ""Roll Tide"" and ""War Eagle"" turn us all into first cousins for 48 minutes. The gifted, the educated, the ""best and brightest"" in a state that saw their forefathers met with dogs and firehoses have seemingly gone quiet. But as we all know, ignoring a problem most certainly does not make it go away.

Across history, movements have been led by the young, revolutionaries and idealists invested in their future and the future of their country or cause. It is these individuals that were blessed with the passion to risk comfort for the sake of the collective. But in these social and economic times, asking one with two strikes against them to try their luck on a third may just be asking too much.

How willing are we to risk the things we've worked so hard for for the sake of those who wouldn't do the same for us?

My challenge to my peers, to myself, is that we pick up the pen and write our own stories.
How willing are we to run to the aid of the very individuals we were told to be better than?

Has comfort made us cowards?

 In 'The Miseducation of the Negro', Carter G. Woodson stated that educated blacks in America had become the worst, and most harmful, advocates for their people because the system that had taught them instilled a second-class view of their own.

Woodson understood that knowledge, true knowledge, was the answer to the majority of our woes as a people, with our most thoughtful & educated being the keys to these locked doors. And while social-media platforms are filled with vitriol and commentary breaking down the situation in Ferguson, Mo., from these same, educated young people, the question arises: What in the hell are we going to do about it?

 In a country, and dare I say world, where hip-hop culture has a chokehold on everything status-quo, it's amazing that, as a whole, the African-American community finds itself in these predicaments time and time again.

But the reality is, until we hold each other, and primarily those in the spotlight, accountable for their words, actions and influence, the same beat will continue to play. Until we stop marching, meeting, and praying with no plan of action, we will continue suffering.

And until young, black people all across this country take it upon themselves to leave an imprint on the culture of their cities, however that may be, the psyche of the majority may never change. The battle is no longer physical or tangible, it is psychological. Battling the effects of a culture we birthed that praises the very things that tear us down as well as a nation that, simply put, does not value nor take us seriously.

Can we change things? Who knows. But what I do know is that millennials are a generation like no other. We have the ability to create, impact and direct the conversation the way we see fit. Regardless if the fight is on your doorstep or not, it is still your fight, your future, your world.

We can rest in our comfortable, intellectual bubbles and talk about change OR we can actually commit to being the difference this world and our communities need. We were given the stage, so let's break a leg.

My challenge to my peers, to myself, is that we pick up the pen and write our own stories. Because I'm damn tired of someone else writing them for me.",20,222,NA,NA

Jesse Jackson led a wide-ranging discussion Tuesday at the SCLC Convention that credited the civil rights movement for the success of SEC football and industrial recruitment to the South.

""The New South is made possible by the civil rights movement,"" Jackson said in an interview after a panel discussion of the Voting Rights Act. ""You couldn't have an Alabama-LSU game, all these black and white players together playing. We made that possible. Nick Saban's check comes from our work. Honda, Hyundai, Toyota, all that's coming South because we pulled the walls down. You can't have the Dallas Cowboys and all that without the walls coming down.""

He also made reference to UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon's lawsuit against the NCAA on behalf of the rights of college athletes.

""Even while they love to see us play ball, they prevent us from selling our own T-shirts - from cotton balls to basketballs and footballs,"" Jackson said.

He decried the South's refusal to embrace the Affordable Care Act and expansion of Medicaid.

""It's despicable to think of a belt that calls itself the Bible Belt, built upon a Jesus who was born an ethnic minority under Roman occupation, who said his mission was to feed the hungry and take care of the sick: for those states to cut Medicaid to the sickest people – That's the Jesus crowd,"" Jackson said.

Jackson joined fellow civil rights activists, comedian Dick Gregory and SCLC Chairman Bernard LaFayette Jr., in a panel discussion Tuesday on the Voting Rights Act at the SCLC convention at the Birmingham Sheraton Hotel.

They spent most of the session reminiscing about the civil rights movement in Alabama.

LaFayette, who led voter registration drives in Selma in the 1963, was attacked and targeted for killing the same night Medgar Evers was killed in Mississippi, he said.

Gregory said he came to the South ready to die, but he lined up at the back of demonstrations. ""I was in the back by the white nuns,"" he said. ""I didn't believe they'd hit a white nun.""

Jackson said he's working for the passage of a Voting Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in response to the U.S. Supreme Court striking down a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Section 4.

""The Voting Rights Act has been undercut,"" Jackson said. ""We think the voting rights act is a big deal.""

Regarding the police shooting and killing of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo., on Saturday, followed by riots and looting, Jackson said it's similar to other police brutality that resulted in riots. ""There's a great sense of alienation,"" he said. ""It was never just poverty.""

The lack of justice creates a crisis that can be healed by justice, he said.

""Quietness is not the answer,"" Jackson said. ""Quietness is the absence of noise. Peace is the presence of justice. Just share education. Just share jobs. Just share healthcare. That's the answer to that alienation.""

Jackson will speak at a prayer breakfast on Wednesday morning to conclude the SCLC National Convention at the Birmingham Sheraton Hotel.

About 450 people from across the country registered for the convention, said SCLC spokeswoman Alice Gordon.",48,74,NA,NA
AL,al26,http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2014/08/its_how_local_cops_use_militar.html,"It's how local police use military equipment, not what they use, that's at issue: opinion",Mark McCarter,8/19/2014,2/22/2017,"{HUNTSVILLE, Alabama}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/huntsville/#/0”> – Is the cop on the beat being turned into G.I. Joe? Are squad cars being phased out by tanks, the image of the friendly officer in his dress blues and his nightstick morphing into a camouflaged figure with a semi-automatic rifle?
That's one of the narratives created in the heartbreak and confusion of Ferguson, Mo., where the ""militarization"" of police has become the hot button issue du jour. Attention is being directed toward the Department of Defense 1033 program that has provided more than $5 billion worth of military surplus equipment to local law enforcement agencies.
The comedian John Oliver, in his HBO political satire show, ""Last Week Tonight,"" spent much of Sunday's episode in a tirade against the establishment and the police force of Ferguson. He said the cops were dressed ""like they are about to launch an assault on Fallujah.""
President Obama said Monday, that ""there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,"" and he called for a re-examination of the policy. Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) announced he would introduce a bill to end the program, saying, ""our local police are quickly beginning to resemble paramilitary forces.""
But if military-looking equipment is the best we have to protect police officers, it's exactly what should be used.
Before perception becomes too much of reality, as created by comics and 90-second news clips, here are a couple of things to consider:
First, weapons are only 5 percent and tactical vehicles just 0.35 percent of the surplus from 1033. If other needed equipment -- night-vision goggles or bullet-proof vests or Humvees – is free, it makes economical perfect sense.
Second, some of it is utilized to do good as much as to fight evil, as with Madison's acquisition of four Humvees for use during ice storms and the inevitable tornadoes, sending those vehicles where ordinary patrol cars can't go. That's logical and practical.
There is a responsibility on local law enforcement agencies to show the feds how that equipment is needed. Though oversight is in place, there's probably an occasional rubber-stamping approval of requests.
The great flaw, and the issue at hand, is not what is being used. It's how it's being used.
It's likely that police in some places are not properly trained to use the equipment. That's as much psychologically trained as physically trained.
""If you have all this equipment,"" Oliver said, ""it's going to go to your head.""
That's human nature. Hand a guy keys to a Maserati, he thinks he's Jeff Gordon. Give a weekend craftsman an elaborate set of tools, he suddenly thinks he can build a new house with his own two hands.
Hand the wrong equipment to the wrong cop, he thinks he's Dirty Harry.

That may well be the case in Ferguson, where every hour seems to illuminate some new mistake on all sides, where protesters are proving that two wrongs don't make a right – they just make a riot.
With the blurry line between military and police, it's incumbent upon the local law enforcement agencies to properly train officers – psychologically as well as physically – in the use of sophisticated equipment, whether it's one of Uncle Sam's hand-me-downs or brand new.

""They've got a lot of stuff,"" Huntsville Chief of Police Lewis Morris said, ""but what are you going to use it for?""
That's the question each agency must ask itself – and answer to the federal government – before obtaining surplus military goods to supplement their collections of weapons and equipment. Though the city of Huntsville has not been a participant in the program and the Madison County Sheriff's Office has been enrolled in the program but not obtained any material, such equipment – from massive armored vehicles to night-vision goggles to automatic rifles -- is prevalent across north Alabama counties and cities.
At least eight tactical vehicles are in use in a 10-county area of north Alabama, as well as six helicopters and more than 230 assault rifles through the 1033 program. For departments with budget limitations, the free equipment often fills a void, though one law enforcement official cautioned, ""Sometimes it costs more to fix those things than to buy them from vendors.""
The Ferguson, Mo., police have come {under widespread criticism}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/14/war-veterans-ferguson-police/#bEO8PVCoVuqi”> because of their use of military surplus equipment during the unrest that followed the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, with a ""militarizing"" of the force that has made many uneasy.
That has, in turn, shed a harsh light on a program that has provided $5.1 billion in ""hand-me-downs"" to local law enforcement at no charge.
Despite the images coming from Ferguson of heavily armed police troops, a Defense Logistics Agency public affairs officer told AL.com that only 5 percent of the allocations has been weapons and less than 1 percent (.35 percent) has been tactical vehicles.
Here's a look at {the distribution of equipment through 1033 for each county}<hyperlink=”https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/15/us/surplus-military-equipment-map.html?_r=0”>, according to The New York Times. (The breakdown did not specify individual agencies within a county.)
Madison County: 72 assault rifles, 30 night-vision pieces, four body armor pieces, one MRAP (mine resistant ambush protected) vehicle. It's unclear which agencies possesses the assault rifles; representatives from Madison Police, Huntsville Police and the Madison County Sheriff's Office told AL.com that most of the equipment listed in the 1033 program data did not go to their departments. A reporter from AL.com is working to learn more.
Madison County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Dave Jernigan said the department signed up for the program during the month of April. To date, the department has not applied for or received any surplus equipment, he said. [Updated at 9 a.m. with Jernigan's comments.]
The MRAP belongs to the city of Madison, which also obtained four Humvees not listed in the 1033 report. The Humvees, said Chief of Police Larry Muncey, were acquired to assist during weather-related emergencies, with the capability of responding where patrol cars cannot. He said his department has received no weapons.
The city of Huntsville did acquire a number of patrol rifles from the National Guard more than 10 years ago that have been ""demilitarized"" and are not automatic weapons. It also recently acquired some rifles from the disbanded TVA police force, according to Morris.
Colbert County: 53 assault rifles, 65 night-vision pieces, 32 body armor pieces and 14 pistols.
Cullman County: 25 assault rifles, 44 night-vision pieces, 84 body armor pieces, 5 pistols, 1 MRAP, 1 armored vehicle.
DeKalb County: 2 assault rifles, 1 pistol, 137 night-vision pieces.
Jackson County: 10 assault rifles, 2 pistols.
Lauderdale County: 116 night-vision pieces, 16 body armor pieces.
Lawrence County: 6 assault rifles.
Limestone County: 20 assault rifles.
Marshall County: 30 assault rifles, 12 night-vision pieces, 4 pistols, 4 helicopters. (According to Albertville Chief of Police Doug Pollard, his city has 14 Humvees primarily for use in weather emergencies; as with Madison, those were not included in the 1033 report.)
Morgan County: 15 assault rifles, 2 night-vision pieces, 4 pistols, 2 helicopters, 1 MRAP.
None of the equipment listed for Morgan County was obtained by Decatur police. Sgt. John Crouch said that the equipment available ""is not suitable to the needs of our department,"" though it would like to have some Humvees to respond to weather-related emergencies, much as Madison has done.
The Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) program transfers a variety of items beyond the weapons and defense equipment. Agencies may also acquire office equipment, blankets, sleeping bags, computers, digital cameras and individual clothing and equipment.
However, they the local agencies must meet certain criteria and must pay for any shipping costs. They are not allowed to re-sell equipment and the Department of Defense retains the right to recall equipment as needed.
Each agency, according to the Defense Logistics Agency, ""is responsible for training its personnel in the proper use, maintenance, and repair of the excess DOD personal property assigned to it.""",12,10,NA,NA
AL,al28,http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/08/birmingham_rally_following_sho.html,Birmingham rally following shooting death of Michael Brown calls for more police accountability,Ana Rodriguez,8/16/2014,2/22/2017,"BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Dozens of people {gathered this afternoon outside Birmingham Police headquarters}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/08/rally_planned_saturday_at_birm.html”> in the 1700 block of First Avenue North to share a unified message.

Together, they chanted:

""I am Michael Brown.""
""Hands up. Man Down.""

The rally, organized by Frank Matthews' Outcast Voter League, was prompted by the ongoing criticism of Ferguson, Mo. police and their involvement in the shooting death of an unarmed black teen exactly one week ago. 

Today's demonstration began at 2:15 p.m.—the time 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a Ferguson police officer.

""We need to make sure we send out a clear message,"" said community activist and Minister Joshua Raby, ""we are peaceful people and we want a peaceful nation.""

Raby said police in Birmingham and across the nation must be held accountable to the oath they swore to keep: ""to serve and protect.""

Pictures, video and witness accounts of Michael Browns final moments at the hands of police have led to days and nights of {demonstrations in the streets of Ferguson}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/protests_in_ferguson_police_us.html”>. Two men who witnessed the shooting said the teen had his hands raised when an officer approached Brown with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly. 

Missouri law enforcement agencies have come under criticism for their response to what have been mostly peaceful demonstrations, including their use of curfews and tear gas, smoke bombs, heavy armor and other ""militaristic"" equipment. 

""We've got to have more police accountability,"" said Mathew Weinberg, who also stressed his belief in the need for a police accountability review committee. ""This is not a black/white issue. There has been police-involved brutality against everyone, white, black, brown.""

As an array of community activists took to a megaphone to share their thoughts, attendees passed around a petition calling for the establishment of a Police Review Committee in Birmingham. 

The committee, said Frank Matthews who has been trying to establish one in Birmingham for years, could be made up of individuals selected by members of the Birmingham City Council and then voted on by the people of their communities and neighborhoods. The Chairman of the Public Safety Committee, he said, could then serve as the review committee's leader to maximixe it's access to information.
Matthews also said he'd like to see the council or police department take action toward obtaining funds to be used toward the purcahse of body cameras that would be used by Birmingham police while on patrol.
""They would be used for their protection,"" said Matthews, ""but also to protect their reputation.""
Though part of the rally was to call attention to police accountability, demonstrators also took time to show love and respect for the community and law enforcement agency for not exhibiting a ""militaristic"" presence in Birmingham neighborhoods, as well as to try and open dialogue between the community and police.     

""We're not here to disconnect anything,"" said one man. ""It's a sad day when people are afraid of those who are supposed to be there to protect and serve.""",151,55,NA,NA
AL,al29,http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/08/bentley_blocking_the_hospital.html,"Bentley 'blocking the hospital door': Jesse Jackson meets with AL.com about Medicaid, DNC, Gaza, and the NCAA",Madison Underwood,8/12/2014,2/22/2017,"BIRMINGHAM, Alabama – In a meeting with the Alabama Media Group editorial board at the Birmingham hub on Tuesday evening, Jesse Jackson emphasized Gov. Bentley's rejection of the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, calling it a ""strictly ideological"" decision and called Medicaid ""a poverty safety net.""
Jackson, who is in town for a convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, discussed a range of topics with the board, including Birmingham's bid for the Democratic National Committee's 2016 national convention, the conflict between Israel and Palestine in Gaza, and what he called the ""jail industrial complex.""
But the expansion of Medicaid in this state – which, had Bentley accepted it, would have been funded 100 percent by the federal government through 2016, with federal funding dropping gradually to 90 percent of the cost by 2020 – was clearly a priority, both as a health care issue and an economic justice issue.
""Wallace blocked the school door based on race,"" Jackson said. ""[Bentley is] blocking the hospital door based upon class. Blacks were locked out of the schools, and black and whites have been locked out of access to medical care, and he should be judged as such.""
He condemned the rejection of Medicaid as a ""strictly ideological"" decision that is adverse to the economic interests of the state. Jackson said Medicaid expansion would not only increase access to healthcare for poor and rural residents, but it also creates jobs, and makes it easier for the poor to avoid bankruptcy due to unpredictable health care costs. It's a ""poverty safety net,"" he said.
""We sense a confusion here that's undermining progress,"" he said.
""You know, cotton balls, and footballs, and basketballs - everybody gets paid except the one with the ball."" -The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr.
And the program saves lives with preventative care, according to Jackson.
""People who cannot get medical aid, they don't have insurance so they can't get their mammograms."" Thousands can't afford cholesterol tests, and doctors can't treat people because they aren't paid enough, Jackson said.
""I'm concerned that when you cut Medicaid, you condemn people to death,"" he said.
The DNC and Birmingham
Asked about Birmingham's chances of reeling in the 2016 DNC convention, Jackson was less than fully optimistic.
""Well, the first victory is that you're being considered,"" Jackson said, but noted there are ""marks"" against Alabama hosting the convention.
""Coming from a state where the government is sending back federal money for education and health care, where the state is using schemes to impede access to voting, where the state is using its schemes to make profits off of jailings, those would be real marks against why [the DNC should] come,"" Jackson offered.
He said that, in this state, the government often rejects federal money and ideas because of the perception that they come from Obama.
""Whether you like him or not, it doesn't make sense to be for the reform of health care, but not be for Obamacare. That's an omelet without eggs,"" he said.
On the ""jail industrial complex""
Jackson bemoaned problems in what he called the ""jail industrial complex,"" including the for-profit prison industry, and Alabama and America's prisons. He called prison reform a civil rights issue.
""The jailing system here, the prison system, was built for about 14,000, and now there's about 30,000. You've got prisoners sleeping on floors, and the jails are for profits – the Corrections Corporation of America is on the stock market,"" Jackson said.
He pointed to several issues with for-profit prisons, including the specter of abusive pre-trial detentions, profiting off prison telephone calls and prison labor, and a rise in incarceration as punishment for low-level offenses.
""We have bet on punishment as a remedy for problems, but it does not appear to be so,"" Jackson said.
Jackson drew parallels between fairness on the playing field, and fairness and equality in the real world. We're able to enjoy football on Saturdays and Sundays – to ""choose reason over race and uniform color over skin color"" – because the rules are enforced fairly, Jackson said.
""Six points for all touchdowns, two points for all field goals, and everybody can see whether he got over or not, the whole world can see it,"" he said. ""Whenever the playing field is even, the rules public, the goals clear, the referees fair, the score is transparent – we can make it. But once you leave that field, the same kid who ran in the touchdown does not have as many opportunities as the guy selling his jersey on the corner as a hawker.""
He said he was in favor of ""some loosening of the reins"" in player compensation (though emphasized the importance of full-ride scholarships), and drew comparisons between uncompensated college athletes and slaves.
""You know, cotton balls, and footballs, and basketballs – everybody gets paid except the one with the ball,"" Jackson said. ""Cotton picking wasn't so bad, it's just that the cotton picker couldn't own the field, couldn't own the land, couldn't own the gurney sacks it was put it in, they couldn't take it to the mill or to the gin, they couldn't turn the cotton into textiles, they couldn't turn the textiles into clothes. They could only pick the cotton. If you could have gone up the textile line, picking cotton would have been all right,"" Jackson said.
""In football, everybody gets the money except the ballplayer,"" he said. 
Gaza, Hamas, and Israel, and Ferguson, Missouri
Speaking on the conflict between Palestinians and Israel in Gaza, Jackson pointed to the successes of the non-violent protest movement in the U.S., in South Africa, and in India.
""I think Hamas could seize the moral authority by shifting from rockets to mass non-violent actions, and a reassessment of the power of nonviolence,"" Jackson said.
Non-violence ""would allow them to be heard,"" Jackson told the board, but right now, ""you can't hear above the rockets.""
He also criticized violent protests in Ferguson, Mo., this week over the killing of a young African-American man, and said those protestors, too, should embrace non-violence.
""They should be marching, but for equity in police hirings, marching for equity in fireman hirings, marching for equity in contracts and in education,"" Jackson said about Ferguson's protestors. ""And burning up buildings will not achieve that.""
Jackson's calm
When one board member noted that Jackson was calm – reserved even – during the meeting despite the injustices he was discussing, Jackson laughed.
""I may seem relatively calm because I am a long-distance runner, and you cannot vent all of your frustrations, and your anguish, and your concerns, and lose energy,"" he explained. ""You have to remain focused.""
""Particularly talking to you people,"" he added, indicating the editorial board.

Federal program dates back to 1990
The 1033 program was established in 1990 and was originally designed to supply law enforcement with military equipment to use in counter-drug activities. That was expanded in 1997 to make all law enforcement agencies eligible for equipment, though preference is still given to drug eradication efforts.
Since 1995, the 1033 program has been run though the Defense Logistics Agency's Law Enforcement Support Office. Each state is required to have coordinator – ADECA in Alabama's case – to ensure compliance with all regulations. Each law enforcement agency that participates in the program has the opportunity to view available equipment and make requests for specific items. If the request is approved by LESO, the law enforcement department is responsible for all transportation and shipping costs, as well as any training needed to use the items.
The items available through the program include the high-profile, such as helicopters, weapons and armored vehicles, to the mundane, including file cabinets, furniture and office equipment.
The program was catapulted into the national spotlight following the Aug. 9 shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a member of the Ferguson, Missouri police officer. The shooting set off a series of sometimes violent protests and police in the town have been heavily criticized for their use of military weapons against demonstrators.
On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said it is up to individual law enforcement agencies to determine ""how and when and where and under what circumstances they use excess military equipment.""
""This is a program legislated by Congress which allows the secretary to transfer some excess military property to local law enforcement,"" Kirby said. ""And many, many law enforcement agencies have benefited from it. In fact, many citizens of many towns and cities all over the country have benefited from it.""",109,44,NA,NA
AL,al34,http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2014/08/spirited_blunt_assessments_on.html,"Spirited, blunt assessments on race relations kicks off Mobile United's series of community conversations",John Sharp,8/18/2014,2/21/2017,"{MOBILE, Alabama}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/mobile/#/0”> - A community conversation on race Monday evolved into a spirited and sometime blunt, analysis of present and past race relations in America, Alabama and Mobile.
The approximately two-hour conversation was sparked by two presenters: The Rev. Robert Allen Turner, the assistant program director at the Dave Matthews Center for Civic Life in Montgomery and Stephen Black, founder of the University of Alabama's Center for Ethics & Social Responsibility and Impact Alabama.
Their presentations came after Mobile United, the host of the community conversation, reported that out of 600 responses from an online survey that 70 percent believe Mobile needs to have a conversation about race relations. Of those responding, 80 percent believe race relations needs improving in Mobile.
""Yes Mobile, Alabama, has a problem as it relates to race,"" Turner said before a large crowd that filed into the Alabama School of Math and Sciences in midtown Mobile. ""But Mobile is only a problem of this state. Yes, even this country. America still today has problem with race.""
Turner's speech included a history analysis of racial discord in the U.S., dating back to the county's founders. He was critical over ignoring the issue that evolved into slavery, segregation and the race relation problems that exist today that include, among other things, institutionalized racism.
He also referenced the problems in Ferguson, Mo., saying that situations involving black-on-black crimes often result in a criminal justice system that is ""usually swift."" But when the crimes are white-on-black - ala, the Trayvon Martin case - ""seldom is anyone punished with jail time.""
Turner also said that while race relations have gotten better, he questioned what Mobilians had to compare with: The city was the home to the last slave ship to arrive to America and is where the last recorded lynching occurred in 1981.
""Some people will think the same thing, why can't we get beyond our past?"" Black said after Turner's speech. ""It's an important starting point for the conversation.""
Black emphasized that in order to improve relationships between the white and black communities, that individuals have to be willing to have productive relationships with people ""that are unlike ourselves.""
""Most people when they think of race problems, they think the only way to deal with it to be polite and civil and not talk about it,"" Black said. ""The only way to move forward is to address the challenge. Consider how many personal relationships people have with people unlike themselves.""
Black said that problems of misconceptions hurt improving relationships, such as perceptions that welfare is more of a ""black problem"" than one affecting whites.
""I think people's misperceptions to race and poverty plays a powerful role,"" he said. ""The majority of people in poverty in Alabama are white. It's a class problem. It's a lack of job opportunities. We all face that together. To think it's a racialized problem hurts everyone.""
Black also cited the strong test scores at majority black schools in Mobile, such as {George Hall Elementary}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2014/08/4_schools_earn_torchbearer_dis.html”>, as important cornerstones toward improved perceptions that minority students can excel without charity.
He contrasted George Hall's success with the struggles in the Birmingham area at schools, such as Hoover, {where the elimination of busing became a hot issue last year.}<hyperlink=”http://blog.al.com/birmingham-news-stories/2014/01/school_bus_controversy_heads_u.html”>
Turner and Allen's speeches were the first of what Mobile United expects to be a series of community conversations about race. The next event is scheduled for Sept. 22.
The conversations were prompted by Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson in June following the racially divisive issue of appointing former Mayor Sam Jones to the Mobile Area Water and Sewer System's board of directors.
The Jones appointment had been split along racial lines until Stimpson, {during a news conference, urged for his former adversary to be added to the board.}<hyperlink=”http://blog.al.com/live/2014/05/mobile_mayor_sandy_stimpson_ca.html”>
""I think it's important because we don't have these type of conversations,"" Turner said. ""We talk about football and religion but we don't talk about the elephant in the room, which is race. It's very important.""",26,153,NA,NA

Marshall wanted to be prepared for just about anything following the North Hollywood bank shootout in 1997. Two heavily armed and armored bank robbers caused a shootout that injured 11 police officers and seven civilians.
""It is better to have a piece of equipment and not need it then to need it and not have it,"" he said.
Marshall also hasn't forgotten about excommunicated Nation of Islam members who went on a three-day crime spree in Montgomery in 1974 that ended in a shootout on Dexter Avenue after the group took over WAPX-AM radio station.
Even so, most of the military equipment acquired by the sheriff's office over the years isn't weapons. Military-surplus weapons are typically too old and don't meet the needs of police departments, Montgomery County Chief Deputy Derrick Cunningham said.
Vehicles, tents, furniture, cots, plastic jugs and gun racks are the items most often acquired by the sheriff's office, he said. (See who got the gear in Alabama in the database. Story continues below.)

Cunningham said military surplus is the best way to purchase all-terrain vehicles to use in the event of natural disasters or snow and ice, which saves his department tens of thousands of dollars.
For at least six years, the Sheriff's Office has had an M113 armored personnel carrier, which looks like a small tank; two military Humvees with no armor. About four years ago, four ATVS were acquired.
Most of these vehicles have been used only in parades and for other public relations purposes, never for police response. One of the Humvees is painted black, has sheriff's office decals and a sound system in the back.
Cunningham said all four ATVS have been used in the past to search wooded areas for a missing person with Alzheimer's disease.
A military Peacekeeper, a large armored vehicle, has also been in the department's fleet for around 20 years. Marshall said it's been used to knock down security bars when performing drug raids.
The sheriff's office has several military surplus M16's and 10 .45 pistols, but all of them are in storage and never used.
Cunningham said he is hoping to return the weapons to the military.
Militarization of police
In the wake of the ongoing riots in Ferguson, Mo., many think police departments are becoming militarized through obtaining military surplus or military-style equipment and weapons.
Cunningham doesn't think so.
""This is police departments getting the equipment they probably need,"" he said, adding that sheriff's offices and small police departments often don't have the funds to buy their own equipment.
But, they have to be prepared for just about anything.
Montgomery Department of Public Safety Director Chris Murphy said law enforcement has changed in the last several decades.
He said the crimes have changed and the criminals have technical equipment, sometimes more advanced than law enforcement.
Murphy said Montgomery Police Department does what it needs to do to ensure city residents are safe and to ensure that officers go home at night.
""We want (officers) to have the necessary equipment, but force has to evaluated based on the intelligence and evidence that is there,"" he said.
Montgomery police wouldn't release specifics on its armory, but said it doesn't have any military-surplus weapons in service.
""The department has a limited number of automatic weapons that are used by SWAT in high-risk situations,"" Montgomery Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Martha Earnhardt said, 'but they are not standard issue and they are not used routinely.""
These weapons are kept under lock and key and only used in high-risk situations, she said.
Montgomery police has a civilian-type armored car that is used to move personnel or victims from high-risk situations such as a domestic violence situation last year where a husband was accused of killing his wife.
Police didn't know if the suspect was still alive, but they had to get out a child left inside the house. 
Both the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office and Montgomery Police Department have tactical teams fully equipped to handle hostage situations, high-risk warrants and other more dangerous incidents, Earnhardt and Cunningham said.
These teams have equipment, bought by the department, which could be considered military-style.
Cunningham said this equipment includes raid shields, rubber bullets, infrared scopes, door rams, C-4 explosives and sniper rifles.",2,3,NA,NA

Jesse Jackson, who said the gains in voting rights for blacks have not been sustained.

Jackson pointed to Ferguson, Mo., where an unarmed black teen, Michael Brown, was shot to death on Saturday. Though it's a majority black city, the mayor and most of the city council are white, he said.

Blacks need to vote and gain representation in their city governments, on school boards, police and fire departments, he said. Otherwise, it's like having the power of Moses but dropping the rod that he used to perform miracles.

""If you drop the rod, the snake'll bite you,"" Jackson said.

He again emphasized the role of the civil rights movement in paving the way for integrated sports teams in the Southeastern Conference, the NFL and other college conferences and professional leagues.

""What's the Super Bowl got to do with civil rights? Everything!"" he said. ""We pulled the curtain down. Behind the cotton curtain, it would have been illegal.""

Now the SCLC focus is on achieving equality, Jackson said.

""Today we're free,"" he said. ""Fifty years later, we're free, but not equal.""

As in sports, blacks can compete with fair rules, Jackson said. ""We're struggling with uneven playing fields,"" he said.

SCLC President Charles Steele said he hoped the convention shone a light on social inequalities.

""Education has become unaffordable,"" Steele said. ""It's elitist. Dr. King represented poor people. Poor people don't have lobbies. We lobby for them.""

Steele presented Jackson with the SCLC's Lifetime Achievement Award. About 120 people attended the breakfast and the convention drew about 450 people to the Birmingham Sheraton this week.",21,10,NA,NA
AL,al37,http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/08/police_have_a_difficult_someti.html,"Police have a difficult, sometimes thankless job: Press-Register Sound Off",AL.com and the Press-Register,8/19/2014,2/22/2017,"Interesting point: Police have a really tough job, especially when people come after them. They have a right to protect themselves, just like you have a right to protect yourself, but they also have to protect you. But if you break the law and come after them, they have a right to use force to protect themselves. I hate it for the family and I hate it for the policeman, but policemen are not going to be perfect. When you start wrestling with them or hitting on them, how can they be rational in what they do?

Policing the police: What I'd like to know is if the cops can do anything wrong. Every time they get into trouble, they're found not guilty. This one this morning was found not guilty, and they say they don't know if he's going to be able to go back to work. Of course he's going to go back to work. Cops can't do anything wrong. It just seems like no cop can do anything wrong. If they've got the badge on, they're incapable of doing any wrong. Something is wrong with this picture.

Blaming Fox: You know, I turn to Fox News every now and then to see the excuses they have for the policeman killing this young teenager. First it was 'he's so big-200-and-something pounds.' So that means the police should be able to shoot every big teenager. Then it was 'he had just committed a robbery' and that didn't work. So now, the latest thing is he was charging the police; he was coming after the police. But they still fail to realize that, if he was walking towards the police, even running toward the police -- so what? He didn't have a weapon. You mean to tell me that policeman couldn't have pulled his baton and beaten an 18-year-old kid down. 'But he was scared for his life.' Why did he get out of the car if he was scared for his life? Excuse after excuse.

Sarcasm?: I'm so proud of Al Sharpton, who came into the St. Louis area and inflamed the situation there. It's just amazing how people react to a situation where calm and level-headedness is required.

Scarlett letter?: This comment is about what's happening in Missouri. This is happening all over the United States. When people go to jail with felony charges, they have no kind of success in life. They are downgraded and degraded because of a felony name. That needs to come off of people's records, so that they can have jobs and homes and families and lead a productive live like anyone else, even though they're poor. It's time for change in our system, all the way around. Change needs to come from state to state in the system.

Is DUI OK?: I was watching Fox News, and I saw the head of the Democratic Party say that drunk driving is not a crime; that drunk drivers are innocent people; that people who get out there and drunk, and run over somebody and kill women and children are innocent. They should just be let free. So, the Democratic Party in the United States represents drunk drivers now.

Public beaches for the public: All of these events that they're bringing in for money in Gulf Shores, these concerts and stuff, are they going to leave an entrance for the people who just want to come and enjoy the public beach? I mean, how many concerts are we going to have in Gulf Shores; is it a concert hall or is it a beach? We have a family tradition to go under the bridge at Perdido, which we do every year. We couldn't do it because of Hangout. Does the Flora-Bama and the Hangout own these beaches? I guess I'll quit going to Baldwin County to go to the beach. I'll just go to Pensacola Beach, Ft. Walton or Biloxi somewhere. They keep the beaches public for the public there. They don't let businesses have big, drunken hangouts. You can have a concert anywhere; there are only a few good beaches for the public to enjoy. The rest of them are bought by the rich.

Retired first-responders hurting: I just wonder if the retired firemen and policemen are going to get a raise. And if not, are they going to raise their insurance, too, so that they end up with less money than what they're making now? They're not making much compared to the working employees, so I just wonder. Is it going to take more of their money away too?

Dress code a good thing: Baldwin County's change in the school dress code policy means that, in a few years, there will be no dress code. You can't have a change to liberal policy when it comes to dress codes; either there is one or there's not going to be one. So, technically, they're just taking the steps to end the dress code policy altogether. I think that would be a sad day for the system. School uniforms are a very good thing for the system. The children are dressed alike; none of them wear more expensive clothes than another; it takes away the peer pressure; it makes life so much easier for the parents because they know what they (students) have to wear on a daily basis; they don't have to go through the ordeal of having to pick out something to wear. I hate to see it happen, but I guarantee that within a few years, Baldwin County will do away with a dress code policy.

Messy problem: Of course they had another sewer spill in Daphne, and of course it was in a creek. The sewer lines are designed to be near creeks, so when it does spill, it's going to get into our waterways. Nobody wants to have to clean it up, because it will cost them money. I think somebody needs to do something about that. It's just as bad as the dadgum oil fields out there, spilling oil in the Gulf. Why do we let these sewer plants get away with all of this mess? I think sometimes they discharge it that way so that they don't have to spend extra money to clean it up. Somebody needs to investigate this. We need to do something about these dadgum sewer plants.

It's a #%* life: Just saw ""Annie"" at Playhouse in the Park. Some very amazing people gave an amazing performance. Too bad curse words were dispersed throughout the play, with an audience full of children.",0,1,NA,NA

Mobile County law enforcement received the most assault rifles in Alabama, with 532 of the 551 issued to the county going to the Mobile Police Department. The Baldwin County Sheriff's Office is also gearing up, with the purchase of a $222,000 SWAT vehicle.
The Department of Defense Excess Property Program, more commonly known as DoD 1033,  issues surplus military equipment to law enforcement agencies at their request. Along with the rifles, a DoD online report shows Mobile County received items such as night vision goggles, body armor and a couple of vehicles. (Search the database below to see what gear went where in Alabama. Story continues below)
Equipment Transfers from DOD to Local Police
See which Alabama counties have received the most equipment through the Department of Defense's 1033 program. Search by county or by item.
Ashley Rains, with the Mobile County Police Department Public Affairs, said the department has 532 Colt AR15 rifles obtained through the military surplus program a couple years ago.
Most of those rifles, however, have never made it out of the vault.
Mobile Police Department Assistant Chief Joseph Kennedy said the agency is in the process of trying to transfer some of the guns to other departments. ""We don't have that big of a need for that many of them,"" Kennedy said.
Rains said the Mobile Police Department received other surplus equipment as well (not listed on the DoD online report), such as  two Hummer Humvees, eight 2.5-ton, high-water American M352A trucks, five Chevrolet K5 Blazers and a Case M1394 tractor. 
Kennedy said the high-water vehicles and Humvees are useful for floods and situations related to hurricanes, and the cost of upkeep for these vehicles is not a problem. ""We asses our needs and as long as our vehicles are working fine and satisfying the need, it's a good program and I think there is a need for that,"" Kennedy said. ""It's a lot easier on us to get vehicles through this program than to have to go out and buy these vehicles.""
According to the DoD report, Baldwin County has 57 assault rifles along with night vision goggles, pistols and body armor pieces, and the items are dispersed to various agencies throughout the county.
Baldwin County Sheriff Huey ""Hoss"" Mack said the sheriff's office does not have any of this equipment, and they do not have requests in for military surplus items. Outside of the 1033 program, however, {Mack has ordered a SWAT vehicle}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2014/08/baldwin_county_sheriff_orders.html”> that has recently been delivered and was displayed Tuesday at the agency's Robertsdale office.
""We have ordered a tactical rescue and SWAT vehicle, that is not military surplus and does not conform to military specs; but conforms to law enforcement specs,"" Mack wrote in an email to AL.com.
In his fiscal year {2014 budget to the Baldwin County Commission,}<hyperlink=”http://blog.al.com/live/2013/07/baldwin_budget_talks_include_r.html”> Mack requested $600,000 to pay for a SWAT vehicle, along with 19 other vehicles. After {opposition from the commission}<hyperlink=”http://blog.al.com/live/2013/08/baldwin_sheriffs_swat_vehicle.html”>, Mack withdrew his request.
""The vehicle will cost $222,000 and will be paid for with Narcotics Asset Forfeiture Monies (monies seized from drug traffickers),"" Mack said.
Although the Sheriff's Office is getting equipment by other means, Fairhope Police Chief Joe Petties said the Fairhope Police Department several years ago  received items through the 1033 program, but the department has thrown a lot of it out. ""In the past, we received quite a bit of stuff...a lot of that stuff, it was taxing on our budget, trying to get it fixed,"" Petties said.
Coffee County, with a population of a little more than 51,000, was able to maintain its equipment, which includes a helicopter, through volunteers. The helicopter was passed to Coffee County from Dale County in 2009 and needed to be refurbished, but volunteers stepped up and donations came in.
""Everything that is associated with this helicopter is done by volunteer, pilots and maintenance,"" Coffee County Sheriff's Office Chief Ronald Whitworth said. ""We use it for search and rescue, and if we are on a manhunt. We have a lot of rural county and any event where we are looking for somebody, you can see better and do better from the air than on the ground.""
Whitworth said they've received other items like night vision goggles and automatic rifles, but the county is returning them. ""We just don't need them.""
Mobile County Sheriff Sam Cochran said the Sheriff's Office has received some military equipment over the years, but not much.  
The Sheriff's Office is in the process of getting updated gas masks and night vision goggles, but Cochrane said deputies no longer use the surplus rifles. The gas masks are used when officers use tear gas.
""Law enforcement is in a difficult situation when asked to restore order. Tear gas is not deadly so it's one of the less-lethal things you could use ...,"" Cochran said.
He said a lot of military weapons are interchangeable for the same thing that law enforcement uses.
""Law enforcement has equipped themselves over the years to better defend themselves against criminals,"" Cochran said. ""One big improvement over the years is body armor. Were it not for all of the experiences in combat and war, we probably wouldn't be where we are with life-protecting body armor.""
Cochran said the Mobile County Sheriff's Office does not have a large vehicle, such as a SWAT vehicle, but it would be useful. ""I can think of many times over my career where there has been a need for a vehicle like that but they weren't available, so law enforcement officers have had to take more risks to rescue a person.""",1,91,NA,NA

Trussville police have an armored truck because of the Department of Defense's 1033 program. Pelham and Leeds have night vision goggles, and Gardendale picked up M-14 and M-16 rifles.
Irondale has gotten everything from Humvees and four-wheel drives to laptops and actual boots for the ground. And Jefferson County has two helicopters.
All of it comes from the 1033 program, a program created by Congress in 1990 to save taxpayers money and ensure that surplus military equipment didn't go to waste.
Across the country, in the wake of the {Ferguson shooting and riots}<hyperlink=”http://topics.al.com/tag/Ferguson/”>, attention has been focused on the program that allows discontinued and otherwise unneeded military equipment to be passed down to local police departments. Some argue it creates an overly militarized law enforcement force. Alabama police argue that it simply saves taxpayers money, and helps police obtain a few of the tools they need for their own war on crime.
""We can't buy it. We don't have the money,'' said Gardendale police Chief Mike Walker. ""I don't see us as being militarized. We're a police department and we know we're a police department. Our job is to save lives, and that includes the lives of suspects.""
""We do run into criminals that have these types of weapons,'' Walker said. ""If somebody pulls a knife, you pull a gun. We always start by saying 'you're under arrest, put hands behind your back.' It's up to them where it goes from there.""
Militarization is becoming the 'new reality'
John Sloan, chairman of the Department of Justice Sciences at UAB, sees it differently.
""Militarization is becoming the 'new reality' by which some police agencies operate,'' {Sloan wrote in an op-ed piece Tuesday for AL.com}<hyperlink=”http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/08/warrior_police_officers_reader.html”>. ""By adopting not only the hardware of the military, but having officers adopt the attitudes of soldiers, images are created of police officers fighting a true 'war' on crime and drugs using state-of-the-art equipment and well regard battle tactics.""
""The problem is,'' Sloan writes, ""the 'enemy' is U.S. citizens who have the right to not be shot down in a hail of bullets as a first response from police. Too much 'friendly fire' is ending the lives of the very people police officers have been sworn to service. Compounding the problem is the fact that too often they are also people of color.""
The program has provided more than $5 billion in ""hand-me-downs"" to local law enforcement at no charge. A Defense Logistics Agency public affairs officer told AL.com that only five percent of the allocations have been weapons and less than one percent (.35 percent) tactical vehicles.
Here's a look at the local distribution of equipment through 1033 in Jefferson County, according to a {New York Times breakdown}<hyperlink=”https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/15/us/surplus-military-equipment-map.html?_r=1”>: Night vision pieces, 832; body armor pieces, 239; assault rifle, 95; pistol, 36; shotgun, 4; helicopter, 2; mine-resistant vehicle, 2.

Equipment Transfers from DOD to Local Police
See which Alabama counties have received the most equipment through the Department of Defense's 1033 program. Search by county or by item.
It's hard to pinpoint exactly who has what in Jefferson and Shelby counties and some agencies, including Birmingham, Hoover and Hueytown police, simply don't want to jump into the fray by even discussing the topic. But the surplus equipment is spread out from one end of the area to the other, and many of those agencies are quick to tout the benefits.
After all, for the most part, they only roll out the heaviest equipment at National Night Out, Christmas parades, and inclement weather. 
""We have gotten four-wheel drive vehicles, like Humvees and trucks, which I'm sure our residents are thankful we had during the snowstorms,'' said Irondale police Detective Michael Mangina. ""We were able to use them to drive around the interstates saving people.""
Mangina said Irondale has received computers, laptops, printers, boots, vest carries, cots, tents, flashlights four Humvees and two four-wheel drive trucks. One of the Humvees is used as a crime scene vehicle. 
Another of the Humvees, Mangina said, was crucial in the response to and recovery of a 26-year-old Remlap woman who died in 2013 when the Jeep she was off-roading in overturned in a remote area of Irondale off Floyd Bradford Road. ""We had a hard time getting to the scene,'' Mangina said.
""Our thinking,'' he said, ""was to get stuff that we feel like we're going to need on an almost daily basis, or at least several times a year. This program is excellent.""
Tornadoes, snowstorms and the Christmas parade
Gardendale has received two Humvees, two Chevrolet K5 Blazers, night vision monoculars and several M-16 and M-14 rifles. As for the guns, the chief said, ""Hopefully they're only to practice with.""
""We've used our military vehicles to carry kids home from the {high school during the snowstorms}<hyperlink=”http://topics.al.com/tag/January%2028%202014%20weather/”>, and in responding to tornado emergencies in neighboring cities,'' he said. ""They don't get used very often. We have used them in the Christmas parade.""
Trussville police in 2013 received an armored vehicle from Fort Stewart, Georgia. Lt. Jeff Bridges said then that the armored vehicle would help during tactical operations. The Leeds Police Department has notched 10 pieces of night-vision equipment from the surplus program. ""We use them for night-time surveillance during searches for offenders, or in missing persons cases, anytime seeing in the dark is important,'' said Chief Byron Jackson. ""I could never get that in the budget.""
The department also received four M-15 rifles and four shotguns, but the shotguns are being returned because they aren't operational.  As for the M-16's, ""They are in my armory for 'just in case,''' Jackson said. ""We would not use them unless something really hit the fan.""
Leeds also has four Hummers that they've used during flooding there and inclement weather, Jackson said. ""We rescued a number of people and responded to a number of calls during this year's winter storm,'' the chief said.
Leeds has two passenger vans through the 1033 program: one is a crime scene vehicle, the other is used for prisoner transport. A front –end loader, also obtained through the surplus program, was essential in building the department's gun range.
Jackson noted that all of his patrol vehicles are outfitted with rifles and some shotguns, but those weapons were bought through the police department's budget, not obtained through the surplus program.
""They would be used in case we engaged armed bank robbers or a school shooter or a barricaded offender,'' Jackson said. ""LAPD had several officers wounded a few years ago when two well-armed bank robbers engaged police. They had nothing to shoot through the robbers' body armor.""
A better chance of survival
The Shelby County sheriff's Capt. Ken Burchfield said sheriff's office does not have much in the way of surplus items. They do have a few pieces of night-vision equipment, but most of their equipment, he said, is bought with sheriff's office funds.
Body bunkers, Burchfield said, give deputies a little better chance of surviving deadly force. Each deputy has a handgun for self-defense and defense of another, and shotguns for use in ""less-than-lethal"" situations.
""Deputies have patrol rifles, not assault rifles,'' he said. ""These give our deputies a better chance of survival when confronted with a lawful deadly force situation when the suspect has a rifle also,'' he said.
The Shelby sheriff's office has a gas launcher used to deploy tear gas for barricaded suspect situations.
""We do not have any mine resistant vehicles. WE do not have a helicopter. We do not have attack jets. We do not have artillery. We do not have a submarine. We do not have a Bradley fighting vehicle. We do not have any Abrahms tanks. We do not have any turret-mounted automatic weapons systems,'' Burchfield said.
'We love our military but that is not our role'
Through the military surplus program, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office has received one cargo truck, two four-wheel drive pickup trucks, one fuel trailer, two helicopters, five Humvees, four flatbed trailers, three
ATVs, eight dirt bikes, two 15-passenger vans, two forklifts, one SUV  and one Armored Personnel Carrier, which Chief Deputy Randy Christian said is non-operational.  ""Sheriff Hale decommissioned the APC as soon as he took office because it looked much more military than it did law enforcement and in fact we tried to return it,'' Christian said.
The passenger vans were painted and striped with the sheriff's office log and are assigned to the jail, used daily to transport prisoners.  ""The SUV is a normal blue Tahoe assigned to a division commander that saved us 40,000 dollars,'' Christian said. ""The Humvees were painted by a local high school's trade program then striped to match our fleet and de-militarize their look.""
Those, he said, are used during inclement weather such as recent ice and snow storms and to navigate through tornado-damaged areas. ""They also allowed us to access small plane crashes in wooded areas,'' he said. ""They have been invaluable.""
The helicopters have been used for search and rescue and in support of on ground law enforcement activities. They also have been painted and striped and in no way appear ""military,"" Christian said.
""All of this equipment was secured at zero cost and has been utilized to help us  serve the public,'' Christian said. "" To be able to secure that kind of equipment during our financial crisis was a no brainer.""
Christian said they have barracks that are being set up at sheriff's office training academy as on campus housing for sheriff's deputy trainees.  ""We lost our housing for trainees when the county sold the County Home to a private company,'' he said. ""To have on-campus housing has been a long term goal that we just have not been able to afford and to be able to secure it at no cost is a Godsend.""
He said they haven't received any weapons through the 1033 program.  ""As you can see, we have been very careful to de-militarize the look of equipment obtained through this program before deploying it and before there was even a debate,'' Christian said. ""That should give a good indication of how we feel about it. We are a law enforcement agency that has worked very hard to build trust with the community and we value that and take great pride in it.""
""We love our military but that is not our role,'' he said. ""We want to always be very careful that when our public has contact with our personnel that there is a clear understanding that they are dealing with a deputy sheriff. We also pay very close attention to the uniform trends from our vendors as they have evolved over the years. We are mindful of that. This is something we were already paying attention before the current events.""
""I believe you will see all law enforcement agencies assess where they are and how they are trending moving forward. That's a good thing,'' Christian said. ""Our belief here is that a law enforcement officer should clearly be recognized as a public servant. Even as careful as we have been with that, we will also take a good hard look at ourselves to insure we are reaching that goal. We want our personnel well trained and well equipped and tactically sound but with the mindset and heart of a servant.""",9,327,NA,NA
