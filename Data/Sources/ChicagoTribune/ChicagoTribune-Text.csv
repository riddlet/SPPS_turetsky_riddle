The victim was identified by relatives as Michael Brown, who was scheduled to begin college classes Monday, according to the {St. Louis Post Dispatch}<hyperlink”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/calm-returns-to-scene-of-ferguson-shooting/article_04e3885b-4131-5e49-b784-33cd3acbe7f1.html”>.

Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, told the {Associated Press}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/US”> that she was driving through the neighborhood Saturday afternoon when she saw her grandson running a few blocks from her house.

""He was running this way,"" she said. ""When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.""

A spokesman for the {St. Louis}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/81045908”> County Police Department confirmed to the Associated Press that it was a Ferguson police officer who shot the man, but did not identify the officer and did not immediately give a reason for the shooting.

Calls by The Times to the police were not returned.

Louis Head, Brown’s stepfather, held a sign that said “Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!” the Post Dispatch reported. And Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, said the shooting was “wrong and it was cold-hearted.”

 Unrest in Missouri city after fatal shooting of black teen
A second night of violent clashes in a St. Louis suburb between law enforcement and residents protesting the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager resulted in several arrests and looting.
By early Saturday night, dozens of police cars remained parked near the shooting scene as mourners left votive candles at a makeshift memorial in the middle of the street.

At the height of the post-shooting tensions, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents, about two-thirds of whom are black, the AP reported.

The crowd eventually dispersed and police scheduled a news conference for Sunday morning.

“We are hurt to hear that yet another teenaged boy has been slaughtered by law enforcement especially in light of the recent death of Eric Garner in New York who was killed for selling cigarettes,” St. Louis County {NAACP}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/81045908”> President Esther Haywood said in a statement. “We plan to do everything within our power to ensure that the Ferguson Police Department as well as the St. Louis County Police Department releases all details pertinent to the shooting.”

Crowds broke the windows of cars and stores following a day of demonstrations over the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old shot dead on Saturday by a Ferguson police officer.

""We are currently experiencing a riot,"" a Ferguson police dispatcher said.

About 150 officers in riot gear from throughout St. Louis County, along with canine units, were sent to the area, a dispatcher for the St. Louis County Police Department said.

There was no immediate word on injuries.

The {St. Louis Post Dispatch reported}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/violence-breaks-out-near-site-of-vigil-for-teen-killed/article_f9d627dc-e3c8-5bde-b2ab-7f0a3d36a083.html”> several businesses were looted, demonstrators blocked traffic and a civilian was severely beaten.

Sunday's protests turned violent after dark, according to news station KMOV-TV, with rioters smashing the window of a store and damaging cars. The crowd broke the windows of a news truck, the station said.

A teenage girl told KMOV that a QuikTrip convenience store was being looted. Asked what looters were taking, she said, ""Everything. They destroyed everything.""

Earlier on Sunday, police said the shooting incident was started by a fight between the victim and an officer in a squad car that quickly escalated.

Police said Brown physically assaulted the officer from the Ferguson police, who then fired multiple shots at Brown after he left the car on Saturday. The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told a news conference.

""It is our understanding at this point in the investigation, that within the police car, there was a struggle over the officer's weapon,"" Belmar told reporters as voices from hundreds of demonstrators shouting outside the building could be heard.

According to Belmar, Brown was walking with a friend in the middle of the street when an officer attempted to exit his vehicle, the {Los Angeles Times reported}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-missouri-police-shooting-20140810-story.html#page=1”>. Police said Brown pushed the officer back into the police car.

Brown then entered the officer’s vehicle and a struggle ensued over the officer’s weapon, according to police. During the altercation a shot was fired inside the car.

The officer and Brown then exited the vehicle and at that point the fatal shooting occurred, Belmar said.

Witnesses have had different accounts.

Dorin Johnson, a friend of the victim, told Fox 2 that he was walking in the street with Brown when the police squad car pulled up. The officer said to ""Get the eff onto the sidewalk,"" he recounted.

""It was not but a minute from our destination and we would be off the street,"" Johnson said.

Johnson said the officer didn't get out of his police car, but ""reach[ed] his arm out the window and grabbed my friend around the neck.""

""I witnessed the police chase after the guy, full force,"" Piaget Crenshaw said. ""He ran for his life. They shot him and he fell. He put his arms up to let them know that he was compliant and he was unarmed and they shot him twice more and he fell to the ground and died.""

A crowd of some 200 people gathered at the site of the shooting on Saturday, some of them shouting ""kill the police"" and yelling profanities, a county police spokesman said.

""Emotions were running very high,"" Belmar said.

St. Louis County police said Brown was unarmed and they would turn over investigation findings of what happened in Ferguson, northwest of St. Louis, to local prosecutors.

Brown's mother told local TV broadcaster KSDK that her son was a good child getting ready to go to college and was visiting his grandmother when the incident took place.

""He didn't bother nobody,"" she said. ""They told me how many times my son was shot - eight,"" she added, and then directed her comments at police.

""You not God. You not decide you are going to take somebody from her,"" she said in an interview with KSDK.

The St Louis County branch of the civil rights group {NAACP}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/social-issues/racism/naacp-ORNPR000027-topic.html”> has said it wants the U.S. {Federal Bureau of Investigation}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/fbi-ORGOV000008-topic.html”> to look into the case, with many in the community telling media that race played a factor in the shooting.

The largely peaceful protests, monitored by about 50 police officers in riot gear, took place after a night of rioting when demonstrations over the death of Michael Brown, 18, turned violent.

About two dozen businesses were damaged in the rioting overnight, 32 people were arrested, and two officers were injured, police said.

""It breaks my heart,"" Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told reporters on Monday. ""Last night was the worst night of my life.""

The FBI is looking into any civil rights violations in the case, a spokeswoman for the agency said. St. Louis County police is leading the investigation into the shooting itself.

Jackson said there was plenty of physical evidence and eyewitness testimony in the case. ""I really believe we can get to the truth of what happened here,"" he said.

Brown's family has asked for an end to the street violence, according to a statement obtained by KTVI television station. They have also hired lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, a black Florida teenager who was also unarmed when he was shot in 2012, Crump's office said.

Monday's gathering appeared nonviolent, with protesters shouting ""Stop the killer cops"" and ""No justice, no peace."" Four people were arrested, according to KSDK-TV.

Police said Brown was shot on Saturday afternoon after a struggle over a gun in a police car. It was not immediately clear why Brown was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car.

The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, police said Sunday. The officer's race has not been disclosed.

Three of the Ferguson Police Department's 53 members are black, Jackson said. About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures.

The first day of school in the nearby Jennings School District was canceled in the aftermath of the rioting.

More than 300 police officers, many in riot gear, tried to control the crowd on Sunday night, said St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman. The 32 people arrested will face charges that could include assault, larceny and burglary, he added.

Sunday's protests turned violent after dark, with rioters smashing windows of stores and restaurants and damaging cars.

Boon Chang, owner of Northland Chop Suey, was cleaning up glass on Monday morning after rioters smashed windows at his restaurant and stole sodas.

""If they saw a brick anywhere, they grabbed it,"" Chang said.

On a vacant building next door, someone had used red-orange paint to write: ""The only good cop is a dead cop.""

Brown's mother told KSDK that her son was a ""good child getting ready to go to college"" and was visiting his grandmother on the day the shooting took place.

The St. Louis County branch of the NAACP civil rights group called a meeting for 6 p.m.(2300 GMT) Monday to discuss the case, according to a spokesman for Murchison Tabernacle C.M.E Church, where the meeting will be held.

Why on earth not? Video cameras are in use in police departments across the country, some placed in squad cars and some on cops themselves.

Police use of force declined 60 percent.

The police chief there summarized the value of these gadgets: “When you put a camera on a police officer, they tend to behave a little better, follow the rules a little better. And if a citizen knows the officer is wearing a camera, chances are the citizen will behave a little better.”

If the Ferguson police had been using dashboard or body cameras, prosecutors and the public would have much better evidence of who was responsible for the death of Michael Brown. Better yet, he might still be alive. ",2,NA,NA,NA

REACTION TO A YOUNG MAN'S DEATH

Michael Brown, 18, was shot to death in Ferguson, a mostly black St Louis suburb, on Saturday afternoon after what police said was a struggle with a gun in a police car. The FBI has opened a probe into the racially charged case.

Brown's family has hired Benjamin Crump, the attorney who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager who was shot to death by a community watch volunteer in 2012.

Police in riot gear fired tear gas to disperse a crowd estimated in the hundreds gathered near a building that burned during Sunday night's rioting, he said.

Fire trucks, ambulances and more officers converged on the area in a chaotic scene. One officer in riot gear stood behind a squad car in a standoff with a group of young demonstrators.

Emergency services said they had responded to reports of a stabbing and a shooting, but had not confirmed such incidents and emergency workers were told later to pull back from the area.

A witness in the case told local media Brown had raised his arms to police to show he was unarmed before being killed.

""He just graduated and was on his way to college,"" said Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, speaking through tears at a news conference. She said her first-born son's first day back at school would have been Monday.

""We can't even celebrate,"" she said.

The FBI opened a federal inquiry into the case intended to supplement the main investigation by St. Louis County police, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

It was not immediately clear from police why Brown was in the police car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.

OFFICER NOT IDENTIFIED

The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, police said. The officer's race has not been disclosed.

Dorian Johnson told television station KMOV that he and Brown had been walking when an officer confronted them, drew a weapon and shot. Johnson said that Brown put his hands in the air and started to get down, but the officer kept shooting.

Jackson said there was plenty of physical evidence and witness testimony. ""I really believe we can get to the truth of what happened here,"" he said.

Demonstrations to call for justice for Brown turned violent Sunday night. Crowds broke the windows of cars and stores, set a building on fire and looted shops. At least two dozen businesses were damaged, 32 people were arrested, and two officers injured.

""I think it is crazy. It's nonsense. What does it bring back? It's not going to bring the man back,"" said Adrian Brewer, 30, an African American from a city near Ferguson.

Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered earlier on Monday at the town's police station to demand that the officer responsible for Brown's death face murder charges. Police arrested up to 15 people during that mostly peaceful demonstration.

On Monday night, demonstrators driven out by tear gas gathered at the station, chanting ""hands up, don't shoot.""

Brown's mother said her son had been planning to study heating and air conditioning repair at a technical college.

Michael Brown Sr., the teen's father, told reporters his son was ""silly"" and ""could make you laugh.""

""We need justice for our son,"" he said.

Three of the Ferguson Police Department's 53 members are black, Jackson said. About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures.

Ferguson's median household income is $37,517, less than the Missouri average of $47,333.

Most of the communities around Ferguson have gone from white to mostly black in the last 40 years, said Terry Jones, political science professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis.

""There's a long history of racial injustice,"" said Jones. ""Slowly and not so surely, the St. Louis metropolitan area has been trying to figure out a way forward. As the Michael Brown shooting indicates, there are often setbacks.""",32,NA,NA,NA

ChicagoTribune,chitri8,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/ct-kass-met-0813-20140813-column.html,Missouri police shooting follows shameless pattern,John kass,8/12/2014,12/9/2015,"Every big-city mayor and police chief in America — including the guys from Chicago — are watching what is happening outside of St. Louis, in the town of Ferguson.

Ferguson was once a white suburb. Now it is predominantly black. And it's hurting.

A young African-American man, Michael Brown, is dead, shot by police.

In the days since there have been anger, rioting, looting and, of course, the politics of race. And the thug behavior of the looters accomplishes something else:

It helps lock Americans into various camps from which we're comfortable listing grievances and condemning the behavior of others.

But it has little to do with illuminating the human tinderbox in some American cities, especially in those violent neighborhoods where residents and cops are under great stress.

St. Louis County police said Brown, who was 6 feet 4 inches tall, struggled with police, reportedly over a gun in a squad car, before he was shot. Neighbors say he was outside the car and had surrendered before the shots were fired.

The immediate, political reaction is to view the shooting through the twisted prism of race. But young African-American men are shot down every day in American cities, mostly by other black men.

And most of us shrug and turn the page and move on, often forgetting that in many neighborhoods there are lousy schools, and no jobs, but plenty of hopelessness and fear, a dangerous combination.

Ferguson has captured attention because of what has happened in the last few days. It's raw enough, and loud enough, and now Al Sharpton, the infamous race hustler and buffoon, has declared it to be fertile ground.

So he's just dropped in to St. Louis, holding news conferences, loudly demanding justice.

Most of us know that Sharpton is a carnival barker, sucking up the media limelight. In offering himself up as part of the show, he makes it about him. But it's not about him.

What's important is the anger and whatever else is seething, just below our common notice.

The rituals of this awful pathology aren't new, including a mob smashing windows, running through liquor stores stealing bottles of booze. Others smashed other stores, including a boutique, and stole what they could.

Stealing whiskey and clothes doesn't bring justice. It brings shame. It allows some to dismiss the entire community as lawless, and dismiss their concerns. Opportunists, both the brutally larcenous and the political, are drawn to it like hungry flies.

Sharpton, who created himself as a fear stoker and media manipulator, said Brown had raised his hands, the universal signal of surrender.

""That's the sign you got to deal with,"" Sharpton said. ""Deal with the last sign he had shown. We want answers why that sign was not respected.""

Sharpton said he wasn't there to stoke more controversy (although that's what he does best) and insisted his visit was all about determining facts and justice.

""I know you are angry,"" he said, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""I know this is outrageous. When I saw that picture (of Brown lifeless on the ground), it rose up in me in outrage. But we cannot be more outraged than his mom and dad. If they can hold their heads in dignity, then we can hold our heads up in dignity.""

Such appeals to dignity are difficult to assess when they are juxtaposed against images of riots and looting. And police officers, typically, feel as if they too are under attack.

After what happened in Ferguson, or when something similar happens in Chicago, we often hear from activists who seek to use a street death as leverage for more political power.

Yet what about the police? They don't make speeches. So you don't often hear from them.

One called me at WLS-AM on Tuesday, where I host a daily midmorning talk show with Lauren Cohn.

The caller said her name was Ann and that her father was an officer who died in the line of duty. (Her story checked out. In fact, I noted her father's death in a column years ago.)

What bothered her was a tendency among some to reduce this all to shorthand and make Brown's killing into a racial issue.

In another excessive-force police case I've been writing about — the killing of a 95-year-old World War II vet — the police officer and the victim were of different skin pigments. I've never mentioned it because I don't think it's relevant.

If someone attacks a police officer, Ann said, ""It's not a race issue.""

He promised a full investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into the case, which has provoked outrage in the largely African-American town of Ferguson where police have not released the shooter's name, citing security concerns and death threats.

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but ... I urge everyone inFerguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" Obama said in a statement.

Friends and family of 18-year-old Michael Brown planned a peaceful church vigil for Tuesday night and his father pleaded for an end to the violence that has followed the incident, while activists demanded authorities release the name of the officer involved.

Standing with supporters, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, Michael Brown Sr. said he wanted justice for his son but wanted it ""the right way.""

""I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,"" said Brown Sr., who wore a T-shirt showing his son's baby picture. ""No violence.""

Activists speaking to reporters in downtown St. Louis also called for federal authorities to take over the investigation after two nights of demonstrations and unrest.

Police in Ferguson, Missouri, had initially said they would release the officer's name on Tuesday, but changed the plan, citing fears of retaliation, according to media reports.

Sharpton, a New York-based civil rights leader, also called for peaceful protest in the wake of looting and more than 50 arrests since the shooting. Sharpton's National Action Network will pay for Brown's funeral.

""To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant that he was,"" Sharpton said of the 6-foot, 4-inch (198-cm) Brown, who had planned to start college this week. A demonstration is planned at a Ferguson-area church on Tuesday evening.

Brown was shot to death in the back of a police car on Saturday, police said. The race of the officer, a six-year veteran who is now on administrative leave, has not been revealed.

The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the racially charged case and St. Louis Countyalso is investigating.

Police said Brown was shot in a struggle with a gun in the police car but have not said why Brown was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.

 

CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS

But a witness to the shooting interviewed on local media has said that Brown had been putting his hands up to surrender when he was killed.

""There were many, many witnesses who have talked to family members and they paint a very different picture than police witnesses,"" said Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Brown family. Crump also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen killed in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012.

The ""hands up"" gesture has been frequently seen at protests over the shooting. More than 100 protesters in front of the St. Louis County Courthouse in nearby Clayton on Tuesday morning chanted ""hands up, don't shoot.""

The Federal Aviation Administration issued a ban on air traffic under 3,000 feet above Fergusonstarting Tuesday. The order said the ban was ""to provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities."" Such bans are typically requested by police departments so that their aircraft do not tangle with news helicopters.

Residents in the low-income, mostly black neighborhood where Brown was killed say they are often harassed by police. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said the neighborhood had a lot of crime but there were no race problems.

Demonstrations on Sunday night turned violent, with looting and property damage. Violence broke out again on Monday night as police officers in riot gear, armed with rifles and accompanied by dogs tried to secure the area.

Ferguson has seen a stark demographic shift in recent decades, going from all white to mostly black. About two-thirds of the town's 21,000-strong population are black, while out of a police force of 53, three officers are black.

The race of officers should not matter as long as their work is fair and professional, said Dave Klinger, a former police officer and criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

""If the officer behaved inappropriately, we've got to sanction the officer and figure out what it is that led him to do what he did,"" Klinger said. ""Was he poorly trained? Was there a pattern in this agency?""

Klinger said the investigation must be as ""transparent as possible.""",55,NA,NA,lots of hyperlinks without links in them
ChicagoTribune,chitri10,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-missouri-police-shooting-racial-divide-20140813-story.html,Shooting of black teen highlights racial divide in Missouri town,Tribune wire reports,8/13/2014,12/9/2015,"The fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday, and subsequent violent protests, highlight a stubborn racial divide in a St Louis suburb that has struggled to build healthy relations between blacks and whites.

From the 1970s, Ferguson, pop. 21,000, changed from being overwhelmingly white to predominantly black as whites left the town and its surrounding areas, seeking to avoid racial integration of public schools.

African Americans, allegedly excluded from buying homes in many St. Louis neighborhoods in an illegal practice called redlining, found Ferguson a hospitable place to set down roots.

""Most of the communities around Ferguson have gone from all Caucasian to all African-American over a 40-year period,” said Terry Jones, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Ferguson, on St. Louis' northern border, is relatively mixed, with 63 percent of the residents African American and 34 percent white, according to {2010 U.S. Census data}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/social-issues/2010-census-EVHST0000235-topic.html”>.

To some Ferguson residents, the shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, symbolizes how African Americans are treated unfairly in a town still run by a Caucasian minority.

Mayor James Knowles is white, as are all but one of six city council members. The police chief is white, and only three members of the 53-person police force are African Americans. A 2013 state attorney general's report found more than 85 percent of motorists pulled over in the city are African American, and the arrest rate among blacks is twice the rate among white residents.

TROUBLED HISTORY

For the broader St. Louis area, the Ferguson disturbances represent another troubled chapter for a metropolitan area with a painful track record on race.

Before the Civil War, a federal judge in downtown St. Louis sent former slave Dred Scott back into slavery, a decision later upheld by the {U.S. Supreme Court}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/justice-system/u.s.-supreme-court-ORGOV0000126-topic.html”>. In 1917, racial riots across the Mississippi River in East St. Louis were among the most deadly in U.S. history. And in the 1970s, St. Louis experienced tense court battles over school desegregation.

Today, St. Louis remains one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States, according to a study of Census Data by researchers at Brown University and Florida State University.

Jones, of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, says Ferguson until now had the reputation of a suburb that made integration work.

A revitalization of Ferguson's downtown, directed by a newly hired city planning director, has brought new restaurants and shops into the once-drowsy neighborhood. The city has worked with local employers, including {Emerson Electric}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/business/emerson-electric-company-ORCRP005101-topic.html”> and the University of Missouri, to encourage employees of all races to live and work in Ferguson.

“It's a bit of an irony that the one municipality that made that effort has suffered the biggest conflict,” Jones said.

POLICING IN THE SPOTLIGHT

John Gaskin III, a member of the St. Louis County {NAACP}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/social-issues/racism/naacp-ORNPR000027-topic.html”> board of directors, said the group was outraged by Brown's killing, but said the issues were hardly unique to Ferguson or St. Louis. He cited the case of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old unarmed black man who died after New York police put him in a banned chokehold.

“Police brutality takes place in every state, all over the country, every day,"" Gaskin said. ""A big part of the problem is that our police departments don't look like our communities.""

Protestors who stormed the streets of Ferguson in the aftermath of the Brown shooting said race was at the root of Ferguson's troubles.

Mary Hall, 57, said police stop her car frequently as she drives through Ferguson. ""You can't drive anywhere without being stopped,"" Hall said.

At a protest outside a burned-out gas station in Ferguson, 92-year-old L.T. Taylor put the events into perspective. ""I been here a long time and I had hoped we could move past this in America,"" he said. ""But some things don't change.""

Some protestors put their emotions into writing. ""Beware, Killer Cop on the Loose. Watch Out, Children,"" read a hand-painted placard leaning against a stately tree.

Others wrote messages trying to urge calm. Jerome Williams, 32, carried a sign reading, ""Guns down for Mike Brown.""

Police said Brown was shot in a struggle with a gun in the Ferguson Police Department squad car, but they have not said why Brown was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.

As of Tuesday evening, more than 50 people had been arrested in two nights of disturbances following Brown's death. The {FBI}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/fbi-ORGOV000008-topic.html”> has opened a civil rights investigation into the racially charged case, and St. Louis County also is investigating the shooting.",50,NA,NA,from Reuters
ChicagoTribune,chitri11,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-iftheygunnedmedown-20140813-story.html,#Iftheygunnedmedown: Social media with a message,Ernie Suggs and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,8/13/2014,12/9/2015,"In the newfound arena of social media as activism, few hashtags have generated as much buzz as {""IfTheyGunnedMeDown,""}<hyperlink”https://twitter.com/QDOTjones”> which has been circulating around {Twitter}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/business/twitter-inc.-ORCRP00010280-topic.html”>, Facebook and Instagram.

Still, the trending hashtag was several hours old before Alexis Nwaiwu, a 19-year-old sophomore at Georgia State University, decided to post.

It wasn't necessarily Michael Brown's photo that inspired her. Rather, it was a news image of Brown whose shooting by Ferguson, Mo., police has caused riots juxtaposed with that of {James Holmes}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/james-holmes-PEOCVC000208-topic.html”>, the Colorado theater shooter, that enraged her.

Someone posted the photo of Brown in his red Nike tank top flashing a peace sign. The headline, taken from a news site, read: ""Police: Michael Brown Struggled With Officer Before Shooting.""

On top of that was a photo of Holmes, wearing a tie in what looks like a class picture. The headline: ""Theater Shooting Suspect Was Brilliant Science Student.""

""I just thought it was interesting how they portrayed someone who is Caucasian as a brilliant scholar. Who was a mass murderer,"" Nwaiwu said. ""Michael Brown is shown as a thug because he was throwing up a peace sign.""

Brown was shot and killed last weekend after an encounter with a police officer in his hometown. His death has not only sparked unrest in Ferguson, to the point where President Barack Obama issued a statement, but social media has also exploded, picking up his cause.

Nwaiwu, a varsity cheerleader at GSU, also picked up his cause, posting a picture of herself laughing at a party flashing two peace signs. Next to it is a smiling image of Nwaiwu in her South Cobb High School graduation robe.

""The one at the party with a peace sign portrays my generation,"" she said. ""But don't get it confused. I still graduated with honors from high school. I am in college. I am a cheerleader and I make good grades. But the media will always show one side of you.""

After the fatal shooting of Brown, 18, several media outlets used what many said was a distorted image of him taken from his Twitter account casual, bordering on menacing. They argue that a majority of his photos show a different side, like broad smiles, hearty laughs and the tenderness of high school graduation photos. He was set to begin college on Monday.

Brown's death comes nearly 2 1/2 years after the shooting of {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/trayvon-martin-PEOCVC000188-topic.html”> and about 13 months after {George Zimmerman}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/george-zimmerman-PECLB0000014809-topic.html”> was acquitted at trial in the Martin case. More recent episodes that fueled the Michael Brown protests: the videotaped death of Eric Garner at the hands of New York City police, and the second-degree murder verdict against Theodore Wafer. Wafer shot Renisha McBride, 19, after she knocked on his door after crashing her car.

""The assumption is that black males are predators and because of that perceived threat as a predator, you can do anything to them,"" said David Wall Rice, chairman of the psychology department at {Morehouse College}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/education/colleges-universities/morehouse-college-OREDU000749-topic.html”>. ""You can gun them down and not be worried about being convicted, like with Trayvon. You can ask what Michael Brown was doing wrong, instead of what was the person with the gun doing wrong?""

Al Tompkins, a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit school for journalism in St. Petersburg, Fla., said in a statement posted on the school's website that the hashtag campaign forces people and news organizations to re-examine how images are received and perceived.

""No single image can define an individual. It is possible for an image to be accurate, real and unaltered and still not be a true depiction of who that person is,"" Tompkins said. ""A booking photo could be a single image of a person at the worst moment of his or her life. A wedding photo could be that same person at the best moment of his/her life. Both are extremes. Seek context.""

Since the hashtag campaign started, the phrase ""iftheygunnedmedown"" has been used on Twitter more than 158,000 times, according to The New York Times. Many of those posted similar photos with similar stories.

Eric Deggans, television critic for {National Public Radio}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/business/media-industry/radio-industry/npr-ORNPR0000040-topic.html”> and the author of ""Race-Baiter: How the Media Wields Dangerous Words to Divide a Nation,"" said the use of social media, particularly among African-Americans, has given voice to people who might have otherwise been silenced.

""With social media, we get to tell our story,"" Deggan said. ""We don't have to depend on the editor of The New York Times having empathy for our stories. We can put up a blog post or Tweet that reflects our attitude and it reaches millions of people in a way more potent than The New York Times.""

Quamisha Desroches, a 2013 {Spelman College}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/education/colleges-universities/spelman-college-OREDU000774-topic.html”> graduate now working in the Dominican Republic as a Peace Corps health volunteer, posted a photo of herself in shorts, a T-shirt and shades getting ready for a paint party next to one from the day she became the first person in her family to earn a college degree.

""Someone may see that picture and think I am a promiscuous young girl, who wears revealing clothing and parties every night,"" she said. ""But I am a 23-year-old virgin. A respectable and college-educated young woman. I know when and how to have fun and while sometimes I may wear provocative clothing, I also know what it means to be professional. Oftentimes people look at a picture, but leave out all of its context.""

Terry Bembry Jr., who played four years of basketball at Houston Baptist University, took a more subtle approach. In one photo, he is wearing a hoodie, although it is down. He seems uninterested in the camera. He might need a haircut and a shave. In the companion photo, he's smiling. Clean-shaven. Fresh haircut. Pressed shirt and tie.

""Being a black man in America, I'm already at a disadvantage and that no matter how well we may be doing for ourselves and no matter how well we present ourselves, there will always be someone or a group of people trying to bring us down and taint our image,"" said Bembry, 24, who works for an oil and gas company in Texas. ""That's what the hashtag is all about. Nobody is perfect, no matter what our skin color is, but African-Americans seem to catch the most hell from the white community in these situations.""

Morehouse's Rice, who teaches a course called ""Black men, Black boys and the Psychology of Modern Media,"" recalls the teachings of W.E.B. Du Bois to provide a historical context. Du Bois, who taught at Atlanta University at the turn of the last century, pioneered the concept of ""double consciousness,"" which refers to the psychological challenge of reconciling an African heritage with a European upbringing and education.

Or as Du Bois put it in his landmark ""The Souls of Black Folk"": ""This sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.""

Rice said black people shouldn't have to worry about which photo of them might be used and argues that both images contribute to a more complete picture.

""That really does add to the complexity of how black men are viewed in the United States,"" Rice said. ""The media reducing black men to one staid image they are comfortable with, while ignoring the complexity of the wholeness of who black men are it should not be a question of which one, but rather showing the whole person.""

Tarshia Stanley, chairwoman of the Spelman College English Department, said that while she agrees that the hashtag campaign has been positive, she cautions about it ultimately being regulated to a slogan that ""re-inscribes images that were troublesome to start with.""

""We have to, as a community, think about these issues of safely and violence toward young black men, particularly coming from authority,"" Stanley said. ""We have to get a real dialogue going. Where is the dialogue with law enforcement before things like this happen? Where is the dialogue about occupying physical space? We have to figure out how we move beyond the hashtag.""",2,NA,NA,from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution

Chanting phrases like “black lives matter” and “no justice, no peace,” many in the youthful crowd held signs with the names of people shot and killed by police officers written on them. The event comes as activists nationwide are rallying in response to Sunday’s fatal police shooting of an unarmed man, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo.

Speakers and organizers with the Black Youth Project spoke emotionally and sometimes tearfully about what they see as injustice by law enforcement and other institutions against African-Americans.

Malcolm London, an event organizer, compared police brutality today with lynchings and violence that occurred during the civil rights movement decades ago.

“I don’t care what color you are: green, red, purple, brown, you don’t deserve to get your life taken by the state, ever, by nobody,” said London, 21, adding later: “These dangerous … stereotypes that persist in this country is the reason why black young people are killed by police officers.”

Another organizer, Rachel Jackson, 23, who said she is a third grade teacher in Chicago, said the type of violence and injustice she witnesses against racial minorities makes her scared for the kids in her classroom.

“It’s just continuing over and over again,” Jackson said.

Those gathered also observed four minutes of silence, during which many in the crowd stood holding hands with their arms raised into the air. The four minutes, London said, represented one minute for each hour Brown’s body was reportedly left on the sidewalk after he was shot.

Many in the crowd, like Corbin Adams, said they’d heard about the event on Twitter or Facebook and, feeling a personal connection to what happened in Missouri, wanted to come out.

“I feel personally like it could happen to me, it could happen to one of my friends,” said Adams, 27, adding that he’s already had experiences where law enforcement stopped and searched his car for no reason.

“I want those things to stop,” said Adams, an insurance broker in the Loop, who suggested better diversity training and just getting “to know each other” could alleviate racial biases.

Many at the gathering said they have been affected by gun violence, including Kiana Knox, 23. Knox said attending was a way to show support for Brown’s family but also to make a social statement.

“It’s not going to be swept under the rug and we’re not going to let it happen,” said Knox about unwarranted brutality. “It’s a matter of making our voices heard and saying that we’re not going to let this continue to happen. It has to stop somewhere.”",57,NA,NA,NA

The unrest followed the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed college-bound 18-year-old, high school graduate--whose body was left on the pavement for four hours.

The televised chaos that ensued looked like the nation's worst police riot since the {1968 Democratic National Convention}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/democratic-national-convention-%281968%29-EVHST000046-topic.html”> in Chicago. 

Making bad matters worse, witnesses say, was the blitzkrieg-like scale of militarized force that police displayed -- camouflage fatigues, body armor, armored vehicles, flash grenades, tear gas, short-barreled assault rifles–-all of which breathes new life into a long-summering and increasingly bipartisan issue the {militarization of local police}<hyperlink=”http://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537”>--with taxpayer-funded assistance from the federal government.

Even as national crime rates were going down, Congress sincd 1960 has been helping police departments to armor up with surplus military gear, all in the name of fighting drug lords and terrorists.

Police in Watertown, Connecticut, for example, recently acquired a  $733,000 mine-resistant, ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicle for only $2,800, according to Stars and Stripes, although the town has yet to report its first land mine or IED.

Police in Bloomington, Georgia, acquired four grenade launchers through the program, {The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports}<hyperlink=”http://www.ajc.com/news/news/military-equipment-flowing-to-local-law-enforcemen/nT7ZK/”>. No word on what the small town (population: 2,713) is going to do with four grenade launchers, but I'm sure they'll find something.

Back in Missouri, more than $449 million in equipment has been transferred to the county that includes Ferguson, a small St. Louis suburb of 21,000 prople. 

Departments that have these weapons are more likely to use them, whether they need them or not. As the {American Civil Liberties Union}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/social-issues/american-civil-liberties-union-ORCIG0000034-topic.html”>’s Kara Dansky, lead author of an ACLU report on these militarization programs, told the New Yorker--quoting psychologist Abraham Maslow--, “If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”

Suspicion of the militarization crosses party lines.  “If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off,"" he wrote in a Time essay. ""But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.”

In a Time essay, headlined “{We must demilitarize the police}<hyperlink=”http://time.com/#3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”>,” Paul observed, “It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime.

It's always risky for a president to get involved in local disputes. But everybody looks to this president when a local dispute disrupts what the Constitution calls the ""domestic tranquillity,"" especially when the dispute involves questions of race.

After four nights of rioting over a racially charged shooting, there wasn't much tranquillity in the working-class St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.

Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, police said. But police offered no details, including the officer's name and information about a convenience store robbery in which Brown was a suspect, for almost a week.

In the meantime, protests over the shooting erupted into four nights of rioting and some looting that made Ferguson look like an uprising in the Gaza Strip.

A second controversy erupted, whether police in full riot gear and armored military vehicles further inflamed the violence with their militaristic handling of peaceful protesters — including the arrests of two journalists and a St. Louis state senator.

By the time I heard that the president was going to interrupt his vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., to say something about Ferguson, I was not surprised.

I only wondered how long it would take for his conservative critics to complain, regardless of what he said, that he was ""dividing Americans by race.""

The answer: Not long.

Fox News contributor {Laura Ingraham}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/arts-culture/mass-media/news-media/laura-ingraham-PECLB00000013551-topic.html”>, guest hosting ""{The O'Reilly Factor}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/entertainment/television/the-oreilly-factor-%28tv-program%29-ENTTV00001041-topic.html”>,"" panned Obama's statement as the latest among ""Obama administration interjections (that) have stoked racial discord in America"" and increased mistrust between minorities and law enforcement.

Fox's ""The Five"" co-host Andrea Tantaros claimed that Obama's comments ""only inflamed the situation,"" but ""I'm not surprised, because he's stuck his nose into other local issues.""

I, by contrast, was neither shocked nor surprised, except by the great pains the president took to sound evenhanded to the point of oratorical blandness.

He praised Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html”> of Missouri and extended his sympathy to Brown's family that ""will never hold Michael in their arms again.""

He scolded looters and those who commit ""violence against police"" and also scolded police, saying there is ""also no excuse"" for ""excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.""

He called for openness and transparency in the death investigation, and repeated his earlier announcement of an independent Justice Department investigation.

Noting that ""emotions are raw,"" that ""there are going to be different accounts of how this tragedy occurred"" and ""of what needs to happen,"" he called for unity, ""belief in equality under the law"" and ""let's remember that we're all part of one American family.""

For this, his tireless critics accuse him of dividing Americans by race. It seems to me that the Ferguson police, among others, were doing a good enough job of that by themselves.

If Obama really wanted to be provocative, he could have brought up other matters that people were talking about, like the militarization of local police forces, an issue that by the end of the week was pulling the liberal left and libertarian right together in unusual agreement.

But the best news emerged when the governor's putting the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge resulted in the first relatively peaceful night in almost a week. Much of the credit went to patrol Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, a native of Ferguson. As he hugged some of his former neighbors, he told reporters, ""I'm not afraid to be in this crowd.""

Instead of trying to block the protesters, he marched with them. Instead of arresting reporters, he set up a media staging area. Instead of launching gas grenades, he told officers working crowd control to take off their gas masks.

Presidents can set a tone, praising and scolding from Washington, but real change comes from local leaders like Johnson, who put history's best lessons into practice.",3,NA,NA,NA

Monday — two days after the shooting of an unarmed African-American teen by a police officer — looks like a good bet. That's when the chief of police made clear that his priority wasn't a fast, transparent drive for justice.

Ferguson had erupted in rioting and looting Sunday night, the day after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed on the street. The police said Brown attacked an officer; that account was disputed by witnesses, including a friend who was with Brown. Deeply distrustful black residents of the town demanded to know how and why Brown was killed and who fired the shots.

No answers came. Just a more intimidating police presence.

""After last night,"" police Chief Thomas Jackson said, ""we can't let our guard down.""

Police in riot gear backed by SWAT armored cars were on the streets Monday night, firing tear gas at demonstrators. St. Louis alderman Antonio French said on Twitter he heard the sounds of rifles being cocked.

On Tuesday, Jackson reneged on a commitment to reveal the name of the police officer involved in the shooting. ""The value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family,"" Jackson said. That fed more rage, and more violence on the streets.

On Wednesday, as the streets erupted again, two journalists were arrested by police as they worked out of a McDonald's restaurant. An Al Jazeera America camera crew reported that it was the target of police tear gas and rubber bullets.

The nation always seems caught by surprise when its racial fault lines are exposed.
- Tribune editorial

The political response throughout these days? It was negligent.

Missouri Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html”> didn't speak publicly about events in Ferguson until Tuesday. He didn't visit the city until Thursday.

Finally, on Thursday, the governor took an important step designed to cool tensions. He brought in the Missouri State Highway Patrol to lead the police response in Ferguson, replacing local authorities. ""I understand the anger and fear the residents of Ferguson are feeling. Our officers will respect both those feelings,"" said Capt. Ron Johnson, who grew up in the area and will run the operation.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the {FBI}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/fbi-ORGOV000008-topic.html”> are conducting a separate investigation of the shooting, which Attorney General Eric Holder said deserves review.

The nation always seems caught by surprise when its racial fault lines are exposed. Incidents like this — really, they could happen almost anywhere — remind us of the anger that can quickly well up when people who feel they have no power, no authority, believe they have been abused by people who have power, who have authority.

Ferguson is a town where the majority of citizens, but only three of the 53 members of the police force, are black. It's a town where black political representation is nearly nonexistent.

What happened last Saturday on a street in Ferguson, Mo.? The truth about the death of Michael Brown might stoke more anger, whether the police officer grossly overreacted or appropriately defended himself. But what happened can't remain a mystery. The failure to provide real information, the failure to provide a genuine assurance of eventual justice, has incited resentment, anger and violence.",13,NA,NA,NA
ChicagoTribune,chitri16,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-missouri-police-shooting-20140813-story.html,"Highway Patrol Captain to take a ""different approach"" to policing in Ferguson",Tribune wire reports,8/15/2014,12/9/2015,"Missouri's governor moved to ease tensions on Thursday after days of racially charged protests over the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, putting the African-American captain of the Highway Patrol in charge of security in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.

Captain Ron Johnson, who grew up in Ferguson, told reporters he would take a ""different approach"" to policing after complaints that officers used heavy-handed tactics, arresting dozens of protesters and using teargas and pepper pellets to break up crowds.

Protesters filled the streets for a fifth night on Thursday in the mostly black suburb of Ferguson and also assembled in other U.S. cities following the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown last weekend.

The mood was boisterous but peaceful, even festive at times, in sharp contrast to tense nightly standoffs between heavily armed riot police flanked by armored cars and angry protesters, as well as episodes of looting, vandalism and violence.

Thousands of demonstrators, including more white protesters than on previous evenings, gathered late into the night near the site of Saturday's shooting.

In sharp contrast to Wednesday night's heavy deployment by riot police, Captain Johnson and a handful of African-American officers without body armor walked among the crowd.

""We just want to be able to come and demonstrate together without the fear of being shot. It's that simple,"" said 53-year-old protester Cat Daniels, an Iraq veteran. ""What you see tonight is people coming together. When that kid was killed the hurt and the pain was real.""

In the forecourt of a gas station burned out during rioting earlier this week, a cowboy rode a horse and a group of children danced on pavement covered in chalk drawings with the words: ""Now the world knows your name, RIP Mike.""

Elsewhere drivers honked horns and waved signs in solidarity and one group of demonstrators even took to the streets on a car-sized replica of the fictional steam locomotive Thomas The Tank Engine.

""It's because of this young man right here,"" Captain Johnson told a CNN reporter, holding up a picture of Brown to shouts of approval from protesters around him. ""It's about the justice for everyone.""

The protests have cast a spotlight on racial tensions in greater St. Louis, where civil rights groups have complained in the past that police racially profiled blacks, arrested a disproportionate number of blacks and had racist hiring practices.

Brown's shooting galvanized a national moment of silence and rallies in other U.S. cities.

In New York, a large crowd briefly overwhelmed a small police presence in Union Square park, forcing officers to scramble to close one of Manhattan's major thoroughfares. Local media showed a handful of protesters being arrested.

In St. Louis, CNN footage showed hundreds of people peacefully assembled in the shadow of the iconic Gateway Arch, Brown's mother and other family members among them.

Seeking to defuse the situation earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama had called on police to respect peaceful demonstrations.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said Ferguson lately ""has looked a little bit more like a war zone, and that is unacceptable.""

Police have pledged to do better but have also justified the tough tactics, saying they have responded to the threat of violence during protests.

""WHAT'S HIS NAME?""

Protesters have decried what they say is a lack of transparency by police investigating Saturday's shooting, including the refusal to release the officer's name.

On Thursday night in Ferguson, around 200 demonstrators chanted, ""what's his name? what's his name?'"" at Johnson and the St. Louis County police chief, Jon Belmar.

Police said they plan to release on Friday the name of the officer who shot Brown, according to CNN and Los Angeles Times reports.

Some critics have also called for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCullough to be removed from the case.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement that police had accepted an offer of technical assistance from the Justice Department ""to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.""

The Justice Department, the FBI and the St. Louis County prosecutor's office are all investigating Brown's death.

A law enforcement official told Reuters that Holder spoke with Michael Brown's parent's by phone as they and their lawyers visited the U.S. attorney's office in Missouri.

Holder expressed his personal condolences for their son's death and promised the department would conduct a full, independent civil rights investigation, the official said.

Early on Thursday, a member of the Anonymous hacker activist collective tweeted the name of a person alleged to be the police officer who shot Brown. But police and other Anonymous tweeters said the activist had named the wrong person.

There is little clarity on what occurred during Saturday's incident. Police have said that Brown struggled with the officer who shot and killed him. The officer involved in the shooting was injured during the incident and was treated in a hospital for swelling on the side of his face, they said.

But some witnesses have said that Brown held up his hands and was surrendering when he was shot multiple times in the head and chest.",358,NA,NA,NA

Causey,8/15/2014,12/9/2015,"When I was growing up, my parents often gave me pep talks that were different from the ones my white male friends got from their parents.

My parents still worry about me. Maybe you can call it being overprotective, but it goes beyond saying such things as, “Make sure you put on your seat-belt” or “Don't get in the car with someone who has been drinking.” These are the things most parents tell their kids.

However, my parents wanted me to know that every time I walked out the front door I was going to be judged as a “black male” first.

What does that mean? It means knowing how to deal with police and law enforcement when confronted or stopped. They also told me how to handle situations in department stores when extra eyes were on me thinking I was going to steal.

I still remember how they would tell me that if I was ever stopped by a police officer to make sure I kept my hands in plain view so that I wouldn't get shot because police might mistake my wallet for a gun.

They also told me to avoid getting into verbal confrontations with officers, even if the officers were dead wrong, because they feared these situations could escalate to me being shot. Call these rules of survival.

Although I have undergraduate and MBA degrees, I have been harassed by police and stopped for no reason other than being black while driving.

Steve Perry, principal of Capital Preparatory Magnet School in Hartford, Conn., said black males have been criminalized from the time they enter school. They are the most suspended and disciplined of any group.

My parents gave me this advice because they know that society judges and looks at me as a threat because I am black male.

I wish people could be judged based on their character instead of their skin color or dialect. I'm not sure that this will happen in my lifetime, but I can hope that it will happen in my daughter's.

Several cases of unarmed black youths who were shot and killed have received national attention. {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/trayvon-martin-PEOCVC000188-topic.html”> was pursued by a neighborhood block watch volunteer, confronted and shot and killed during a subsequent altercation. On Saturday?, Michael Brown, 18, was shot and killed after a confrontation with a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. The teenager was unarmed. President Barack Obama said the shooting was “a tragedy” and called for peaceful protests, but the city still erupted in violence that's continuing.

On Aug. 11, Ezell Ford, 25, was reportedly lying on the ground when he was fatally shot by a Los Angeles police officer. Ford, who was unarmed, was considered mentally challenged. Ford was confronted by police during an “investigative stop.” According to police, a struggle ensued and police “opened fire.”

In Milwaukee, a police officer shot Dontre Hamilton multiple times during a confrontation at a park in April. Hamilton, 31, was fatally shot during a struggle in which the officer said Hamilton became combative. Family members said Hamilton had a history of paranoia and schizophrenia but was not typically violent.

Staying safe was a constant conversation that I had with my parents, and it's one that parents of black children must continue to have. CNN asked black parents this week what they tell their sons when they go out, and just as my parents did when I was growing up, parents today give their sons the same tips my parents gave me.

Sometimes staying safe means knowing how to act around police. Because not knowing can quickly rob you of your childhood innocence.",2,NA,NA,NA

These are scenes playing out in Ferguson, Missouri, which has been racked by protests for the last week following the fatal shooting of an unarmed 19-year-old named Michael Brown.

For veterans of the wars that the Ferguson protests so closely resemble, the police response has appeared to be not only heavy-handed but out of step with the most effective ways for both law enforcement and military personnel to respond to demonstrations.

""You see the police are standing online with bulletproof vests and rifles pointed at peoples chests,"" said Jason Fritz, a former Army officer and an international policing operations analyst. ""That's not controlling the crowd, that's intimidating them.""

The protests in Ferguson began in earnest just a day after Brown was killed, when a prayer vigil for the slain teen turned into an evening of looting.

Scriven King, a 10-year veteran of the {U.S. Air Force}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/defense/u.s.-air-force-ORGOV0000126141145-topic.html”>'s law enforcement component and a SWAT officer, attributed the initial spasm of violence to a lack of leadership and mismanagement of public perception on the Ferguson Police Department's behalf.

""The first thing that went wrong was when the police showed up with K-9 units,"" Scriven said. ""The dogs played on racist imagery. . . . It played the situation up and [the department] wasn't cognizant of the imagery.""

King added that, instead of de-escalating the situation on the second day, the police responded with armored vehicles and SWAT officers clad in bulletproof vests and military-grade rifles.

""We went through some pretty bad areas of Afghanistan, but we didn't wear that much gear,"" said Kyle Dykstra, an Army veteran and former security officer for the {State Department}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/u.s.-department-of-state-ORGOV000000150-topic.html”>. Dykstra specifically pointed out the bulletproof armor the officers were wearing around their shoulders, known as ""Deltoid"" armor.

""I can't think of a [protest] situation where the use of M4 [rifles] are merited,"" Fritz said. ""I don't see it as a viable tactic in any scenario.""

Ferguson police have defended their handling of the protests and said some demonstrators have been trying to ""co-opt"" peaceful protests. But while the Ferguson and St. Louis county police departments may have made their presence felt in the streets, they have made only limited use of social media.

""They've kept people in an information black hole,"" King said, mentioning that their decision not to share details about operations more widely has only exacerbated the situation.

""There has not been a dialogue about the tactical situation the officers faced,"" he said, referring to the fact that there might have been a reason that caused the officers to respond with such heavy equipment. ""There could have been threats to the officers, but that information has not been shared to the public.""

As the violence continued to escalate over the course of the week, King said, Ferguson police also exacerbated tensions by allowing individual officers to engage with protesters.

""Officers were calling the protesters 'animals,' "" King said. ""I can't imagine a military unit would do that in any scenario.""

King added that if it were a military unit in a similar situation there would be a public affairs officer or civil affairs engagement team that would help bridge the gap between the riot control elements and the general population.

""I would hate to call the Ferguson response a military one,"" he said. ""Because it isn't, it's an aberration.""",3,NA,NA,NA

That was harmless when contained to friends at the bar or co-workers in the break room. But it's not so harmless anymore. We now jabber into streams of social media, letting fact-less comments flow far and fast, spreading like a contagion of idiocy.

The tragedy in Ferguson, Mo., may be the best example yet of how reckless and harmful this unfiltered communication can be.

From the moment Michael Brown was shot to death by a Ferguson police officer nearly a week ago, the Internet has been a cesspool of assumptions and speculative opinions. The Ferguson police department, behaving in a generally unhinged manner, has released little information about the shooting. In the absence of that information, all of humanity rushed in to fill the void and everyone, from Brown to the police, from the residents of Ferguson to the national news media, have been vilified by someone.

When police officials finally released the name of the officer who killed Brown, Twitter exploded because several people traced that name to a picture of a black police officer. Insults flew and Twitter trolls sneered with satisfaction, saying the cries of racism in Ferguson were unfounded, because the offending officer was the same race as Brown. (An argument that makes zero sense, even if it was true.)

Then, predictably, we learned several hours later than the black officer in a photo dispatched far and wide is not the same person as the Ferguson police officer in question. They simply share a name - Darren Wilson. The Ferguson officer is actually white. And so a new round of sneering began.

The problem here is that our ability to broadcast has rendered us incapable of waiting. We can't be bothered to wait for facts. We must be out there, we must be first, and if what we're tweeting or blogging about isn't based in fact, well, who cares?

We should care. Look at the noise the news out of Ferguson has generated. Look at the hateful tweets and self-righteous Facebook posts, most of which have crumbled in the face of facts.

We help no one by jumping to conclusions. Not Brown's memory, not his family and not the community devastated by his death.

It can be hard, with a phone in hand and a Twitter account at the ready, to realize that sometimes it's OK to say nothing. But it is.

Sometimes the best thing we can do, the most responsible thing we can do, is easy: Wait.",5,NA,NA,NA
ChicagoTribune,chitri20,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-libertarians-conservatives-ferguson-20140815-story.html,Libertarians shift conservative take on Ferguson,Dan Balz,8/15/2014,12/9/2015,"The killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, has produced a rare and surprisingly unified response across the ideological spectrum, with {Republicans}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/republican-party-ORGOV0000004-topic.html”> and Democrats joining to decry the tactics of the city's police force in the face of escalating protests.

Most notably, the reactions reflect a shift away from the usual support and sympathy typically shown for law enforcement in such situations among conservatives. Although possibly unique to the circumstances of the events in Missouri this week, the changing reaction on the right is clear evidence of a rising and more vocal libertarian wing within the Republican Party.

No better sign of that came Thursday than in an article by Sen. {Rand Paul}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/rand-paul-PEPLT007915-topic.html”>, R-Ky., published on Time's website.

""If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off,"" he wrote. ""But, I wouldn't have expected to be shot.""

In his piece, Paul criticized what he called the growing militarization of local police forces. ""There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace,"" he wrote, ""but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.""

Paul also bluntly pointed to the role that race continues to play in law enforcement. ""Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention,"" he wrote.

Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist, said, ""It's an interesting left-meets-right dynamic and probably Rand Paul is at the center of it.""

Those people alarmed by the militarization of local police, he said, are the same people troubled by the widespread surveillance programs of the {National Security Agency}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/defense/security-measures/national-security-agency-ORGOV0000104-topic.html”> or the increasing use of drones as military weapons.

Paul is a prospective 2016 presidential candidate and the leading proponent of libertarian philosophy among elected officials. In Ferguson, he has found circumstances almost tailor-made to advance his worldview. In doing so, he continues to set himself apart from others in the Republican Party with the hope of expanding the party's coalition and advancing his own political future.

In this case, he blames the militarization of local police on big government and especially Washington's willingness to provide such materiel to local communities. His comments on race mark another moment in which he is trying to show an openness to the issues affecting African Americans that sets him apart from others in his party.

John Weaver, a Republican strategist, said in an email message: ""There is a growing concern across the country — and finally across demographic and ideological lines — of the militarization of local police, the often quick escalation in lieu of law enforcement defusing a situation, and the erosion of guaranteed rights under the Constitution. The growing libertarian wing of our party is pushing, rightfully, in this direction.""

The images of police in riot gear, with armored vehicles and heavy weaponry, shooting a tear-gas canister at an Al Jazeera camera crew (and then putting their lights and camera onto the ground after the crew fled in terror) have drawn alarming reactions from the left and the right.

The rough treatment and detainment of two journalists, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, has added to the public outrage about the Ferguson Police Department's handling of the protests over Brown's killing.

For more traditional conservatives who also might join the presidential race in 2016, the events in Ferguson have been a cause for more careful reactions.

Sen. {Marco Rubio}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/marco-rubio-PEPLT007456-topic.html”> of Florida said, in part, ""I'm very concerned by recent events in Ferguson, including the violence that has gripped that community and the inexplicable jailing of two reporters. As the {FBI}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/fbi-ORGOV000008-topic.html”> looks into allegations regarding the police department there, I hope Americans all over the country will voice their opinions through peaceful means and not resort to violence.""

Sen. {Ted Cruz}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/ted-cruz-PEPLT0008957-topic.html”>, R-Texas, whose conservatism is far different from Paul's, walked a careful line in his written reaction that was posted on his Facebook page, balancing what he called the tragedy of Brown's death with the challenges local police face. He also spoke of the need to protect civil liberties and the right of reporters to cover the news without being intimidated.

Pete Wehner, a {White House}<hypelink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/white-house-PLCUL000110-topic.html”> official during {George W. Bush}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/presidents-of-the-united-states/george-w.-bush-PEPLT000857-topic.html”>'s presidency and a frequent commentator from the right, highlighted what has changed within the conservative movement. ""{Libertarians}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/parties-movements/libertarian-party-ORGOV000277-topic.html”> are reacting as one would anticipate but there are more libertarian voices within the Republican Party today than in the past,"" he said in a telephone interview.

But in noting the restrained reactions of more traditional conservatives, he offered this caution to those suggesting that libertarianism is gaining widespread support with the GOP.

""I think a number of people who are conservative are somewhat troubled by the images coming out of there,"" he said. ""I don't think that's indicative of a broader trend among conservatives that is less pro-law enforcement. I think it's to the specifics"" of what has happened in Ferguson.

Stevens anticipates a growing audience for these views, particularly among younger Americans. ""To be younger and more anti-authoritarian is not unusual,"" he said. ""More younger voters who are conservative are fine with legalization of marijuana and are fine with gay marriage.""

The strength of the libertarian movement within the Republican Party will be tested more significantly if Paul seeks the presidency in 2016. But at this moment, its advocates are making their voices heard.

""They're not the largest force by any means,"" Wehner said. ""But they're more influential than they have been in the past, and you're seeing some of that in the reactions to what's going on in Ferguson.""",3,NA,NA,NA
ChicagoTribune,chitri21,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-ferguson-brown-shooting-20140815-story.html,"Ferguson Day 6: Protests continue, as rally approaches",Tribune wire reports,8/16/2014,12/9/2015,"Minutes before a police officer shot him dead, Michael Brown had become a suspect in the theft of cigars from a store, according to police reports released on Friday after days of protests in a St. Louis suburb over the unarmed black teenager's death.

But what, if anything, that had to do with the fatal encounter became less clear as the day went by. Hours after the reports' release, police said that Officer Darren Wilson, 28, had no idea 18-year-old Brown was a robbery suspect. He simply wanted Brown to move from the road to the sidewalk, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said at a news conference

""He was walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic. That was it,"" Jackson said.

After nearly a week of accusations that the Ferguson Police Department did not know how to communicate with the public, Jackson did little to dispel that image during two appearances on Friday.

He was visibly nervous, stuttering as he fumbled his notes, and made announcements that sowed more confusion. After releasing the robbery incident report without any attempt to explain its fuller context, he let more than five hours pass before confirming, and only when asked, that Wilson did not know about the robbery when he encountered Brown.

The decision by the police department, which is overwhelmingly white, to release a report on the robbery while keeping details of the shooting secret only added to the frustration felt by many in the St. Louis area.

Still, as protests entered their sixth night on Friday there was far less tension than earlier in the week, before local forces were replaced by state police led by an African-American captain.

Outside a burned-out building where protesters were shot with rubber bullets two days ago, the scene resembled a summer carnival. Horns blew in support as cars drove past a crowd of people, many of whom brought picnic coolers.

Hope Walker, 46, sat in a folding chair on the sidewalk with some friends. ""It's more like a block party than what I was calling little Beirut,"" said the music teacher.

However, later in the evening, protesters were saying via Twitter, that police fired tear gas a crowd.

Earlier Friday, after identifying Wilson as the officer involved in the shooting, the Ferguson police chief described him as a ""gentleman"" who has been devastated by the incident. Wilson worked four of his six years as an officer on the Ferguson police force, Jackson said.

Wilson's identity has been kept a secret since the Aug. 9 shooting and authorities had been under mounting pressure to both identify the officer and to provide details about the investigation to ease unrest in the largely black community.

Since Saturday's killing, which took place shortly after noon on a street running through a quiet, tree-lined residential neighborhood, protesters have converged on Ferguson.

Civil rights groups have complained that Brown's death is the latest in a long history of racial profiling and harassment by police, and discriminatory arrests.

Some residents saw the police report on the robbery as the latest example of the pattern.

""This is how the police operate here, they always defame the name of the victim,"" said area resident Arthur Austin, 39. ""The more I hear, the less I trust what the police are saying.""

CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS

The police version that has thus far been provided of Brown's shooting differs markedly from witness accounts, including that of his friend Johnson. 

In their earlier account, police said Brown reached into the patrol car and struggled with Wilson before the officer pulled his service gun and shot Brown multiple times. Wilson sustained a facial injury, which was treated in a hospital, they said.

But Johnson and one other witness have said that Brown was trying to get away from the officer, who tried to grab him after telling him to move off the street and onto a sidewalk. Brown held up his hands in a sign of surrender but was shot several times, they said.

Police have acknowledged that Brown's body was more than 30 feet away from the police car when he collapsed and died and that multiple shell casings were found at the scene.

The name of the robbed convenience store was redacted by police, although a street name listed and security-camera footage of the store were released. A clerk at a store on that street that closely resembled the one seen in the video images said he knew nothing about the robbery. All three employees who were on duty last Saturday were away for the next two weeks, he said, declining to give his name.

RALLY ON SUNDAY

A Brown family attorney said it appeared to be Brown in the convenience store's security-camera footage, which showed a man shoving a store clerk during an apparent robbery. Dorian Johnson, the friend who was with Brown that day, told the FBI and Justice Department officials about the robbery this week, his lawyer said.

Anthony Gray, a Brown family attorney, said the talk of a robbery was a ""distraction"" raised by police. He said the real issue was why Wilson shot an unarmed Brown as the teenager held his arms in the air in a sign of surrender, as two witnesses described.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the civil rights group National Action Network, issued a statement condemning what he called a ""smear campaign"" against the teenager.

Sharpton said he would lead a rally on Sunday with Brown's family, who expressed outrage at the police report in a statement on Twitter.

""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender,"" the statement said.

According to the account given by Jackson and the police reports his department released, police received a call about the robbery and an ensuing altercation with a clerk at 11:51 a.m. on Aug. 9. A suspect description went out over police radio.

Wilson left a prior call he was on and then encountered Brown at 12:01 p.m. Three minutes later Wilson had fatally shot Brown, Jackson said.

Wilson, who has been put on paid administrative leave, has been shielded from the public. A lone police car sat outside Wilson's single-story brick house on Friday, and neighbors posted signs on their doors asking to be left alone. One neighbor said Wilson had not been seen for days.

Another posted a sign on their door that read simply: ""We don't know anything. Pray for peace.""

PROTESTS

Captain Jay Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who took over control of security in Ferguson the previous day, said there were no arrests during protests on Thursday night and no tear gas used after his officers replaced local police.

Thousands of protesters, demanding justice for Brown's killing, had clashed with riot gear-clad local police since Saturday, but there was a marked shift Thursday to a calmer tone after the governor put an African-American Missouri Highway Patrol Captain in charge of security for the area.

On Thursday night, a small number of police mingled with the crowd, urging a healing to the racially charged situation, in marked contrast to the riot gear, rubber bullets and tear gas that had confronted protesters earlier in the week.

Just three of Ferguson's 53-strong police force are black, while two-thirds of the town's population of 21,000 are black.

Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who was named Thursday to oversee security in the area, reported Friday that the near week-long period of unrest and angry confrontations between police and protesters appeared to be over.

Under his direction, roadblocks were lifted, and instead of using teargas and intimidation, Johnson's teams walked the streets to talk with protesters and listen to their concerns.

""Last night was a great night,"" he said. ""People were talking... getting their voice out.",240,NA,NA,Reuters report

La Ganga,8/16/2014,12/9/2015,"The first thing Norm Stamper thought when he saw images of the protests in Ferguson, Mo., following the police shooting of an unarmed black man was straight out of a folk song — “When will we ever learn?”

“My reaction was, ‘Please learn from my mistakes, from what I did and did not do during the week of WTO,’ ” said the former Seattle police chief, who presided over a law enforcement response to widespread demonstrations in 1999 that was vilified around the globe for its heavy handedness.

“Don’t tear gas nonviolent and not-threatening protesters,” Stamper continued. “And for God’s sake, don’t bring dogs out … It’s a throwback to the ‘60s and Bull Connor. The imagery sucks. It was really painful to see the images I saw from Ferguson.”

Stamper knows whereof he speaks. Fifteen years ago, when the World Trade Organization met in this leafy, progressive outpost, tens of thousands of anti-globalization protesters and labor union activists shut down the heart of Seattle’s city center.

The police response was swift, dramatic and iron-fisted. Officers wielded tear gas, batons, stun grenades and pepper spray. There were more than 600 arrests. The mayor called for curfew and a 50-block no-protest zone. Law enforcement agents in riot gear marched through the city streets.

“The biggest mistake in my 34 years of law enforcement was that we used a military response to a domestic situation, a military tactic that was absolutely unnecessary,” Stamper told the Los Angeles Times. “Why did we do it? It was the cop in me that supported my staff and believed that, if we needed to get emergency assistance to someone in medical distress, we wouldn’t have been able to do it.

“The cop in me should have been overruled by the chief in me,” Stamper said. “I blew it. The effect was to heighten tensions, not de-escalate tension .… A whole lot of others would not have acted as they did if we didn’t act as we did.”

The parallels to Ferguson are painfully obvious. Days of demonstrations followed the Saturday night shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man who had allegedly robbed a convenience store, by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson.

Largely white law enforcement agencies in this largely black suburb of St. Louis — a small town of 21,000 where racial tensions run high — pulled out the military gear, tear gas and camouflage, armored vehicles and police dogs, rubber bullets and sharpshooters.

It wasn’t until Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html”> dispatched the State Highway Patrol on Thursday to take over security in Ferguson that the incendiary situation began to calm down. Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black and grew up in Ferguson, was tapped to lead the effort.

“My new hero is Ron Johnson,” Stamper said. “What he has done is textbook conflict management, conflict resolution. It’s textbook interpersonal competence. The fact that he comes from the community, that he is African American, has achieved a high rank in the state patrol, he’s got instant street credibility.”

On Friday, Stamper decried what he calls the increased militarization of local police forces, which he called “a problem of massive proportions.”

Since the advent of the war on drugs, and particularly since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he said, “police officers are looking more, sounding more, acting more like soldiers than domestic peacekeepers…That translates into an occupational force. In a democratic society, a pluralistic and free society, police officers need to be a part of the community, not apart from it.”

Stamper said there was a place in modern policing for the kind of military equipment that many police forces have gotten in recent years from the federal government. But small towns with tiny police forces should not have arsenals that rival big cities'.

Instead, he called for regional SWAT teams that are staffed with carefully picked and thoroughly trained officers.

He remembers being deputy chief of the San Diego Police Department in 1984 when James Oliver Huberty opened fire in a San Ysidro McDonald’s, killing 21 people and wounding 19 others.

“He’s firing shots everywhere and attempting to keep the police at bay,” Stamper recalled. “We positioned a SWAT sharpshooter a distance away. We give him a green light, and he kills Huberty.

“What if before we did that, we had an armored personnel carrier at our disposal? We could have driven it into the fast food eatery and perhaps reduced the carnage.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

On Friday, Dorsey wrote, ""Heading home to St. Louis"" on his verified Twitter feed, and has followed with a crush of short videos shot from marches and news conferences held by Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol. The agency was brought in after local police used what have been denounced as aggressive tactics to control crowds.

Scenes of police in riot gear and clouds of tear gas have been all too frequent in Ferguson since Brown was gunned down Aug. 9, and Twitter has served as a live stream of the clashes between cops and civilians.

The hashtag #Ferguson has remained the top trend on Twitter for nearly the entire week, as a mixture of established print, television and digital reporters have used the website as a rolling notepad, chronicling developments both large and small through tweets, photographs and brief videos.

Twitter has seen more than 4 million tweets containing the hashtag #Ferguson in the last seven days, with more than 450,000 between Friday and Saturday evenings, according to Topsy.com, a website that provides data on social media trends. In one hour Saturday, about 23,000 tweets carried the hashtag.

Twitter has served as a haven for journalists in recent years, with reporters often breaking details of rapidly developing stories at 140 characters rather than waiting to publish longer articles online or in print, or to go on the air with them.

Although many stories have hijacked the attention of Twitter's 271 million monthly active users, few have dominated the website for as long as the clashes and civil unrest in Ferguson.

On Saturday night Dorsey was still tweeting videos that showed him out with marchers and also posted a picture of himself alongside St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been in Ferguson for days and used Twitter to constantly update followers with scenes from the protests and conflicts with police.

Canfield Green Apartments, a worn complex of brick buildings surrounded by trees and hills, has become a rallying point for protesters. They congregate at its center, Canfield Drive, the two-lane street where Brown, a black 18-year-old, died Aug. 9, shot multiple times by a white police officer.

The apartments are a working-class way station — a way out of the inner city, adjacent to the slightly pricier townhomes and tract houses.

""It's not the projects, and it's not Section 8, but it's not townhomes, either,"" said Lloyd Williams, 29, a friend of Brown's family who works at a casino.

But amid the trappings of a working-class haven is an edge of frustration and anger.

Many of the young have no work. Some have served time in prison for violent crimes, including clashes with police. The apartment complex community had a tense relationship with Ferguson officers.

In this mix, Michael Brown was known as a good kid — not an angel, but someone who had hope for the future.

It is part of the reason why his death has reverberated so strongly: He had hope, and he was killed.

""If his grandma said go upstairs, he went. He was respectful,"" recalled neighbor Kevin Seltzer, 30. ""He didn't bother people. That's why the community here in Ferguson, the real community of Canfield, we're upset now.""

Brown stayed at Canfield with friends and, earlier this year, with his grandmother at the adjacent Northwinds apartments. He had just graduated from nearby Normandy High School — no small achievement here.

He was heavyset and quiet, but not shy. He recorded rap music with his best friend and smoked marijuana with other young men.

Everyone called him ""Mike-Mike."" He's so big, they said, you have to call him twice. His cousin, Christine Ewings, said Brown had played on the high school football team but stopped because he was afraid of hurting smaller students.

Williams said he used to listen to Brown rap about improving his life as he was preparing to attend technical school, studying the heating and cooling trade. ""He was bettering himself,"" Williams said.

Brown didn't have a car or license. Like many here, he walked to nearby stores, including on the day he was shot.

Seltzer watched him leave that day in a T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops. Brown was headed for a nearby minimart to buy cigarillos — cigars often used to smoke marijuana.

“He was respectful. He didn't bother people. That's why the community here in Ferguson, the real community of Canfield, we're upset now.”
- Kevin Seltzer, Michael Brown's neighbor

He stopped briefly to chat with two white landscapers who had been chopping down trees in the complex. They complained about the work, and Brown put it in perspective.

He told them ""be thankful you have a job because some people don't have jobs around here,"" recalled Seltzer, who is among the unemployed.

Moments later, he said Brown departed with a friend, Dorian Johnson, 22, promising to be right back.

Police said that Brown then walked to a minimart and stole some cigarillos. Williams said he didn't know whether that was true, but he said in this neighborhood it wouldn't have marked Brown as much of a criminal. ""When you're growing up in a rough situation, everybody makes mistakes,"" Williams said.

Brown was later shot after being confronted on Canfield Drive by police Officer Darren Wilson in front of several apartment residents.

A woman who lives in the complex and asked not to be identified for fear of being targeted by residents and police said she heard the commotion and ran to her balcony. She said Brown threw his hands up in the air, shouting, ""Don't shoot!""

""The officer kept shooting and he fell to his knees, begging for his life,"" the woman said. ""That's when he finished him off, shot him in the head.""

The woman said she works in a warehouse and moved here in March with her 2-year-old daughter to escape the violence in inner-city St. Louis.

She knows hard-core criminals, and said that Brown wasn't one. He was not a known drug dealer, not a gang-banger.

""His death just pushed a lot of people over the edge,"" she said.

The simmering fear at the apartments has boiled over lately. Several residents have moved out, afraid of both demonstrators and the police.

""There's a bad vibe around here now,"" said the woman who witnessed the shooting. ""I don't feel safe.""

She emerged from her apartment Friday into the humid afternoon with her daughter following the sweet smell of barbecue to a free lunch in a tent set up by volunteers on the lawn across from an impromptu shrine set up on the street for Brown.

They retreated almost immediately. The night before there had been looting one street over on West Florissant Avenue. Now the governor had announced a curfew, and she was worried.

Kevin Brankley, 29, observed from the opposite side of the street, just as he had the day of Brown's shooting.

Brankley said he grew up in a tough area of St. Louis, and was almost accustomed to seeing bodies in the streets. But this shooting startled even him, ""movie-type"" violence in broad daylight against a man he knew to be laid-back.

Brankley, a construction worker, said he planned to stay at the complex, where he hoped neighbors would continue to look out for one another.

He said he didn't know Brown very well, but he added: ""It's not how good Mike was — it's how corrupt the police is,"" he said.

As a black man on these streets, ""it doesn't matter what you do,"" he said. ""You're not liked or hated for what you do. You're liked or hated for who you are.""",1,NA,NA,NA
ChicagoTribune,chitri25,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-ferguson-brown-shooting-20140816-story.html,"Imposed curfew in effect in Ferguson, Mo.",Tribune newspaper and wire reports,8/17/2014,12/9/2015,"Rain did not deter hundreds of protesters, angry at the shooting death of unarmed Michael Brown a week ago, in Ferguson, Missouri from demonstrating in the streets Saturday night and early Sunday morning. 

The state's governor, Jay Nixon, declared a state of emergency Saturday afternoon and set an unpopular curfew which was disobeyed by a small crowd. Around 1 a.m. Sunday morning eye-witnesses gave conflicting reports, some saying police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the remaining protesters, others claiming the shots heard were merely smoke cannisters.

The mood among hundreds of protesters on a main road in Ferguson that has been the scene of recent demonstrations was tense and defiant on Saturday night just prior to the midnight curfew and dozens of helmet-clad officers holding full-length shields took position near demonstrators in the rain.

""The curfew is going to make things worse,"" said protestor Phonso Scott, 24. ""I think the cops are going to get violent tonight, but they can't lock us all up.""

The curfew will be in effect from midnight to 5 a.m., said Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol. He said the curfew would be enforced through communication, not physical force. ""We will be telling people, 'It's time to go home,'"" he said.

""We won’t enforce it with trucks, we won’t enforce it with tear gas, we’ll communicate,"" Johnson said during the afternoon press conference.

By Saturday night Johnson stood in the rain listening to a local resident asking why the officer who shot Brown had not been arrested or charged. ""We'll get some answers. I promise you,"" he said.

""The eyes of the world are watching. This is the test of whether a community, this community, any community, can break the cycle of fear, distrust and violence, and replace them with peace, strength and, ultimately, justice,"" Gov. Nixon said in remarks made at a church near the embattled community Saturday afternoon.

After another night of racially charged protests and looting in Ferguson, the governor had said he was going to meet with local and state law enforcement on Saturday to craft a plan aimed at quelling further violence.

That plan, apparently, resulted in the establishment of the curfew.

""It was a rough time last night. There was a lot of looting and there were a lot of people arming themselves in their storefront to guard their businesses,"" said Al Nothum, a spokesman for the Missouri Highway Patrol earlier in the day.

Noting that most protesters on Friday night had been peaceful, Nixon said he ""cannot allow the ill-will of the few to undermine the goodwill of the many, while putting the people and businesses of this community in danger.''

“The eyes of the world are watching. This is the test of whether a community, this community, any community, can break the cycle of fear, distrust and violence...”
- Missouri Governor Jay Nixon

""This is not to silence the people of Ferguson,'' Nixon said, ""but to address those who are drowning out the voice of the people with their actions. We will not allow a handful of looters to endanger the rest of this community.''

But after his opening remarks, Nixon quickly lost control of the crowd, with the images being recorded for a national television audience.

""You need to charge that police with murder!'' one person yelled. Others demanded to know how the curfew would be enforced. ""Going to do tear gas again?"" someone asked.

Nixon began answering that ""the best way for us to get peace"" was for everyone to go home and get a good night sleep, when another resident interrupted him, shouting ""we don't need sleep. We need justice!""

St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCullough, who has faced skepticism from some elected officials and community members over his ability to handle the case, on Saturday told a local public radio station he plans to convene a grand jury within days to begin looking into evidence in the shooting of Brown.

The governor put Captain Johnson in charge of security on Thursday after several nights of violent clashes between protesters and local police forces in the aftermath of the Aug. 9 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Tensions temporarily cooled on Thursday night but on Friday evening protesters again swarmed through a residential and retail district in the small town outside St. Louis that has become a near war zone, pitting mostly black protesters against mostly white police forces.

Johnson said police fired a teargas canister at a crowd near a food and liquor store and broader violence and looting erupted. Some protesters threw bottles at riot gear-clad police who had ordered the crowd to disperse.

Peaceful protesters, some chanting ""hands up, don't shoot,"" attempted to stop looters at several shops, including a store Brown was accused by police of robbing of cigars earlier in the day before his death.

“This is wonderful. This is what should have happened a long time ago,” Robert Powell, 42, said as he watched looters during the night hop through the shattered glass door of a meat market.

Powell, who owns a professional cleaning service, grew up on the city's west side, and to him, this was small-time crime.

After years of living in a town where he said African American men are singled out for harsh treatment by the police, he shared the looters’ frustration.

Powell blamed the unrest on the Ferguson police chief's release of information Friday about Brown.

Further down the road, Etefia Umana and his son were walking past the scene of the earlier mayhem, with Umana pointing out businesses where citizens had prevented looters from entering.

""We had some friends who were blocking stores,” he said, though he admitted that at some businesses, “eventually they were overwhelmed.”

Information release confuses

Tensions have been high since police officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown, 18, shortly after noon last Saturday as Brown and a friend walked down a street that runs through an apartment complex where Brown's grandmother lives.

Emotions ramped up again Friday when authorities finally gave in to days of pressure and released the name of the officer who shot Brown, but did so only after first saying that Brown was a suspect in a store robbery at the time he was shot, a move that supporters of Brown's family called {a ""smear"" campaign}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-ferguson-brown-shooting-20140815-story.html#page=1”>.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson acknowledged in a news conference on Friday that Wilson did not know Brown was a suspect in the robbery and that the shooting resulted from the officer's request for Brown to move out of the street. 

""This robbery does not relate to the initial contact between the officer and Michael Brown,"" Jackson said. Asked why Brown and his friend were stopped if not suspects in the robbery, the chief said, ""because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.""

Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Brown's family, said in a statement issued Friday that the family was ""beyond outraged"" at the police attempts to ""assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.""

The Brown family attorney said on Saturday that Dr. Michael Baden, a high-profile forensic pathologist, will conduct a second autopsy on Brown's body, according to CNN.

Civil rights activist the Reverend Al Sharpton said he would lead a rally with Brown's family in Ferguson on Sunday.

""There's nothing more contemptible and offensive to the people of this country than for law enforcement to try to smear a dead man or dead child that can't speak for themselves,"" Sharpton said on Saturday morning at a weekly rally he holds in New York City that is broadcast on the Internet.

Other law enforcement agencies criticized the Ferguson police department for trying to make the alleged robbery an issue connected to the shooting and for releasing a video from inside the store that shows Brown violently shoving a store clerk before he walks out the door.

""We had no involvement whatsoever in releasing that video,"" said Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, which is leading the local investigation into the Brown shooting.

The New York Times reported on its website on Saturday that the U.S. Justice Department opposed the Ferguson police decision to release the video, with an unnamed U.S. law enforcement official telling the paper federal officials feared the surveillance footage ""would roil the community further.""

Neither the governor's office nor the state highway patrol were involved in the decision either, said Scott Holste, a spokesman for Governor Nixon.

Police, witness accounts differ strongly

The police version of Brown's shooting differs markedly from witness accounts, including that of the friend who was walking with Brown at the time, Dorian Johnson, 22.

In the police version, after Wilson asked Brown to move out of the road onto a sidewalk, Brown reached into the patrol car and struggled with Wilson for the officer's service gun. Wilson, who sustained a facial injury, then shot Brown a number of times.

Johnson and at least one other witness have said that the officer reached out through his car window to grab at Brown and that the teenager was trying to get away from the officer when he was shot. Brown held up his hands in a sign of surrender but the officer got out of his patrol car and shot Brown several times, they said.

Police have acknowledged that Brown's body was more than 30 feet away from the police car when he collapsed and died and that multiple shell casings were found at the scene.

Social media sites have helped fuel national outrage over the shooting, which is being investigated both by the U.S. Department of Justice for any civil rights violations and by the St. Louis County police force.

FBI agents were at the scene of the shooting on Saturday interviewing area residents, and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson also visited the site, leading a prayer near a make-shift memorial to Brown just a few feet from where he died. 

Curfews have happened before

In recent years, authorities in Boston, New Orleans and other cities have enacted curfews as they contended with upheaval caused by hurricanes, racial tension and terrorism.

Last year, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick asked residents of Boston, Cambridge and Watertown to shutter themselves inside as police scoured the area for Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the brothers who carried out the Boston marathon bombings.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with Watertown police in April 2013. Police asked residents of all three cities to remain indoors as they searched for his brother. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was later located nearby hiding in a boat.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans was placed under a dusk-til-dawn curfew in an attempt to prevent looting and violence after the city flooded and lost power.

When Hurricane Sandy hurtled up the East Coast in 2012, several New Jersey towns also ordered curfews.

In 2001, then-Mayor Charlie Luken announced an 8 p.m. curfew in Cincinnati after rioting broke out in response to a white police officer killing an unarmed black teenager.

Many American cities, including Los Angeles, also maintain curfew laws for juveniles. But it is rare to see them strongly enforced.

Last month, the Baltimore City Council passed one of the country's strictest curfew laws, requiring children under the age of 14 to be home by 9 p.m. Children up to 16 are required to be home by 10 p.m. on school nights and 11 p.m. on weekends.

In the video, panicked screams quickly overtake the sound of police sirens, while onlookers try to piece together what they had just seen.

The Los Angeles Times has removed portions of audio from the video clip that include bad language.

Seltzer said he decided to share the video with news organizations in the hope of shedding an objective light on Brown's death, the circumstances of which have been muddied as police and protesters continue to debate the details of the shooting.

It can be comforting to know that there is — in theory, at least — someone out there monitoring customer service representatives who make life more difficult rather than less. Customer service representatives dealing with abusive customers can take comfort in this kind of monitoring, too, as it can shield them from false accusations of bad behavior. By reviewing recordings of calls gone wrong and calls gone right, meanwhile, trainees can learn from the sometimes trying experiences of others. What's not to like?

Thankfully, the stakes of customer service interactions tend to be pretty low. The same can't be said about interactions between armed police officers and civilians, which can be a matter of life and death.

The turmoil in Ferguson, Mo., vividly reminds us that while most of these interactions go smoothly, far too many spiral out of control. We know little about the exact circumstances surrounding the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. But had the police officer who shot and killed Brown been obligated to wear a video recording device, there is reason to believe that Brown still would be alive.

Over the past few years, the idea of requiring that police officers make use of so-called body cams has gained currency. Note that this is quite different from simply allowing civilians to record on-duty police officers, a right that shouldn't even be in dispute. Instead of waiting for a world in which every civilian records every encounter with the police, some students of law enforcement have argued that police forces should move in this direction.

Last fall, Guardian correspondent Rory Carroll reported on the small Southern California city of Rialto, where the local police department has affixed small body cams to all of its officers. The results were dramatic. Carroll cites a jaw-dropping study, which found that in the year following the introduction of the body cams in February 2012, public complaints fell by 88 percent — while officers' use of force fell by 60 percent.

The success of the Rialto experiment makes intuitive sense. When we know that we are being observed, we become more aware of how others might judge our behavior, so we feel a not-so-subtle pressure to act in socially acceptable, rule-following ways. Moreover, the existence of a video recording allows police officers to revisit exactly how they performed in high-pressure situations.

Our capacity to remember past events is notoriously faulty. There is a universal human tendency to fixate on some things while neglecting others. Video recordings can help correct for these deficiencies. In instances where something does go wrong — due to malice on the part of the police, a civilian or something else entirely — the video provides a record that can help investigators sort out how things really came unstuck. In politically sensitive cases, in which all sides fear getting railroaded, a black box of this kind would be a godsend.

Granted, Rialto is not a major metropolis, and some will no doubt dismiss the success of its body cam initiative as a fluke, or one not easily repeatable in a big, bustling city. Even Bill de Blasio, the New York City mayor who came to office on the strength of his opposition to heavy-handed stop-and-frisk policing, has hesitated to require that {NYPD}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/law-enforcement/new-york-city-police-department-ORGOV0000107-topic.html”> officers wear body cams, insisting that ""it's not something that has been perfected yet.""

The {American Civil Liberties Union}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/social-issues/american-civil-liberties-union-ORCIG0000034-topic.html”>, however, has endorsed the idea, giving it much-needed liberal street cred. And now the Brown shooting has led a cavalcade of commentators, mostly but not exclusively on the left, to speak out in favor of the idea. Given time, it's easy to imagine body cams becoming standard issue for police officers.

But why stop at video recording the police? While I will happily concede that video recording is particularly important for the police, in light of their ability to use deadly force, there are many public servants who have considerable power over others and who are shielded from scrutiny in the absence of video recording.

Public school teachers and administrators are the most obvious example. In March, the Justice Department issued an alarming report on racial disparities in school discipline policies. For example, while black children represent only 18 percent of all children attending preschool, 42 percent of all preschool students suspended once are black, as are 48 percent of children suspended more than once.

Video recordings could determine whether teachers are systematically biased against black students, if they are disciplining students in an entirely race-neutral way, or if the truth is somewhere in between. Investigators could identify patterns that could help inform how teachers are trained to manage their classrooms.

What's more, video recording could allow teachers to evaluate their progress, and to share their experiences with other teachers who can help them think through how to improve their performances.

Teachers unions and their allies, however, are not keen on the idea of video recording. In light of the collapsing cost of collecting this data, it's hard to understand why they'd be opposed to it, particularly if the recordings are used primarily for professional development.

If anything, video recording could help teachers beat back shrill accusations of incompetence and top-down, one-size-fits-all schemes for measuring effectiveness. Many teachers have, for good reason, resisted the concept of value-added assessments that rely heavily on standardized tests, preferring instead classroom evaluations that involve occasional visits from outside observers. Video recording every class session would give observers far more data to work with, thus giving them a fairer and more complete picture of how well a given teacher is doing day in and day out — not just a brief snapshot drawn from an hour or two.

Some readers will be offended by the idea of video recording cops and teachers. You might even invoke the specter of mass surveillance. I see things differently. Privacy is a wonderful thing, but on-duty police officers and teachers in classrooms are not private citizens living their lives as they choose. They are public servants charged with, well, serving the public.

Video recording is nothing more and nothing less than a tool for accountability. Those who use their power responsibly and who make a good-faith effort to do their jobs well have much to gain from video recording. Those who abuse their power and who otherwise cut corners will either have to shape up or answer for their actions. If you come across an argument against video recording that doesn't sound like an attempt to avoid accountability, fill me in.",3,NA,NA,NA

Citing Dr. Michael M. Baden, former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, the newspaper reported that Brown, 18, was shot twice in the head.

Four shots hit Brown in his right arm and one entered the top of his skull, the Times said, citing findings by Baden, who it said flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family's behest.

The bullets, some of which left as many as five wounds, did not appear to have been fired from very close range, the Times reported, because no gunpowder was detected on his body. That conclusion could change, however, if gunshot residue is found on Brown's clothing, the newspaper said.

Anthony Gray, an attorney for the Brown family, said the fact that one of the shots struck the top of Brown’s head was significant.

“To have a shot that’s at a 90-degree angle from the top of his skull to the bottom of his chin, almost vertical, that sounds like an officer standing over him,” Gray said.

Baden said two bullets struck Brown in the head: one in the forehead, and one at the top of the head—fired at “a right angle to the top of the head.”

“The top of the head one was the one that would have made him unconscious and fall to the ground,” Baden {told the Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-protest-curfew-20140817-story.html”>.

But it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from that, he said, without also considering witness statements and marks on Brown’s clothing. “The head is very moveable, and it can be in a number of positions,” he said.

At least one of the wounds to Brown’s arm “could have been defensive,” Baden said.

The autopsy was in addition to one performed by Missouri officials, as well as one that Attorney General {Eric Holder}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/eric-holder-PEPLT000001873-topic.html”> said the Department of Justice would perform.

A spokesman for the Ferguson police said the department had not seen a report of the autopsy and had no comment on it.

Brown was shot by white police officer Darren Wilson. The police department in the St. Louis suburb has come under strong criticism for both the death of an unarmed man and its handling of the aftermath. Unrest has gripped the area for days, including the past two nights despite a midnight curfew.

""People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day 1,"" Baden told the New York Times in an interview after performing the autopsy.

""They don't do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying.

Baden said his autopsy was not intended to determine whether the shooting was justified.

""In my capacity as the forensic examiner for the New York State Police, I would say, 'You're not supposed to shoot so many times',"" he told the New York Times. ""Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.""

Baden also said only three bullets were recovered from Brown's body, but that he had not yet seen the X-rays showing where the bullets were found which would help clarify the autopsy results.",10,NA,NA,NA
ChicagoTribune,chitri30,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/la-na-nn-ferguson-michael-brown-20140817-story.html,"Autopsy shows Michael Brown was shot six times, and twice in the head",Molly Hennessy-Fiske; Richard A. Serrano,8/18/2014,1/6/2016,"Michael Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, a preliminary private autopsy found, a Brown family attorney said Sunday night.

This mostly black St. Louis suburb has been racked by unrest since Brown was shot by a Ferguson police officer Aug. 9. More turmoil erupted hours before the midnight curfew was to take effect.

Protesters have marched every night since Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man, was killed by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. Some demonstrations have been punctuated by looting, vandalism, tear gas and rubber bullets.

On Sunday, the Brown family received a diagram from the private autopsy performed by former New York City Medical Examiner Michael M. Baden, family attorney Anthony Gray said. The diagram showed six entry wounds, including two to the head, he said.

“It raises the same questions we had before,” he said, adding, “The bullet marks on the body are consistent with the witness statements.”

One of the wounds was on top of Brown’s head, Gray said.

“To have a shot that’s at a 90-degree angle from the top of his skull to the bottom of his chin, almost vertical, that sounds like an officer standing over him,” he said.

Baden said his examination suggested that none of the six bullets was fired at point-blank range, but all were fired from at least one to two feet away.

“There’s no evidence of powder residue,” Baden said in a telephone interview with the Los Angeles Times.

Baden said two bullets struck Brown in the head: one in the forehead and one at the top of the head — fired at “a right angle to the top of the head.”

“The top of the head one was the one that would have made him unconscious and fall to the ground,” Baden said.

But it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from that, he said, without also considering witness statements and marks on Brown’s clothing. “The head is very movable, and it can be in a number of positions,” he said.

At least one of the wounds to Brown’s arm “could have been defensive,” Baden said.

The autopsy results were first reported by the New York Times.

Police say Brown had participated in a strong-arm robbery at a mini-mart shortly before his encounter with the Ferguson officer.

At least one witness who was accompanying Brown that afternoon has said Brown was shot as he walked away from the police officer with his hands raised, and then was hit with additional bullets.

Also Sunday, U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. instructed the Justice Department to have a federal medical examiner perform an autopsy on Brown, citing “extraordinary circumstances” and the family’s request. It will be the third autopsy in the case, counting the local official one.

Holder’s decision is the latest development showing that federal investigators are conducting a far different inquiry than local officials. Federal authorities are reviewing the shooting to determine whether there were any civil rights violations, while local officials said they were trying to determine whether the officer was justified in using lethal force.

More than 1,300 participants filled Greater Grace Church and spilled out the door for an afternoon rally hosted Sunday by Brown’s family, Al Sharpton’s National Action Network and the National Bar Assn.

Sharpton urged the community to take positive action, and to vote. “Don’t loot in Michael’s name,” he implored. He added, “You all got to start voting and showing up — 12% turnout is an insult to your children.”

Among those who spoke was Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson, who took charge of the police response to protests late last week at Gov. Jay Nixon’s direction.

Johnson, appearing in uniform, told the crowd that he had met Saturday with some of Brown’s relatives.

“They brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart,” Johnson said. “I wear this uniform. And I should stand up here and say I’m sorry.”

On Sunday, as protesters returned to the streets, the St. Louis County Police Department tweeted about 9:15 p.m.: “Molotov cocktails [were] being thrown at police. Tactical units on the scene. Please leave the area!”

Authorities said gunshots had been reported in the central demonstration area and warned people to clear the streets.

Protesters were marching peacefully, holding their hands in the air and chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot.”

Overnight Saturday and into Sunday, protests broke out as police sought to enforce the curfew imposed to quell unrest. An unidentified male was in critical condition after being shot.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Al Nothum said the wounded man was a protester shot by a fellow protester. The motive was unclear, he said, adding, “We don’t know if it was intentional or not.” The victim was driven to a hospital in critical condition, he said.

Seven people were arrested in connection with the Saturday clashes, all for failure to disperse, he said.

Nothum said Johnson “made it real clear that we will use any force necessary.”

Saturday was the quietest in nearly a week, with no reports of looting, Nothum said. “Last night was one of the best evenings that we had even though it was quite hectic.”

On Sunday night, some protesters were astonished at the police response.

“It’s unbelievable. This is something you would see on TV in a third-world country,” said Martin McDonald, 38, a truck driver from Florissant who had joined the crowd for the first time Sunday. “Tear gas — I’ve never seen it escalate to that point.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

 Police said they faced coordinated attacks on Sunday, including gunfire and Molotov cocktails, during protests, and defended their use of tear gas to try and quell the violence.

Hundreds of protesters fled to safety after authorities fired tear gas and canisters of smoke to disperse them hours ahead of a planned midnight curfew in the tense St. Louis suburb where Michael Brown, 18, was shot to death by a police officer on Aug. 9.

""Molotov cocktails were thrown, there were shootings, looting, vandalism, and other acts of violence that clearly appear not to have been spontaneous,"" Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson told a late night news briefing.

The ""coordinated acts"" by a few in the crowd were ""premeditated criminal acts designed ... to provoke a response,"" Johnson added.

He said the trouble began after police responded to the shooting of a civilian at around 8.25 p.m., which Johnson said.

Also Sunday night, the {New York Times reported}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=LedeSumLargeMedia&module=a-lede-package-region&region=lede-package&WT.nav=lede-package”> that a private autopsy showed that Michael Brown was shot at least 6 times by police.

Citing Dr. Michael M. Baden, former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, the newspaper reported that Brown was shot twice in the head, and that the bullets that hit him did not appear to have been fired from very close range.

The crowd of about 400 appeared to be marching peacefully Sunday but a spokesman for the Missouri Highway Patrol said ""aggressors"" had advanced on a law enforcement command post.

Police drove into the protest area in armored vehicles and shot smoke canisters at watching media representatives during a protest that had until then appeared to be peaceful.

The St. Louis County police {tweeted that Molotov cocktails}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/stlcountypd/status/501189523091361792”> were being thrown at police and that shots had been fired, urging people to leave the area.

The Los Angeles Times {reported}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-protest-curfew-20140817-story.html”> that police fired smoke canisters and tear gas at demonstrators and at cars stuck in traffic. Hundreds of people ran from the scene, covering their faces to block the tear gas.

A Ferguson native and journalism student who has been filming the demonstrations accused authorities of intimidation.

""This is once again a peaceful protest,"" said Etefia Unama, 20, who attends {Loyola}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/education/colleges-universities/loyola-university-new-orleans-OREDU0000657-topic.html”> University in New Orleans. ""They're trying to create an atmosphere of intimidation. This is martial law, a police state.""

 ""The smoke bombs were completely unprovoked,"" said Anthony Ellis, 45. ""It (the protest) was led by kids on bikes. Next you know, they're saying, 'Go home, Go home!'

However, the Missouri Highway Patrol said ""aggressors"" were trying to infiltrate a law enforcement command post and that armored vehicles were deployed to ensure public safety.

""We ordered them back. We ordered them back again. After several attempts, we utilized the smoke to disperse these individuals,"" said Missouri Highway Patrol Corporal Justin Wheetley said.

The actions took place hours before a midnight curfew imposed for the second night in the tense St. Louis suburb, site of ongoing protests as well as violence and looting since Michael Brown, 18, was shot to death on Aug. 9.

Earlier on Sunday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal autopsy of Brown's body, seeking to assure the family and community there will be a thorough investigation into a death that has sparked days of racially charged protests.

Brown was shot by white police officer Darren Wilson.

Police say Brown was asked by Wilson to move out of the road and onto a sidewalk and that Brown reached into a patrol car and struggled with Wilson for his service gun and was shot.

A friend of Brown's, Dorian Johnson, 22, and at least one other witness said Wilson reached out through his car window to grab at Brown and the teenager was trying to get away when shot. Brown held up his hands in a sign of surrender, but Wilson got out of his patrol car and shot Brown several times, they said.

CHURCH RALLY

The police department in the St. Louis suburb has come under strong criticism for Brown's death and its handling of the aftermath. The clashes in Ferguson have pitted mostly black protesters against mostly white police in a residential and retail district.

The Highway Patrol captain charged with restoring order told hundreds of people gathered at a local church for a rally on Sunday that he was committed to protecting their right to protest.

""I'm sorry,"" Captain Ron Johnson, who is black, told Brown's family during remarks that prompted repeated standing ovations at the rally. ""My heart is heavy.""

The mood at the rally was somber, as a choir sang gospel music at Greater Grace Church, civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton asked participants to join hands and prepare themselves for difficult days ahead as the results of three autopsies of Brown's body become public, and his funeral is held.

""This is a defining moment in this country,"" Sharpton told the crowd. Brown's death ""will change this town,"" he said.

In St. Louis on Sunday, about 125 people attended a rally in support of officer Darren Wilson, the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department said. Protesters held signs that read, ""We love and support you Darren"" and ""Support our police. Pray for peace.""

On Saturday, protesters were dispersed by police using canisters of smoke and later teargas after refusing to leave the area when the midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew began. Seven protesters were arrested after failing to disperse.

The smoke and teargas were ""the minimum amount of force that we could have used to get them moving,"" said Missouri State Highway Patrol spokesman Al Nothum.

Overnight Saturday, one person was shot and critically wounded. The circumstances were not clear, and the shooter was still at large, police said. Johnson said police were unable to identify the victim, who he said was not shot by police.

VIDEO CRITICIZED

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, criticized the Ferguson police department for releasing a video on Friday purporting to show Brown taking part in a convenience store robbery shortly before the shooting. Police have said the officer who shot Brown had no idea he was a robbery suspect.

""I think it had an incendiary effect,"" Nixon said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Police ""clearly are attempting to besmirch a victim of a shooting,"" he added.

At Sunday's rally at the church, some participants referred to the theft of a box of cigars as shoplifting; police had initially called it a strong-arm robbery.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson defended the release of the surveillance video over the objections of the U.S. Justice Department. Jackson said he was complying with the news media's requests for information in the case.

Mob justice is an oxymoron.

Ewings was not surprised. Months earlier, she was so worried about police stopping her 16-year-old son that she sent him to live with his father in quiet southern Missouri.

Then she learned that the man killed on Aug. 9 was her cousin, 18-year-old Michael Brown, or ""Mike-Mike,"" as everyone in the neighborhood called him.

Ewings, 46, rushed to the scene, where she found Brown's mother huddled next to the yellow police tape, staring at her son's body in the street. ""She cried until she couldn't cry anymore,"" Ewings said.

It was every mother's nightmare, but particularly here in this black neighborhood, where there is no harder or more painful task than trying to keep your son safe, Ewings said. It takes constant attention and diligence.

A young black man here is a potential target, a victim and a suspect, she said.

Ewings, a certified nurse assistant just retrained as a phlebotomist, had struggled to parent her son, facing the same challenge as Brown's mother, a grocery store clerk who lives nearby.

She knew the stakes were high. She wanted to set her son free slowly, to let him grow into being a man. But Ewings knew she had to keep him in line or he could end up dead in the street.

Ewings has three daughters, but she knew her son Daryus Watson would face distinct challenges. She tried to teach him what she figured all young black men needed to know: Stay in at night. Don't hang out, not even on the stoop. Don't engage with police. And be respectful to a fault if you get stopped.

""Just say, 'Yes sir' and let them deal with me,"" she would tell her son, warning him that it was only too easy to provoke police and get arrested.

""Don't engage with them, because they only need a reason,"" she would say.

Daryus chafed at her rules. One night when Ewings came home early from a late shift, she caught him hanging out on the stoop. Another time, she found him at a neighbor's house at 3 a.m., playing video games.

Now he lives with his father, who is helping him with his latest passion: boxing. Daryus got a summer job at a Hardee's restaurant, and is a B and C student on track to graduate. He has plans to go to technical school and become a welder. After his cousin's shooting, he returned to visit his mother, who has kept him in her sight.
.
Daryus, like Brown, does not have a criminal record — something else she counseled him to avoid.

""You've already got two strikes against you,"" she would say. ""You're black and you're a man. Don't let them give you a third strike, getting locked up.""

Ewings grew up here, attending public schools that were racially mixed. But neighborhoods remain self-segregated, she said. White parents don't live in her world, where sons must be trained to withstand police scrutiny.

""I just don't hear about them shooting a white boy to death in the middle of the street,"" she said.

Brown, who lived with his grandmother in a nearby housing complex, would stop by to see Daryus.

The two would play video games and talk about freestyle raps that Brown composed under the moniker Big'Mike and posted online — including ""Heaven,"" ""Lights Out"" and ""Body Bag.""

In one song, Brown talked about his hopes:

Everybody has their problems and their issues.

I just want to be one of them few that make it out of the hood,

come back, help my people out,

my hood and the people I grew up with.

Brown, the eldest of four children, connected with his disabled grandmother and came to stay with her in recent years, attending a local high school.

""She was working with him, keeping him focused,"" said Ewings, wearing a ""Justice for Michael Brown"" T-shirt.

At times, Brown and his grandmother clashed. He left days before the shooting to stay with friends in a neighboring apartment complex.

""I'm stayin with my home boi right now cause my peoples don't believe in me — that's sad,"" he posted on Facebook, where he went by ""Big Mike.""

But by the day of the shooting, they seemed to have reconciled. ""OK, I believe that everyone had faith in me the whole time,"" Brown posted.

One of Brown's greatest challenges was his size, at 6-foot-4 and 292 pounds, Ewings said. He was so tall his mother had to reach up to hug him. In this neighborhood, size can be a liability, turning young men into threats in the eyes of the police.

When police released surveillance video of Brown purportedly confronting a shorter, older mini-mart clerk before the shooting, grabbing a bunch of cigarillos and storming out, they called it a robbery. Ewings said if Brown had been smaller, or of a different race, the incident might be judged differently.

""Nobody's an angel,"" she said.

Ewings joined relatives and friends for a rally at Greater Grace Church on Sunday that drew more than 1,300 people.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson, who took control of the police response last week from local officers at the direction of the governor, addressed the crowd, apologizing for the often harsh treatment black men have faced from law enforcement.

""I wear this uniform. And I should stand up here and say I'm sorry,"" said Johnson, who is black.

Johnson told the audience that he too had a son at home with sagging pants, cap askew and tattoos on his arms.

He said Michael Brown was ""going to make it better for our sons,"" he promised.

Ewings burst into cheers.

""He apologized for the police,"" Ewings said. ""Somebody like him standing up there in a position of authority gives you hope.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Both incidents unfolded on an August day, with a crowd of bystanders nearby. And both involved a police patrol car stopped in a predominantly African American community. In 1965, Frye and his mother were arrested (and roughed up by officers) and an impromptu protest began. Soon South Los Angeles and Watts were being consumed by days of looting and arson in what came to be known as the Watts Riots.

The parallels between the recent events in Ferguson and previous incidents and social movements in American history are many. Throughout the 20th century, interactions between police and African Americans and other groups have led to public protest and violence. This article lists just a small sampling of the vast literature on the subject.

“Riot and Remembrance: America's Worst Race Riot and Its Legacy,” by James Hirsch is one of several recent books detailing the long-forgotten history of the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, in which armed white residents torched black neighborhoods in the Oklahoma metropolis. The event began with the arrest of a black man following an encounter with a white woman in a downtown Tulsa elevator; to forestall his lynching by a white mob, a group of armed black men (including many {World War I}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/wars-interventions/world-war-i-%281914-1918%29-EVHST00000109-topic.html”> veterans) arrived at the courthouse where he was being held. The sight of armed African Americans (in a state with Jim Crow laws) led to what amounted to a white pogrom against Tulsa’s black community.

The Tulsa tragedy is also recounted in Tim Madigan’s “The Burning: Massacre, Destruction, and the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.” Online, readers can peruse {the report}<hyperlink=”http://www.okhistory.org/research/forms/freport.pdf”> issued by an Oklahoma state commission in 2001. 

Two decades after Tulsa, race {riots}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/riots/los-angeles-riots-%281992%29-EVCAL00021-topic.html”> swept through Los Angeles -- the so-called Zoot Suit riots of 1943 in which groups of mostly white servicemen beat up Latino youths. The California writer Carey McWilliams witnessed the violence, which also targeted black youths, and wrote about it in his ground-breaking 1949 work, “North from Mexico.” In a much more recent book, the historian Edward J. Escobar sees the Zoot Suit riots in the context of the many violent encounters with whites and police that helped forge the Mexican American community in Southern California in the first half of the 20th century. {His book}<hyperlink=”http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520213357”> “Race, Police, and the Making of a Political Identity: Mexican Americans and the {Los Angeles Police Department}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/law-enforcement/los-angeles-police-department-ORGOV000939-topic.html”>, 1900-1945,” is published by the University of California Press.

“Fire This Time: The Watts Uprising and the 1960s” by Gerald Horne is a detailed account of the events leading to the looting and arson that swept through South Los Angeles in 1965. In fiction, Walter Mosley’s 2004 novel “Little Scarlett,” is set in the community during the Watts riots. In an {interview with NPR}<hyperlink=”http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3410079”>, Mosley recalled living in Los Angeles in the 1960s. African Americans were so angry at being marginalized (and of being the targets of police abuse) that even Mosely’s conservative, law-abiding father said he wanted to take a rifle and a Molotov cocktail and join the rioters (though he did not). “I wanna go out there and fight,” his father told him.

Almost four decades after Watts, Los Angeles erupted again, after the videotaped beating of {Rodney King}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/rodney-king-PEOCVC000206-topic.html”> by LAPD officers in a San Fernando Valley traffic stop.

Most troubling was the release of internal police text messages (sent from terminals in police cars) in which officers bragged of beatings suspects. ""Capture him, beat him and treat him like dirt…,"" one officer wrote.

The frustrations of African Americans in 1990s Los Angeles were also stoked by a second incident: the shooting of an unarmed 15-year-old girl in a South Los Angeles liquor store. The case is detailed {in a 2013 book}<hyperlink=”http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/04/entertainment/la-ca-jc-brenda-stevenson-20130804”>, by the UCLA historian Brenda Stevenson, “The Contested Murder of Latasha Harlins: Justice, Gender and the Origins of the L.A. Riots.”

Of the riot itself, and the enormous psychic toll it took on Los Angeles, there are few books more moving than “Twilight: Los Angeles 1992,” which is based on Anna Deavere Smith’s one-woman play of the same name. (I was a dramaturge on the original, 1993 production at the Mark Taper Forum.) For me the highlight of Smith’s opus was then, as now, the soliloquy spoken by former gang member Twilight Bey. Riffing on the origins of his nickname and his sense of identity as a young black man, Bey says: “Twilight is that time of day between day and night…I call it limbo…So sometimes I feel as though I’m stuck in limbo, the way the sun is stuck between night and day in the twilight hours.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

A {Pew Research Center poll}<hyperlink=”http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/”> found that 80 percent of black Americans say the case ""raises important issues about race"" -- but only 37 percent of whites agree. A plurality of whites, in fact, thinks ""race is getting more attention than it deserves."" 

It would be easier to address the case as a simple matter of a teenager who got into a confrontation with a cop that left him dead. But it hardly seems coincidental to blacks that the young man was black and the officer white. That juxtaposition evokes a long history of white cops (and sometimes black cops) abusing black males.

Whites can generally factor out race in their dealings with law enforcement. So they may have trouble understanding how being black changes one's perspective. A reader wrote me to complain that the only people who inject race into these matters are the ""old media.""

Of course the new media, such as Twitter, have been preoccupied with that angle too. But the people who first raised the race issue in Ferguson were the black residents who were aghast at Brown's shooting. Black teens generally do not see society as nonchalantly colorblind in its perceptions of them. 

I understand the reluctance of many whites to dig into the racial roots of controversies like this, because, being white, I share it. Race complicates issues and raises all sorts of problems that continue to bedevil American society. It makes whites feel implicated in ways they can't escape. But ignoring it when it matters, as it does in Ferguson, is no solution.",46,NA,NA,NA
ChicagoTribune,chitri36,http://www.chicagotribune.com/test/la-na-obama-ferguson-20140819-story.html,President Obama chooses his words carefully on Michael Brown,Christi Parsons and Kathleen Hennessey,8/18/2014,1/6/2016,"As they watched police in military gear spread tear gas in a St. Louis suburb in recent days, {White House}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/white-house-PLCUL000110-topic.html”> aides knew President Obama would be expected to weigh in on race.

But rather than bold words, Obama's reaction in this case has been shaped by an acute awareness of self-imposed limits.

White House officials argued that in a nation polarized on racial issues — and deeply split about the president — strong language from Obama about the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown and the protests and looting in Ferguson, Mo., would risk worsening the problem rather than making it better.

""His words can't heal things overnight — centuries of racial history and decades of economic unwinding take time to repair. But if his words are careless, they can inflame the situation, and he knows that,"" said one senior aide, speaking anonymously to discuss the president's thinking.

As a result, Obama has not offered another ""{Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/trayvon-martin-PEOCVC000188-topic.html”> moment"" of empathy with a young black man who some people believe was the victim of racial prejudice.

Instead, in a brief news conference at the White House on Monday, Obama offered carefully balanced statements about the need to ensure the rights of peaceful protest, but also to combat criminal behavior.

""We've got to make sure that we are able to distinguish between peaceful protesters who may have some legitimate grievances and maybe long-standing grievances, and those who are using this tragic death as an excuse to engage in criminal behavior,"" he said.

The closest Obama came to personal reflection was when he talked about sending in federal investigators and defended his decision not to go to Ferguson himself.

""I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed because ... the DOJ works for me,"" Obama said, referring to the Justice Department. ""When they're conducting an investigation, I've got to make sure that I don't look like I'm putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other.""

The White House reaction has been shaped less by the Martin case than by another racially charged incident from early in his presidency — the firing of Shirley Sherrod — that many Americans have probably forgotten.

Administration officials forced Sherrod, a black Agriculture Department official, to resign in 2010 after she was accused — falsely, as it turned out — of making anti-white comments. White House aides pushed to quickly remove her in a botched attempt to get ahead of a media controversy.

When they're conducting an investigation, I've got to make sure that I don't look like I'm putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other.
- President Obama, on speaking out on the Michael Brown case
Sherrod's story has become a cautionary tale in the White House about the dangers of reacting too quickly to a racially charged situation.

White House officials say the president has, over time, become mindful of getting caught up in the swirl of a media storm — even those that carry personal resonance.

Some of his political allies endorse the reticence.

""He really has said as much as probably he should,"" said Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Rep. {Marcia L. Fudge}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/marcia-l.-fudge-PEPLT007832-topic.html”> (D-Ohio). ""I know there are a lot of people who want him to be much stronger, but the reality is, we really live in two Americas.""

Rather than using the president's personal story to address the unrest in Ferguson, aides worked back channels to communicate with the African American community. The president received regular briefings from Atty. Gen. {Eric H. Holder Jr.}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/eric-holder-PEPLT000001873-topic.html”>, and Obama announced Monday that he was sending Holder to Ferguson on Wednesday.

Obama has won strong marks from civil rights leaders for the Justice Department's investigation and the rare decision to conduct a separate autopsy. Those moves sent strong signals that the administration would not be leaving the case to local authorities, said {NAACP}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/social-issues/racism/naacp-ORNPR000027-topic.html”> President Cornell William Brooks.

Given the unrest in Ferguson, Obama has had to be more cautious so as not to inflame tension, Brooks said.

""But his actions speak volumes,"" Brooks said. ""The prose of his conduct and decisions outweigh the poetry of any press release.""

Although Obama is reluctant to dive into racial controversies, in his second term he has shown a willingness to speak at length and in personal terms about his experience with prejudice. He has given more attention to programs targeting young black men, and he has spoken more bluntly about the gun violence and economic inequality that disproportionately affect black communities.

That was notably true in the Martin case, in which Obama called a small team to his office a few days after {George Zimmerman}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/george-zimmerman-PECLB0000014809-topic.html”> was acquitted of shooting Martin and said it was time for him to address the nation.

""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" he said, in what became the headline quote from his remarks.

Obama also crafted Monday's much less emotional comments mostly without the help of his speechwriting staff, officials said.

""I've said this before, in too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,"" Obama said. ""In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear.""

But before the Martin remarks, there were mistakes, White House aides acknowledge.

Five years after it happened, advisors this week were still thinking about the swift, harsh reaction that followed Obama's off-the-cuff remarks about the arrest of black scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. in 2009. Although Obama's remarks were wide-ranging, what lingered was his quote that police had ""acted stupidly.""

His attempt to make up for the stumble with the awkward and gimmicky White House ""beer summit"" with Vice President {Joe Biden}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/joe-biden-PEPLT007548-topic.html”>, Gates and the officer who made the arrest was not a high point in race — or public — relations.

""Go back to the beer summit. Go back to the comment that he made about Trayvon. How much grief did he take for that?"" Fudge said. ""At some point you say, 'I don't want to be the person who divides this nation. I want to bring us together. That is what the role of the president is.'""

Just as prominent in his mind as Martin, one advisor said, is the memory of Sherrod, who was pushed from her job over supposedly anti-white remarks she made to a black audience.

After listening to her full speech, however, administration officials decided Sherrod's words had been taken out of context and misrepresented by conservative critics. The administration apologized to her for the firing and offered her a new position. That experience warned them against getting disoriented by the media storm itself.

Obama has made it known that he wants to be ""open and clear about his feelings on the subject"" when he speaks publicly about Ferguson, but that he didn't want to prejudice the situation, senior advisor Valerie Jarrett said.

Like the rest of the president's staff, she said, she's trying to follow his lead in not giving in to a ""gut reaction"" to the events surrounding Brown's death in Ferguson.

""I have to have a reaction based on the facts,"" Jarrett said. ""We all do.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Nixon, who had declared a state of emergency for the town on Saturday and ordered that the streets be cleared for a curfew that ran from midnight to 5 a.m., said the National Guard would fall under the supervision of the Missouri Highway Patrol.

The deployment of the National Guard is the latest in a series of steps taken by authorities to end the looting and burning of stores that have punctuated protests since the shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, more than a week ago.

But retired local business owner Marshall Tucker said: ""It ain't getting no better with the National Guard coming in. That'll be worse,"" he said. ""Tonight it's going to get really sticky.""

As daylight was coming to an end on Monday, police with plastic handcuffs took positions and tried to clear a main thoroughfare where protests have taken place at night, directing crowds into designated protest areas.

Video from the scene showed one journalist, with cameras slung around his neck and his hands bound behind him, being led off by police. He was identified by colleagues as Getty photographer Scott Olson.

President Barack Obama said he told the governor that the National Guard use should be limited and urged healing instead of violence. Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Ferguson on Wednesday, Obama added.

""While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos. It undermines rather than advancing justice,"" Obama told a news conference.

The president met with Holder on Monday to discuss the unrest. Holder said more than 40 FBI agents were canvassing Ferguson neighborhoods in an investigation that included federal and local officials.

""Moreover, at my direction, an additional medical examination is being performed on the body of Michael Brown,"" Holder said. Results of official autopsies by federal authorities and the county are pending.

An autopsy conducted on behalf of Brown's family showed he was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. The path of one bullet indicates the 18-year-old may have been lowering his head in surrender when the fatal shot hit, according to Brown family attorney Daryl Parks.

Parks told a news conference one bullet hit Brown in the very top of his head and another shattered his right eye.

""His head was in a downward position,"" Parks said. ""Given those kind of facts, this officer should have been arrested,"" Parks said.

There were no signs of struggle with the officer and no gunshot residue on the body.

According to police, the officer involved in the shooting said he fired initially after Brown reached into his police car.

NIGHTLY PROTESTS

Darren Wilson, 28, the officer who shot Brown as the teenager was walking through a Ferguson residential neighborhood on Aug. 9 with a friend, was put on paid administrative leave and is in hiding.

Edward Magee, a spokesman for the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office, said the case could be presented this week to a grand jury, which will decide whether Wilson will be indicted.

The National Bar Association, the country’s largest network of black attorneys and judges, filed a lawsuit on Monday against the city of Ferguson and its police department over evidence related to Brown’s shooting.

The suit asks the department to preserve all videos, photographs, police logs and investigative reports about the shooting, as well as arrest reports for protesters who were detained in the days and nights that followed.

The shooting set off protests in Ferguson, whose population of about 21,000 is mostly black. Thousands of demonstrators, angry that the police officer was not arrested, have filled the streets.

The protests have been marred by rioting and looting, leaving some stores badly damaged, as well as attacks against police with Molotov cocktails, officials said

Law enforcement officials have been widely criticized for using excessive force. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged U.S. authorities to protect protesters' rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.

According to accounts by local police, Brown and a friend were walking down a road when Wilson asked them to move onto the sidewalk. Wilson reported that Brown reached into his patrol car and struggled for his service gun when the officer fired the initial shot.

Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, 22, said Wilson had reached out through his car window to grab at Brown and the teenager was trying to get away when he was shot. Johnson said Brown held up his hands to surrender but that Wilson got out of his patrol car and shot him several more times.",432,NA,NA,NA

The ideal self-help book for Americans at this precise moment in time would be titled: ""It's OK to Shut Up: A Guide to Keeping Quiet in the Age of Social Media.""

And that book would contain just one sentence: ""Just because you have Twitter and Facebook accounts doesn't mean you have to use them.""

Silence is no longer golden. It is, at best, discarded tinfoil, devalued by our ability — and our irrepressible need — to broadcast every thought, regardless of whether that thought is kind, ill-intentioned, fully formed or in any way factual.

Consider the tragic shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Soon after the unarmed 18-year-old was gunned down by a police officer, the news exploded on Twitter and Facebook, a justified outpouring of sadness and anger.

But just as quickly, people were leaping to conclusions, both about Brown himself and about the officer who shot him. Facts were in short supply, thanks to the apparent incompetence of the Ferguson police, but that didn't stop a soul from theorizing and filling in the blanks with assumptions.

In the week that followed, both the media — always in a reckless rush now to be first — and social media users continued to wildly speculate.

When the Ferguson police finally released the name of the officer who shot Brown — Darren Wilson — thousands tweeted that he must be black. I've never met a white person named ""Darren Wilson,"" the masses cawed.

Some mocked that the racial component of the story — white cop shoots unarmed black teen — had been knocked down. Others suggested that the Ferguson police were trying to pin the shooting on a black officer.

It was a sharknado of reckless, useless and inflammatory noninformation, all of which turned out to be wrong when it was revealed that Wilson is, in fact, a white officer.

And the cavalier dispensing of blah-blah continues. On Sunday night, {MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/business/media-industry/msnbc-%28tv-network%29-ORCRP0000017172-topic.html”> host Chris Hayes, on the scene in Ferguson, {tweeted}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/501222222598774784”>: ""I'm looking at what appears to be a dead body in the middle of Chambers.""

More than 12 hours later, {Hayes clarified}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/501426859700416514”> that the person he saw was actually a crash victim — and was not dead. But hey, if it looks like a dead body, you've got to go ahead and tweet about it — that's what this Twitter thing is for, right?

Wrong. We need to find a way to put the brakes on our incessant babbling. How many times do we see public officials or celebrities say or tweet something stupid, then walk it back moments later? There's a rush to communicate without thinking, to stake our claim to an idea — right or wrong — that will be the first of its kind in the Internet slurry.

There's a great passage from Douglas Adams' comedic novel ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" A human-looking alien who has lived on Earth for some time recounts his theory on why humans talk so much: ""If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favor of a new one. If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working.""

That was written long before social media, but it applies nicely to the present day. If we don't tweet, our Twitter will stop working. If we don't type something on Facebook, our fingers might fall off.

It seems we could all use a reminder that it's OK to say nothing at all. So I went in search of inspiration, perhaps a patron saint of ""keeping it to yourself.""

Turns out the ancient Greeks had Harpocrates, the god of silence, represented by a boy with his finger pressed to his lips.

Catholics have St. John of Nepomuk, the patron saint of silence. (He's also the patron saint of flooding, which makes for kind of a nice twofer if you're trying to keep a tsunami under wraps.)

Legend has it that the king of Bohemia had John drowned in 1393 because he refused to divulge the confessional secrets of the queen, whom the king suspected of being unfaithful. The accuracy of that account has been brought into question, which seems ironically appropriate.

But rather than rely on some old saint or cherubic Greek god, I prefer to go with something fresh. Allow me to present: St. Trapshut of Waitington, the nondenominational patron saint of thinking before you communicate.

St. Trapshut is portrayed in both male and female form, always with a mildly disappointed facial expression and a hand tucking a smartphone into a purse or hip pocket. Trapshut was imaginarily canonized (by me) after refusing to tweet out a particularly juicy but wholly unsubstantiated nugget of gossip, then dying from the empty feeling of being left out of the zeitgeist.

I'm sure St. Trapshut medallions, iPhone cases, bracelet charms and prayer cards will soon be available. But all you need to remember is this: Before you tweet, post to Facebook or say something into a television camera, think of how St. Trapshut sacrificed his (or her) life by holding back.

And then quietly, ever so quietly, walk away. And notice how good it can feel to say nothing.",4,NA,NA,NA

Some of what you've heard is correct, and chilling.

Trouble is, we don't yet know enough of what occurred Aug. 9 in that St. Louis suburb to adequately separate fact from rapidly widespread fiction. Nor do we know enough to pass judgment on Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot him, or on others who were directly involved in this volatile episode.

In a better world, all of us who want justice done would be pressing for hard facts, evaluating eyewitness and official accounts — and suspending judgment until we know as much as we can. But that clearheaded methodology demands more patience, more suppression of preconceived notions, than we can muster. The human mind craves a plotline that pulls dots of information into a mosaic — a plotline that brings comforting order to troubling ambiguity.

Fortunately, the eventual disclosure of facts often mocks these declarations. We'd bet that within days, weeks, months, we'll all learn facts that disprove some of the facile judgments now passing for knowledgeable commentary about this case. One example of how time can bring clarity:

We were struck early on by the fast framing of this story. Those accounts had Brown, hands raised as if in surrender, being shot in the back. Reports Monday said the two autopsies performed to date have all of the bullets striking from the front. Was Brown surrendering to Wilson? Charging Wilson? Something else?

The answer could hardly be more crucial. Yet all we can say for certain is that this early framing of Brown's death as a street execution has played a powerful role in forming Americans' attitudes.

Actually, we can say something else for certain: Some opportunists are busy hijacking Ferguson. Our list includes looters and others who've thrown Molotov cocktails and fired guns — violent acts that undermined the admirable and restrained calls for peace and justice that protesters, church congregations and many residents of Ferguson have requested of us all.

Whenever Ferguson does again have a sense of peace and justice, there's a debate to be had over what's being called the militarization of U.S. police departments in the dozen years since 9/11. Chilling photographs of officers uniformed in camouflage and pointing rifles at people in Ferguson has energized the broader liberal and libertarian argument that police agencies have too much firepower. To which conservatives are retorting: When an emergency erupts, police have to be prepared for whatever happens next; they can't let crowds destroy businesses and then plead that they didn't expect a protest to turn violent. Our own view is that it's wise for authorities to have the equipment that allows them to restore order; the question here is whether — at the moment the equipment was deployed — that was a reasonable response to the evident threat.

Determining reasonable responses, of course, requires that all of us work from reliable information. That's been difficult. With each night's outbursts in Ferguson, Twitter and other social media streams have brought events on the streets to the screens of followers everywhere. If you cannot get enough, then you see this chiefly as a wonderful new means of instant communication. If, though, you want confirmed facts and context so you can assess public policy, then you see this surge of social media as a scale on which immediacy and accuracy are never quite balanced. Ask the Huffington Post reporter who, in one heated moment, distributed a photo of what he thought were rubber bullets, but which turned out to be ... earplugs. (The reporter's subsequent apology couldn't fully repair his credibility.)

The opaque nature of this tragic death invited mistakes and misstatements: Other than Michael Brown and Darren Wilson, few if any other individuals knew exactly what was happening; most of what we've all heard comes from people who weren't there and are relaying accounts that are, at best, secondhand.

The flip side of what's hard to assess — that is, what occurred between an officer and a young man when few people were around — was the first official response to the ensuing rioting: an increasingly intimidating police presence, unleavened by an explanation of what authorities already knew about the incident. The police would say their first priority was to protect Ferguson; more transparency might well have defused anger in the streets.

Much as all of us would like to have every answer today, the people of Missouri have a criminal justice system that will try to sort out what occurred in Ferguson on Aug. 9. Our system offers no guarantee that it will uncover the full truth or yield perfect justice. But it's our best hope for both.",10,NA,NA,No author

Missouri's governor had lifted a curfew for the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on Monday as National Guard troops were called out.

The National Guard deployment was the latest step by authorities to end the looting and burning of stores that have punctuated protests and stirred questions about race relations in the United States since the shooting death of Brown.

Governor Jay Nixon, who had declared a state of emergency for the town on Saturday and ordered the streets cleared for a curfew that ran from midnight to 5 a.m., said the National Guard would fall under the supervision of the Missouri Highway Patrol.

National Guard troops could be seen walking on the fringes of the gathering, keeping a distance from protesters.

President Barack Obama said he told the governor the use of the National Guard should be limited, and urged healing, instead of violence. Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Ferguson on Wednesday, Obama said.

Protesters would not be allowed to congregate on the streets on Monday, the Missouri State Police captain in charge of the scene had told reporters earlier in the day.

""We're going to stage them in this parking lot,"" Johnson said. ""We are going to contain the criminal element.""

The Federal Aviation Administration said it had renewed a ban on low-flying civilian aircraft over Ferguson to help law enforcement authorities do their job.

Important matters like games and championships can turn on whether umpires get it right. So why haven't police throughout the country made a priority of putting video to work in their jobs? The stakes, after all, are much higher: even life and death.

The fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by Office Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo., is a classic example of how vital such recordings can be. The police say Brown attacked Wilson and tried to grab his service pistol and was shot in the ensuing struggle. Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown, said Wilson attacked his friend, shot him in the chest and, when Brown tried to flee, shot him in the back.

An autopsy revealed six wounds — none in Brown's back, though one assistant in the autopsy said a shot in Brown's arm might have come from behind. The autopsy showed no evidence of a struggle. Tests on Brown's clothing should reveal whether he was shot at close range. But all this is an attempt to reconstruct an event from memory and remnants. It would be far easier to establish what happened had Officer Wilson been equipped with a video device that recorded the encounter.

When the California city of Rialto adopted gadgets that could be attached to an officer's sunglasses or collar, it found that complaints against cops plunged by 88 percent and police use of force fell by 59 percent. Chief William Farrar told The New York Times, ""When you put a camera on a police officer, they tend to behave a little better, follow the rules a little better. And if a citizen knows the officer is wearing a camera, chances are the citizen will behave a little better.""

Some police and citizens, of course, behave badly anyway. In those cases, the footage makes it far easier to establish fault and punish the wrongdoer.

The devices aren't cheap. Those in use in Rialto cost about $900 apiece. {Taser International}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/business/taser-international-incorporated-ORCRP014899-topic.html”> has a model advertised for $399. For New York, the cost of equipping all officers could be up to $31 million.

But as the Public Advocate of New York noted in a report, the city paid $152 million in compensation for alleged police misconduct. The cameras would ""reduce the money the city spends on lawsuits resulting from police misconduct,"" it concluded.

The {Better Government Association}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/better-government-association-ORCIG000018-topic.html”> has calculated that Chicago spent $521 million over the last decade in settlements, judgments and legal fees stemming from police misconduct cases.

Rules are needed to make sure citizen privacy is protected, while assuring that unscrupulous cops can't alter or delete unflattering images. But those requirements shouldn't be hard to meet.

Had these devices been in use in Ferguson, they could have saved everyone a lot of trouble and confusion trying to figure out exactly what happened that led to the death of Michael Brown. They might even have served to keep him alive.",3,NA,NA,No author

The violence has captured headlines around the world, raising questions about the state of U.S. race relations nearly six years after Americans elected their first black president.

Law enforcement has made various efforts to soothe angry demonstrators, but police said they had come under heavy gunfire overnight and arrested 31 people despite the deployment of Missouri National Guard troops and the lifting of a curfew to allow protesters to have more freedom to demonstrate.

""We overpoliced for a few days, and then we completely underpoliced,"" U.S. Senator {Claire McCaskill}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/claire-mccaskill-PEPLT007895-topic.html”>, a Missouri Democrat who was traveling to Ferguson on Tuesday, told cable channel {MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/business/media-industry/msnbc-%28tv-network%29-ORCRP0000017172-topic.html”>.

She said she was working with local leaders on ways to quell the violence. Possible methods include screening for weapons and moving protest areas away from the business district to open green spaces.

Both she and U.S. Representative {Emanuel Cleaver}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/emanuel-cleaver-PEPLT007795-topic.html”>, another Missouri Democrat, said calm was needed to allow federal investigators to evaluate the evidence.

""What's happening now is damaging, or interfering, with what needs to be done,"" Cleaver told MSNBC.

On Monday, President Barack Obama said he told Missouri Governor {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html”> that use of the National Guard should be limited, and he also called for conciliation. Attorney General {Eric Holder}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/eric-holder-PEPLT000001873-topic.html”> plans to visit Ferguson on Wednesday.

Ferguson, a community of roughly 21,000 mostly black residents just outside St. Louis, has a long history of racial tension. Blacks have complained of police harassment and under-representation in city leadership.

Tension boiled over 10 days ago after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead while walking with a friend down a residential street on the afternoon of Aug. 9.

The police refused to immediately release the name of the officer who killed Brown. They later identified him as 28-year-old Darren Wilson but and still have not provided details about why he fired multiple rounds at Brown.

Both the {U.S. Department of Justice}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/crime-law-justice/u.s.-department-of-justice-ORGOV0000160-topic.html”> and the St. Louis County Police Department are investigating the shooting. The county prosecutor's office said it could start presenting evidence to a grand jury Wednesday to determine if Wilson will be indicted.

Since the killing, thousands of protesters have taken over the site of the shooting and the nearby business district each night, chanting anti-police slogans and carrying signs calling for Wilson's arrest.

Some journalists covering the confrontations have been hit by tear gas and arrested.

On Tuesday, the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, an intergovernmental security and human rights organization whose members include 57 countries including the United States and Canada, criticized the treatment of the journalists.

'HEAVY GUNFIRE'

On Monday night, officials had hoped that the lifting of a curfew imposed over the weekend would cool tensions and end the looting and violence. Police also closed a roadway to traffic to provide a path for marchers.

But police said some in the crowd hurled bottles, rocks and petrol bombs at officers, who responded by firing gas-filled canisters and a noise cannon to try to disperse the throng.

State Highway Patrol Captain {Ron Johnson}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/ron-johnson-PEPLT007868-topic.html”>, who is overseeing security in Ferguson, said officers had come under ""heavy gunfire"" but did not return it. Riot police did confiscate two guns and what looked like a petrol bomb from protesters.

Four officers were injured, he said.

Johnson separately told CNN that two people were shot within the crowd, but not by police, and were taken to hospital. There was no immediate word on their condition.

""This has to stop,"" said Johnson, an African-American who grew up in the area. ""I don't want anybody to get hurt. We have to find a way to stop this.""

The suspect was acting erratically and refused to put down the weapon, according to authorities. Police Chief Sam Dotson said {via Twitter}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/ChiefSLMPD”> that an officer gave verbal commands, and both officers ""feared for their safety"" before firing their weapons. 

At a news conference, Dotson said the suspect held a knife overhead in ""a threatening manner"" as he approached at least two officers.

It was not clear how many shots were fired, and Dotson did not disclose the race of the man who was shot or of the officers. Both officers opened fire, and no one else was injured, Dotson said.

The incident unfolded in the shadow of Ferguson, where police and civilians have clashed since Aug. 9, when a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed young black man who witnesses have said had his hands up when he was gunned down.

As Dotson spoke, shouts could be heard off-camera, and reporters repeatedly asked the chief if he feared similar unrest in St. Louis. City Alderman Antonio French, who has been heavily involved in the protests in Ferguson, said on Twitter that a crowd was already forming at the scene of Tuesday's shooting.

At one point Dotson was asked if he thought Missouri Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html”> should consider deploying the National Guard in the city.

“I think this is an incident that happened in the city of St. Louis,"" Dotson said.

At least one witness to the incident told police that the suspect may have been intentionally trying to provoke the police into shooting him. Dotson said the man was acting erratically before the shooting occurred.

""Shoot me, kill me now,"" the man said, according to Dotson.

Both officers have been placed on administrative leave and Dotson said he would try to make information available as quickly as possible. Based on the preliminary facts, though, Dotson seemed to suggest the officer's actions were justified.

“If a person is charging you with a knife and they’re within three or four feet, that’s a lethal range for a knife,"" he said.

The man's identity was not released, but Dotson described him as a 23-year-old male.

Funeral services are planned on Monday for an unarmed black teenager whose fatal shooting by a white policeman in Missouri has ignited more than a week of racially charged clashes in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.

The violence has captured international headlines, raising questions about the state of U.S. race relations nearly six years after Americans elected their first black president.

As lawyers for the family of Michael Brown, 18, announced plans on Tuesday for his funeral, U.S. lawmakers called for calm and a change in police tactics that have so far failed to soothe angry demonstrators.

Police said they came under gunfire again overnight and made dozens of arrests despite the deployment of Missouri National Guard troops and the lifting of a curfew to allow protesters more freedom to demonstrate.

There were at least 57 arrests on Monday night and into Tuesday, most on a charge of failure to disperse, according to the St. Louis County Justice Services Center. It said 15 of those arrested were from outside Missouri.

""The people who are rioting and looting are not the people who live in this area. They come down here and they wait for the action to start,"" said Arlando Travis, 38, owner of a local landscaping business.

""We overpoliced for a few days, and then we completely underpoliced,"" U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who was traveling to Ferguson on Tuesday, told cable channel MSNBC.

She said she was working with local leaders on new methods, such as screening for weapons and moving protest areas away from the business district to open green spaces.

President Barack Obama said on Monday he told Missouri Governor Jay Nixon that use of the National Guard should be limited, and he also called for conciliation. Attorney General Eric Holder plans to visit Ferguson on Wednesday.

Ferguson, a mostly black community of about 21,000 residents just outside St. Louis, has a history of racial tension. Blacks have long complained of police harassment and under-representation in city leadership.

In a separate incident just miles (km) from the protests, a 23-year-old black man holding a knife was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, police told a news conference. They said two officers opened fire after the man ignored repeated calls to drop his weapon.

SIMMERING DIVISIONS

Public reaction to the police response in Ferguson was mixed nationally, showing divisions along color and political lines, according to a Reuters/IPSOS poll released on Tuesday.

""There's certainly not universal support on this particular issue - there's a lot of divisiveness,"" said IPSOS pollster Julia Clark.

The online poll of 976 U.S. adults conducted from Friday to Monday showed a clear majority agreed the racial makeup of a police force should reflect the local community, and 78 percent said citizens should be able to record police making arrests and carrying out other duties.

Tension boiled over 10 days ago after Brown was shot and killed while walking with a friend down a residential street on the afternoon of Aug. 9.

The police refused to immediately release the name of the officer who killed Brown. They later identified him as 28-year-old Darren Wilson but have not provided details about why he fired multiple rounds at Brown.

Wilson has yet to make a public statement, but investigators said he has been cooperative in interviews with detectives.

The U.S. Department of Justice and the St. Louis County Police Department are both investigating the shooting. The county prosecutor's office said it could start presenting evidence to a grand jury on Wednesday to determine if Wilson will be indicted.

Since the killing, thousands of protesters have taken over the site of the shooting and the nearby business district each night, chanting anti-police slogans and carrying signs calling for Wilson's arrest.

Some journalists covering the confrontations have been hit by tear gas and arrested.

On Tuesday, the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, an intergovernmental security and human rights organization whose members include 57 countries including the United States and Canada, criticized the treatment of the journalists.

On Monday night, some in the crowd hurled bottles, rocks and petrol bombs at officers, who responded by firing gas-filled canisters and a noise cannon to try to disperse the throng.

State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who was named to oversee security in Ferguson last week after the tactics of local police leadership were questioned, said officers had come under ""heavy gunfire"" but did not return it. Riot police confiscated two guns and what looked like a petrol bomb from protesters.

Four officers were injured, he said.

Johnson separately told CNN that two people were shot within the crowd, but not by police, and were taken to the hospital. There was no immediate word on their condition.

""This has to stop,"" said Johnson, an African-American who grew up in the area. ""I don't want anybody to get hurt.""

Area schools remained closed on Tuesday due to the unrest.

The disturbances are the worst since the angry but peaceful protests across the United States in July 2013 over the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic who killed unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin during a scuffle in Florida.
