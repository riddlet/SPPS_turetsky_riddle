CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST (voice-over): Tonight, we are ALL IN.

A no-fly zone over Ferguson, Missouri, a day after the media reportedly ordered by police to leave the scene of protest. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I need justice for my son. 

HAYES: A community wants answers, including the name of the officer at the center of it all. 

Plus, death on the racetrack. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tony Stewart just hit that guy. 

HAYES: What's next for one of NASCAR's biggest stars after he struck
and killed a fellow driver. 

And the world mourns the loss of a brilliant mind. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He was such a generous soul. 

HAYES: Tonight, we remember actor Robin Williams. 

ROBIN WILLIAMS, ACTOR: Boys, you must strive to find your own voice. 

HAYES: ALL IN starts right now.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HAYES: Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. 

Three days after the police shooting death of an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, this image is front and center and one of many we're seeing out of Ferguson, Missouri, of the continuing and escalating tension between community members and local police in the wake of death of 18-year-old Michael Brown at the hands of local police. 

Last night, after we were off air, protesters took to the streets once again in a largely nonviolent show of their frustration and desire for answers. 

""St. Louis Post Dispatch"" posted this video showing police using tear gas. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

POLICE: This is the St. Louis Police Department. Please return to your home. 

PROTESTERS: No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! 

You go home. We live here! 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Police said shots were fired at a police vehicle as it circled a Walmart parking lot and that numerous police cars sustained damage. At times scenes appeared to descend into chaos. 

(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)

HAYES: ""The River Front Times"" posted this video of what appears people protesting from their own yards, already standing behind fence as police instructed them to go to their homes and tear gas is fired. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is my property. This is my property. 

(INAUDIBLE)

(EXPLETIVE DELETED)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: That scene was explained by multiple written reports, including this one from the ""Huffington Post."" Quote, ""Richie West, 24, and a handful of friends and family members were watching from his backyard. They decided to protest, still on his property, shouting with their hands in the air, 'you go home, you go home'.""

Police told them to disperse and fired tear gas at them. West continued to shout, ""This is my backyard,"" and police fired again.

The police presence was felt by reporters as well. Wesley Lowery of ""The Washington Post"" tweeting just after midnight, ""Eventually officerscharged again. Handful reporters, photogs, threatening if we didn't move, your last warning, you're putting your lives at risk.""

The relationship between the police of Ferguson, residents of Ferguson seems to be getting worse by the today. 

Today, there was yet another protest outside of the office of St. Louis County prosecuting attorney Bob McCulloch. This one appeared to go forward without incident. 

Meanwhile, today, police of Ferguson, Missouri, said they are delaying the release of the name of the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown out of concerns for the officer's safety. 

Also today, the FAA issued a temporary no-fly zone extending to 3,000 feet over the Ferguson area. Officer Brian Shelman (ph) of the St. Louis County police department saying it was requested because on Sunday night, a police helicopter came under fire, of course, the no-fly zone also means news helicopters cannot hover overhead. 

Finally, the man who says he was the key witness in the case, the person who says he was walking with Michael Brown when this altercation arose, Dorian Johnson, as of last night when we interviewed him on this show, two days after the shooting said he had not yet been contacted by the police. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Did Michael reach and struggle for the officer's gun as the police are saying he did? 

DORIAN JOHNSON: That's incorrect, sir. He did not reach for a weapon at all. He did not reach for the officer's weapon at all. 

HAYES: And you were able to see this interaction? 

JOHNSON: Yes, sir, correct. 

HAYES: Mr. Bosley, have you or your client, have you been approached by investigators? It seems like this is very key eyewitness testimony. 

FREEMAN BOSLEY, JR., DORIAN JOHNSON`S ATTORNEY: Well, what is interesting about this is that we have not, as a matter of fact, the NAACP, through (INAUDIBLE), contacted the authorities and the police department yesterday to make us available and make Mr. Johnson available and at that point, they said they had some other things going on, they did not want to interview Mr. Johnson at that time. And also wanted to indicate that Mr. Johnson ran away and was not really a person that witnessed everything that was going on and, of course, you know we know that is not correct. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: We spoke with Johnson's attorney just a few minutes ago. He says today, both the FBI and the local authorities have been in touch to schedule interviews with his client, Johnson.

Last night's protests and the police response was covered and captured not only by print media, but also by citizens, such as St. Louis alderman, Antonio French. This video just another instance in which police presence can appear to be overwhelming. 

There are reports circulating online right now that riot police are moving in on protesters at the local QuikTrip. An hour ago, I spoke withalderman French who`s been documenting the protests. He was standing in front of that QuikTrip. I asked him what he saw last night and how his judgment was to how the police reacted to last night's events. 

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ALDERMAN ANTONIO FRENCH, REPRESENTS THE 21ST WARD IN ST. LOUIS: Listen, I think since this thing first happened, as soon as the -- even while the body was still on the ground, I think the police at times have taken a heavy-handed approach and at times that has made things worse, I think. Last night, we had a large group of people here at the QT again which has become a rallying point. They were peacefully protesting. 

As it got larger, there were some guys that made their way out on to the street. A few of them jumped on cars and that's when the police came in. And they came in very heavy. They had assault weapons, gas masks, big vehicles, assault vehicles. And it wasn't soon before they used tear gas. 

The crowds quickly dispersed, but those guys that remained, some of them did get hit with these pellets and suffered from some of the tear gas. I was out here with them. I had some of the tear gas in my eyes as well. 

HAYES: We've also gotten troubling reports I have to say as a reporter of Ferguson police attempting, it seems, to keep reporters away from the area. That happened last night. Did they explicitly order the press to leave as far as you could hear? 

FRENCH: Yes. So, after they cleared the area of most people, a lot of the residents who still live in the area that was closed off were still in here. And media was on the outside. Television stations, reporters, photojournalists, and they were asked to leave. 

At least one photojournalist tweeted he was threatened with arrest if he didn't leave. I even understand tonight that police have told reporters to leave at a certain time, and so, we've had at least two or three incidents where people's constitutional rights are clearly being violated. People being peacefully demonstrating across the street from the city hall were asked to leave, almost a dozen were arrested. Then they did not leave, telling reporters to leave the scene last night and again today. 

HAYES: What is your feeling right now about the Ferguson police specifically, and St. Louis County police, who I understand are also involved in the response to this? I mean, do you think the statements they're making are credible? Are they doing a good job of communicating with folks in the community? 

FRENCH: I don't think they're doing a good job of communicating. I think at times they should have been commended for staying away. They did keep their distance sometimes, but other times they were very heavy-handed and I think made the situation worse. 

As far as the investigation into what this is all about, which is the killing of young Mike Brown, there's no trust between the Ferguson police department and the community at this point. And there's not much trust with St. Louis County police department and the community at this point. 

It's only going to take an independent federal investigation to get these people what they want which is justice for this young man that was murdered. 

HAYES: Has the governing class of Ferguson, talking about -- and I understand you're an alderman in St. Louis, itself. Is the governing class of Ferguson come out to address this? It seems to me the mayor, for instance, has been notably absent amidst all this unrest? 

FRENCH: Well, I think one of the reasons that you have this unrest is because there's such a disconnect between the government of Ferguson and the people who live here. So, the people who live here are 2/3 African-American. The government of Ferguson is almost all white and have been unable to communicate, or it seems empathize with the community in this time of crisis. And that has created a really contentious environment. 

At times I think it should have been a soft hand, one of compassion, reaching out to these young people who are rightfully angry and frustrated and instead they got a very heavy-handed response which, again, I think made it worse. 

HAYES: So, Alderman, where does it go from here? We've seen successive nights of protest. We've seen some pretty heavy police response. The police have said that their helicopters have been shot at last night. That's been and able to independently confirm. 

I mean, where do you see this going? 

FRENCH: Well, I hope things get better. And I hope we don't see the violence tonight.

And a lot of us have been talking to younger people and encouraging more older leaders to come and talk directly with the young people. I think that will help. 

But, frankly, the healing hasn't begun yet. We're still in the crisis. And what has to happen, what is necessary to get beyond this, these conversations, have not even started. 

And so, we're still in the middle of it. It's not going to be solved overnight. It didn`t happen overnight. But we really need to get to the business of healing our community. 

HAYES: St. Louis Alderman Antonio French -- great, thanks. 

FRENCH: Thank you. 

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HAYES: As Alderman French just noted, underlying this incident is the relationship between community and local police. And according to ""The Los Angeles Times"", African-American make up 65 percent of Ferguson's population. The Ferguson police department has 53 total commissionedofficers, three of whom are black and two of whom are other people of color. The rest are white. 

Both the police chief and mayor of Ferguson are white. And out of the six city council members, one is black. 

So, how did we get here? 

Joining me now, Missouri Democratic State Senator Jamilah Nasheed. 

Senator, what is the nature of the disconnect between the people elected to represent and govern Ferguson, folks who live in Ferguson, at the heart of the anger we're seeing in the wake of this incident? 

STATE SEN. JAMILAH NASHEED (D), ST. LOUIS: What you're seeing is the unrest of a community who has been denied and oppressed economically as well as politically and they are frustrated. 

You have 20 percent of the population in Ferguson, 20 percent of those
young men are unemployed. They cannot find jobs. They're being excluded 
from jobs, especially in the construction industry. So, what you're seeing is frustration and the frustration is a direct correlation to the economic and political oppression. 

HAYES: You know, I've been doing some reading about Northern County which is this part of St. Louis county, and it seems that there's been a real transformation of parts of the sort of suburbs around St. Louis that were once primarily white have become much more black and brown over time and yet have kind of maintained the same folks running the political machinery of those areas? 

NASHEED: And that's correct. However, the major issue that we're dealing with right now, people cannot begin to understand what's happening around the St. Louis area. The young man that was murdered, they are frustrated about that because they are asking how can a young man whose only crime was walking down the street, wanting to go visit his mother who was gunned down simply because he was an African-American man? They want to know those answers and those answers they don't have yet. 

HAYES: Well -- 

NASHEED: And that's why you see the unrest in the community. 

HAYES: Now, there was a decision that was announced today by the Ferguson, I believe it was the Ferguson police department, that they will not release the name of the officer involved. The reason they gave, there's a barrage of threats on social media. The police say that they're getting inundated with phone calls and there's a fear for the safety of this officer which seems like an understandable worry. 

At the same time, it does seem there's a fairly compelling public right to know the name of an officer who committed this act, it appears while on public duty. What is your reaction to the police department's announcement today? 

NASHEED: You know, I`m appalled. The people should have a right to know. You have – it's unjustifiable. How can you justify killing and shooting down a man in the middle of the street, execution-style, againsimply because his only crime was walking in the middle of the street wanting to visit his grandmother? 

He wasn't considered a statistic. He didn't have any felony charges. He didn't have any gang activity. He wasn't involved in any gang activities. 

He didn't do any of those things. He wasn't a drug dealer. He was an upright young man who did exactly what his mother told him to do -- go to school, get a good education, and become a productive citizen. 

HAYES: Senator, can I -- can I ask you if you've had interactions with any of the political officials? Obviously, you're a member of the Missouri state senate. 

Have you had interactions? Is anyone talking to or has there been any kind of communication between elected officials, the mayor, city council of Ferguson, who, as far as I can tell have been remarkably absent from the aftermath of this entire thing? 

NASHEED: That's unfortunate. Antonio French, Alderman Antonio 
French, he's been there, I mean, he`s on the ground. You also have the 
Senator Nadal, she's on the ground. So you do have elected firms that are 
engaged as well as involved. 

What we need more than anything, we need a fair and transparent investigation. We need an independent investigation from the Department of Justice. 

HAYES: Yes. 

NASHEED: Because many of the people in the community, they don't trust the county prosecutor. They know that in the past, he sided with the police department. 

HAYES: State Senator Jamilah Nasheed, thank you for joining me tonight. I appreciate it. 

NASHEED: Thank you. 

HAYES: All right. So, what this image, the one you're seeing there, what that has to do with what we're seeing in Ferguson, Missouri. I'll explain ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HAYES: This is what the Amazon bestseller's page for DVDs looked like today. ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""Dead Poets Society"", ""Good Will Hunting"", ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", ""Patch Adams"", ""The Birdcage"", 17 of the top 20 best-selling DVDs star Robin Williams and 16 of them are out of stock. I'll talk to someone who wrote one of those films, ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HAYES: There are new details tonight in the tragic death of Robin Williams. The Marin County sheriff`s office revealed that Williams was last seen alive Sunday night by his wife, Susan Schneider before she retired for the evening. On Monday morning, believing that Williams was still asleep in his bedroom, she left the house. 

Roughly 11:45 a.m., Williams' personal assistant became concerned when Williams did not respond to knocks on his bedroom door. The personal assistant gained access to his bedroom and found Williams' body. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KEITH BOYD, MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: The preliminary, and I again say, preliminary results of the forensic examination reveal supporting physical signs that Mr. Williams' life ended from asphyxia due to hanging. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Expressions of overwhelming grief and shock and sadness continue to pour in today over the death of Robin Williams who had the occasion to work with and come to know so many during a career that spanned nearly four decades in the spotlight. 

This from Nathan Lane: ""What I will always remember about Robin, perhaps even more than his comic genius, extraordinary talent, astounding intellect, was his huge heart, his tremendous kindness, generosity and a compassion as an acting partner, colleague and fellow traveler in a difficult world."" 

From Williams' 25-year-old daughter, Zelda, who Williams called his baby girl and the last picture he ever posted on Instagram, ""I love you, I miss you, I'll try to keep looking up."" 

More than 30 years ago, on the episode of ""Mork & Mindy"", the show that launched Robin Williams into stardom, Williams addressed what it meant to be famous. It was, he said, perhaps the last thing some of us might want. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ROBIN WILLIAMS, ACTOR: See, being a star, sir, is a 24-hour job and you can't leave your face at the office. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Isn't fame its own reward? 

WILLIAMS: Oh, yes, sir, it is, but when you're celebrity, everybody wants a piece of you, sir. Unless you can say no, there will be no piecesleft for yourself. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought all stars were rich, live in mansions and drive big eggs. 

WILLIAMS: I know, sir. That's the common misconception. But you see, to get that, you have to pay a very heavy price. You have responsibilities, anxieties, and to be honest, sir, some of them can't take it. 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not buying it, Mork. 

WILLIAMS: Why, sir? 

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It sounds to me like they have it made. 

WILLIAMS: Well, most of them do, sir. But some are victims of their own fame. Very special, intelligent people. People who like Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Lenny Bruce, Freddie Prinze, and John Lennon. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Joining me, Randi Mayem Singer, who worked with Robin Williams in one of his greatest role, in ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" She was the screenwriter for that film. 

Randi, thank you for joining me.

Could you have made -- would that movie have been made without Robin Williams, would it have worked without Robin Williams? 

RANDI MAYEM SINGER, SCREENWRITER, ""MRS. DOUBTFIRE"": I can't imagine it with anybody else. I mean, I think if there had been a real Mrs. Doubtfire, she would have paled in comparison to what Robin did. 

HAYES: How much of what he brought to that performance, how much of that was improvised, how much of it was scripted, and what was it like to watch him work? 

SINGER: It was amazing. First of all, anything with Robin Williams involves improvisation. He sort of would begin with the script and then begin take after take to salt and pepper it with Robin-isms and try different things and toss out one thing and bring in another. 

As the takes circled back to sort of the end of the take run, it would kind of return to the script and with the best of what he had been experimenting with. It was almost as he was keeping track of it as it was going. Or Chris Columbus was reminding him, you know, try it with that one thing. You know, it was amazing to watch him work I think like no other actor. 

HAYES: There's been a lot of remembrances of him over the last 24 hours I've been reading, and they note two things. One, the kind of amazing sort of manic fireworks of his comedic brain and things that were associated with it, and also his quiet gentleness and his sadness, actually, I've said on a number of accounts. 

Did you get that off him? I mean, when you worked with him, what kind of presence was he like to work with? 

SINGER: He was, to this day, one of the nicest actors that I've ever worked with. And he would -- there was a present normal, if you will, side of him, discussing a scene or discussing a line of dialogue or what he wanted from the script. But in the middle of that, he would get up out of his chair, use the whole room, go into character, take over a restaurant, work his way through it, sit back down and, you know, turn into a regular person again. 

There was definitely a sweet, sensitive, wonderful man in there, but there was also this incredible comedic, you know, place that he went and it was both. I remember thinking, it's a good thing he became Robin Williams because I couldn't picture him in a desk job. 

HAYES: The reason I wanted to play that monologue from ""Mork & Mindy"" which I found really poignant is there's this cliche at the center of this whole thing that I think has been in everyone's head about the sort of sad clown or about the comedian who's struggling with depression and about -- and about the kind of fleetingness of fame and stardom and how different the lived interior life of a star is from what is seen from the outside. 

SINGER: Right. 

HAYES: And there's this moment in the Marc Maron WTF podcast where he talks about fame and insecurity. Take a listen for the second. 

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

WILLIAMS: You know, the insecure part goes, ""No, no!"" 

MARC MARON, WTF: What are you afraid will happen? 

WILLIAMS: I guess it's that fear of you'll recognize that there, you know, as you know, how insecure are we really? 

MARON: Yes. 

WILLIAMS: How desperately insecure -- made us to this for a living. 

(END AUDIO CLIP)

HAYES: It strikes me this is someone who is struggling both with real depression, as an illness but also in the world that just seems to feed the worst part of those mythologies, frankly. I mean, any time I go to L.A. and I'm around people who are in show business, it just seems like a machine that's been crafted to stoke the worst kinds of insecurity in people. 

SINGER: You know, you -- yes, I don't know even how to respond to that. You see -- I see that in a lot of people that I work with. It seems sometimes that the most brilliant artists among us are the ones that have demons. 

I can't really say that I saw those in the brief time that I worked with him, but I do remember there was one moment at the after-party of the premiere party and it was at a restaurant, and we were looking around, my husband and myself, where's Robin? And he was outside where the festivities were taking place just looking over a ledge at a fountain by himself. So, we went out there and we talked to him and had the best conversation about parenthood and raising kids and marriage and it was just a regular conversation with a guy at a party. But it was -- it was striking to me that he was out there and not inside with all of the festivities going on. 

HAYES: Screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer -- thanks so much for joining me tonight. I appreciate it.

SINGER: Thank you. 

HAYES: The aftermath, investigation into one of the most horrific things to happen at a sports event ever, that's coming up.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HAYES: You might think this summer of global turmoil has entered a relative low, as the latest cease-fire in Gaza continues to hold for a second day and U.S. airstrikes in Iraq may have possibly turned the momentum against ISIS. But, cast your attention to this image. What you are looking at is a convoy of trucks, 280 to be precise, that departed the Moscow area earlier this evening and route to the Ukrainian border, where they intend to cross over into Ukraine. 

These trucks are part of what the Russian government is calling a humanitarian mission to deliver 2,000 tons of aid including food, medical equipment, and generators to civilians in rebel-held areas of Eastern Ukraine, which have seen fierce fighting between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian military; fighting that is intensified over the last several weeks. 

And, while some fear the aid convoy might be a quasi literal Trojan horse, the Kremlin insists there is nothing to see here. The whole operation is on the up and up. And, under the supervision of the international committee of the Red Cross, it is so legitimate the convoy even got the blessing of an orthodox priest as you see here. Yet the Red Cross says it does not have everything it needs to carry out this humanitarian mission. Tweeting that ""Important details still need to be clarified"" like the content and volume of the aid. 

And, while Moscow says the convoys being organized by the emergencies ministry, a nonmilitary agency dealing with humanitarian relief task, they cannot post reports soldiers of the Russian Army bragged on social networks, the trucks from military vehicles hastily repainted white. And, after initially saying it would deny access to the convoy, Ukraine has now agreed to let the trucks to enter under Red Cross supervision.

But, if the two sides have reached the deal, they seem to have very different perceptions of what it entails. An aide to the Ukrainian President said, quote, ""This cargo will be reloaded onto other transport vehicles at the border by the Red Cross."" The Russian foreign minister said, ""Ukraine had decided against reloading relief supplies from the convoy after its examination at the border."" 

All of which means we are watching these trucks right now barrel toward the Ukrainian border and toward what could be a very ugly confrontation in the midst of a very active war zone. We will see what happens as those trucks reach the border in the next few hours. Stay tuned. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HAYES: There is now an ongoing police investigation into the death of this young man, named Kevin Ward Jr., 20-year-old, died on Saturday night at a racetrack in upstate New York. The man whose car struck and killed him on that racetrack happens to be one of the biggest most famous names in all of NASCAR. And, that is three-time champion driver Tony Stewart. You see there. 

During a Sprint Car Race on a dirt track, Stewart's car appeared to make contact with Ward's car causing Ward's car to spin out, as you see there. Ward then got out of his car, walked down the track, apparently yelling and pointing at Stewart's car, at which point he was hit by the right side of Stewart's car. The sheriff investigating the accident says footage like this video uploaded to YouTube is crucial to the investigation. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: Oh, he hit him. Tony Stewart just hit that guy, Alan.Tony Stewart just hit that guy. Holy [EXPLICIT WORD]. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Ward was pronounced dead at the hospital with the official cause of death being blunt-force trauma. If you are like me, the first thing you might have asked watching yourself watching this video is, why in the world did he even get out of the car? But it is not an uncommon thing. 

As ""The New York Times"" points out, quote, ""Like many other drivers over the years, both of the top-level racing and on dirt tracks like the one Saturday that was the site of the fatal confrontation, Stewart has gotten out of his crashed race cars and wagged his fingers at other drivers."" In fact, at a 2012 Race in Tennessee after Tony Stewart and another driver, Matt Kenseth collided, wrecking Stewart's car. Stewart got out of his car, walked out on the track and threw his helmet at Kenseth's car as he drove fast. 

Stewart has pulled out of an upcoming dirt track race, and there is no decision yet if he will compete in this weekend's NASCAR race in Michigan. Investigation is continuing, but sheriff says there is no evidence of criminal intent on the part of Tony Stewart and no charges have been filed. 

Joining me now, Mike Pesca, host of the Slate daily podcast, ""The Gist"" which I highly recommend and an NPR contributor. The video, we did not show the worst part of that video because it is horrible. It is shocking to watch that video. And, one of the most shocking things is that what happened right afterwards is that the Stewart people put out this 
preposterously anodyne statement that did not even name the guy and said he was going to race the next day at a NASCAR event. 

MIKE PESCA, NPR CONTRIBUTOR/HOST OF ""THE GIST"": Yes. So, I will look at that maybe as kindly as I can and say they did not know how to react. This was so unprecedented, though deaths on race courses happen, and the phrase they used it business as usual and that was terrible. But, I think what has happened here is that so many people watching the video have rushed to accuse Stewart of murder. 

HAYES: Yes. I mean that is -- I mean we should be clear that is not a legal accusation right now. There is an ongoing police investigation. There is no evidence they say of criminal intent. But, the people who watch that video on social media, other people are basically saying, ""We are watching the guy run over a dude."" 

PESCA: Right. OK. So, here is what you have to know about this. And, I just want to say, I think we do a great harm to Tony Stewart when we do this because there is no evidence of any intention. 

HAYES: Yes.

PESCA: So, some things to know about that race car. They have giant wings. The site is extremely limited. It is not like a NASCAR. It is not a hugely lit NASCAR track. It is a dirt track. He is wearing dark clothes. 

HAYES: That right there is footage of what it looks like -- 

PESCA: I have talked to people who have driven these cars. There are huge blind spots. The blind spots are somewhere near the right rear tire. They are also not even designed to turn right. They are designed to turn 
left. There are so many factors that would indicate that Tony Stewart did not see them. 

And, the biggest factor, since we cannot at all prove that Tony Stewart in any way had any intentionality, I think that it is a calumny against him to say that, you know, Tony Stewart is something of a murder. But, you know, it is like -- 

HAYES: But, part of it -- we should explain. Part of that, the guy has this notorious reputation. 

PESCA: Right. 

HAYES: As a hot head. As a brawler. 

PESCA: Right. 

HAYES: As a trash talker. 

PESCA: Right. 

HAYES: You know what I mean? So, it is not like that is why, I think people are saying that. 

PESCA: Right. And, well, it is also because the way we react to video as sports fans, we are conditioned to go over video. It is like forensic videography. 

HAYES: Absolutely.

PESCA: Did he gain a yard? Is it first down? We are talking about this in no different from, you know, should he have punted or gone for it? Not we, but the public debates. But, I just want to say about Stewart being a hot head. There are hot heads in sports. There are some thingsyou do not do. So, even though there are hot heads in baseball, pitchers 
will throw at a guy, only one time a guy swung a bat at an opponent. 

HAYES: Right.

PESCA: You just do not do it. In hockey, you do not slice someone with a skate and you never hit someone with a car. 

HAYES: Part of the reason, I think, also that people have been sort of aghast in this, you can hear the engine revving at the moment right before, and there is lots of explanations why that -- 

PESCA: Well, we seem to think that. We also know that video can be extremely misleading. And, you know -- I think there was a statement by a friend of Ward who pretty much accused Stewart of doing something wrong. 

HAYES: Yes.

PESCA: A guy named Tyler Graves. He was in grief, and I understand his statement. But, a lot of the statement about saying how Tony Stewart could see Ward -- that has been proven -- 

HAYES: This is one of the strangest parts of the context of this. This is like Michael Jordan breaking someone's nose while playing a pickup game. 

PESCA: Yes. 

HAYES: At, like, a local park while he is still playing for the championship Bulls. 

PESCA: Yes. 

HAYES: I mean, the whole reason -- the whole fact of Tony Stewart racing on this dirt track is just kind of mind-boggling in and of itself. 

PESCA: Well, it is sort of like Michael Jordan and the owner of the Bulls doing that -- 

HAYES: Right. Right. 

PESCA: He is this huge businessman with so much money riding on his entire racing team. But, this is why people love Tony Stewart. He gets -- there is maybe a $3,000 prize there. 

HAYES: He loves to race so much -- In a dirt track race. 

PESCA: That is why fans love the guy and also the temper and also the shaking of the finger. And, NASCAR has that weird relationship with it, where they officially fined him like that track in Bristol, where he threw the helmet. But, they kind of love it. 

HAYES: That is like the NFL showing the hits of corners coming across the middle of the field. Mike Pesca from ""The Gist."" thank you. 

PESCA: You are welcome. 

HAYES: All right. What are suburban police departments doing with things like this? That is ahead.

HAYES: We have learned tonight that actress Lauren Bacall has died. Bacall first burst on to the scene in the Humphrey Bogart film ""To have and have not"" in 1944. She went on the starred offer aside Bogart in a string of movies that established her as a sultry, sophisticated icon of the golden age of Hollywood. She is reported to have died peacefully earlier today in New York. Lauren Bacall was 89 years old.

HAYES: This image is one we showed you earlier. It flooded through social media today. Different angles of it. It was taken yesterday in the growing outrage over the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Images of police in riot gear walking toward a man with his hands raised, pointing his weapons at him from a few feet away. 

Of course, part of the reason we are seeing such widespread and reverberating outrage over the death of Michael Brown outside St. Louis is that, it comes right on the heels of other images like this one of Eric Garner, whose death was ruled a homicide by a medical examiner after he was put in a choke hold by a New York City Police Officer in July, or this one of a 51-year-old African-American woman on the ground being punched by a California Highway Patrol Officer, also in July. 

But, here is the thing. It is not just those images that have led to so much outrage and anguish and condemnations of the state of American justice. It is those images juxtaposed against some other big stories this year such as these pictures of the open-carry movement that showed gun owners just strolling the aisles of a target store carrying long guns and assault rifles, or a woman standing with her gun at an intersection reading a flag that reads, ""Come and take it,"" or most iconically this from the Bundy Ranch in April of a man in sniper position aiming his rifle at federal officers from the Bureau of Land Management. 

Try to imagine if any of these people were African-American. Try to imagine what would have happened at the Bundy Ranch if they used the tactics of Ferguson, Missouri, last night. In 1967, images of Black Panthers with guns walking into the California Statehouse to protest a gun control measure, actually helped contributed to the modern gun control movement. 

Governor Ronald Reagan saying at the time, ""There is no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons."" In 2002,Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winning playwright, August Wilson articulated the racial double standard that continues to dominate the country. 

There is a difference, he said, between white and black in America. A black man unarmed standing in a vestibule of his house is shot 41 times. A white man waving a rifle on the lawn of the white house, 150 yards from the leader of the free world, they negotiate with him for 10 minutes and shoot him one time in the leg. That is the difference in being white and black in America."" 

Joining me now, Phillip Agnew, Director of Dream Defenders, and retired NYPD Detective, Marq Claxton, Director of the Black Law Enforcement Alliance. Marq, I would like to start with you. I think -- I remember growing up in New York in the 1980s and 1990s and there was a series of incidents of police brutality. There was a lot of angry and unrest, then of course culminating in LA with the Rodney King incident and the riots after that. 

Have things gotten better in the 30 years, or I guess 20 years since Rodney King? Have things gotten better in terms of how police are trained, about how they interact, about what they do, about whether they are held accountable? 

MARQ CLAXTON, DIRECTOR OF THE BLACK LAW ENFORCEMENT ALLIANCE: No, actually there has been a significant shift in many police models across the nation. And, that is as far away as possible from community policing and more towards this more militarized show of force, use of force-type policing. It has been increasingly about producing numbers, arrest numbers and showing force in communities as opposed to relating to communities, communicating with communities and defusing situations prior to them 
happening. 

HAYES: So, you think the trajectory is actually getting worse?

CLAXTON: Absolutely. There is no question about it. I mean you show the image, for example, of police officers in full military regalia at civil disturbance. And, a lot of times, those type of incidents, that type of show of force exacerbates situations. And, it really damages the relationship that should exist. The good relationship between police departments and the community at large. They are the client, and they should always be considered as the client and not some entity that needs to be forced upon. 

HAYES: Phillip, you have been doing a lot of organizing around this issue and obviously it is something that has been acutely problematic in Florida, in certain areas of Florida; but, around the country, I mean, how much do you see this as a trend? How much do you see this as an enduring reality that has been like this for a long time? 

PHILLIP AGNEW, DIRECTOR OF DREAM DEFENDERS: It has been like this for a very long time. It is been like this for a very -- you know, Chris, ever since you are born, your taught at this posture right here should guarantee you life and liberty in your interaction with the police officer. This should indicate to a police officer that you mean him or her no harm, that you have no malice in your heart and that you are subjecting yourself to the will of that police officer. 

And, this is the position that for years in this country was the last position that people that look like me, and people that look like people around this country, died in. And, so this is an enduring trend in this country. This should mean -- this is the white flag. I am surrendering to you, and it is only so long. What you are seeing in Ferguson, it is only so long that people can look in their timeline and see kids dying. 

And, not react in a way that is human and that is real and that is genuine. I cannot -- you cannot stroll past a picture of a young man in the middle of a street on his stomach with his brains blown out and react in any other way than people are reacting right now. This should mean, I want to live. And, this is an enduring trend. He said it before, this is a consequence of heavy militarized police forces that have been infusedwith money from the federal government to terrorize communities. 

HAYES: Marq, when we have these discussions about police/community relations, particularly along the axis of race. There is a sort of historic nature of distrust between law enforcement, African-Americans distrusting law enforcement, people of color distrusting law enforcement, particularly in urban environments. And, I wonder just how you watch this unfold as a black man and as a former police officer and how you think about those two identities of yourself. 

CLAXTON: That is an excellent question. Let me just say, first and foremost, I think that in large part, we have had incidental distrust of police. You know, because as I grew up, the way that I grew up, many of my friends and family members, et cetera, did not have this innate distrust or dislike of police officers. 

It is the interactions that we have had historically. It is the interactions that we have had on a personal level that impact how we look 
at policing in general. It is the same -- sadly, it is the same type of mentality that occurs in communities. You can only go based on your own personal experiences. 

The struggle and the challenge and Mr. Agnew's emotion is clear here. That is why it is so important for us to deal, one responsibly, 
respectfully, and honestly, with the racial component and dynamic that exists throughout the nation in law enforcement, et cetera; but, then, also be honest about where policing is going. How far away it is going from, you know, to serve and protect, and more toward in terms of enforcement. 

HAYES: I would like to see more police officers sitting down with Phillip Agnew and Marq Claxton. 

CLAXTON: Absolutely. 

HAYES: And, figuring out what modeling of policing that do not look like what you are seeing in Ferguson right now looked like. 

CLAXTON: Right. Right. 

AGNEW: No -- and Chris, you know, I would love to see more police officers in communities who are sitting with people, but they are not incentivized on that model. 

HAYES: Right. And, they are also not being held accountable when things go wrong and that is why, I think, the nation's eyes right now are on Ferguson -- 

AGNEW: Absolutely. 

HAYES: Phillip Agnew from Dreams Defenders, retired NYPD Detective, Marq Claxton, thank you gentlemen, both. I will talk to someone who literally wrote the book on the militarization of America`s police forces, next. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HAYES: One of the most striking things about this image from Ferguson, Missouri, is that police are wearing camouflage. When you think about it, it seems odd considering they are not in a jungle. They are not in a war zone. What exactly are they trying to camouflage into? 

This is a tiny example of the massive militarization of police from even small departments across the country. Military-style equipment, such as this MRAP Vehicle used in a raid at a house in Idaho yesterday. MRAP, which stands for Mine Resistant and Ambush Protected. Presumably there were no mines planted in Idaho. 

I am joined out by someone who has done the most thorough reporting on this issue, Radley Balko, author of the ""Rise Of Warrior Cop: The Militarization Of America`s Police Forces."" And, Radley, as you watch, this unfold in Ferguson, what are you thinking? 

RADLEY BALKO, AUTHOR, ""RISE OF THE WARRIOR COP"": Well, I am thinking that this is a very predictable consequence of a, you know, a 30-year trend toward police militarization. I think the militarization, itself, is part of a larger trend that I think one of your earlier guests touched on. And, that is a willingness or a policy among domestic police in the United 
States of using more force more often for increasingly, you know, petty offenses. 

And, really a mentality that is taken hold I think in too many police agencies that is very much kind of us versus them. It is a mentality that sees the people they are supposed to be serving not as citizens with rights but as potential threats. If you look at the racial makeup of Ferguson, Missouri, it is about 67 percent black. 52 of the 55 police officers at the Ferguson police department are white. 

So, you know, it is important that communities see their reflection in their police force, so that they see cops as one of their own who are using force to protect them and not an outside force as being imposed upon them. And, it is important that police see their own reflection in the communities for very similar reasons, and that just was not happening in Ferguson. It is not happening in a lot of the rest of the country. 

HAYES: And, there is something symbolically really problematic about the military gear just at the basic level of kind of our constitutional expectations of what it means to be part of a republic in which we are not an occupied populous in which law enforcement is there as public servants and public employees and not a force to subdue the people around them. 

BALKO: Right. And, you know, it is also part of, you know, what kind of country do we want to be? I mean, when you talk about the MRAPs, the people who defend the use of MRAPs, which were -- again, as you said, designed for use in Afghanistan and Iraq. The people who defend them say, what is wrong with it? It is a big bulletproof truck. There are no guns attached to it. 

But, it is about image. It is about the kind of mentality that it instills in the people, officers who are using it. I, several years ago, interviewed a citizen in Keene, New Hampshire who is fighting the purchase of an armored personnel carrier in that town. 

And, she said it is not about whether or not it has guns. It is about whether I want to look out the window in my town and see a military vehicle parked at city hall. She said, that is not the kind of town I want to live in. I think we need to look at these images that are coming across social media and ask ourselves, is this the kind of country we want to live in? 

HAYES: Yes. There are two questions about whether it is useful or appropriate or makes issue better or it is needed. And, you make the argument in your book I think really well that this has been driven by alot of money that has come from the federal government, much less demand and need for this specific kinds of heavy, heavy machinery. Radley Balko, his book, ""Rise of the Warrior Cop."" You should definitely check that out. Thank you so much.

BALKO: Thanks for having me on.

HAYES: That is ""All In"" for this evening. ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" 
starts right now. Good evening, Rachel.",NA,NA,Read the transcript from the Tuesday show,"DatePublished is the updated date, not the original publishing date"
MSN,msn2,http://rss.msnbc.msn.com/id/55865425/ns/msnbc-rachel_maddow_show/,"'The Rachel Maddow Show' for Wednesday, August 13th, 2014",NA,08/14/2014,04/22/2016,"RACHEL MADDOW, HOST, ""THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW"": Good evening, Chris. That was amazing. I actually think we`re going to be speaking with another journalist who was just arrested in the same -- what appears to be sweep in Ferguson coming up in just a couple of minutes here. Thanks, Chris Hayes. And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. There is a lot going on in the news right now. There`s a lot going on in domestic news right now. As I mentioned to Chris, we`re going to have the latest in a live report from Ferguson, Missouri, in just a moment. We`re hoping to be speaking with another journalist who appears to have been arrested for at this point unknown reasons by the local police in the middle of protests there. The upset and the protests continue in Ferguson tonight over the police shooting of an un-armed teenager in that city this weekend. What`s happening tonight includes, apparently just a massive, massive over the top apparent police response to demonstrations tonight. And we have some pretty incredible footage and again, some live interviews from there, that`s coming up in just a moment. Some of that stuff we`re still getting fed in and we`re still producing, the White House today also sent up some signal flares suggesting that President Obama may be about to take a really controversial, really big step. As they say, the president plans to return early to Washington from his vacation, that`s a big deal with the White House. There`s a lot going on right now, we`re going to be talking about all of that tonight. But meanwhile, as all of those stories and also frankly as Robin Williams` tragic death earlier this week, all of these stories are keeping the whole country very much focused right now on domestic matters. Meanwhile, as a nation, we have appeared to have just started a major U.S. military engagement. This all started on June 16th, with this notice to Congress that President Obama was sending 275 U.S. troops back into Iraq. In this notice he said he was sending those troops there to support and protect U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. That was June 16th, 275 troops, 10 days after that, June 26th, another notification, 300 more U.S. troops. These ones to work with Iraqi forces fighting Sunni militants in that country. That was June 26th. Then four days after that another notice to Congress. The president sending 200 further troops. And this time that additional deployment also including American aircraft getting sent back into Iraq. That was June 30th. Three separate notices. And then it happened again. August 8th, another notice to Congress, it was this past Friday. More U.S. troops going into Iraq. But this time, in the president`s notice to Congress, there was no number of troops specified. That notification was on Friday, again it did not give a number for how many more troops the president was sending back to Iraq. But the White House told us today that the additional 130 U.S. marines and special operations troops that were sent to northern Iraq yesterday, those 130 troops make up at least part of what the president meant in that Friday letter to Congress, the one that had no numbers. The National Security Council gave us the statement about this today, we`re going to put it up on our website tonight if you want to read their full statement about the number of troops that the president meant and the fact that these ones that arrived in Northern Iraq yesterday were included in that number. And now how many more American troops are going to be sent back into Iraq under that most recent notice? We have no idea. Again, the president`s notification did not give a number, we know it`s at least 130 because that`s what`s there now. But apparently, there`s no ceiling. And the overall clarity that we`ve got now is that the trajectory is still pointing up here. I mean, as of today the Pentagon says, the U.S. military aircraft supporting this news mission in Iraq are no longer going to be just flying missions off an American aircraft carrier parked in the Persian Gulf. The USS George H.W. Bush as of today, the U.S. aircraft they say are also based on land in Iraq, they`re now based at an air field in Northern Iraq. Taken all together, we`ve now got nearly 1,000 U.S. troops serving in Iraq again. But this administration has taken great pains to say that this rapid and apparently open ended escalating redeployment of U.S. troops back into Iraq, they have taken great pains to say this will not be a boots on the ground operation. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel gave marines at Camp Pendleton that exact assurance yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHUCK HAGEL, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: This is not a combat boots on the ground operation. We`re not going to have that kind of operation. (END VIDEO CLIP)MADDOW: That`s what Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said yesterday, that was yesterday, though. And apparently today, it`s a U.S. combat boots on the ground kind of operation. The Pentagon confirming tonight through an anonymous U.S. defense official that a team of fewer than 20 U.S. military personnel did hit the ground today in Iraq, at Mount Sinjar, where civilian refugees have been trapped for almost a week now by ISIS` militant fighters. In addition to helping Iraqi forces that are supposed to be helping those militant and in addition to direct U.S. air strikes against those militant fighters, U.S. troops have also in recent days begun dropping food and water and supplies to those trapped civilians. Have you seen any of thefootage of those drops? The footage of them dealing with civilians on this mountain. And what they`ve been doing from these helicopters? These are not just being done by the U.S. It`s the U.S. but it`s also being done by Iraqi and Kurdish forces as well. But have you seen the footage? The footage is amazing. I mean, you can see. Look out the window, you can see the poor people on the ground scrambling to try to get these supplies that are being dropped from thehelicopters. When these aircrafts have landed they have also been swamped by these people trying desperately to get onboard the aircraft so that they can get out, to try to kids out, to try to get elderly people out, to get out people who are not going to survive unless they can get off that mountain.This is a firsthand report from correspondent John Irvine of ITV News.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN IRVINE, ITV NEWS SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: After giving them food, the crew picked out a handful of people to take off this mountain. These were hard choices. Eventually it was too much for the pilot who changed his mind. He would not leave any of them behind and so they all rushed on board. Sadly, the first takeoff attempt failed. We were too heavy. Five have to get off. The young man were the obvious choice. An older man said a stoic farewell to his family and went down the ramp. The weight difference was just enough. To the relief of all on board, we took to the air. This was a life saving flight for these people, and their emotions were all too plain to see. They had survived more than a week on a baron lofty island hunted by bigots who want to wipe them out. The pilot a hero, came back to check his handiwork on his last mercy mission on a long day. This helicopter has the capacity for 15 passengers. I counted more than 50 on board. (END VIDEO CLIP)MADDOW: Yesterday an Iraqi pilot was killed when too many people climbed aboard the chopper that he was piloting and it crashed. This was the incident in which the famous ""New York Times"" correspondent Alissa Rubin was hurt. You may have heard about this yesterday. She was on that chopper along with a New York Times photographer, along with some other journalists, including a Time Magazine photographer who took these images from the crash site. And what they were doing there, that was intended to be an air relief effort for these refugees. Obviously, when that aircraft crashed what you have now is literally a boots on the ground effort. Right? I mean, air campaigns have a way of not becoming just air campaigns. Whether it`s the support forces needed to keep aircraft flying safely, or it`s the consequences on the aircraft can`t fly safely. And there`s some sort of crash or some sort of unforeseen circumstance. I mean, even bombing campaigns, but especially relief efforts that you attempt to mount from the air, they have a way of sometimes and somehow ending up on the ground. Well, the United States has announced today that the military has now moved tilt rotor Osprey aircraft to a Northern Iraqiair base. Osprey are massive vehicles. They can take-off and land vertically like a helicopter but rotors can tilt so the air -- the aircraft can essentially fly like a plane before it tilts its rotors back again to land vertically. ISIS militants on the ground in Iraq and Syria are not thought to have the kind of firepower that could shoot down F-18s or other fighter aircraft like these ones taking off from the deck of the USS George H.W. Bush today in the Persian Gulf. But that militant group is thought to have the kind of firepower conceivably to at least try to shoot down helicopters. So atleast try to target them. The British have announced they`re sending some massive Chinook helicopters to the -- in Northern Iraq. We learned today that we are also sending ospreys. It is still not a combat operation. But in the event that the awful event that one of those aircraft goes down, is it still not a combat operation? The territory around where this relief operation is going to happen is not controlled by the Iraqi government. It`s controlled by those ISIS militants. And with U.S. Special Forces and marines on the ground already today. The White House says, it is expecting recommendations from that team that`s on the ground today, about how best to handle the problems of those civilians trapped by ISIS. The first word by those groups today were that there would not as many refugees on that mountain as they expected. And so maybe that`s good news and this ends here. But the White House did say today, that maybe the recommendations from this group, maybe the recommendations from these on the ground U.S. forces in Iraq will be that the president should order U.S. ground troops there. The U.S. ground troops to clear the way for some sort of safe passage by land for those thousands of trapped civilians. In two months we have gone from zero to 1,000 troops to a new U.S. joint air base in Iraq. To boots on the ground already today. And the prospect of more to come. And who knows how much further this is going to go? I mean, this redeployment to Iraq has all happened in exactly 59 days, and that ends up being really important. Fifty nine days ago, is when President Obama first sent the June 16th notification to Congress that 275 troops were going back to Iraq. And that was 59 days ago. That was the first notification. And by now, we are now back in a big way. That todaygot a lot bigger and that the White House is signaling they get a lot bigger still. There was no number on the last notification. Is this overall redeployment to Iraq a good idea? Is this a slippery slope? We are already sliding down -- Iraq war. I mean, if this is a humanitarian mission to protect those refugees from the ISIS militant group and if this is a mission to protect the U.S. personneland assets and interest from this ISIS militant group, how do we know when that mission has been achieved? What does the U.S. have to do to ISIS? How much do they have to be degraded or hurt before this mission is over? How long is this going to last, how much is it going to take? How many boots are going to be on the ground, how do we know that it`s over? That last notification that the president sent to Congress did not includea number for how many troops he was sending, and the day after he sent that notification was the day the president said, quote, ""I don`t think we`regoing to solve this problem in weeks. I think this is going to take some time."" How much time? For what mission -- at how much risk and how will we know when it`s supposed to be over. So far, there`s a lot going on in the world, I recognize it. But this is being treated as a matter of international news. Right? The sort of matter of foreign interest that Americans might be interested in but might not. But we have male started what amounts to a major U.S. major militaryoperation in a country where we just ended a major war. And there`s a law in our own country that says that we`re not just supposed to wonder about the wisdom of this, Congress is supposed to ask those questions, debate them formally and then vote. Congress is supposed to make a decision about this. Congress is. And the president said that notification to Congress that he was sending those first U.S. troops back into Iraq 59 days ago. The notification is a letter, addressed to the speaker of the house, and to the president pro-term of the Senate. Starting on June 15th, they`re sending 275 armed forces personnel they`re deploying to Iraq, blah, blah, blah. But then look at the bottom, I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the warpowers resolution. Public law 93-148. The war powers resolution says that the constitution constrains the president from waging a war, waging a military operation on his own say so. Article I section 8 of the constitution says decisions about war and peace are decisions that are made by the Congress not the president. And so, the war powers resolution makes clear that yes the president can act with lackerty (ph). The president can respond to events around the world, he has the prerogative to send U.S. forces abroad to engage in military operations on his own say so for a limited period of time. He can do that on his own say so as long as he notifies Congress when he was doing it, and then those forces cannot stay there doing that military operation for more than 60 days, at the end of 60 days, they don`t get to stay there anymore. Unless congress votes that they can. U.S. troops are required by law to be withdrawn from hostilities within 60 days unless Congress acts to approve them being there. That 60 days runs out tomorrow in Iraq. And it`s not like what the president has asked for in Iraq is stay and contain. Right? Since that initial notification to Congress 59 days ago, about 275 troops, the president sent another contingent of troops and then another contingent of troops and then another open ended no number given contingent of troops that today included them putting boots on the ground and setting up an air base in Northern Iraq. One senator democrat Tim Kaine of Virginia sent the White House a letter yesterday saying, I think Congress ought to vote on this. Congress needs to authorize this sort of thing, we ought to vote on it. But it`s one thing to send that letter to the White House, Congress actually has to do it. Congress is on vacation. Congress is making no move at all in that direction. Sixty days for the first authorization runs out tomorrow. And what is starting to look like America`s new war in Iraq. America`s new war in Iraq is now getting to the ground troops phase as of today. So far, no debate, certainly no vote, no authorization. It`s just quietly happening in Iraq, quietly escalating, it`s happening again, we`re back there, it`son again. And nobody expects that this Congress is capable of having a good debate about this issue. Nobody expects that this Congress is capable of having a good debate about anything. But if we are now back to up to 1,000 Americans serving in Iraq again. And we have just set up another new air base there and we have boots on the ground there. Even a bad debate about that is better than just pretending this is not happening, and this is some other country`s problem. This is a decision for the U.S. Congress to make, not just something forthem to complain about or crow about or write op-eds about or ignore. They are actually supposed to vote on whether or n
t this happens. Right now it is happening without them. Whether you think this mission is a good idea or not, it is on constitutional auto pilot right now. Which is an insult and in some ways a betrayal of the 1,000 Americans who right now arerisking their necks over there for us again. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: Big news day, we have a lot more ahead. Including the very latest on the tumultuous reaction to the Ferguson Missouri shooting. Including a massive and militarized police response. Look at this militarized police vehicles in the streets and look at what those cops are wearing. We`re going to talk live with one of the reporters who was just arrested and detained this evening by police in Ferguson. That`s next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: This is Maria Chappelle-Nadal, she`s a state senator in the great state of Missouri. She`s running up for re-election, so far she`s unopposed, she has no opponent in the democratic primary this month, and she so far has no opponent in the general election. But Senator Chappelle-Nadal has been out on the streets in her constituency a lot lately. Here for example, she is in-front of a local police station on Sunday night, with a couple of local kids, she tweeted from a protest that same night.Because State Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal represents the town of Ferguson, Missouri where police shot and killed an unarmed teenager on Saturday. Eighteen year old Michael Brown was one of Maria Chappelle-Nadal`s constituents. And it`s important to know who she is, because you will not see Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal in this next clip, but you willhear her voice. Check this out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STATE SEN. MARIA CHAPPELLE-NADAL, MISSOURI: I wanted to know if I`m going to be gassed against like I was on Monday night. And I was peaceful. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I know, I know, I know. CHAPPELLE-NADAL: Again, we couldn`t get out. And we were peacefully sitting. I just want to know if I`m going to be gassed again. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I hope not. CHAPPELLE-NADAL: I really hope not either. (END VIDEO CLIP)MADDOW: And I`m your state senator? That was the chief of police in Ferguson, Missouri today. Taking questions from reporters and elected officials and citizens, at a press conference, people ask for instance why the department needed to bring out armored vehicles, handed down from the U.S. military. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: What`s the need for a mine-resistant vehicle? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: People are using bombs now. Pipe bombs, so forth. (END VIDEO CLIP)MADDOW: There`s been no indication of bombs at any of these protests, even though there definitely has been some looting, and some violence and things definitely have been rowdy at some of these events, there have been no bombings reported. So, we`re not sure what the chief is referring to there, or if he`s just referring to the possibility of bombings in general. People today also asked whether the body of Michael Brown has been released to the family. The chief said the body had been released and that the Police Department was working with the NAACP to try to set-up a meeting between the police and the family. People asked whether the Police Department has video of the shooting, the chief said they do not. We`ve seen some speculation this week that there may be dash cam footage of the shooting. The police chief though explained today that the department has received a grant for a few cameras this year, but they have not yet installed them. And nothing like that was in operation on the scene on Saturday. But what people asked about several times, the question that kept coming up over and over again in different forms was this. City and police officials in Ferguson today issued a statement saying that they mourned the loss of Michael Brown`s life, but they also said that people upset about it, should limit their protests to daylight hours. Quote, ""We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner, we`ve further ask all of those wishing to demonstrate or assemble to disbursewell before the evening hours to ensure the safety of the participants and the safety of our community."" Whatever officials in Ferguson Missouri meant by that notice, the message does not seem to have come through very clearly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: First, why the curfew? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: There`s not a curfew. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: There`s not a curfew?UNIDENTIFIED MAN: No. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I don`t know where that came from. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Protesting -- UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We`d like the protesting to end at dark, just because it`s as you probably know, it`s just been unsafe after dark. (END VIDEO CLIP)MADDOW: Well, today protests began in broad daylight in Ferguson, Missouri within just the last couple of hours. We started to get these images back from the town, pretty remarkable images. There are girls out dancing in the street, one of the protests calling for justice for Michael Brown. Christine Conetta from the Huffington Post tweeted this out today. This is part of the protest today and the one side, you have broad daylight, you have protesters, some of them holding signs, some of them listening toGospel music, other dancing, others chanting, the people united will never be defeated. But on the other side, this was the police turnout. The police in full riot gear, full S.W.A.T. gear, enormous armed vehicle, reporters on the scene say police had guns, including from the top of the vehicle as you see there, trained directly on the crowd. Not pointed up, like you might do just for deterrence, but actually pointed at the protesters, it`s not clearwhat about this daylight protest caused police to call out the infantry orsomething that looks like a striker brigade combat team for this event. But the news tonight is still ruling in from Ferguson. It is not yet all sorted out. One report from the scene today said that state senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal had actually herself been arrested at the protest. The state senator herself tweeted back a cheerful response moments later, no, she had not been arrested. She said, ""No, I wasn`t arrested, I`m on the street."" She tweeted back cheerfully she was still there. But reporter Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, he did got picked up bypolice, and then ultimately released, he did an interview just this past hour with Chris Hayes, he said, the S.W.A.T. force invaded the McDonald`s where he was trying to send out a report and charge his phone. He wasthere along with Wesley Lowery from the Washington Post. Mr. Lowery tweeted that ""Officers decided we weren`t leaving McDonald`s quickly enough and we shouldn`t have been taping them."" He tweeted from the scene that officers slammed him into a soda machine, because he was confused about which door they wanted him to walk out of. Wesley Lowery from the Washington Post was then detained and then he released, he said there were no charges filed against him, and he says there will be no police report.He writes, quote, ""The chief thought he was doing you a favor."" The police officer told him about being released. This is day four of the conflict in Ferguson. Missouri since Michael Brown was killed by a police officer there. And thus far, it does not feel like the conflict is getting better. From the scenes in the street up to and including the armored vehicle with a cop on top with his gun trained at peaceful protesters in broad daylight today, up to and including that today, it feels like this is getting worse. Joining us now is Wesley Lowery, he`s a reporter of the Washington Post, he was detained tonight by a police, just released while he was there covering the situation in Ferguson. Mr. Lowery, Wesley, thanks very much for joining us. I appreciate you calling in. WESLEY LOWERY, WASHINGTON POST REPORTER: Of course, no problem. MADDOW: Can you tell us the circumstances of why you were arrested and then why you were released? LOWERY: Of course, I don`t want to say too much other than what I`ve put out on twitter already. (INAUDIBLE) But I will put this out here, is that we were working with McDonald`s, for those who aren`t here in Ferguson, it`s about two blocks away from ground zero, from the gas station that was burned down to where these protests has been going on. So, essentially it`s been the media center. They have outlets and internet. So, a lot ofreporters have been dropping in there to charge up and grab food, that type of thing. At some point as this happening, protests were going on, armed officers, some kind of normally dressed, others in more of this riot and S.W.A.T.gear initially saying, you all should leave, you should get out of here, and eventually, someone was saying, can you say what`s going on? Are you closing the McDonald`s, eventually they said, well, we can ensure your safety, if you stay, we`re not going to answer your 911 calls. After that, they came back a few minutes away and then now they decided they were going to forcibly remove us, as I tried to pack up my bag, I pulled out my phone and the video record, which an officer took exception to and told me to stop videotaping. I did not, which I think angered him. And then as I was packing my bag and videotaping with one hand, he was angry I was not moving fast enough or whatnot, I put my backpack on and was trying to walk out, in the corner I can see Ryan having some type of interaction . As I turned around the corner, I was trying to ask him, well, my car is parked here, where am I going to be able to move my car? Can I get out? They didn`t want to answer that question. They directed me towards the one door. Where I encountered another officer who tries to direct me towards another door. I said, officers, where would you like me to go? As I turned to follow their instructions, my bag flipped of off of my shoulder.I said, officer, I`m going to need my -- just my bag, give me one second, one officer said, let`s take him. They slammed me to the soda machine, grabbed my bag, grabbed my phone, and put me in temporary restrain. And took us outside. Moments later, I saw Ryan being led out -- MADDOW: Did you identify yourself as press to these officers? LOWERY: My Washington Post credentials were on my neck. MADDOW: And were you hurt when they hit you into the soda machine? LOWERY: Not in any real way. I mean, I certainly think that by my standards I call it assault, I have been out here all week and seen people really get hurt, so I don`t want to say that, I was not hurt. MADDOW: In terms of what you have seen both in the circumstances in which you were arrested and also what you were reporting on before then, is it your sense that the -- what looks to be a military style police response is getting more agro over time or is this just what it looked like all week and this is fairly static? LOWERY: I arrived on Monday afternoon, and this is exactly what it`s looked like since I arrived. MADDOW: OK. In terms of you feeling like you didn`t know how to avoid arrest in this circumstance, do you think that has been the case with other protesters and other people who have been arrested and detained by police in these circumstances? I mean, what`s striking about your account and Ryan`s is that it seems like you certainly weren`t trying to get arrested. You were trying to do your jobs, but police gave you no way to avoid being arrested. LOWERY: I think that is accurate. You know, listen, I went to Ohio University, which for a long time was the top party school in the country. We had these street fests that would turn into sometimes into riots. That was a lot of riots, police. I was covering that in Ohio State where I covered crime scenes in Boston and Los Angeles and D.C. I`ve been at these such scenarios and I don`t take pride in the fact that I`ve never been arrested. I was never looking to get arrested. But I tell -- I have to say I`ve been in a lot of scenarios with very heavily armed, police officers have been in a lot of scenarios where journalists could get arrested. I don`t believe mine that I did anything that matters have been taken into custody. And I think we`re also both(INAUDIBLE) to try to avoid being taken into custody, this frankly. I would rather be out on the street right now talking to protesters trying to tell this story and no disrespect to you, but not sitting here talking on the phone about me. MADDOW: Wesley Lowery, report ever with the ""Washington Post,"" detained tonight in Ferguson, Missouri, in this very intense police environment. Wesley, I`m glad you are alright. Thanks for your time tonight. Thanksfor taking time. Get back out there. All right. More ahead on this still unfolding situation in Ferguson tonight. We have some new tape just fed in. We`ll be right back. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RYAN J. REILLY, THE HUFFINGTON POST: Evidently, I was not moving quickly enough for their effort them to like. And at which point I was given a countdown. I was told I had, you know, 45 seconds, 30 seconds to pack up all my stuff and leave. I was then -- when I -- basically, he then arrested me. You know, this is -- it was just a terrible experience. My, you know, the worst part was, he slams my head against the glass purposely on the way out of the McDonald`s and sarcastically apologized for it. (END VIDEO CLIP)MADDOW: That was reporter Ryan J. Reilly from the ""Huffington Post"" speaking to Chris Hayes just a few minutes ago. Mr. Reilly was arrestedand released tonight, along with ""Washington Post"" reporter Wesley Lowery, who we just spoke to on this program. They were both sort of manhandled a bit while arrested. Neither said they were hurt. But neither of them wasseeking to get arrested, neither one of them was protesting. They wereboth arrested while covering the protest tonight in Ferguson, Missouri. Joining us now is Lizz Brown. She is an attorney and columnist for the ""St. Louis American."" Ms. Brown, thanks very much for being with us. I appreciate your time tonight. LIZZ BROWN, ATTORNEY/COLUMNIST, ST. LOUIS AMERICAN: Thank you, Rachel. MADDOW: So, the police in Ferguson today asked for protests to only happen during daylight. From the outside, it doesn`t seem like the temperature is dropping, the authorities are really defusing anything. What`s your sense of how things are right now. BROWN: My sense is that -- well, if we start with talking about just thatdirection, that protesters are not supposed to assemble after dark. It`skind of baffling. It is a direction that I think that will lead to more problems. And it`s baffling because how do the police officers explain themselves in terms of -- what, you can`t do your job at night? Police officers can`t work at night? And then if you put it in an historical context, this is an area, this is a part of the country that at one time had places called sundown towns. And what sundown towns were a place where African-Americans could not be after sundown. So there`s a historical context to this, and an illogical anti-constitution component to this as well. We have a right to free assembly, all of these actions together. So all of these components together can only lead to more problems with people and the police. MADDOW: Where do you think this goes? Where do you think this ends? Obviously, we are going to have some developments in the case, there will have to be a decision by the prosecuting attorney at one level, about whether or not there will be charges brought in the killing of this youngman. There is probably going to be more information released of some kind about the actual incident. We will probably hear more from eyewitnesses and more of the police side in terms of what they say happened at this event. That stuff will happen on a factual basis. That stuff will trickle out. But what do you think is going to happen in the community and between the police particularly when we see these continuing four days of stand-offsnow between people on the street and cops in 
rmored vehicles? BROWN: Well, when the police continue to give directions that leave people no option, I think there`s going to be continued problems within the community. We have -- I mean, the possibility of making certain that someone is going to be indicted on this, people are looking for that. And they`re looking to the county prosecuting attorney`s office. The challenge with the county prosecuting attorney`s office from the community`s perspective is, the county`s prosecuting attorney`s office needs to be examined the same way that the Ferguson police department would. The Ferguson department has 53 police officers, three African-American. The county prosecuting attorney`s office also reflects similar numbers. So what faith or what faith can the community have in a determination coming from the prosecutes attorney`s office that there will be a fair examination and a factual examination and an honest examination of what happened with the killing of mike Brown? MADDOW: Are there issues beyond specifically the numerical diversity in the prosecutor`s office that have led to concerns in the community about whether or not this prosecutor can be counted on to bring justice in a racially charged case like this? BROWN: From my own experience, like you said, I`m an attorney, and one of the first jobs I applied for was prosecuting attorney in the county -- prosecuting attorney`s office. And when I applied, they were interested in me, and they wanted to hire me. But they said to me, now, Lizz, if we give you this job, you have to understand that there may -- you may hear people using the n word, are you OK with that? So that gives you kind of the sense of the atmosphere of that office. So should we have -- can we have faith in that? It remains to be seen. And you also can look at the history of the prosecuting attorney`s office in terms of the African-Americans they allow to serve on the journey. This office, under (INAUDIBLE), under Bob McCullough has been challenged legally again and again with the strikes they use to keep African-Americans from serving on the journey in order that the prosecuting attorney gets a conviction. That`s their practice. That`s what buzz west taught Bob McCullough and that office. So what can we expect? I think it`s problematic? MADDOW: Lizz Brown, columnist for the St. Louis American providing some very disturbing and helpful context in understanding this. Thanks very much for being with us. Nice to have you here. BROWN: Thank you. MADDOW: All right, lots ahead tonight. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: This was the scene earlier tonight as reporters staked out a birthday party on the island of Martha`s Vineyard where President Obama spent in part of his vacation tonight. President Obama was supposed to be on vacation until the end of next week, but the White House has now announced somewhat cryptically that he is going to be coming back to D.C. early, at least for a day. Why is that? That`s next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: President Obama of course is on vacation this week, but given the state of the world. This has turned out to be more of a working vacation than true time off. Take Monday, for example, the president was technically on vacation, but he came out at around 5:00 Monday afternoon to deliver a formal statement about the latest developments in Iraq. Earlier in the day, he had a briefing with his national security adviser Susan Rice, about a range of topics including Gaza. That morning the president held a phone call with the Italian prime minister to discuss the Ebola outbreak. Also then a phone call with the president of Ukraine to discuss concerns about the potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. President Obama has been able to conduct all of this really high level business from the confines of his rented Martha`s Vineyard vacation home. But even though his vacation goes until next Sunday, the 24th of August. The White House has announced now, that President Obama is going to be leaving Martha`s Vineyard early. He is leaving this Sunday the 17th to return to the White House. And it`s a mystery at this point as to why the president is returning to Washington in the middle of his vacation. They`re not saying why. I mean, Congress is out of town, so it`s not like there`s any pending legislationthey`re trying to get through that they`ll have to sign. It is not like Congress has bothering to authorize all these troops we just sent to Iraq or anything. The Supreme Court has ended its current session so there is no Supreme Court decisions were awaiting. The president has been able to do all this high level national security stuff from vacation. So why does he have tocome back to D.C.? In the news industry, one of the things that often happens is that someone gets a tip or hears a rumor that some big thing is about to happen or some big political decision is about to be made. In different news outlets have different sources in different places. And sometimes when you try to report out that tip, sources in the government with direct knowledge about that rumored thing, they`ll essentially try to waive you off of it, right? They will say, no. This thing you`re hearing is not right. Even if they`re not willing to tell you that On the Record, they`ll essentially nudge you away from something, alright? If they feel like you`re barking up the wrong tree. Now, that potentially is a way to trick the media out of covering a real story. But when it`s not a trick, it can be a real indication that the rumors are wrong. And the same principle applies in reverse. The same principle applies when the rumors are not wrong. Sources go out of their way to knock, waive you off of what you`ll be hearing, they won`t confirm this thing you heard. But they also won`t scream bloody murder about how wrong it is. And that`s not On the Record reporting. But in this business, that is often the indication you are looking for that you in fact are on the right track. Well, right now, the country and the political world have been waiting to see what President Obama is going to do on immigration, right? The White House has said, the president will announced by the end of the summer, what he intends to do to change the immigration system on his own by executive action without Congress. And this is one of those cases where the scuttlebutt that he`s going to do something really big, something really dramatic on this issue. Those rumors are not being met with hair on fire denials and aggressive waving off by people who might in the position to know. In fact, quite the opposite. Immigration advocates have been pushing President Obama to go big, right? They`re looking for him to defer deportation for millions of immigrants, to basically shut down the deportation system for anybody who doesn`t have criminal involvement. The Republican response to that prospect has been to argue not that they don`t want to President Obama to make that sort of policy change. Republicans have argued that he can`t make that sort of change. They said it would be illegal if he even tried. House speaker John Boehner has said if President Obama took that sort of executive action, quote, ""he will be sealing the deal on his legacy of lawlessness."" And while those two sides battle it out publicly, the go big side and thatwould be illegal side, Democratic groups that are close to the White House now seem to be quietly greasing the skids to prepare America for the possibility the White House really is about to do something big. ""The Huffington Post"" Sam Stein reporting today that the highly connected Democratic research from American bridge appears to have just laid the ground work for President Obama to take major action. They released 20-page memo explaining what that kind of action would mean, defending the president`s right to do it. They debunk the conservative argument thatthis president has taken more executive action than his predecessors, he hasn`t. He report lays out all the times his immediate predecessors, Republican presidents and Democratic presidents have themselves used executive actions specifically on immigration. Like in 1987, when Ronald Reagan eased deportation for 200,000 people from Nicaragua or in 1990 when George H. W. Bush ease deportation for Chinese students. The memo from American Bridge lays out Republican and democratic presidents on their own have taken executive action to change the immigration system, to defer deportation for undocumented immigrants who are already here. The same thing president Obama is reportedly now considering and that pro-immigrant groups are encouraging him to do on a very large scale. This has the feel of Democrats laying the ground work for something big that`s about to happen and it happens at the same time the president is about to jet back to Washington for something they won`t say what in the middle of his summer vacation. What`s going on here and who knows about it? Joining us is somebody who might. Brad Woodhouse, president of the well connected Democratic super PAC American Bridge which just released that report supporting the idea of President Obama taking big-time action here. And Mr. Woodhouse is the former communication director for the DNC. Thanks for being here, Brad. Nice to see you. BRAD WOODHOUSE, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN BRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me. MADDOW: Is it fair for me to describe you as well connected, as being on the same wavelength as the White House on this? WOODHOUSE: Well, I think so. I mean, look, the president sent these signals. I mean, it`s pretty obvious that, especially in the aftermath of this fiasco of John Boehner and the Republican House leaving town, unable to do their own border package. Then he comes to the podium and says the president may have to take his open action. And then they pass a bill to basically deport everyone indiscriminately. And then left the president as the president said no choice. Now, John Boehner said, unprecedented lawlessness. And you know, we`re an organization that really dives into research and facts, and we`re like, wait a minute, that doesn`t sound right. I mean, some of us were alivewhen Ronald Reagan took action on immigration executive action, when George H. W. Bush, when George W. Bush did it. So we went about this. It turned out to be not hard, but yes, we are trying to lay the ground work. We want to provide this president, the White House, Democrats, immigration groups, what they need to make the case. Because what they`ve said about this president and executive action is wrong. Not to mention the fact that their position on immigration is wrong and is hurting them in the party. MADDOW: Are you, as an organization, advocating that the president do that or do you think that President Obama is about to do that and therefore,you`re trying to sort of texture the ground ahead of him so that it lands in a more advantageous way? WOODHOUSE: Well, I think there`s a little bit of both. I mean, we as an organization, you know, do support immigration reform. I think Democrats nearly across the board support action. Congress, we believe, should take action. I think we`ve all believed that. But it`s clear this Congress won`t. I mean, John Boehner is literally strangled by the tea party. You know, John Boehner and Reince Priebus, again, this cycling Congress saying, you know, we didn`t do something to reach out Latinos. They shoved Latinos farther and farther away from the Republicans party. They have created a perfect storm where the president can come in not only do the right thing, but a really smart political thing. And in fact, I think it`s going to set the Republicans back quite a bit politically with this community and it`sgoing to be a real problem going into 2016. MADDOW: It`s going to be fascinating to see how big the president does decide to go if he`s going to do this. They said we would hear by the end of the summer. WOODHOUSE: Getting close. MADDOW: Exactly. President of American Bridge super PAC, thanks very much for being with us. I appreciate it. WOODHOUSE: Thank you, Rachel. MADDOW: All right. We got more ahead tonight, actually on the situation tonight, the ongoing situation tonight in Ferguson, Missouri. Stay with us. We`ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: So we have more breaking news tonight from Ferguson, Missouri, where police today responded to a peaceful daytime protest in full riot gear and S.W.A.T. gear with an armored vehicle with the roof mounted gunner. That apparently was handed down from the military police in Ferguson, Missouri. Of course, they have been protesting a police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old this weekend. Within the last hour, MSNBC has spoken with two reporters who were not protesting but who were arrested in Ferguson while reporting on the protest this tonight. Ryan J. Reilly from the ""Huffington Post"" and Wesley Lowery from ""the Washington Post."" We have spoken both of them in the past hour. Those reporters are post detained and roughed up a little, but then released. And then moments ago, police began firing tear gas into another protesting crowd in Ferguson. This picture comes from Christina Coleman, a reporter at NBC`s local affiliate, KFDK. Our reporter John Swayne from ""the Guardian"" sends this picture. He says police are telling people they must leave immediately, that what`s going on right now in Ferguson is quote ""no longer a peaceful protest."" We`re on day four in Ferguson and from the clouds of tear gas, this does not seem to be ratcheting down. That does it for us tonight, but there`s much more now on the situation in Ferguson tonight from ""THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL"".Good evening, Lawrence.LAWRENCE O`DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: Rachel, one of those reporters who just got hit with teargas is going to join us right away.MADDOW: Good.O`DONNELL: Thanks, Rachel.MADDOW: Thanks.",NA,NA,Read the transcript to the Wednesday show,"DatePublished is the updated date, not the original publishing date"
MSN,msn3,http://ori.msnbc.msn.com/id/55850133/ns/msnbc-all_in_with_chris_hayes/,"All In With Chris Hayes, Monday, August 11th, 2014",NA,08/12/2014,04/22/2016,"CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: Good evening from New York. I`m Chris 
Hayes. 

And we begin tonight with a startling news that actor Robin Williams 
has died of an apparent suicide. Williams` press representative Mara 
Buxbaum confirming, quote, ""Robin Williams passed away this morning. He`s 
battling severe depression of late. This is a tragic and sudden loss. The 
family respectfully asks for their privacy as they grieve during this very
difficult time.""

The Marin County sheriffs office coroner division establishing this 
grim events through this timeline: 11:55 a.m. local time, Marin County 
communications received a 911 telephone call reporting a male adult had 
been located unconscious and not breathing inside his residence in Tiburon, 
California. Police and emergency personnel were dispatched at 12:02 p.m. 
local time. Male subject was pronounced dead identified as Robin Williams 
age 63. 

An investigation into the cause, manner and circumstances of the death
is currently under way. The sheriff`s office coroner division suspects the 
death to be a suicide due to asphyxia.

Police say Williams was last seen alive at his residence where he 
resides with his wife at approximately 10:00 p.m. last night. Williams` 
wife Susan Schneider said in a statement this morning, ""I lost my husband 
and best friend while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and 
beautiful human beings. I`m utterly heartbroken. As he`s remembered, it`s 
our hope the focus is not on Robin`s death, of the countless moment of joy 
and laughter he gave to Williams."" 

Williams` career is indeed legendary. His films have a total U.S. box 
office gross of more than $3 billion, but that number fails to grasp the 
breadth of his genius as a standup comedian, an actor in both television 
and film across decades and decades. He dazzled TV audiences in ""Mork & 
Mindy,"" which launched him into national prominence. He took on inspiring 
and serious roles in films like ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Dead Poets 
Society"", as well as delirious bravado performances in ""Good Morning, 
Vietnam"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and performed a standup routine.

Joining me now on the phone is David Edelstein, film critic for ""New 
York Magazine"".

And, David, this is really crushing to hear this. I have to say, 
maybe it`s some kind of generational point, but I find this one really, 
really, really, really hurts. 

DAVID EDELSTEIN, NEW YORK MAGAZINE (via telephone): It hurts 
terribly. And I think the devastation of hearing that he`s taken his life 
is -- imagine that a man who did as much as he did (AUDIO GAP) reminded us, 
remained in his own mind unfulfilled. 

And maybe in a way he was unfulfilled. Think back to those `70s and 
the early `80s, you think of someone whose mind seemed to work faster than 
anyone alive. And possibly did. I mean, when you saw him when he got
going on talk shows, it really seemed as if the jokes were being beamed in 
from UFOs. You didn`t know where he was coming up with this stuff. 

And I`m afraid to say that, and I saw him do standup and he was -- he
was miraculous. He was superhuman. But you know, I don`t know that movies 
ever really fulfilled him in the way that I wish they had. I wish -- I 
wish we lived at a time when movies could be looser, could accommodate the 
kinds of spontaneity that he had. 

In a weird way, he never found, you know how Will Ferrell works with a
guy named Adam McKay. They create an improvisatory feeling on the set. I 
don`t think Robin Williams ever found, ever quite found that on screen.

HAYES: There`s always something about Williams -- I was -- my mother 
always loved Robin Williams. Sort of been a devoted fan through her eyes 
and there was always, of course, something about his presence that was so 
manic. I mean, that was what he was channeling when he was doing his best 
work. It was the mania being unleashed, like watching a dancing flame.
And you didn`t know -- 

EDELSTEIN: It was. It would be very dark as well. And I don`t think 
-- you know, he -- after ""Good Will Hunting"", he has roles where he was a 
kind of a zany humanist ""Patch Adams"", where he would entertain children 
dying of cancer. There was an attempt on screen, on the big screen, at 
least, to try to bottle that energy and maybe try to domesticate it, try to 
take what was scary brilliant out of it. 

Now, that`s not to say he didn`t deliver -- I mean, I think if you 
watch ""The Fisher King"" again, you see he played a role as a kind of Don 
Quixote figure, kind of mad visionary that I think caught some of that 
manic energy, but also a lot of the darkness. That`s a performance that I 
don`t think is sufficiently appreciated. 

""Moscow in the Hudson"" -- 

HAYES: Great film. 

EDELSTEIN: He gets the soul of a Russian ex-patriot, deep melancholy.
I think he connected with that role. 

It was also surprisingly effective later in his career when he was 
cast as a serial killer in the film ""Insomnia"" opposite Al Pacino. And it 
was startling the way he seemed to relish having a chance to swear on 
screen and to be nasty and cruel, you know? Those were sides of his 
personality that didn`t show up on screen. 

HAYES: The kind of danger you talk about, feeling when you were 
watching him, particularly in his improvisational mode, not necessarily in 
the confines of scripted films. 

Although sometimes in some of those roles that really comes across -- 
I want to play this first appearance on Carson`s ""Tonight Show,"" where you 
can feel that sense of watching someone who doesn`t himself know what will 
happen next. You feel it and there`s an exhilaration and terror at the 
same moment. This was kind of how I think of him. 

This is Robin Williams on the ""Tonight Show"" for the first time. Take 
a look.

JOHNNY CARSON, THE TONIGHT SHOW: People always think performers don`t 
get nervous. 

ROBIN WILLIAMS, ACTOR: Not at all. No, really. Not me. No way. 

CARSON: Is there some reason you don`t -- the fact you get nervous -- 

WILLIAMS: I suffer from severe dyslexia, too. I was the only child 
on my block on Halloween to go trick-or-trout. 

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: Here comes the young Williams boy again. Better get some 
fish. 

There you go. Say hi to your mom and dad. 

(LAUGHTER)

CARSON: Where is home for you? Or did you come from a home? 

WILLIAMS: All the people in the institution, Tommy, if you haven`t 
taken your medication yet, it`s going to be fine. 

CARSON: Be back at 12:00. 

WILLIAMS: How are you, Mr. Williams? I`m real fine. 

Look at this thing. Look, flipper. 

Right now, there`s a someone going, what are you doing? 

Relax, relax, relax. It`s OK. You`re on TV. You`re a nice man. You 
won`t hurt me. 

CARSON: No.

WILLIAMS: Thank you. 

Don`t be afraid. The sores went away. 

CARSON: The same -- 

WILLIAMS: Real men can stand up to herpes.

HAYES: Everything there, David, all the nerves seems completely 
authentic. It`s like this person channeling all the kind of crazily 
intense neuronal energy into what he was doing in the moment, it feels
unsettling and you cannot turn away from it. 

EDELSTEIN: It`s a high wire act that he played and he did it better 
having seen him live, I can tell you he did it better than anyone. 

But let`s not forget also he came of age in Hollywood at really the 
height of the cocaine epidemic, and he was famously quoted as saying that 
cocaine is God`s way of telling you, you make too much money. 

And I fear that like so many people, he felt at a certain point, he 
was burning so brightly he had to have something to keep his confidence up. 

And he never -- I don`t know -- he sort of is like Robert de Niro, I 
think was maybe a buddy of his in that -- I think de Niro`s talked about 
it, too. There was a way in which they burned something essential out of 
them doing that. 

And, of course, his -- you always -- when you heard him on talk shows,
he would speak with this great melancholy -- 

HAYES: Yes. 

EDELSTEIN: -- about that period in his life when he burned so 
brightly and yet it was also accompanied by insane terror. Oh, the terror 
of -- to be performing at that level and try to keep it up. Can you 
imagine? Because he was better than anybody. 

How -- where do you go from what you just saw on Carson? Where do you 
go from that? How can you ever capture that? How can you be sure of 
capturing that? 

HAYES: David Edelstein from ""New York"" magazine -- thank you, David. 
I really appreciate it. 

EDELSTEIN: You`re welcome. Thank you.

HAYES: Joining me on the phone is Mark Harris, writer for 
""Entertainment Weekly."" 

And, you know, Mark, I was going back through some of the most recent 
Robin Williams interviews and what struck me was a kind of palpable sense 
that he didn`t feel -- the way that we`re all talking right now about Robin 
Williams` career as being remarkable and spanning decades and award winning 
roles and brilliantly talented, that he didn`t feel that way about himself. 
It comes through in the most recent interviews about his career, about his 
finances, about the fact he`d gone back to rehab in 2006. 

There`s just this massive gap between -- and I`m always struck by this 
in one of these moments, the gap of perception between people who are 
watching from the outside, what it is like to live inside the head of that 
person. 

MARK HARRIS, ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY (via telephone): I think that`s 
right. And, you know, as stunned and sad as we all are, in a way, we are 
less surprised than we might be if this was news about someone who did not 
wear his heart on his sleeve as much as Robin Williams did. I mean, he was 
not someone who concealed what he was going through. Whether it was 
struggles with substance abuse or health issues or emotional issues or 
insecurity. 

You -- he was open about many of the difficulties through the years 
that he faced. And I think that kind of openness also extended to many of 
his performances. I mean, over the years especially after ""Mork & Mindy"" 
in the early `80s when he started his career as a movie actor, there were 
time in the lesser movies he made when we would recoil a little from the 
source sort of sad clown thing he was often forced to do, the sort of 
sentimentality through the laughter like ""Patch Adams"". 

But I think in a way, in those parts Williams was communicating 
something that was very, very true to him. Which is that comedy for him 
was a way of masking pain, coping with pain, overriding pain, expressing 
pain, aside from all of the other really brilliant aspects about him as a 
comic artist and performing artist. He was -- he was a very true guy. I 
mean, there was real honesty. Not just anarchy, but truth in his comedy. 

HAYES: Do you think we will remember him for his films? What role do 
you think we will remember him most for? 

HARRIS: Well, you know, it`s funny, I was listening to David 
Edelstein earlier said that movies failed for the most part to harness the 
really unique, free-wheeling, fast-moving anarchic talent that he had. And 
I mostly agree with that, he always seemed a little hemmed in by having to 
just play one part. But I think in some ways the big exception to that is
the movie that you didn`t actually see him if which was ""Aladdin."" You 
know, that performance as the genie we was -- 

HAYES: That`s right. 

HARRIS: -- one of the rare cases where the movie was able to keep up 
with him and it`s sort of a tribute to the fact that Robin Williams made 
everyone else look slow. That it took a cartoon to keep pace with him. 

HAYES: Mark Harris from ""Entertainment Weekly"" -- thank you so much, 
Mark. 

HARRIS: Thank you. 

HAYES: If you`re watching this right now and you have had thoughts 
about suicide and are depressed, I want to read this very important number 
to you. It is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. And it is 1-800-
273-8255. 

They are there at any second in the darkest, darkest, darkest moments. 
They are there. They are a phone call away and you can pick up that phone 
right now, right now. And call them. 

There is much more -- there is much more news tonight. We will be 
back with more of it after this break.

CROWD: Hands up, don`t shoot! Hands up, don`t shoot! Hands up, 
don`t shoot! Hands up, don`t shoot! 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: My hands are up, don`t shoot. The chant of protesters in 
Ferguson, Missouri, after an unarmed teenager is shot and killed by a 
police officer. 

We`ll bring the latest in an interview with the young man who says he 
saw it all. That`s next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HAYES: Outrage in Ferguson, Missouri, today, after police shot and 
killed an unarmed teenager Saturday afternoon in broad daylight. 

Here`s what we know about the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. 

After Brown was walking with another individual on a road near the 
Canfield Apartments in Ferguson, a northern suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. 
After an altercation, key elements which are disputed by police, Brown was 
shot and killed by a police officer. 

Police do not dispute that a police officer who has not been publicly 
identified shot and killed Michael Brown. Police officer is on 
administrative leave, pending an investigation. There was no dispute that 
Michael Brown was unarmed. 

As for that altercation, an individual who said he was accompanying 
Michael Brown, Dorin Johnson, has said in multiple interviews that he was 
walking in the street with Brown when the police squad car pulled up. The 
officer said to get the F on to the sidewalk he recounted. It was not but
a minute from our destination and we`d be off the street, Johnson said. 

Again, this is the man who said he was with Michael Brown prior to and
during the altercation. Johnson told CBC News that after a pause, the 
officer reversed his car and the following ensued. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DORIN JOHNSON, WITNESSING THE SHOOTING: He pulled up on the side of 
us, he tried to push his door open but we were so close to it that it 
ricocheted off us and bounced back toward him and I guess got him a little 
upset. At that time, he reached out the win toe. He didn`t get out of the 
car. He just reached his arm out the window and grabbed my friend around 
the neck. 

As he was try to choke my friend, he was trying to get away, an 
officer then reached out, he grabbed his arm to pull him into the car. So, 
it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car. He`s trying to pull 
away. At no time the officer said that he was going to do anything until
he pulled out his weapon. His weapon was drawn. He said, I`ll shoot you, 
or I`m going to shoot. 

And in the same moment, the first shot went off and we looked at him. 
He was shot and there was blood coming from him and he took off running. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Johnson said he, himself, ducked and hid, but that Brown kept 
running and the officer got out of the car. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOHNSON: His weapon was already drawn when he got out of the car. He 
shot again and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his 
hands in the air, he started to get down but the officer still approached 
with his weapons drawn, and he fired several more shots.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Various news accounts refer to multiple witnesses, many of 
those witnesses unnamed, but one who is willing to offer account on camera, 
Piaget Crenshaw, described the event this way. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PIAGET CRENSHAW, WITNESS TO SHOOTING: I heard gunshots fired, and 
I`m, like, oh my goodness, what`s going on? I gathered all my things and 
looked back out the window. At this moment, he`s running, he`s chasing 
after Michael down the street and gunshots are being fired repeatedly as 
well. I went from that window to my balcony where I then saw Michael.
He`s running this way. He turns his body toward this way. Hands in the
air. Being compliant. He gets shot in his face and chest and goes down 
and dies. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Police officer offered a different account. As described by 
St. Louis County police chief John Belmar.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOHN BELMAR, POLICE CHIEF: The officer had an encounter with two 
individuals, one of whom is Mr. Brown who is walking down the road in 
Canfield Apartments. He spoke to the individuals about getting off of the 
street and perhaps taking the sidewalk. One of the individuals complied. 
The other did not. 

In fact, as the officer decided to get out of his car to continue the 
conversation, he was pushed back into the car and there was a physical
confrontation in that car where, in fact, there was a struggle over the 
officer`s gun. We do know, for example, that there was one shot fired 
within the car and then we`re talking a look at the rest of the details of
the investigation at this point to determine exactly what happened once
police officer exited the car. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: As the FBI today announced its own investigation, many 
questions remain unanswered, including how many shots were fired and how 
many hit Michael Brown. 

In the wake of Brown`s death, outrage, protests continued today in the
St. Louis area for the third day running, protesters chanting, ""no justice, 
no peace"". Many protests including yesterday`s were marked by intense 
interactions with the police. Some instances last night in Ferguson, 
rioting and looting erupted. 

Alongside the protests, community meetings continued to take place in 
the St. Louis area. A makeshift memorial sprung up for Michael Brown and 
the family of the 18-year-old who`s planning to begin college classes 
today, called for justice, not violence. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

LESLEY MCSPADDEN, VICTIM`S MOTHER: The violence needs to stop. The 
support is all needed -- all needed -- but not the violence. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Joining me now is Dorin Johnson, who says he saw the shooting 
and his attorney, Freeman Bosley Jr. 

Mr. Johnson, you say you were walking with Michael at that moment. 
Were there other people on the street that could have witnessed or 
corroborated your account? Because, obviously, the police are telling a 
very different story than what you and some other witnesses have said.

JOHNSON: Yes. At the moment, at the time when we were in the street, 
before the officer pulled all the way on the side, no, I did not see 
anyone. My eyes were not looking for anyone. My ears were open, just 
talking to my friends. So, before the officer said his first words -- no, 
I didn`t not see anyone. 

HAYES: How quickly did this escalate? It sounds like from your 
account that it was sort of casual comment made by a police officer for the 
two of you to get off the street and it sounds like there was gunshots 
within, what, 60 seconds? 

What was the timeframe of this encounter like? 

JOHNSON: The timeframe was a little just like you said, 60 seconds or 
less. It sped up so quickly. It got out of hands real quick, like, it 
wasn`t even a minute like you said, 60 seconds. 

HAYES: Did Michael reach and struggle the officer`s gun as the police 
are saying he did? 

JOHNSON: That`s incorrect, sir. He did not reach for a weapon at 
all. He did not reach for the officer`s weapon at all. 

HAYES: You were able to see this interaction? 

JOHNSON: Yes, correct. 

HAYES: Were you scared in that moment? 

JOHNSON: Not scared yet, but more shocked at how the officer 
approached us. It really -- it`s just more shocking than scared at that 
moment. 

HAYES: Mr. Bosley, have you or your client, have you been approached
by investigators? It seems like this is very key eyewitness testimony. 

FREEMAN BOSLEY, JR., ATTORNEY FOR DORIN JOHNSON: Well, what is
interesting about this is that we have not, as a matter of fact, the NAACP 
through (INAUDIBLE) contacted the authorities and police department 
yesterday to make us available and make Mr. Johnson available and at that 
point, they said they had some other things going on. They did not want to 
interview Mr. Johnson at that time and also wanted to indicate that Mr. 
Johnson ran away and was not really a person that witnessed everything that 
was going on. Of course, we know that is not correct. 

HAYES: Well, Mr. Johnson, is there any doubt you were there with 
Michael at that moment? 

JOHNSON: Sir, I did not leave until the last shot was fired, until I 
confirmed that my friend was not moving, that he was dead. That`s when I 
took off running. 

HAYES: Is there a possibility based on your account of how things 
went down, do you believe that, say, a dash camera from the police 
officer`s video would change in terms of how things were set up spatially? 

JOHNSON: No, the way the officer approached us, if there was a dash 
cam on his car, all that it would have gotten is me and my friend walking 
in the street, and that`s it. 

HAYES: Because the actual shots fired and ,Michael`s death came when 
he was behind the police car, am I correct? 

JOHNSON: His death came from behind the police car, but the initial 
shot we were on the side of the driver door of the police car. 

HAYES: What was going through your head as you are now, you say, 
crouched behind a car watching a police officer chase your friend? 

JOHNSON: I`m fearing for my life at this moment because at this time 
the first shot had already been fired and I notice my friend had been shot. 
I`ve been in situations before where gunfire has let out and I really don`t 
take fondness (ph) of guns. 

So, I feared for my life, scared. I didn`t know what to do, and 
shocked. My body couldn`t move at that moment. 

HAYES: How close were you, Michael? 

JOHNSON: I didn`t fully have to extend my arm out to touch Michael or 
the officer. I was that close that I could touch both of them, without 
fully extending my arms. 

HAYES: Did Michael at any point strike out, lay hands on, assault the 
officer? 

JOHNSON: He did not initially assault the officer. I didn`t see it, 
at no point in time while I was standing in the officer`s driver door 
window where he touched the officer or any type of threatening way. Not 
whatsoever. 

HAYES: How close friends were you and Michael? Were you tight? 

JOHNSON: We weren`t so much as close friends, childhood, but the time 
I met him, because I had recently -- I had just moved over in the 
apartments. When I met him, we just became good friends. 

HAYES: What kind of person was he? 

JOHNSON: He was a very cool person. Quiet. Calm. And gentle. 

HAYES: Dorin Johnson and Freeman Bosley Jr., his attorney -- thank 
you, gentlemen, both. I really appreciate it. 

JOHNSON: You`re welcome. 

BOSLEY: Thank you.

JOHNSON: Thank you. 

HAYES: All right. The breadth of the protests in the community raise 
the question, now, of course, of what is next. Not just in this 
investigation, but in police community relations.

Meanwhile, St. Louis County police chief John Belmar says he supports 
the parallel FBI investigation. Of course, the shooting that we saw this 
weekend comes on the heels of several high-profile incidences of people 
being shot by, or killed by police across the country. 

Of course, the death of Eric Garner, which was ruled a homicide here 
in New York City in Staten Island after he was first questioned by police
for the charge of selling untaxed cigarettes.

There has also been a whole lot of different information released out 
in the wake of the death of Michael Brown. First, accusations that he had 
been busted for shop lifting. So far there has been no corroboration of 
that. A lot of outreach, too, about how he`s been portrayed, both in the 
images that have been circulated about him and what people have done to try 
to presume that they knew what kind of person Michael was.

Joining me now is MSNBC contributor Goldie Taylor who is in Ferguson 
tonight. 

And, Goldie, what are things like in Ferguson right now? 

GOLDIE TAYLOR, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: You know, the tensions are still 
fairly high, although not quite as high as last night. I hear that there`s 
an incident at a nearby mall, but we`re not certain that it`s related to 
the recent unrest. 

HAYES: What is the context for what we are seeing in Ferguson County? 
It seems to me that the -- there`s some buildup that has happened before 
this incident happened over the weekend. 

TAYLOR: Well, I will tell you this, that north St. Louis County is 
comprised of dozens of small jurisdictions, tiny townships, 20,000 people 
or less. And that those tiny townships over the last 30 to 40 years were
all white. 

But now, those townships are increasingly more African-American as in 
Ferguson`s case, some 85 percent, but if you look at the arrest rate, if 
you look at the traffic stops, disproportionately, they are African-
American, especially when you start to look at citations and arrests and
outcomes. 

And so, you`re starting to see some real tension begin to flare up 
between what`s a fairly white leadership in terms of mayors and police 
chiefs and a black population and there`s a bit of distrust from both 
sides. 

HAYES: Is there confidence among folks there, and I think I know the 
answer to this, but I will ask it, about there being a genuine and thorough 
investigation? I mean, obviously, I cannot say and I cannot be the arbiter 
of the disputing accounts between the man you just saw who said he was with 
Michael when he was shot and the police. 

TAYLOR: Sure. 

HAYES: If it is the case that what happened happened in the way that 
witnesses have described it, it seems very, frankly, clearly a crime. 

TAYLOR: I spent a good deal of time with him today, but I also spent 
a good deal of time with community leaders from the NAACP and other 
community groups here today. I`ve been out here on the scene. I think
that there`s still a great deal of distrust from the community for this 
investigation. 

I think there was a bit of relief, though, that the FBI has come in 
and either taken over the investigation or I think it`s a little bit 
unclear as to whether they`re running a parallel investigation.

But we do know at the very least that there will be a Department of 
Justice monitor on this. I think the level of skepticism for the Ferguson 
police even extends to the St. Louis County police unfortunately. And so, 
I think those police departments and others have a lot of work to do to 
rebuild their ties, to rebuild their binds with these communities that they 
are sworn to serve and protect. 

HAYES: There is a sense, I mean, this is now -- there have been a 
number of high-profile incidents in which young black men, unarmed, have 
been killed. Obviously Trayvon Martin comes to mind. There was an 
incident recently in a Wal-Mart store with a young man who is buying a toy 
weapon. 

We saw Eric Garner`s death here in New York. And, there is this 
sense, and you saw it just explode across social media this weekend, what 
do we have to do to say that we are worthy of respect and dignity and life? 

TAYLOR: You know, I think that, that is -- that really is the center 
question. I grew up here in St. Louis. It still remains one of the most 
segregated towns that I have run into in my lifetime. My parents frankly 
told my brothers how to deal with themselves or at least attempt to deal 
with themselves when they were in all-white communities. 

But, they were not even safe in their own communities where there was 
higher, you know, proportions of crime. This is about the value of life. 
When we look at investigation, when we look at how people are prosecuted, 
when we look at outcomes in terms of prison sentences; even when we look at 
the kind of media coverage that, you know, these deaths receive, they are 
quite different when you begin to look at race, at gender, at income. Our 
justice system, unfortunately, it has a color. 

HAYES: MSNBC Contributor Goldie Taylor in Ferguson, Missouri, 
tonight. Thank you very much. 

TAYLOR: Thank you, Chris. 

HAYES: The unraveling of Iraq, that is ahead. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HAYES: Updating our lead story tonight. The death of actor Robin 
Williams. Marin County Sheriff`s Office is investigating the cause, manner 
and circumstances of Williams` death. But, Sheriff`s Office Coroner 
Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia. 

20th Century Fox Television, which produced Robin Williams` most 
recent sitcom as released a statement tonight saying, quote, ""Robin 
Williams was a comedy giant. And, although, we only knew him personally 
for a season, he was warm, funny, a true professional. His cast and crew, 
both, loved him and loved working with him. And, our hearts go out to his 
family and friends. He was one of a kind."" Williams had been battling 
depression, according to a statement from a press representative. Robin 
Williams was 63. Oh, captain, my captain. We will be back. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PRES. BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: As I said when I
authorized these operations, there is no American Military solution to the 
larger crisis in Iraq. The only lasting solution is for Iraqis to come 
together and form an inclusive government, one that represents the 
legitimate interests of all Iraqis and one that can unify the country`s 
fight against ISIL. Today, Iraq took a promising step forward in this 
critical effort. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: President Obama praising the Iraqis for making important 
progress toward forming a unity government today, as U.S. airstrikes on 
ISIS targets continued today in Northern Iraq. Today, the Iraqi President 
nominated Shiite Politician, Haider Al-Abadi as the new prime minister 
ending months of political deadlock since the country held parliamentary 
elections in April. 

Now, according to Iraq`s constitution, that gives the new prime 
minister 30 days to form a president and means current Prime Minister Nouri 
Al-Maliki has 30 days until he is out of the job. President Obama and Vice 
President Biden called Al-Albadi today to offer their support and urge him 
to be as conclusive as possible. That will not be easy if Maliki has 
anything to say about it. 

In a televised appearance today, he condemned the appointment as 
unconstitutional, decrying the U.S. for supporting it and rather ominously 
reminding Iraqis he remains their commander in chief. Last night in 
Baghdad, as he was making another very aggressive speech, additional
security forces deployed around the city and locked down government 
buildings in the green zone. 

Maliki, you may recall, is responsible for the pro-Shia policy seen by 
many as having opened the door to ISIS who courted the disaffected Sunni 
minority in the country. And, if he keeps hanging on to power, Baghdad, it 
seems could be on the verge of a coup. That is just what is happening in 
the capital, OK? Between ostensible allies of the United States Government 
or current and former allies. 

In Northern Iraq, where ISIS has seized large swaths of terror over 
the past two months, U.S. has begun to send weapons directly to Kurdish 
forces, who are fighting back against the brutal Islamist troop. It is a 
bid to keep the momentum headed in the Kurds` direction after U.S. 
airstrikes helped turn things around a bit over the weekend. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DUNCAN GOLESTANI, MSNBC INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Definitely, I 
think there is a sense of something has shifted, because last week here in 
Erbil they were panicking the possibility of ISIS fighters marching on the 
city. Something changed over the weekend. That something was the U.S. 
airstrikes. 

We heard about U.S. Aircraft shooting at a convoy of ISIS fighters 
that was moving on a Kurdish line of defense just outside. That helped 
them. We also heard over the weekend of the Kurdish forces, the Peshmerga 
taking two important towns that are just half an hour away; really key 
strategic towns because they are on the north/south route. 

And, again, they are only able to retake that territory because of the 
U.S. air cover. So, it has been really, really important, but saying that, 
frontlines, they keep on shifting. So, yes, there is optimism up here, but 
the fighting is still raging quite unpredictably all around the country. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: U.S. Military continued its air campaign against ISIS today 
hitting four targets near Mt. Sinjar where ISIS holding siege to tens of 
thousands of Yezidi refugees. Peshmerga, Kurdish forces have managed to 
opened a corridor for some of the Yezidi to escape, but thousands remain 
trapped on the mountain in 100 degree heat with little food and water. Up 
next, why air strikes in Iraq, but not Syria. The Obama doctrine, if there 
is one. We will discuss, ahead. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HAYES: All right, this summer, it really has felt like the world is 
on fire. All right? I mean it just everywhere you look, there seems to be
a war, or disaster, or foreign policy entanglement that seems head 
scratchingly impossible to deal with. Of course, the critics of the 
president are happy to take a little victory lap and point to the president 
as the source of this. And, that is the question. 

What exactly is the president and the U.S.` role in a Middle East that 
seems aflame right now and a world that seems teetering on instability, and 
would it be possible for the U.S. to do anything to make it better or was 
the U.S. trying to, quote, ""Make it better the source of that instability 
in the first place?"" 

Joining me now, Zainab Salbi, founder of Women For Women International 
and Ali Gharib, writer and foreign policy analyst. Iraq is such a 
complicated situation and terrible in so many ways. I mean, the Yezidi, 
just the raw footage of these people that are -- let`s just be very clear 
about the kind of moral stakes here. I mean this is just unapologetic 
genocide being committed against people because of their faith. 

ZAINAB SALBI, WOMEN FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL FOUNDER: Yes.

HAYES: There is a group of people that wants to extinguish every last 
one of them because of the God they worship. 

SALBI: Absolutely. 

HAYES: Right? 

SALBI: That includes Christians as well. 

HAYES: And, it includes Christians as well. 

SALBI: Yes.

HAYES: And, at the same time, I cannot help but watch this and think 
there is something Shakespearean about Barack Obama, the man who is 
President of the United States because he opposed the Iraq war, when 
basically the entire governing class of the country did not, is now back 
ordering air strikes in Iraq. 

ALBI: Well --

HAYES: As an Iraqi, what does this look like? Does this look like 
the U.S. being indecisive? Does it look like the U.S. doing a good job of
managing an impossible situation? Or does it look like the U.S. making 
things worse? 

SALBI: I think it looks like the U.S. not taking full responsibility 
for it has created. What we are seeing right now has not suddenly 
happened. It is the consequences of the Iraq invasion that happened by 
President Bush. President Obama is a president of a country and he 
continues the legacy of the country. His legacy right now in Iraq is 
constantly too little, too late. Too little, too late. 

HAYES: But, OK. I have heard that from a lot of people. There is a 
sort of synergy between the too little, too late critique that you hear 
from Iraqis and from John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Neocons -- There is an 
agreement on this. There is, though, right? 

SALBI: All right. 

HAYES: My question is, would more earlier be better? Because if 
there was more earlier, my sense is we would be having a whole other set of 
discussions about what a cluster -- 

ALI GHARIB, FOREIGN POLICY ANALYST: What a cluster in defense of 
Iraqis, John McCain and Lindsey Graham are talking about more bombs and not 
more, you know, like diplomatic pushes for stuff like, say, ""Cutting off 
more arms to Maliki unless he creates more inclusive government and things 
like that."" 

SALBI: That is true. I mean the question is, how can the U.S. 
constructively intervene in the Middle East? -- 

HAYES: Right. 

SALBI: -- or not intervene? And, the consistency of that is 
important. We cannot look at Iraq in an isolated way. Iraq and now ISIS 
and the division of the country right now is part of a longer strategy that 
includes Saudi Arabia, that includes Egypt, that includes Syria, and 
Jordan, and all the neighboring countries. 

HAYES: Right.

SALBI: America has to make that constructive decision. We are 
intervening in a constructive way where we look at the region and the 
interconnection of the region or pull out completely and let the region 
handle itself. 

HAYES: Right. So, we are not going too -- I mean the U.S. -- maybe 
that is a possibility, right? I mean, maybe that would be for the best for
everyone, if the troops left Saudi Arabia -- 

GHARIB: But it is not going to happen. 

HAYES: Right, exactly. Like. it is not going to happen. 

SALBI: All right. 

HAYES: So, then the question is -- I mean, because it is striking to 
me, like the Syria question, right? So, now you look at what is happening 
with ISIS. I think everyone looks at ISIS basically across the political 
spectrum in the world and is aghast, right? I mean, I do not -- like -- it 
is ghastly. Everyone looks at ISIS and thinks, ""Oh, my God."" 

GHARIB: Even Al Qaeda. 

HAYES: Even Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is like, ""You guys are too violent 
for us.""

SALBI: Right.

HAYES: Stop it. Stop beheading everyone, right? 

SALBI: But, Al Qaeda is not a moderate group -- 

HAYES: I am not saying they are. But, I am just saying -- So, Ali, 
what I see is I see an interventionist story about this, which we are going 
to get to in a second about a certain critic who gave an interview about
this, which is basically, U.S. not intervening in Syria, not helping the 
moderate opposition, gave rise to ISIS. And, now, I see an anti-
interventionist thing that says, if the U.S. war in Iraq have brought ISIS 
about."" Right? 

GHARIB: Well, at least one of those things is true. And, the problem 
is that this is all a counterfactual argument, right? 

HAYES: Yes. 

GHARIB: It is not clear that had we armed some mythical moderate 
Syrian opposition that we did not know existed and was, you know, just
fragments of little pieces of rebel forces in 2012, would that have stopped 
ISIS rise? Maybe. But, if there is nothing definite about that, but what 
it definitely would have done is flooded the zone with weapons. 

For all we know, those weapons could have gotten in ISIS hand earlier 
than Iraqi troops stripping off their uniforms and abandoning their 
artillery. Because, you know, if you go back and read the news articles 
from 2012, you know, you can go back and read the ""New Yorker,"" John Lee 
Anderson was in Northern Syria and was writing about even how the FSA 
commanders cannot identify which brigades are theirs. They did not know 
what they were, yet alone we go in there and start dispensing weapons. I 
mean it is counterfactual based on a context that never really existed. 

HAYES: But, here is where I feel like we arrived on this summer on 
fire, right? I mean if you look across the region, it just feels like, ""Oh 
my God, it is all burning."" I mean that is how it feels, right?

SALBI: Absolutely.

HAYES: This is not me just like me as an American looking over there. 

SALBI: No. No. It is burning. 

HAYES: That maybe that is just what the world looks like as America 
recedes from the role it is been playing. 

GHARIB: Which is inexorable or there is something we can do about it. 

HAYES: Right. That is the question, like maybe that is just like you 
stare into the void of what this new era looks like, which is the world is 
on fire and the only upside is there are not American troops being burned 
in that fire. 

GHARIB: That is way too pessimistic for me, Chris. But, I mean, I 
think speaking to the issue of their being nonmilitary ways to deal with 
stuffs, you know? Zainab was talking about the Saudis. The Saudis in 
2012, we were begging the Saudis to arm the FSA --

HAYES: Right.

GHARIB: -- which, you know, I think would have still been a task, but 
we were begging them to it and instead what they did is they armed ISIS. 

HAYES: Right. 

GHARIB: And, they helped to create the -- 

HAYES: Thank you, our great ally. 

GHARIB: These are our allies. Yes. 

HAYES: Yes. Zainab Salbi, Founder of Women for Women International 
and Foreign Policy Analyst, Ali Gharib. Thank you very much.

SALBI: Thank you.

HAYES: One somewhat surprising critic or maybe not so surprising 
critic for President Obama`s foreign policy doctrine attacking him for 
being weak. We will talk more about that, next. 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HAYES: Hillary Clinton, who is President Obama`s Secretary of State 
until early this year broke dramatically with the president`s foreign 
policy in an interview published yesterday in the ""Atlantic"" Magazine. 
Many have taken it as a sign Clinton tried to distance herself from the 
president ahead of a potential run for the White House. 

Asked about the Obama doctrine, which is often characterized as, ""Do 
not do stupid stuff."" Clinton replied, ""Great nations need organizing 
principles and do not do stupid stuff is not an organizing principle."" 
While the president has maintained that arming Syrian rebels and deploying 
U.S. troops there, would not help turn the tide in Syria`s bloody civil 
war, Clinton suggested a lack of action gave rise to ISIS, the terror 
group, now rampaging across Iraq.

A failure to help build up a credible fighting force, the people who 
are the originators of the protest against Assad, there were Islamist, 
there were Sectors, there was everything in the middle. The failure to do 
that left a big vacuum, which jihadist have now filled, Clinton said. 

Joining me now is Rick Perlstein, Author of the very new, very 
excellent, ""The Invisible Bridge: The Fall of Nixon and the Rise of 
Reagan."" The latest in his epic trilogy of books in American conservatism. 
One of the great historians we have, working right now. So, here is why I 
have you right now, Rick.

The entire book, the opus that you have just produced which is 
phenomenal, and everyone should read, basically says the 1970s was a period 
of kind of instability. The world felt like it was aflame. America was 
kind of staring into the void caused by Watergate and Vietnam, trying 
wrestling coming to terms of what we were as a nation. 

And, Reagan swept in to say, do not think about all that. We are the 
exceptional city on the hill. We are the greatest nation in the world. 
And, when I read that Clinton interview -- maybe it is just because I have 
been reading your book for the last week, it felt to me she was channeling 
Reagan in a very similar political moment in America. 

RICK PERLSTEIN, AUTHOR, ""THE INVISIBLE BRIDGE"": Yes. I think that 
""The New York Times"" made the same comparison. I think the interview was 
very, very worrisome. I think that when Robert Kagan said that he 
considers Hillary Clinton a fellow neoconservative, that is exactly what he 
was referring to. I think she kind of bolt forward with this hubristic 
notion that America could heal the world through its touch and good 
intentions. 

But, everything bad that has happened in American foreign policy has 
sprung directly from that idea. I mean, when Lyndon Johnson thought he 
could build a TVA in the river delta. You know, 10 years later you have 
58,000 lives of Americans expended and, you have not one but three nations 
laid to waste. And, people were taking a look good -- hard look at that 
hubris in the `70s. And, it was a very salubrious thing. It really 
dismays me that Hillary Clinton has not learned that lesson. 

HAYES: You know, part of this I think that was interesting about the 
Clinton interview with Jeffrey Goldberg, also was the fact that, I think we 
have the tendency to read her through such a political prism that she is
figure trying to calculate her pitch to the political whims of the moment. 
As opposed to like, this is what she believes. Like she -- I think 
everyone looks back at the Iraq war vote and said she voted that way 
because that is the way the politics was, as opposed to that is what she
believe and this is what she believe in this interview, like she really 
does have these views on foreign policy. 

PERLSTEIN: Yes. I think she is been pretty darn consistent and she 
has been on the side of intervention and all these debates in the state 
department. And, the problem with it is, the kind of nuance that Barack
Obama has been trying to introduce into foreign policy really kind of 
speaks to the complexity of the world. 

And, by trying to kind of explain away that complexity, you are going 
to get us into the same blunders over and over again. Now, if it is the 
fact that she wants to govern like Ronald Reagan did in foreign policy, let 
is review that record. It is kind of paradoxical. He only committed 
troops once and that was in tiny Grenada, right?

HAYES: Right.

PERLSTEIN: And, he was the one who was the only president to 
eliminate a class of nuclear weapons. And, he was the one who looked at 
the kind of complicated morass of mutual assured destruction and 
mathematical abstractions that underlie it and said let is get rid of 
nuclear weapons. I would love to see that sort of vision from Hillary 
Clinton. But, by trying to be like Reagan, she might be more like Reagan`s 
rhetoric and less like Reagan`s reality. 

HAYES: Rick Perlstein, the book is ""Invisible Bridge."" Go, go get it 
now. All right, that is ""All In"" for this evening. ""The Rachel Maddow 
Show"" starts right now. Good evening, Rachel. Good to see you again.",NA,NA,Read the transcript from the Monday show,"DatePublished is the updated date, not the original publishing date"
