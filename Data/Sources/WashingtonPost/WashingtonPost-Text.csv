Lesley McSpadden says her son, Michael Brown, had graduated from high school and was headed to college.

McSpadden was speaking at the site of the Saturday killing. She says police have not explained why her son was confronted by the officer. “I would like to see him fired,” McSpadden said Sunday. “I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty.”

Police say the unarmed man was shot multiple times after a scuffle involving the officer and two people. The officer has been put on leave.

The St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation. County Executive Charlie Dooley, who showed up at a protest Sunday during a police news conference, urged calm and said he will request an FBI investigation. U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said Sunday that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had instructed attorneys in the department’s civil rights division to monitor developments.

Police have not disclosed the name of the man who was killed, but family members say it was Brown.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the news conference that an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn’t known, but “it was more than just a couple.” He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer’s gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and was expected to be interviewed later Sunday. Authorities are not sure whether that person was unarmed, Jackson said.

A few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters about the time the news conference was to begin. At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police building, some chanting, “Don’t shoot me,” while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase but didn’t use force; the crowd eventually left.

Protesters outside chanted slogans — “No justice, no peace” and “We want answers” — and some carried signs that read “Stop police terrorism” and “Disarm the police.”

“We’re outraged because yet again a young African American man has been killed by law enforcement,” said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP. “This is an issue everywhere in America. You never believe that this can happen in your town.”

Rioting erupted in Ferguson on Sunday following the day of protests.

“We are currently experiencing a riot,” a police dispatcher said, according to Reuters. He said officers in riot gear responded. 

The Rev. Al Sharpton called the shooting death “very disturbing.” The New York-based civil rights leader said he planned to go to Ferguson to meet with the family Monday night or Tuesday.

Critics have contended that police in the St. Louis area too often target young black men. Statistics on police-involved shootings in the region were not immediately available.

Gaskin made comments Saturday alluding to the 2012 shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges, as well as the New York City man who recently died from a police chokehold.

The officer’s race has not been disclosed. He has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years, Belmar said, noting he wasn’t aware of other issues involving the officer. He has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is a common procedure after police shootings.

Anthony Shahid, a community activist who led Sunday’s protest, urged demonstrators to post videos and photos on social media so Monday’s planned protests would draw thousands.

“We’re not worried about what’s happening in Afghanistan,” Shahid said. “We’re worried about what’s happening in Ferguson . . . black youths being murdered.”

Brown’s grandmother, Desiree Harris, said Saturday she saw him minutes before she heard a commotion and went outside. She found Brown’s body less than two blocks away.

“My grandson never even got into a fight,” she said. “He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.”

Several protesters were angry that Brown’s body remained on the street for hours after the killing. Belmar said that officers “had to practice our due diligence and that’s why it took as long as it did.”

Relatives have said that Brown was a 2014 Normandy High School graduate who was to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday.",4,NA,NA,NA

Michael Brown, a college-bound 18-year-old, was shot and killed Saturday in this small, predominantly African American city after an apparent confrontation with police. His death immediately inspired both solemn vigils and angry protests, which in recent days have left some stores looted, buildings burned and shattered glass in the streets. At least 32 people have been arrested on suspicion of looting.

The demonstrations showed no sign of abating Monday.

“He was a good boy. He didn’t deserve none of this. None of it,” said Brown’s father, Michael Brown Sr., who was one of more than two dozen relatives and friends at an afternoon news conference at the Jennings Mason Temple church near St. Louis. “We need justice for our son.”

The details surrounding Brown’s death remain unclear. But the case is recalling the racial animosity surrounding the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 and other recent altercations between African Americans and police. The Martin case drew in President Obama, who called for calm amid similar anger and noted that, if he had a son, he would “have looked like Trayvon.”

Obama did not comment on the case Monday during a public appearance in Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., where he is on vacation.

Brown’s family moved to hire lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represented Martin’s family after the teenager, also unarmed at the time of his death, was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer. Appearing here, Crump called Brown’s shooting “another senseless death of another person of color.”

The National Bar Association, which represents African American lawyers and judges, has called for an investigation into the deaths of both Brown and Eric Garner, a 43-year-old Staten Island man who died in mid-July after being placed in a chokehold by a New York police officer. A thorough civil rights investigation is the only way that “the African American community’s faith in law enforcement can be strengthened,” Pamela Meanes, president of the association, said in a statement.

“The death of yet another African American at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve the community where he lived is heartbreaking,” Cornell William Brooks, president and chief executive of the NAACP, said in a statement.

In the Brown case, police say it appears that the teen was shot following a physical altercation with a police officer at his cruiser and a struggle involving the officer’s gun. But authorities have not said what resulted in Brown being shot multiple times nearly three dozen feet from the officer’s car.

Crump said witnesses have disputed the account offered by police, but he did not elaborate on what these witnesses said.

He called on anyone with a video of Brown’s death to come forward to show “exactly what happened.”

“Their baby was executed in broad daylight,” Crump said.

Cheryl Mimura, an FBI special agent in St. Louis, said that the bureau was opening an investigation into any potential civil rights violations that may have occurred.

“The shooting incident in Ferguson, Missouri this weekend deserves a fulsome review,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a statement.

He said the FBI’s investigation “will supplement, rather than supplant,” the local inquiry.

“At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right,” he said. “Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”

Holder had already instructed attorneys in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division “to monitor developments relating to the shooting incident,” department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said in an e-mail to The Washington Post.

The local investigation will be conducted by the St. Louis County Police Department at the request of the Ferguson police.

Jon Belmar, chief of the county police, promised an impartial investigation, pointing out that none of his department’s officers was involved in the shooting. “I want to assure you that this is a very complicated investigation, as it should be,” he said Monday during a news conference. “A man lost his life. There’s a police officer involved in this. We need to make sure this investigation is done right.”

An autopsy of Brown showed that he was “struck several times by gunfire,” Belmar said. The autopsy was carried out on Sunday, the day after Brown was killed, and his body was returned to his family for burial.

At the news conference at the church, Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said that she had been overjoyed at the prospect of dropping her son off at college on Monday. Instead, she is planning his burial.

“That was my firstborn son. . . .Ask anyone and they’d tell you how much I loved my son.. . . I just wish I could have been there to help him, my son,” she muttered before breaking down in tears.

Brown’s grandmother, with whom he occasionally lived, could barely make it to the car afterward. She had to be carried by other family members.

“Oh, God, they took my baby,” she wailed.

The shooting and ensuing violence have drawn national attention, with every twist and turn explored on social media. There have been multiple public gatherings since Brown was killed, with protesters marching and chanting near the Ferguson police headquarters again Monday.

The looting on Sunday night was the work of only part of the crowd that had gathered to protest, Belmar said. He said the police got thousands of calls reporting shots fired, burglaries and assaults, among other things. A Wal-Mart was among the businesses looted, and a photographer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch documented a burning convenience store.

Hundreds of police officers responded to the looting, according to the St. Louis County police. Two officers suffered relatively minor injuries. The people who were arrested could face charges of assault, burglary and larceny, a spokesman said.

Monday morning, the sites where rioting occurred were covered with graffiti, broken glass and debris.

Belmar said Sunday that a Ferguson police officer “had an encounter” with Brown and another person Saturday. At some point, the officer reportedly was pushed back into his car and “physically assaulted,” the chief said.

There was a struggle over the officer’s weapon, which was fired once in the car, Belmar said. Following that, the officer got out of the car and fired at the teenager multiple times. Brown was killed about 35 feet from the officer’s car, Belmar said.

The officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave. His name has not been released.

There are still very few publicly released details of the shooting, but many civil rights leaders and family members have focused on how Brown was dressed at the time of the incident. According to reports, he was wearing cargo shorts, flip-flops and a T-shirt. He was unarmed.

“From what I’m told he had on, how would a trained policeman even feel that he could have been bearing arms?” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader. Sharpton plans to visit St. Louis on Tuesday to meet with the Brown family.

“Policemen are to use deadly force to protect their lives,” he said. “If you’re looking at a kid
18 years old and you know he does not appear to be able to be concealing a weapon, then what is the life-threatening circumstances that would justify firing your weapon?”",213,NA,NA,NA

In a statement, Obama said that the 18-year-old’s death has “prompted strong passions” but urged people to remember Brown, through “reflection and understanding.”

“I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,” Obama said. “We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.”

Attorney General Eric Holder has said the Department of Justice is investigating the shooting. Obama said the administration will “continue to direct resources to the case as needed.”

Obama’s comments came after protests over Brown’s death turned contentious late Monday and early Tuesday, leading to an hours-long standoff in Ferguson between several dozen local residents and dozens of officers in full riot gear just blocks from where {he was killed}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-of-an-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri/?hpid=z2”>.

Law enforcement officers lobbed tear gas canisters and shot rubber bullets at enraged protesters who refused to clear the street. 

“I’ve never in my life seen anything like this,” said Eric Crawford, 25, who was caught by a volley of tear gas. “You’ve got people who are standing in their front yards getting shot with tear gas - in their front yards, at their own houses.”

Some residents stood down police dogs, armored vehicles and pointed guns while chanting, “we’re unarmed don’t shoot.”

Not long after Obama’s statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said that it had banned flights from operating below 3,000 feet over Ferguson, at the request of police. The agency’s notice said it was issued “to provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities.

The temporary restrictions were implemented at the request of the St. Louis County, Mo., Police Department. Police asked for the restrictions on Monday because their helicopter was shot at “multiple times on Sunday night,” Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the police, said in an e-mail to The Post.

Also on Tuesday, several hundred residents descended on the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office. Standing on the steps of the county building, the protesters chanted “no justice, no peace,” before taking to the streets.

“Hands up, don’t shoot,” they yelled as they made their way through downtown Clayton.

Later, they came face to face with officers guarding the prosecutors’ office, chanting, “Who do you serve? Who do you protect?”

The consensus -- among many residents, community leaders, and journalists both visiting and local -- is that the unrest that has gripped this town for fours days has only just begun. 

The FBI on Monday launched a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting that has pushed the question of race and the use of lethal force again to the forefront of national discussion.

The details surrounding Brown’s death remain unclear. But the case is recalling the racial animosity surrounding the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 and other recent altercations between African Americans and police. The Martin case drew in President Obama, who called for calm amid similar anger and noted that, if he had a son, he would “have looked like Trayvon.”

Obama did not comment on the Brown case Monday during a public appearance in Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., where he is on vacation.

Brown’s family moved to hire lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represented Martin’s family after the teenager, also unarmed at the time of his death, was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer. Appearing here, Crump called Brown’s shooting “another senseless death of another person of color.”

Police had been expected to release on Tuesday the name of the officer who shot and killed Brown, an 18-year-old who would have begun college on Monday. But Timothy Zoll, a spokesman for the Ferguson Police Department, {told the Washington Post}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-wont-identify-officer-who-shot-and-killed-michael-brown/”> that the name won’t be released because of threats made against Ferguson police officers on social media sites.

The officer involved in the incident has been placed on paid administrative leave. There is no timetable for when police could release the officer’s name, Zoll said.

A group claiming to be associated with the hacking collective Anonymous said Tuesday that it knew the name of the officer and was working to be sure it had the right person before identifying him. This group also said it had launched cyberattacks on the city of Ferguson’s Web sites following the police response to looting on Sunday night.

Ferguson’s site and e-mail systems were both hit with cyberattacks that appeared to be continuing into Monday evening, Pam Hylton, the assistant city manager, told The Post.

Civil rights activist Al Sharpton was expected to arrive in Ferguson on Tuesday. “It is a broader problem that we see in many circles, the feeling that black young men in particular are expendable,” Sharpton, an MSNBC host, said Monday in an interview with The Post. “There is a racial aspect in this as well as a class aspect in this.”

Residents describe the current outrage echoing through the city as the product of years of tense relations between Ferguson’s majority-white police department and its majority-black population. 

“It’s not right,” said Craig Ruffin, 29, a protester who faced tear gas on Monday night. “I’m a single parent of a 7-year-old daughter. That could have been her dead in the street.”

Details remain scarce as to what exactly led to Brown’s shooting. Police say he started a scuffle with an officer and reached for the officer’s gun. 

Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County police, said Sunday that a Ferguson police officer “had an encounter” with Brown and another person Saturday. At some point, the officer reportedly was pushed back into his car and “physically assaulted,” the chief said.

There was a struggle over the officer’s weapon, which was fired once in the car, Belmar said. Following that, the officer got out of the car and fired at the teenager multiple times. Brown was killed about 35 feet from the officer’s car, Belmar said.

Residents in the neighborhood of the shooting have circulated an account of the incident in which the officer initiated a confrontation, drove his cruiser in reverse at Brown as he walked down the street and then shot him several times as he attempted to surrender.

A man who says he was with Brown during the incident {told MSNBC in an interview posted online Tuesday}<hyperlink=“http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”> that they were walking together when a police officer in a cruiser told them to “get the f---- on the sidewalk.” Dorian Johnson, 22, said the two continued to walk, and the encounter escalated into a physical confrontation, with the officer nearly hitting them with his vehicle, MSNBC reported.

Johnson told MSNBC that the officer fired at Brown several times, even though Brown tried to run away and yelled “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!” 

Most infuriating for many residents is the rumor -- unconfirmed by police but spreading rapidly on the streets of Missouri -- that Brown was shot in the head as he lay dying on the pavement.

“I just put myself in his shoes,” said Duane Finnie, 36, a childhood friend of Brown’s father and friend of the family. “Your last seconds of life and you’re getting shot down - executed - by someone who is supposed to protect you.”

It was those sentiments that echoed at a crowded meeting of the local NAACP early Monday evening, at which community leaders urged responsible protest.

But it was just minutes after the hundreds had begun departing from the meeting that demonstrations near the site of Brown’s death turned tense.

In an attempt to disperse the crowd Monday night, officers made their way down West Florissant, a main street in Ferguson. When some residents, chanting “Don’t shoot, my hands are up,” refused to leave, officers began using tear gas.

Johnson and other residents have said that the encounter between Brown and the officer began when the officer ordered Brown not to walk in the street. That hints at {an issue facing black residents of Ferguson and other cities}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/the-breaking-point-for-ferguson/”>.

While black residents accounted for 67 percent of Ferguson’s population, black drivers accounted for more than 86 percent of the traffic stops made last year by the Ferguson Police Department, according to a report produced by the office of Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster.

And the majority of the traffic stops (92 percent) that ended with arrests involved black drivers.

Statewide, black drivers “were 66 percent more likely than white drivers to be stopped” last year, Koster said in a statement in May.

The numbers were not much different for the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting at the request of the Ferguson police. Last year, 32 percent of the traffic stops made by the county police involved black drivers. Nearly half of the stops ending in arrests (47.9 percent) involved black drivers, while 50 percent involved white drivers, despite white residents making up 70 percent of the county’s population.

A former lieutenant with the county police was fired last year after an investigation found that the lieutenant, who was accused of ordering officers to target black people around stores in the county, had made “inappropriate racial references.”

In the wake of the allegations against the lieutenant, St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley asked the county police board to produce documents and statistics regarding racial profiling.

The county police are participating in a study of the department’s protocols conducted by researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles. “We want to make sure we’re not stopping people based solely on their race,” Belmar told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch when researchers visited the department in May.",382,NA,NA,NA

Some were seen looting a QuikTrip and a Wal-Mart, according to the Post-Dispatch. People also looted a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store, making off with goods, including bottles of alcohol. And at least one fire was reported.

“My nose is burning, my eyes are burning, my throat is burning and officers nearby are dealing with this too,” station reporter Elizabeth Matthews said in a live report.
Earlier in the day, a few hundred protesters assembled outside Ferguson Police headquarters. Many marched into a nearby police building and chanted “Don’t shoot me” while holding up their hands. Officers didn’t use force and the crowd left, according to news reports.

Asked about the number of arrests early Monday morning, an operator at the Ferguson Police Department told The Washington Post, “I cannot release any information at this time.” He did not identify himself.
“Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess,” Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said, according to the AP. “Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. … We’re only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors. There’s nothing productive from this.”
Knowles added, “We’re going to obviously try to urge calm.”
County Police Chief Jon Belmar said Brown, 18, and another man got into a struggle with a police officer on Saturday afternoon. One of the men allegedly shoved the officer back into his squad car. A shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the vehicle. And the struggle spilled out onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times, according to the AP.
KTLA reported that witnesses claim Brown, who was unarmed, had his hands in the air when the officer shot and killed him.
The race of the officer is not known, but the incident drew criticism from civil rights leaders who compared the shooting to that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, a black teen killed by George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012.

Ultimately, it was a selfie of Martin in a hoodie that became the image associated with his death. Martin was wearing a hoodie when George Zimmerman killed him, and the hashtag {#IAmTrayvonMartin}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23iamtrayvonmartin&src=tyah”> allowed even the {Miami Heat}<hyperlink=”http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/miami-heat-put-hoods-show-support-trayvon-martin-182102000.html”> to share photographs of themselves wearing hoodies in a show of solidarity.

Why did they feel such a pressing urgency to magnify — and manufacture — his failings? Why was it so important to them to make him unworthy of sympathy?”
As with so many discussions, #IfTheyGunnedMeDown circles back to respectability politics. In Martin’s case, there was an argument over whether different wardrobe choices would have inoculated Martin from death because some claimed the hoodie made him appear menacing. Said {Geraldo Rivera}<hyperlink=”http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/03/23/foxs-geraldo-rivera-i-think-the-hoodie-is-as-mu/184418"">, in a “Fox & Friends” segment for which he was later excoriated:
I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon Martin’s death as George Zimmerman was … When you see a black or Latino youngster, particularly on the street, you walk to the other side of the street. You try to avoid that confrontation. Trayvon Martin’s you know, god bless him, he’s an innocent kid, a wonderful kid, a box of Skittles in his hand. He didn’t deserve to die. But I’ll bet you money, if he didn’t have that hoodie on, that — that nutty neighborhood watch guy wouldn’t have responded in that violent and aggressive way.
#IfTheyGunnedMeDown isn’t just demanding that people like Geraldo see past clothing. It’s questioning if it’s possible for people, especially young black men, to live their lives online without worry that an innocent photo of them gettin’ gully at a party will somehow become re-appropriated as evidence of black thuggery. Forget a doctor judging underwear — the entire nation may now judge whether a victim was a good kid or deserved to be shot. The hashtag asks if black teens have the same right as others to make mistakes — to do dumb things and post about it on Facebook or clown around with their friends — without becoming branded in perpetuity.

Mo Brooks (R-Ala.). The very idea, this notion that whites are under siege particularly by black and brown takers, as I have written before, is worthy of a thousand side eyes. But Brooks’s contention feels especially offensive in light of recent events.
On Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, Mo., a suburb outside St. Louis, a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown. There are {conflicting stories}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/anger-confrontation-after-fatal-shooting-of-teen-by-ferguson-police/article_04e3885b-4131-5e49-b784-33cd3acbe7f1.html”> about what happened. One witness told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that she saw police try to put the unarmed Brown in a squad car. Brown’s mother said her 18-year-old son was walking to his grandmother’s house a few homes away. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said {there was a struggle}<hyperlink=”http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/st-louis-police-chief-physical-confrontation-led-fatal-shooting-unarmed-teen-article-1.1898637”> over the cop’s gun. An investigation into what happened is underway, and the civil rights division of the Justice Department is monitoring the case.
Brown’s death came two days after Theodore Wafer was {convicted of second-degree murder}<hyperlink=”http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/renisha-mcbride-shooter-shocked-guilty-verdict-article-1.1897748”> for killing Renisha McBride. The 19-year-old African American woman reportedly banged on his suburban Detroit door and windows in the middle of the night last November seeking help after a car accident. Wafer, who said he feared a home invasion, opened his front door and shot McBride dead.
Wafer’s conviction came two days after John Crawford, a father of two, ventured over to the toy department of a Wal-Mart in Beavercreek, Ohio. There he reportedly picked up a toy gun and walked with it while talking on the phone with LeeCee Johnson, the mother of his children. {According to the Dayton Daily News}<hyperlink=”http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/man-police-shot-in-walmart-killed-over-fake-gun-fa/ngw77/“>, two other shoppers became alarmed and called police. Johnson told the paper she heard Crawford say “It’s not real” before he was shot and killed by police.
And that horrible incident occurred one year and one month after George Zimmerman was acquitted of the second-degree murder of Trayvon Martin. The neighborhood watch volunteer called the Sanford, Fla., police department because he thought the unarmed black teen walking in the neighborhood was a {“real suspicious guy.”}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/under-suspicion-the-killing-of-trayvon-martin/2011/03/04/gIQAz4F4KS_blog.html?tid=a_inl”> The 17-year-old was returning to the apartment where he was staying after going to a convenience store.
When I wrote first wrote about Martin’s killing, I said that one of the burdens of being a black male was bearing the heavy weight of other people’s suspicions. The McBride murder shows that such suspicion knows no gender. I also wrote about the lessons my mother taught me growing up. How I shouldn’t run in public, lest I arouse undue suspicion. How I most definitely should not run with anything in my hands, lest anyone think I stole something. The lesson included not talking back to the police, lest you give them a reason to take you to jail — or worse. And I was taught to never, ever leave home without identification. The reason was not only a precaution in case something happened, such as an accident, but also in case I’m stopped by police for whatever reason. To this day, whether I’m going on a run or just running to get something out of my car nearby, I never step out of my home without my driver’s license, insurance card and my Washington Post business card with my partner’s cellphone number written on it.
When you’re black and especially male — in the United States — you have to go to these seemingly overboard, extra lengths in the off-chance they might save your life. But none of those things would have helped me if I were in the shoes of Michael Brown or Renisha McBride or Trayvon Martin. We don’t know yet if Brown was asked for identification, but we know the other two weren’t. Perhaps their assailants saw all they needed to know.
What frightens me more than anything in the world is that the chances are very high that one day I might be in their shoes and might meet their tragic end. The so-called victims of the nonexistent “war on whites” have absolutely NO idea what living under that kind of siege, that kind of very real threat, is like.",636,NA,NA,NA

A new {study}<hyperlink=""http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/08/05/0956797614540307.abstract""> out of Stanford University suggests people who perceive the penal system as more black are more distressed about crime and more accepting of biased policing, which in turn exacerbates the racial disparity. Policy effects negative racial attitudes, and our prejudices clearly create biased policies.
Because of the time it takes to create, racially tilted policing and incarceration policy reveals our conscious biases.
However, the split-second decisions police make in determining an imminent threat involves intuition and assumptions. Researcher Alan Lambert posits that stereotyping is not just a conscious act. Lambert found that bias could be thought of as implicit responses that are magnified in certain social settings through a loss of cognitive control.  The {disproportionate}<hyperlink=""https://www.rt.com/usa/police-brutality-us-protest-586/""> killing of unarmed black and brown people reveals our collective internalized fears. When threatened by the stereotype, police don’t give killing black and brown folk a second thought.
LeeCee Johnson, the mother of Crawford’s children, explained this phenomenon when she {said}<hyperlink=""http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/man-police-shot-in-walmart-killed-over-fake-gun-fa/ngw77/?nmredir=true&__federated=1"">:
“We was just talking. He said he was at the video games playing videos and he went over there by the toy section where the toy guns were. And the next thing I know, he said ‘It’s not real,’ and the police start shooting and they said ‘Get on the ground,’ but he was already on the ground because they had shot him …  And I could hear him just crying and screaming. I feel like they shot him down like he was not even human.”
In his classic essay “Shooting an Elephant,” George Orwell writes of a colonial police officer in 20th century Burma. The officer is pursuing a rampaging elephant in heat; the beast has already ravaged a fragile village and even killed a man.
The policeman initially intends only to scar the elephant into an unpopulated space. But the pursuit quickly became a hunt. Two thousand members of the small community follow, expecting to see a breathtaking finale.
Eventually the officer sees the elephant grazing peacefully in the clear. But, he still has thousands of people following, expecting action. Quickly, the officer realizes that he’s committed to killing the elephant.  The demands from the mob reinforced the commitment.
So the policeman shoots the enormous elephant. He shoots it again, and again, and again.
In cities and towns across the country, we are killing elephants every day. Black boys and girls are the collateral damage of a society wanting action against the menacing threats to community.
In response to flash mobs in 2011, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter admonished young African Americans from the pulpit, “If you want to be aggressive, we’re going to be aggressive…We’ve got the biggest, baddest gang in town…a committed group of citizens and a committed government.”
In Philadelphia and other cities across the country, our rhetoric, policing and policy are forming mobs to eradicate an invisible bully of stereotypes, but it’s our fears that literally blind us to the fact we are killing unarmed men and women.",73,NA,NA,NA

The basics: An unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown {was shot and killed Saturday by a police officer}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/anger-mounts-at-death-of-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri-fbi-launches-investigation/?tid=a_inl""> in suburban St. Louis. People protested Saturday and Sunday, with large crowds of protesters and police facing off multiple times since the shooting. Some {rioting and looting}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/11/police-killing-prompts-rioting-looting-near-st-louis/?hpid=z4&tid=a_inl""> also broke out late Sunday night. The FBI has launched an investigation, but federal authorities will also monitor an investigation being carried out by local police.
Why and how was Michael Brown shot?
The circumstances surrounding the shooting appear to be somewhat unclear. Police said Saturday that the shooting followed an encounter involving a police officer, Brown and another person Saturday afternoon, but additional confirmed details are scarce.
Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County police, said that the episode began with “{a physical confrontation}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html?_r=1"">.” Belmar did not explain what prompted the confrontation, but he said that {the officer was pushed back into his squad car}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/missouri-crowd-after-shooting-kill-the-police/2014/08/09/bee84a46-2021-11e4-9b6c-12e30cbe86a3_story.html?tid=a_inl""> during the episode and that one shot was fired from the officer’s weapon inside the car. Brown was shot multiple times — “more than just a couple,” Belmar said — on the street nearby, and all shell casings matched the officer’s gun. It’s not known yet why the officer shot him, nor why lethal force was used.
Benjamin Crump, an attorney hired by Brown’s family, said at a news conference on Monday evening that witnesses have disputed the account offered by police, but he did not elaborate on what these witnesses said occurred. (Crump {also represented}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/anger-mounts-at-death-of-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri-fbi-launches-investigation/?tid=a_inl""> Trayvon Martin’s family.)
What do we know about Michael Brown?
Brown was an 18-year-old who recently graduated from high school and had been set to start college on Monday.
His parents spoke briefly at a news conference on Monday night. Lesley McSpadden, his mother, was overcome with emotion several times.
“He was a good boy,” Michael Brown Sr. said. “He didn’t deserve none of this. None of it. We need justice for our son.”
He described his son as fun, silly and always ready to make you laugh.
“I just wish I could’ve been there to help him,” McSpadden said, shaking her head. Tears streamed down her face as their attorney discussed how that very day, Brown was supposed to start college at Vatterott College, a trade school.
Crump, their attorney, called on anyone with a video recording of Brown’s death to come forward so they can find out “exactly what happened,” he said. “Their baby was executed in broad daylight,” Crump said.
What do we know about the person who shot him?
All authorities have said is that it was an officer with the Ferguson Police Department. The officer, who has not been identified, has been placed on paid administrative leave.
Who is investigating the shooting?
The St. Louis County police are investigating the shooting at the request of the Ferguson Police Department. (Ferguson is a part of St. Louis County.) The police have promised to conduct a full investigation and said there is no conflict of interest, bias or favoritism involved because none of their officers were involved.
“We are sorry that a young man lost his life and ask all to give their condolences to the family along with their thoughts and prayers,” the county police said in a statement. “We are investigating this incident as we would any other shooting.”
The police said they are going to send the results of the investigation to the St. Louis County attorney’s office for a decision to be made regarding any criminal charges.
Attorney General Eric Holder has told attorneys in the Department of Justice’s civil rights division “to monitor developments relating to the shooting incident,” department spokeswoman Dena Iverson told The Washington Post.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation {opened an investigation}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/fbi-opens-investigation-into-shooting-of-michael-brown/?tid=a_inl""> into the shooting, Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI in St. Louis, confirmed on Monday. The FBI will also continue to monitor the county police investigation.

Can you tell me anything about Ferguson? 
Ferguson is a small, predominantly African American city just outside St. Louis. It  has about 21,000 residents, and a little more than two-thirds of the residents are black, according to the U.S. Census. (About 70 percent of St. Louis County’s 1 million residents are white.) The town was first formed in the 19th century as a railroad stop before becoming incorporated as a city in 1894.
What has the response been from people in Ferguson? A series of vigils and protests have followed Brown’s death. On Saturday, in the hours after Brown was killed, there was an immediate outcry from the community. Some people chanted “kill the police,” according to witnesses. While there were reports of additional shots being fired as dozens of police officers arrived at the scene, no other injuries were reported. The protest Saturday took a tense turn as the police flocked to the area with dogs:

The county police asked for help in responding to this scene, so police from the city of St. Louis as well as the Missouri Highway Patrol responded shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday. Police from the Metropolitan Police Department in the city of St. Louis left Ferguson a little before 3 a.m., with police commanders planning to meet Monday to figure out future plans, according to Police Chief Sam Dotson.
Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, told The Post that about 300 officers responded to the scene. He said that {32 people were arrested}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/dozens-arrested-following-missouri-violence/?tid=a_inl""> , while two officers sustained relatively minor injuries; the people who were arrested could face charges of assault, burglary and larceny.

By Monday morning, the sites where rioting occurred were covered with graffiti, broken glass and other debris.

This morning, this was the front page of the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/"">:
Residents, advocacy groups and onlookers far from St. Louis are focused on the details surrounding the fatal confrontation. Police say the 18-year-old was unarmed. The unidentified officer who shot him at midday says that Brown attacked him. The St. Louis County police chief has promised a thorough investigation.
But there's a much broader piece of context here that has to do with a legacy of racial segregation in U.S. cities, which has eroded more slowly in St. Louis than many other big metros. St. Louis remains among the most segregated metropolitan areas in the country. According to {data}<hyperlink=""http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Data/Report/report2.pdf""> from Brown University's {US2010 Project}<hyperlink=""http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/"">, looking at the 50 metropolitan areas with the largest black populations as of 2010, St. Louis ranks as the 9th most segregated.
That ranking comes from what's called the {Index of Dissimilarity}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_dissimilarity"">, a metric that reflects how evenly two populations are spread across census tracts within a given metropolitan area. A score of 100 reflects total segregation, zero total integration. Scores above 60 are generally considered high. Below, I've charted the Brown data for 25 of those metropolitan areas, including St. Louis, dating back to 1980 (I've shortened the place names, but each corresponds to a metropolitan statistical area, not just the city proper):
Segregation is not in and of itself the problem in any metropolitan area, but it contributes to inequalities in who has access to resources, amenities, opportunity and power. And the greater the segregation, the less likely communities are to form connections across different groups.
Antonio French, a city councilman in St. Louis, suggested {to the New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html?ref=us&_r=1&gwh=C02B169263DC620FB031D62141CF3CD4&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now""> that the legacy of race in Ferguson had helped fuel the community's reaction to Brown's shooting: “It’s a textbook example of how not to handle the situation,” he said. “Ferguson has a white government and a white mayor, but a large black population. This situation has brought out whatever rifts were between that minority community and the Ferguson government.”
That larger context — about geography, history and race — should be part of the conversation about what happened on both Saturday and Sunday. I have no special insight into the community of Ferguson itself, but I found {this column from the Post-Dispatch's Aisha Sultan}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/relationships-and-special-occasions/parenting/aisha-sultan/why-ferguson-burned-explaining-st-louis-area-riot-to-kids/article_725f501f-ba21-538a-acaf-f00221add91d.html""> helpful in starting that conversation. Ferguson, she writes, is ""a place where it's easy for the economic recovery to bypass the poor"":
It's part of north St. Louis county, where whites left en masse beginning in the 1960s, creating one of the most extreme cases of ""white flight"" in the country. But many who remained in power are still white, including much of the law enforcement.

Michael Brown was shot and killed on Saturday by an unidentified police officer in Ferguson, Mo., a small, predominantly African-American city just outside St. Louis. His death immediately sparked outrage, with protests and vigils beginning that day and showing no sign of abating on Monday. The reaction took a violent turn on Sunday, as some protesters began looting businesses in the Ferguson area over several hours, leaving a trail of broken glass and burned-out storefronts in their wake.
It is still unclear what exactly happened when Brown was killed on Saturday, but the episode evoked a string of recent racially-charged cases that includes the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Brown’s family has hired attorney Benjamin Crump, who was also {the attorney for Trayvon Martin’s family}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/zimmerman-trial-jurors-request-clarification-on-manslaughter-instructions/2013/07/13/3a26dbbe-ec0c-11e2-aa9f-c03a72e2d342_story.html?tid=a_inl""> Crump announced early Monday morning.
Police have said that it appears Brown was shot following a physical altercation with a police officer at his cruiser and a struggle involving the officer’s gun. But authorities have not said what exactly resulted in Brown being shot multiple times nearly three dozen feet from the officer’s car.
Crump, speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, said that witnesses have disputed the account offered by police, but he did not elaborate on what these witnesses said occurred.
Cheryl Mimura, an FBI special agent in St. Louis, said that the bureau was opening an investigation into any potential civil rights violations that may have occurred.
“Just because we’ve opened a case doesn’t meant there is a civil rights violation, it’s to determine whether or not there has been a civil rights violation,” Mimura said on Monday morning.
This investigation will be conducted separately from one being carried out by the St. Louis County police, she said. But the FBI will also continue to monitor the county’s investigation as well.
“The shooting incident in Ferguson, Missouri this weekend deserves a fulsome review,” Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. Holder said that the FBI’s investigation “will supplement, rather than supplant,” the local inquiry.
“At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right,” he said. “Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”
Holder had already instructed attorneys in the Department of Justice’s civil rights division “to monitor developments relating to the shooting incident,” department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said in an e-mail to The Washington Post.
The St. Louis County Police Department said it is investigating the shooting at the request of the Ferguson police and has promised an impartial investigation since none of its officers were involved. Ferguson is in St. Louis County.
“I want to assure you that this is a very complicated investigation, as it should be,” Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County police,  said during a news conference on Monday. “A man lost his life. There’s a police officer involved in this. We need to make sure this investigation is done right.”
An autopsy of Brown showed that he was “struck several times by gunfire,” Belmar said Monday. The autopsy was carried out on Sunday, the day after Brown was killed, and his body was returned to his family for burial.

Michael Brown’s parents spoke briefly at a news conference on Monday night. Lesley McSpadden, his mother, was overcome with emotion several times. “I just wish I could’ve been there to help him,” McSpadden said, shaking her head.
Tears streamed down her face as their attorney discussed how that very day, Brown was supposed to start college at Vatterott College, a trade school.
“He was a good boy,” Michael Brown Sr. said. “He didn’t deserve none of this. None of it. We need justice for our son.”
Crump called on anyone with a video recording of Brown’s death to come forward so they can find out “exactly what happened,” he said.
“Their baby was executed in broad daylight,” Crump said.
[tweetbegin 498954369619202048 tweetend]
News that the FBI would conduct its own investigation came as the shooting — and the ensuing violence — drew national attention. There have been multiple public gatherings since Brown was killed, with protesters marching and chanting near the Ferguson police headquarters again on Monday.
The looting on Sunday night was the work of only part of the crowd that had gathered to protest, Belmar said. He said the police got thousands of calls for shots fired, burglaries and assaults, among other things. Businesses including a Wal-Mart were looted, while a photographer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch {documented a burning convenience store}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/PDPJ/status/498681736260509697"">.
Hundreds of police officers responded to the looting on Sunday night, arresting 32 people in total, according to the St. Louis County police. Two officers suffered relatively minor injuries. The people who were arrested could be facing charges of assault, burglary and larceny, a spokesman said.
Brown’s death comes just weeks after Eric Garner, a 43-year-old Staten Island man, {died after being placed in a chokehold}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/07/21/investigations-outrage-follow-police-chokehold-and-eric-garners-death/?tid=a_inl""> by a New York City police officer. The National Bar Association has called for an investigation into the deaths of both Brown and Garner. This is the only way that “the African American community’s faith in law enforcement can be strengthened,” Pamela Meanes, president of the association, said in a statement.
“The death of yet another African-American at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve the community where he lived is heartbreaking,” Cornell William Brooks, president and chief executive of the NAACP, said in a statement.
Several elected officials in Missouri {called for investigations}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/11/missouri-pols-call-for-transparent-investigation-of-michael-brown-shooting/""> into Brown’s death. Gov. Jay Nixon (D) and the state’s two U.S. senators all called for a “transparent” examinations of what happened, as did authorities and groups in the St. Louis area.
Just over two-thirds of Ferguson’s 21,000 residents are black, while about 70 percent of St. Louis County’s 1 million residents are white, according to the U.S. Census.
“We are asking the public to be calm, be patient and be prayerful,” Charlie Dooley, the St. Louis County executive, said in the news conference on Monday.
Belmar, the county police chief, said detectives still need to speak with several witnesses in the apartment complex near where Brown was shot, adding that it is taking time for police to talk to all of the witnesses.
“The public has a right to be skeptical,” he said. “And I appreciate that and I would expect that the public be skeptical…But I would also ask the public to be reasonable, because it takes a long time to make sure we do this investigation the right way.”
Belmar said on Sunday that a Ferguson police officer “had an encounter” with Brown and another person on Sunday. At some point, the officer was reportedly pushed back in the car and “physically assaulted,” the chief said.
There was a struggle over the officer’s weapon, which was fired once in the car, he said. Following that, the officer got out of the car and shot at the teenager multiple times. Brown was killed about 35 feet away from the officer’s car, Belmar said.
The officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave. He has not been identified yet.",271,NA,NA,NA

We are re-posting the below, from Monday, in light of the developments.
The {killing of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-of-an-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri/?tid=a_inl""> on Saturday has led to protests, looting and some heavy-handed police-work. Those protests harken back to a situation with more parallels -- racial and otherwise -- than anybody involved would prefer to see: Trayvon Martin.
If the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown captures the nation's attention like Martin's did it's predictable that opinions on the matter could be vastly different between black and white.
In the months after the 2012 killing of the 17-year-old Martin -- an unarmed black teenager who went out one night in Sanford, Fla., to buy candy and was shot to death by a neighborhood watch volunteer -- views of the incident quickly cemented along racial lines. A Gallup poll in April 2012 -- just more than a month after the shooting -- showed {a majority of African Americans (51 percent) viewed the man who shot Martin, George Zimmerman, as ""definitely guilty.""}<hyperlink=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/153776/Blacks-Nonblacks-Hold-Sharply-Different-Views-Martin-Case.aspx"">. At the same time, non-blacks were much more undecided (61 percent), with just 11 percent saying Zimmeran was definitely guilty and another 21 percent saying he was ""probably guilty.""
By July 2013, when a Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the case, the split was even more pronounced. While 87 percent of African Americans said Martin's shooting was unjustified, just 33 percent of whites agreed, according to {a Washington Post-ABC News poll.}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/07/22/zimmerman-verdict-86-percent-of-african-americans-disapprove/"">
In addition, just 9 percent of African Americans approved of the not-guilty verdict; whites approved of it 51 percent to 31 percent.
The Martin-Zimmerman case, of course, was hardly the first example of a huge racial split on a high-profile case.
After NFL Hall of Famer O.J. Simpson was acquitted in 1995 of murdering his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ronald Goldman, {71 percent of African Americans said Simpson was innocent}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/26/AR2007092602351.html?tid=a_inl"">, according to a Washington Post poll, while 72 percent of whites said he was guilty. Just a few years earlier, both whites and blacks found fault with the not-guilty verdict for the police officers accused of beating Rodney King in Los Angeles, but there was still a significant racial split, with {nine in 10 African Americans}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/lariots/stories/poll.htm?tid=a_inl""> disagreeing with the verdict, and six in 10 whites objecting.
Plenty of things have yet to shake out in Ferguson, and details are still scant. Local police say the officer was involved in a physical altercation in which he was pushed into his squad car and struggled to keep hold of his gun. Protesters have been holding their arms in the air -- a reference to accounts of the shooting that suggested Brown was cooperating when he was shot, with his own arms up.
But the situation and its aftermath are already causing some very strong and wide-ranging reactions. And racial divisions over the criminal justice system suggest that's quite likely to be the case going forward. On Monday the FBI said it had opened an investigation into Brown's shooting.
In the Trayvon Martin case, the Gallup poll in 2012 showed African Americans were much more likely to view race as a contributing factor not just in Martin's killing but also in the decision by authorities not to immediately arrest Zimmerman.
While 72 percent of blacks said race was a major factor in the situation that led to Martin's shooting, just 31 percent of whites agreed. Blacks said 73-20 that Zimmerman would have been arrested right away if he had shot a white person; whites disagreed 49-35.
And this is really just an outgrowth of Americans' preconceived notions of the criminal justice system.
African Americans are much more likely to believe the criminal justice system is biased against them, with a Gallup poll showing 68 percent believe this to be true. Just 25 percent of whites see the same bias against blacks.
Similarly, {Pew polling last year}<hyperlink=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/08/22/chapter-1-i-have-a-dream-50-years-later/""> shows many more blacks saw themselves as being treated unfairly when it comes to public institutions -- most notably in dealing with police (70 percent) and the courts (68 percent).
And this feeling is personal for many of them. A {Gallup poll}<hyperlink=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/163523/one-four-young-black-men-say-police-dealings-unfair.aspx""> from last year showed 17 percent of African Americans said they felt that they had been treated unfairly by the police in just the previous 30 days. That's down from a decade ago, but still a striking figure, considering the short time frame involved.
There is plenty of evidence that Americans of all races believe that society {has progressed when it comes to racial equality}<hyperlink=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/163580/fewer-blacks-bias-jobs-income-housing.aspx""> and {ending  discrimination}<hyperlink=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/08/22/chapter-1-i-have-a-dream-50-years-later/"">. When it comes to law enforcement, though, that same perception of progress doesn't necessarily exist.
This is the racially charged backdrop for the debate and demonstrations that will continue to unfold over Ferguson in the days and weeks ahead.",9,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo16,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/police-use-tear-gas-on-crowd/,"Police use tear gas on crowd in Ferguson, Mo., protesting teen’s death ",Wesley Lowery,08/12/2014,02/19/2016,"For a third night, summer rage pitted the people of Ferguson against those sworn to protect them.

On Saturday, officers shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown.

On Sunday, resident protests turned to riots, marked by looting and the burning of  several local stores.
And, taking to the streets again Monday night, locals were met with tear gas and rubber bullets.

Protests against police brutality turned contentious early Monday evening, leading to a standoff between several dozen local residents and dozens of officers in full  riot gear just blocks from where Brown was gunned down.

In an attempt to disperse the crowd, officers made their way down West Florissant, a main street in Ferguson. When some residents, chanting “Don’t shoot, my hands are up,” refused to leave, officers began deploying tear gas.

“I’m under siege,” said Donald Harry, whose house sits at the corner of  West Florissant and Nesbit, where residents gathered and yelled at police who approached.

The previous night, rioters shot out the back window of the black SUV that sits in Harry’s driveway. Tonight, however, it was the police he was worried about.

“I’ve got my family in here,” Harry said, pointing back to his home as a tear gas canister landed in his yard, ignited and sent him and this reporter ducking behind shrubbery.
As police moved up West Florissant, many residents said they were trapped. The neighborhood consists of a series of cul-de-sacs with one main road — West Florissant, now blocked by police — stretching between them.

“I was just trying to get to my sister’s house,” cried one 23-year-old, who lay sobbing on a lawn.

He said he was walking home when officers approached him and sprayed tear gas in his face and peppered him with rubber bullets.
“These m———— came out of the cut and sprayed me in the face like this is a f—– video game or something.” the man said. His friends pleaded with an ambulance to hurry, and a neighbor offered to drive him to the hospital.

“I don’t need a hospital,” the man yelled. “This is my home.”

The police activity only further incited the crowd, with some people lying in the street with their hands in the air. “Don’t shoot!” they chanted. “Go home, killers.”

Others fled, crying out for water as stinging tear gas bit at their eyes.

“I had to go back for my sister,” explained 18-year-old Travis Hollins, who ripped off his shirt as tears streamed from his eyes. His 21-year-old sister had fallen near a tear gas canister, he explained, so he had run back into the fray to help her.

As police continued to press forward, they demanded that residents “get out of the street,” “return to your homes” and “go home now.”

In turn, residents responded: “These are our homes.”

At one point, a beat-up Cadillac approached the police line with NWA’s “F— the Police” playing loudly from its speakers.

“You have a son, I have a daughter,” the woman in the passenger seat could be heard pleading with the male driver. “Let’s go home now.”

“No, I’m tired of putting up with this,” the man declared, driving closer to the police.

As the night wore on, residents regrouped. Many refused to leave. Others were physically incapable.

“This is beyond Mike Brown; this is about all of us,” said Edward Crawford, 25.

“The looting was wrong, but so is this. This is excessive force,” he said as a tear gas canister landed just behind him.

The residents slowly dispersed over the course of several hours, with about two dozen remaining late into the night.

“This is not right, this is just not right,” cried Carl Union, 27, who carried a sign reading: “Justice for Mike Brown.”

The final standoff came just before 11 p.m. Officers backed up their formation almost all the way to the housing complex where Brown was shot.

As they regrouped, the two dozen residents who remained outside approached with hands in the air.
“Can we go home? Do we need our hands up? Are you going to shoot us?”

The police, weapons at the ready,  responded by telling them to stop asking questions and “just go home.”

Moments later, the cops pressed forward and cleared the street for good. As they passed, some remaining protesters threw rocks, and residents shouted from their windows: “This is our home. Leave us alone.”

As he ran past this reporter, a middle-aged man summed up the terrifying feeling that permeated the now-quiet Ferguson streets:

“And this is only day three….”",84,NA,NA,NA

Frankel,08/12/2014,02/19/2016,"St. Louis doesn’t riot.

That has long been part of the city’s lore. During the 1960s civil rights era, this city along the Mississippi River stayed calm — even as Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit and Washington all burned. St. Louis was in their league back then. The nation’s 10th largest city. A sizable black population. And after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, tens of thousands of people marched through the city streets. But St. Louis suffered no widespread violence.

It was one of those hard-to-explain moments. St. Louis doesn’t riot. 

And then, Sunday night, it did.
Riots and vandalism broke out in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. An 18-year-old black man named Michael Brown was fatally shot by police there. Brown was unarmed. Events leading up to the shooting were unclear. Police and the FBI have promised to investigate. But a day after Brown died, violence erupted. Stores were looted. A gas station was torched. Shots were fired at police. 

Maybe it was how police reacted to what initially was a peaceful memorial service for Brown. Maybe it was the echoes of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teen gunned down by a neighborhood watch volunteer. Maybe the crowd sensed police weren’t taking their concerns seriously.

It’s still unclear why, this time, tensions boiled over. But to many people, it had little to do with this town. The violent reaction grew from something larger, something tougher to pin down.

Ask people who live in Ferguson where they’re from, and most likely they’ll say St. Louis. It’s a quirk of the region. People identify with the St. Louis metro area. Ferguson, a city of 21,000 residents, is a place distinct from St. Louis city, which is different from Affton or Clayton or Ballwin. But these are mostly neighborhood distinctions. The residents all live  in the same St. Louis County, which is packed with 91 different municipalities. Some have quaint downtowns. Others have just 12 residents. But at the center of all of them is St. Louis city.

What happened in Ferguson was a regional reaction. The crowds that gathered in Ferguson — both peaceful protesters and those looking for trouble — came from Ferguson, yes, but also Berkeley, University City, Jennings and St. Louis.

Just look at Antonio French.

He spent most of Sunday taking photos and shooting videos as a memorial turned into an angry mob. He was widely interviewed Monday by media nationwide. But he’s not from Ferguson. He’s a St. Louis alderman. For years he has complained about St. Louis police and how crime is handled in his predominantly black neighborhood.

“This isn’t unique to Ferguson,” French said by phone, as he stood on a street in Ferguson on Monday watching riot police march in a line toward protesters.

He added: “This is no different than if it happened in Dellwood, Jennings or St. Louis. This has really been bubbling up for a long time.”

This is about police brutality, he said. Others agreed.  

“There’s a lot of angry folk. There’s a lot of people who want to make sure they’re heard,” said John Gaskin III, who lives in Florissant, another St. Louis County suburb, and who is a national youth board member of the NAACP. “This isn’t a St. Louis problem. It’s a national problem.”

Tensions between police and African American teens run deep, said Rod Brunson, professor at Rutgers University. He has studied the issue in St. Louis. “The dynamics play out on the street everyday.”

But Ferguson erupted. “And I don’t know what made it rise to this kind of level,” Brunson said.
Ferguson is about two-thirds black, one-third white. Its poverty rate is about double Missouri’s average. The town has its struggles. But Ferguson is also home to the world headquarters of Emerson Electronics, a $24 billion company with 132,000 employees spread across the globe. Thousands of people work just outside Ferguson at Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefits manager with $100 billion in annual revenues that is based in the St. Louis area.

“Ferguson would not be the first place I’d predict to have this incident or this response,” said Rick Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri – St. Louis, located just a few miles from Ferguson.

Rosenfeld grew up in St. Louis city. He remembers well the region’s reputation for not rioting. In 1967, after summertime riots in cities such as Newark and Milwaukee, a young Rosenfeld ran into Dick Gregory, the activist and comic who hailed from St. Louis. He asked Gregory why their shared hometown hadn’t angrily risen up.

“The shade trees,” Gregory told him, smiling.

Gregory was joking. But his response also carried a kernel of truth. People in St. Louis were not immune to the injustices and anger of the civil rights movement. But something about that place didn’t lead its residents to lash out in anger. Not back then.

St. Louis still has its shade trees. So does Ferguson.

But you can’t say they don’t riot there anymore.",0,NA,NA,NA

Outside the police station, the red and blue lights of the police cruisers cut through the early morning darkness.

But the sleeping residents and on-guard officers know the respite may be temporary. With the rising sun comes a reawakening of the rage that has for days gripped this town.

The arrival of the Rev. Al Sharpton and the anticipated release of the name of the officer who shot and killed Brown, an 18-year-old who would have begun college on Monday, threaten to reignite the heated passions that have sparked protests, violence and looting in the days since Brown’s slaying.

“It is a broader problem that we see in many circles, the feeling that black young men in particular are expendable,” Sharpton, a civil rights activist and MSNBC host, said Monday in an interview with The Post. “There is a racial aspect in this as well as a class aspect in this.”

Residents describe the current outrage echoing through the city as the product of years of tense relations between Ferguson’s majority-white police department and its majority-black population.
“It’s not right,” said Craig Ruffin, 29, a protester who faced tear gas on Monday night. “I’m a single parent of a 7-year-old daughter. That could have been her dead in the street.”

Details remain scarce as to what exactly led to Brown’s shooting. Police say he was involved in a scuffle with an officer and reached for the officer’s gun. Residents in the neighborhood of the shooting, rather, have described an incident in which the officer initiated a confrontation, drove his cruiser in reverse at Brown as he walked down the street and then shot him several times as he attempted to surrender.

Most infuriating for many is the rumor — unconfirmed by police but permeating public perception of the shooting — that Brown was shot in the head as he lay dying on the pavement.
“I just put myself in his shoes,” said Duane Finnie, 36, a childhood friend of Brown’s father and friend of the family. “Your last seconds of life and you’re getting shot down – executed – by someone who is supposed to protect you.”

As Brown’s family and friends filed into a news conference about the shooting Monday afternoon a minister declaimed Psalm 27: “The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear…”

Brown’s mother stepped to the microphone, overcome with emotion as her family members wailed in the sanctuary’s front row. Along the sides of the room sat many more friends of the family, their shirts declaring “no justice no peace.”

Battling tears, Leslie McSpadden used her time at the podium to urge witnesses to come forward and the community to remain peaceful.

“No violence, just justice,” she said through tears.

At a crowded meeting of the local NAACP early Monday evening, community leaders also urged responsible protest.
But it was just minutes after hundreds had begun departing from the meeting that demonstrations near the site of Brown’s death turn tense.

By nightfall, residents and riot police were engaged in what became an an hours-long standoff, as law enforcement lobbed tear gas canisters and shot rubber bullets at enraged protesters who refused to clear the street.

“I’ve never in my life seen anything like this,” said Eric Crawford, 25, who was caught in a volley of tear gas. “You’ve got people who are standing in their front yards getting shot with tear gas – in their front yards, at their own houses.”

It was a frightening scene, as residents stood down police dogs, armored vehicles and pointed guns while chanting, “We’re unarmed don’t shoot.”

By 11 p.m., the streets were clear but the tension remained.
And the consensus  — among many residents, community leaders, and journalists both visiting and local — is that the problems may have only just begun.
“One day, one month, one year from now… After you leave…” Crawford, a nine-year resident of the town, told this reporter, “it’s still gonna be f***** up in Ferguson.”",0,NA,NA,NA

And while the name was expected to be released Tuesday, authorities in Ferguson, Mo., now say they won’t be identifying the officer for the time being.

Timothy Zoll, a spokesman for the Ferguson Police Department, told The Washington Post that the name won’t be released because of threats made against Ferguson police officers on social media sites.

The officer involved in the incident has been placed on paid administrative leave. There is no timetable for when police could release the officer’s name, Zoll said.

A group claiming to be associated with the hacking collective Anonymous {said Tuesday}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/OpFerguson/status/499203260528328705""> that it knew the name of the officer and was working to be sure it had the right person before identifying him.

Ferguson’s site and e-mail systems were both hit with cyberattacks that appeared to be continuing into Monday evening, Pam Hylton, the assistant city manager, told The Post.

The shooting of Michael Brown is being investigated by the St. Louis County Police Department at the request of the Ferguson police. Jon Belmar, chief of the county police, said {during a news conference Monday}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/anger-mounts-at-death-of-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri-fbi-launches-investigation/?tid=a_inl""> that Brown was shot “several times by gunfire.”

According to police, Brown was shot following “an encounter” involving the teenager, the police officer and another person who was with Brown at the time. Belmar said that there was a struggle over the officer’s weapon inside the car and that the officer later got out and shot at Brown multiple times.
Brown was killed about 35 feet from the officer’s car, Belmar said.

Residents of the neighborhood where the shooting occurred have described the situation as initiated by a police officer, who confronted Brown as the teenager was walking down the street and then shot him as he was trying to surrender.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown’s family, has called on anyone with a recording of Brown’s death to come forward so they can find out what occurred.

“We want to know and see exactly what happened, because this family rejects what the police [and] authorities said at their press conference about how this played out,” Crump said at a news conference on Monday evening.",55,NA,NA,Link re: Hackers Anonymous not working

Witnesses say that Brown, who police say was shot and killed 35 feet from the officer’s car, was shot as he was trying to surrender after an encounter initiated by the police.

Dorian Johnson, who said he was with Brown at the time of his death, {told MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> in an interview that he was “shocked” at the officer’s actions on that street in suburban St. Louis.

Johnson told the network that the officer ordered them to “get the [expletive] onto the sidewalk.” They told the officer they were almost at their destination and kept going, but the officer hit his brakes and drove in reverse before confronting them.

“I feared for my life,” Johnson said. “I didn’t know what to do … My body really couldn’t move at that moment.”
Brown was “a very cool person,” Johnson said. “Quiet, calm and gentle.”

Johnson, who described himself as being within reaching distance of both the officer and Brown during the confrontation, said Brown did not “touch the officer in any type of a threatening way.” And Johnson disputed the police’s contention that Brown had struggled for the officer’s gun.

“He did not reach for a weapon at all,” he said. “He did not reach for the officer’s weapon at all.”

The entire episode unfolded very quickly, taking less than a minute, Johnson said.

Police have confirmed that Brown was shot multiple times. They have also said that the only shell casings recovered at the scene came from the officer’s gun.

Johnson had {told KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html"">, a St. Louis TV station, that the officer approached Brown and continued to shoot even after the teenager had his hands in the air.

Brown’s family and its attorney, Benjamin Crump, have asked for any eyewitnesses with video recordings of what happened to come forward. Johnson told MSNBC that he didn’t see anyone else in the immediate vicinity at the time.

According to the city’s police chief, {three of them are black.}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html#page=1%20"">
These numbers matter not just for the terrible optics of white officers clutching tear gas canisters opposite black residents shouting back. They speak to a fundamental problem rooted deep in history and driving the perception of injustice in Ferguson today: This community isn’t represented in its own institutions of power.
For many decades, this was true in cities all over the country. Blacks were systematically excluded from good government jobs, civil service roles and their most visible ranks on police and fire forces — first through outright discrimination, then through more devious means. Police and fire departments in particular found all kinds of ways to block minorities, inviting lawsuits and the repeated scrutiny of the Department of Justice.

They required that applicants take cognitive tests wholly unrelated to the work of police and firemen. Or they never solicited applications at all, passing jobs instead on to people who were part of the personal and family networks of men already in the department. Or they required applicants to demonstrate know-how with technical equipment they'd never seen before because they didn't have friends on the force.

Lyndon Johnson's {Kerner Commission}<hyperlink=""http://www.eisenhowerfoundation.org/docs/kerner.pdf""> following the race riots of the 1960s diagnosed this very problem as one contributor to the era's urban unrest. Cities, the commission recommended, needed to actively recruit blacks to their police forces. The dual premise here seems fairly self-evident now: It's harder to police a community when the police force doesn't reflect it. And it's harder for residents to trust the intentions and outcomes of a justice system that doesn't reflect them.

And yet, such scenarios still exist in many places, including Ferguson. Last year, the Urban Institute and Todd Gardner, a survey statistician with the Census Bureau's Center for Economic Studies, {compiled a brilliant historic dataset}<hyperlink=""http://www.metrotrends.org/commentary/race-and-local-government.cfm""> comparing the demographics of U.S. cities to the makeup of the civil servants who serve them. Historically, from Cleveland to Birmingham to San Jose, we see minorities underrepresented in higher-paying, more powerful public sector jobs like police officer, while they're overrepresented in low-wage government jobs like janitor.

These patterns have narrowed since the 1960s, but in some cities, particularly in the Midwest, minorities actually appear to be falling behind again. This graph from that analysis shows that high-wage local government jobs (at right) in the country's 100 largest metropolitan areas were disproportionately held by whites 60 years ago. As you can see below, a ratio above one indicates groups that are overrepresented in local government jobs relative to their share of the general population locally:
This data, based on American Community Survey microdata that's not publicly available, combines all local government jobs, including teachers, lawyers, secretaries and agency heads. Police officers aren't identified separately in the analysis, but they're counted as high-earning jobs. You can see what the picture looks like more locally to metropolitan St. Louis below (you can look up other individual metros {here}<hyperlink=""http://www.metrotrends.org/commentary/race-and-local-government.cfm"">):
Non-whites in metropolitan St. Louis have been far overrepresented in low-paying civil service jobs. And their representation among high-paying ones has fallen well below what we might expect given the demographics of the local community.

These trends help explain why blacks repeatedly show greater distrust of public institutions like police departments and court systems, as my colleague Aaron Blake {wrote yesterday}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/12/when-police-departments-dont-look-like-the-cities-theyre-meant-to-protect/www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/11/in-ferguson-an-all-to-familiar-recipe-for-racial-discord/?tid=a_inl"">. Recent Pew Research data, for example, suggest that 70 percent of blacks feel that they are treated less fairly than whites in dealing with police (only 37 percent of whites agree with this). A {2013 Gallup poll}<hyperlink=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/163175/minorities-less-confident-police-small-business.aspx""> found that just 38 percent of blacks say they have a ""great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in the police (for whites, the number is 60 percent).

""It's sad,"" someone commented to me yesterday about Ferguson, ""that we don't see this kind of community anger every time a child dies"" — as if there were some equivalence between one black teen shooting another, and one black teen shot by a law enforcement officer. This misses the deeper grievance. Ferguson isn't merely reacting to the shooting of Michael Brown; it's reacting to the shooting of Michael Brown by someone who represents an institution of power that's supposed to protect the public.",0,NA,NA,Link re: Aaron Blake not working

Standing on the steps of the county building, the protesters chanted “no justice, no peace,” before taking to the streets.

“Hands up, don’t shoot,” they yelled as they made their way through downtown Clayton.
[tweetbegin 499219103392235520 tweetend]
Later, they came face to face with officers guarding the prosecutors’ office, chanting “Who do you serve? Who do you protect?”

The large demonstration was the latest boil-over of frustration in the four days since Brown was killed — a shooting about which few details have been released.

“Every time I hear about these shootings, I think that it could have been me,” said Gianni Cook, 18, who attended the protest with a sign asking: “Am I next?”

Residents remain outraged that Brown was shot, allegedly shot multiple times, while unarmed. The officer who killed him has not been identified, and local law enforcement has not released a detailed narrative or timeline of the shooting.

[tweetbegin 499220378674528256 tweetend]

Civil rights leaders and Brown’s family have called for a federal investigation into the shooting. Residents, meanwhile, say the shooting is disturbing but not surprising.

{This tension}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/08/12/why-the-police-shooting-riots-in-ferguson-mo-had-little-to-do-with-ferguson/?hpid=z2&tid=a_inl""> can be seen and felt in many ways. Ferguson is a small city with a little more than 21,000 residents, according to the U.S. Census. A little more than two-thirds of its residents are black, giving the city nearly inverted demographics compared with surrounding St. Louis County (where just under a quarter of the residents are black).
Residents have said that the encounter between 18-year-old Michael Brown and an unidentified police officer began when {the officer ordered Brown not to walk in the street.}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/witness-brown-did-not-reach-for-the-officers-weapon/?tid=a_inl""> That sounds like an unimaginably small thing considering what was to follow, yet that small thing hints at an issue facing black residents of Ferguson and other cities.

While black residents accounted for 67 percent of Ferguson’s population, black drivers accounted for more than 86 percent of the traffic stops made last year by the Ferguson Police Department, according to {a report}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf""> produced by the office of Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster.

And the majority of the traffic stops (92 percent) that ended with arrests involved black drivers.

Statewide, black drivers “were 66 percent more likely than white drivers to be stopped” last year, Koster {said in a statement}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/newsreleases/2014/AG_issues_2013_Vehicle_Stops_Report/""> in May.

The percentage of black drivers getting pulled over by the Ferguson police is actually higher than it has been in recent years. As recently as 2008, black drivers accounted for 79 percent of traffic stops — still nearly four out of five stops, but not as high as the percentage seen last year.

These numbers were not much better for the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting at the request of the Ferguson police. Last year, 32 percent of the traffic stops made by the county police involved black drivers. Nearly half of the stops ending in arrests (47.9 percent) involved black drivers, while 50 percent involved white drivers, despite white residents making up 70 percent of the county’s population.

In a statement, Obama said that the 18-year-old's death has ""prompted strong passions"" but urged people to remember Brown,  through ""reflection and understanding.""

“I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" Obama said. ""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.  Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.""
Protesters and police have clashed in Ferguson, Mo., after the death of the teenager. Police have used rubber bullets and tear gas to try to disperse the protesters, many of whom were black.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday that it had banned flights from operating below 3,000 feet over Ferguson, Mo., at the request of county police.

{This notice}<hyperlink=""http://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_2599.html""> says it was issued “to provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities.”

The temporary restrictions were implemented at the request of the St. Louis County Police Department. Police asked for these restrictions Monday because their helicopter was shot at “multiple times on Sunday night,” Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the police, said in an e-mail to The Post.

Following protests Sunday, {some began looting stores around the Ferguson area}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/dozens-arrested-following-missouri-violence/?tid=a_inl"">, leaving a trail of debris in their wake. More than 30 people were arrested.
Police in St. Louis wanted the restrictions put in place “for the safety of those flying,” Schellman said.

There are various instances when such temporary flight restrictions could be implemented at the request of law enforcement groups. One rationale for the FAA in issuing such restrictions over hazard areas is to protect people in the air “from an existing or imminent hazard,” according to the FAA’s site.

These restrictions are likely to impact news helicopters, which typically fly under 3,000 feet.

Several other notices were issued Tuesday, including some aimed at clearing the airspace over California, Oregon and Montana for firefighting operations.

Frankel,08/12/2014,02/19/2016,"The graduation photo was taken in March.
Back then, Mike Brown was still just Mike Brown. A student with a football tackle’s build. Just one of the 100 or so in his senior class at Normandy High, a struggling school that had lost its state accreditation and, along with it, a measure of its pride, in an area already beset by challenges.
That day, he and the other students passed around a handful of green graduation gowns, slipping them on and off, as they posed one-by-one for pictures.
In his photo, Brown barely smiled, his green mortarboard tilted back on his large head, a red sash around his shoulders — a slight bravado that, his teacher noted, might have obscured how difficult reaching this moment had been.
Michael Brown officially graduated Aug. 1, later than some and months after the photo was taken. He still had credits to earn then. He was in an alternative learning program, a way to help the students facing the longest academic odds.
But he got his diploma. And 10 days after that, he was to start at a local technical school to learn how to fix furnaces and air conditioners.
“He’d accomplished it,” teacher John Kennedy said. “In the last two months, man, Mike was there every doggone day and he was giving it his full effort.”
Now, Mike Brown is no longer just Mike Brown.
Last Saturday, as Brown walked down a street with a friend, the 18-year-old man was fatally shot by a police officer in this city in St. Louis’s northern suburbs. Brown was unarmed.
An unidentified police officer had a confrontation with Brown and a friend as they were walking. What happened remains unclear.
County police and the FBI have announced separate investigations. But doubts in the local community about whether the shooting was justified quickly boiled over, leading to days of rallies and unrest, including angry confrontations between protesters and police, nighttime scenes made hazy by tear gas and shouted slogans.
Now Brown is part of a renewed national discussion about how police treat minorities, especially young black men.
President Obama on Tuesday offered his “deepest condolences” to Brown’s family, who is now represented by the same attorney used by the family of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager gunned down by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012.
The Rev. Al Sharpton came to St. Louis. Social media and talk shows swirled with anger aimed at both Brown’s death and the violent demonstrations that followed.
Tuesday night, authorities in Ferguson braced for another round of violence. The Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned flights from operating below 3,000 feet over the city, at the request of county police. A police spokesman said that a helicopter had been shot at multiple times and that the flight ban is “to provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities.” The ban may also preclude the hovering of news helicopters.
Investigation moves slowly
The official police investigation, a standard reaction to any officer-involved shooting, was moving slowly, said county police spokesman Brian Schellman. Three days after the incident, detectives still had not talked with many “critical witnesses.”
“They’ve reached out to numerous people who have been unwilling or unable to talk with them,” Schellman said.
Police detectives have tried “numerous times” to talk with Dorian Johnson, Brown’s friend who was with him when the shooting occurred and who, since then, has given several press interviews.
Ferguson police have said Brown pushed the officer as the patrolman was trying to exit his car, then struggled with him over his gun.
Johnson has said the officer was the aggressor. The officer, according to Johnson, shot Brown while still inside the vehicle, then emerged and fired multiple times.
“We want to talk to him,” Schellman said of Brown’s friend. “We have to talk to him.”
Ferguson police had planned to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, but they reversed course Tuesday because of “threats being made against all Ferguson officers on social media sites,” the city’s police spokesman, Timothy Zoll, said in an e-mail.
There is no timetable for when the officer’s name could be released, he said.
Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the family of Michael Brown, said releasing the officer’s name could help ensure peace on the streets of Ferguson.
In Ferguson, residents with signs gathered at the site of the shooting in the early afternoon, prompting honking horns and cheers of “hands up, don’t shoot.”
In nearby Clayton, several hundred people marched through downtown and descended on the county prosecutor’s office.
“I need justice for my son,” Michael Brown Sr. said at a news conference Tuesday.
The town where Brown died has 21,000 residents. The poverty rate is about twice Missouri’s average. There are challenges. But it is also home to the world headquarters of Emerson Electronics, a $24 billion company. Nearby is Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefits manager that employs thousands in the St. Louis area.
Black residents make up about two-thirds of Ferguson’s population. In the 2000 census, whites held a slim majority. Meanwhile, the city’s police force remains overwhelmingly white.
David Klinger, a criminology professor at the nearby University of Missouri at St. Louis, said he was surprised that some in the community reacted so violently.
“Obviously there’s been stuff that was boiling under the surface for years,” Klinger said.
‘The gentle giant’
Trying to piece together the incident that killed Brown has been tough for his friends and family. Seeing Brown on the street, he looked intimidating. He was a big man. But he was not threatening, they said.
The county prosecutor said Brown had no adult criminal history. And Brown’s family didn’t think it was in his nature.
“We called him the gentle giant. He was a gentle giant,” said Charles Ewing, Brown’s uncle.
His family tried to get him to play football. Brown was too timid for the sport, Ewing said.
“He had never gotten into a fight in his entire life,” said Duane Finnie, a family friend.
At school, he was that kid who was full of jokes and trying to make others laugh.
John Kennedy, who taught Brown this year, saw it. And he’d seen it in other students at Normandy High. They were covering, hiding the struggles they faced inside school and outside, too. Brown didn’t have it easy, Kennedy said.
At the school’s alternative program, Kennedy was always the first one in the building. The place would be empty. He’d unlock the doors at 7 a.m. and he’d always find Brown standing there, smiling. Classes didn’t start until 8 a.m. But Brown was there. First one in the door.
On Tuesday, Kennedy, who has taught at Normandy for 19 years, struggled to reconcile that memory with how his former student was now part of a national debate, his death the spark for unrest in the streets. It wasn’t supposed to turn out like this. Not for Mike Brown.
“It’s a disappointment,” Kennedy said. “There’s a lot to be disheartened about.”",1543,NA,NA,NA

Then, apparently unhappy with the government’s response, it made good on its word.

Now Belmar was the one in the crosshairs.

Many Twitterers praised the hackers throughout the day Tuesday. Still, some called them out — particularly in posts about Belmar’s family — saying: “{This. Is.

The notion of something “playing out on social media” (or, even worse, people “taking to social media”) in this day and age is a tiresome platitude suffused with cliche. We get it. Things happen, people tweet. We know that people act and react online, because we know that people live online, because we long ago crossed, drained and paved over whatever Rubicon separated our digital selves from our physical lives.

Yet the situation playing out in Ferguson, owing both to the paucity of confirmed information and to the repeated confrontations between hundreds of frustrated protesters and heavily armed police officers, seems different and feels particular. In a way that evokes situations that have happened in other parts of the world as countries rebelled against dictators, the people in and around Ferguson are using social media to capture and broadcast minute-by-minute updates, photos and videos of the protests, comments from elected officials and offer a view of the scene there that simply would not have been able to spread to so many people so quickly until very recently.
It took a little time for the attention to spread beyond the St. Louis area and some pockets of the Internet. Not long after Brown’s death, as his body remained on the neighborhood street, people began to spread sending the message out about what had happened.

As is often the case in the immediate aftermath of an event where few people know for sure what happened, information was mixed with misinformation. There were false reports of police officers getting killed and of the person who was with Brown when he died being found dead himself. Brown was identified, his name beginning to spread beyond merely those who knew him:

The decision was made because of “threats being made against all Ferguson officers on social media sites,” Timothy Zoll, a spokesman for the Ferguson Police Department, told The Post in an e-mail.

There were also attempts made to quickly counter the narrative that builds after these incidents, the idea that people can be summed up and summarily dismissed with a single photo. In the wake of the death of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager who was shot by a neighborhood volunteer in February 2012, the notion of how he was perceived became fodder for people who {sent around photos}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/02/06/playing-games-with-trayvon-martins-image/?tid=a_inl""> that purported to show the “real” Martin.

Amid protests, a St. Louis County police officer shot and critically wounded a man after he had pointed a gun at police early Wednesday, authorities said.

At around 1 a.m., police officers responding to a call that four people wearing ski masks and armed with shotguns were at an intersection in St. Louis, spokesman Brian Schellman said. Police also received calls that shots were fired in that same area.

After police arrived, people began fleeing the scene, Schellman said. One person pointed a handgun directly at an officer, who shot the man, he said. This man, who has not been identified, was taken to an area hospital in critical condition. Police are investigating the incident and recovered a handgun at the scene, Schellman said.
Earlier in the evening, community faith leaders and civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton held a massive rally in a local church earlier in the evening to protest the killing of Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old fatally shot by Ferguson police on Saturday. Their purpose was to call for peace and, they hoped, keep residents – many of whom had hit their breaking points after what they describe as years of police mistreatment – out of the violent clashes with officers that have taken place each evening.

“We ask that you all continue to support us in a peaceful manner,” urged civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Brown’s family, as he addressed the standing-room-only crowd at St. Mark’s Family Church about a quarter mile from where Brown was killed.

But even as Crump and other speakers led hundreds in song, dance and chant, local residents were again in a standoff with police in riot gear.

Ground zero for the clashes has been a burned-out Quick Trip gas station, which was destroyed when demonstrations turned violent on Sunday night. Residents and others who travel from other local areas have demonstrated there, holding signs declaring “Guns down for Michael” and chanting, “hands up, don’t shoot.”
But, like clockwork, when the sun goes down each night those remaining on Ferguson’s dark streets are met by heavily-armored police, prompting confrontations and injuries.

Unlike other nights, police moved to clear much of the street during the early evening hours on Tuesday, dispersing most residents and protesters by 11 p.m.

But some lingered in the winding suburban streets near the demonstration site, leading to several more clashes with officers who used tear gas.

In another incident on Tuesday night, a local woman was shot in what police have described as a “driveby shooting.” The woman is expected to survive and police say they are searching for four to five suspects.

The third night of violence comes as community leaders desperately try to contain the rage of residents who are angered by the shooting and the failure of police to release the name of the officer involved.

“Respect the family!” urged Sharpton, who begged the young men in the room to serve as peacemakers. “They haven’t even buried their son – don’t go out there and start stuff in his name.”

[tweetbegin 499368991291637760 tweetend]
Sharpton’s passionate address, often interrupted by the crowd’s chants of “no justice, no peace,” came toward the end of an hours-long service meant to both rally the community and get many off the night streets.

Hundreds attended the rally, dancing and singing in worship.

“Because he lives, I can face tomorrow. Because he lives, all fear is gone…” belted out the worship leader, with attendees responding in turn: “And life is worth the living just because I know he lives.”",48,NA,NA,NA

We must change how we're policing poor, black communities.",Elijah Anderson,08/13/2014,02/19/2016,"SWAT teams and angry protesters clashed in a small St. Louis suburb for a third day Tuesday, following the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. The eruption of protests and violence has been a long time coming. While I certainly do not condone rioting, examining the conditions surrounding Brown’s death — and the deaths of several other unarmed black men killed by law enforcement recently — makes clear that community reactions like those in Ferguson, Mo., are bound to happen. America has continued to isolate poor black people in economically depressed neighborhoods under increasingly oppressive police tactics that breed distrust and hostility.

Ferguson has suffered from “white flight” in recent years, leaving pockets of structural poverty and deeply alienated black people. The once predominantly white suburb now is 65 percent black. Poverty afflicts 22 percent of residents, twice as many as in 2000, according to the Census Bureau. Ferguson’s story isn’t uncommon in the United States. Authorities often see fit to heavily police towns with growing black and poor populations, to surveil them, and occasionally to harass them in the name of a “broken windows theory” of policing, banking on such methods to control crime. The broken windows theory, promulgated by James Q. Wilson, holds that where there is urban disarray, there is crime. Wilson argued that cleaning up trash and fixing broken windows — but also quickly policing deviants and miscreants for even small-scale crimes — would lessen crime overall. The thinking was that by taking care of the small stuff, you won’t face as much big stuff. The theory caught on, and authorities began to use it all over the country. For example, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and police commissioner Bill Bratton employed this theory in New York City, and it seemed to reduce crime. But increased “{stop-and-frisk}<hyperlink=""http://www.nyclu.org/issues/racial-justice/stop-and-frisk-practices"">” incidents — which allow officers routinely to stop sometimes law-abiding citizens in search of illegal drugs, firearms or other criminal possessions — resulted in ever greater tension between communities of color and police, and in ever larger numbers of minority men being incarcerated.

The use of “broken windows” policing meant, ​in practice, increasing harassment of young black men. This sort of harassment is doing as much to breed hostility as to prevent crime. For example, the New York Police Department’s use of the controversial stop-and-frisk practice  is most commonly exercised against young blacks and Latinos. {A recent report by the Center for Constitutional Rights}<hyperlink=""http://ccrjustice.org/home/what-we-do/issues/discriminatory-policing"">found that black and Latino people are stopped much more frequently than whites under this program, even in mixed and especially in predominantly white communities. Further, the report noted, “Blacks and Latinos are treated more harshly than whites, being more likely to be arrested instead of given a summons when compared to white people accused of the same crimes, and are also more likely to have force used against them by police.” The racial biases underlying this disparity extend to other forms of aggressive policing, causing black people to associate police officers with humiliation and injustice, and stirring distrust for police in black communities around the country.

The intensified police presence in poor black communities fosters this negative association in residents from a young age. As children, they see police officers walk the hallways of their schools like in a prison. When black boys are involved in an altercation or disruption, instead of being sent to the principal’s office, they are too often handcuffed on the spot and given a criminal record. Experience teaches black men that police officers exist not to protect them, but to criminalize and humiliate them. Few black boys get through adolescence without a story of police harassment, and with age, their stories proliferate. Aggressive police tactics turn black males into subjects of suspicion and skeptical scrutiny. This makes them vulnerable to harassment, whether their crime is real or imagined. Black men engaged in innocuous activities — {walking home from a corner store}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/parents-demand-answers-after-neighborhood-watch-captain-allegedly-kills-teen-trayvon-martin/"">, {holding a BB gun at Walmart}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/family-ohio-man-fatally-shot-cops-walmart-store-security-video-article-1.1900809"">, {leaving his bachelor party}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/police-involved-sean-bell-shooting-canned-article-1.1050169""> — become targeted as criminals by authorities. With each negative encounter, black men build up antagonism toward law enforcement. They develop defense mechanisms and toughen up to protect their pride and perceived respectability. With this built-up hostility, interactions over minor offenses, {like suspicion of selling loose cigarettes}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/20/justice/ny-chokehold-death/"">, become quickly charged.

While this is not the first time in history that aggressive police tactics have plagued black communities, this generation of young people have limited tolerance for such experiments in policing at their expense. Compared to their grandparents, the millennial generation — regardless of race — is less inclined to blindly respect and trust authority. {A 2011 MTV poll found}<hyperlink=""https://hbr.org/2011/12/millennials-are-playing-with-y/""> that 70 percent of millennial respondents believed they could “successfully negotiate anything with authority figures.” Further, {a Pew Research poll found}<hyperlink=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/""> that millennials are detached from hierarchal institutions and are distrustful of people in general. This generation isn’t intimidated by authority. On top of that, images of police brutality against black men have proliferated online, turning what might have been isolated local antagonisms into national grievances.
Practices like stop-and-frisk have exacerbated tensions between blacks and police officers. At the same time, {police departments are increasingly militarized,}<hyperlink=""http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/militarized-night-ferguson""> applying military-grade weapons to a domestic population — especially to those they see as criminal — and effectively criminalizing the everyday lives of black people. Under authoritarian oversight and normalized police harassment, a generation of young people were bound to get fed up and respond with the defiance and turmoil we are witnessing in Ferguson. Clearly, the relationship between the police and the communities they are charged with “protecting and serving” needs to change.",294,NA,NA,Link re: Reason not working

It’s a story about race, but it’s also become a story about the power of the state and how it’s wielded, and against whom.

So my question is this: Where are the libertarians?

Libertarians are, after all, supposed to be having their moment, as a {cover story}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/magazine/has-the-libertarian-moment-finally-arrived.html?_r=0""> in last week’s New York Times Magazine put it. The foundation of libertarianism is skepticism toward government and a belief in individual freedom. There aren’t many freedoms more fundamental than the freedom to walk to your grandmother’s apartment, as Brown was doing, without getting shot by a representative of the government. So you might have thought that libertarians would be all over the media raising pointed questions about the misuse of police power.

You would also have thought that libertarians would be using the police reaction to the protests over Brown’s killing as a case study in the needless and dangerous militarization of the police. {Like many}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=1""> police forces around the country, the one in Ferguson is bristling with military equipment, which they brought out to confront protesters. Though we’re talking about a town with 21,000 residents and a police force with 53 officers, they apparently have acquired the means to repel an invasion by any commando teams that decide to invade Ferguson. Driving up in their armored vehicles and {decked out}<hyperlink=""http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8""> in gear appropriate to a Marine patrol in Helmand province, the police used tear gas, rubber bullets, and {wooden pellets}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/missouri-police-wooden-bullets-protest-michael-brown"">  against protesters, including some who were standing {in their own back yards.}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-tear-gas_n_5671811.html?ir=Black+Voices"">
But there has been a near-total silence from prominent libertarians on this issue. Senator Rand Paul, right now America’s most prominent libertarian (yes, I know, some don’t consider him a real libertarian), hasn’t said anything about the case — no public comments, no news releases, nothing on Twitter, nothing on Facebook. I contacted his office just to make sure that I hadn’t missed anything, and a press staffer told me they have no statement at this time. I also called the office of Rep. Justin Amash, known as the purest libertarian in the House, and got the same answer: he hasn’t said anything about it, and they have no statement to make. How about mustachioed libertarian TV personality John Stossel? Just a couple of weeks ago {he was writing}<hyperlink=""http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/07/23/conservatives-libertarians-and-liberals-should-all-worry-about-militarization.html"">  about the militarization of the police. He hasn’t said a peep about Ferguson.

You can find {articles}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/reason.com/tags/police-brutality""> about Ferguson on the website of Reason, the libertarian magazine. But the politicians and conservative media figures who claim to be the most fervent advocates of individual freedom and to care the most about misuse of government power have been silent. One might be tempted to conclude they believe that when somebody’s grandson has to pay taxes on their inheritance, it’s a horrifying injustice that demands redress, but when somebody else’s grandson gets shot walking down the street, that’s just how things go sometimes.",891,NA,NA,NA

Authorities said the officer involved was “physically assaulted” and that there was a struggle over the officer’s weapon. They also said that Brown was shot “several times,” ultimately dying 35 feet from the officer’s car.

Residents and at least one eyewitness {offered a different account}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/the-scene-in-ferguson-early-morning-quiet-fears-for-the-day-ahead/?tid=a_inl"">, saying that the officer initiated a confrontation and ultimately shot Brown as he was attempting to surrender. Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking with Brown when he died, told MSNBC that Brown {did not reach for the officer’s weapon or touch the officer in a threatening way.}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/witness-brown-did-not-reach-for-the-officers-weapon/?tid=a_inl"">
Johnson’s lawyer said Wednesday afternoon that he and Johnson would meet with both the FBI and county prosecutor later in the day.

The differing accounts and the lack of any larger update from police on the circumstances of Brown’s shooting — even as Johnson’s comments are being widely reported — are heightening the tension in Ferguson. Also raising concern among police critics: the Ferguson police reversed course on Tuesday and said {they would not identify the officer who shot Brown}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-wont-identify-officer-who-shot-and-killed-michael-brown/?tid=a_inl"">, because of what a spokesman said were threats made against the city’s officers.

Police in Ferguson {issued a statement}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/WesleyLowery/status/499588291335692288""> on Wednesday, saying that the department is “working to restore confidence” and pledging to cooperate with the ongoing investigations into the shooting.

The statement said that while police have worked to allow residents “to both grieve and voice frustrations through prayer vigils and peaceful protests,” they were asking people to only gather during the day because of the “violent outbursts” that have occurred at night.
“We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner,” the statement said. “We further ask all those wishing to demonstrate or assemble to disperse well before the evening hours to ensure the safety of the participants and the safety of our community.”

Martin was deemed a “real suspicious guy” by Zimmerman, then a neighborhood watch volunteer, as he walked back to his father’s girlfriend’s apartment from a convenience store. Brown was shot multiple times by a police officer. Just how many times is a mystery as the police refuse to release that tidbit from Brown’s autopsy.

WashingtonPost,wapo37,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/ferguson-mo-police-chief-defends-officers-says-he-understands-communitys-frustration/,"Ferguson, Mo., police chief defends officers, says he understands community’s frustration",Wesley Lowery,08/13/2014,02/24/2016,"Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said he was driving with his kids on his way to lunch Saturday afternoon when a sergeant called him.

“He said there has been an officer involved shooting with one of your officers. And the other person is dead,” Jackson said. “I said: I’m on my way.”

Jackson said he made a u-turn, headed to the scene and, in the meantime, called the chief of the St. Louis County police and asked him to take jurisdiction.

“I get a call that says there’s an officer involved in a shooting and the other person is dead, do I want to investigate that, how’s that going to appear in the community?”

But now Jackson faces scrutiny and outrage from a population that desperately wants answers – How many times was Michael Brown shot? Why did the officer stop Brown in the first place? Why was lethal force justified? – that he is incapable of providing. Because he handed over control of the investigation, he said, he does not even know those answers himself.

“It’s frustrating,” he said. “And I understand the frustration of the community. I get it. I get it.”
What Jackson could clarify, however, is that there is no dashcam video of the shooting of the unarmed, 18-year-old  Brown. The department does not have cameras in its 18 cruisers. They received a Department of Justice grant this year for two dash cams and two officer cameras – but the dash cams have not yet been installed.

Robert P. McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, also declined during a separate news conference to say how many times Brown was shot.

“We want to test the veracity and accuracy of anybody who comes to us with a statement and says they saw something,” McCulloch said.

McCulloch promised a thorough investigation, vowing to talk to “anybody and everybody who has anything to say about this.” But he would not say how long the investigation could take.
“The timeline on this is there is no timeline,” he said.

Jackson said that the department will likely scale down the show of force at the nightly protests, which have been met by police in riot gear firing tear gas and rubber bullets. But he defended the actions by saying that he believes things have been handled well,  for the most part.

At an afternoon news conference, State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, who has been leading protests and a fixture in the community this week, confronted him.

“I just want to know if I’m going to be gassed again,” she said.

“I hope not,” Jackson responded.

“I hope not either,” she added, later telling this reporter: “He blew me off.”

While Jackson defends his record on diversity (noting that he promoted the first two black superintendents in department history) and the actions of his officers during protests each of the last three nights (“Nobody has gotten hurt though,” Jackson said, moving his hand to make the point. “Not even during the riots.”) many residents disagree.

“They’re agitating the situation,” said Anthony Ross, 26, who lives nearby and says that the relationship between local residents and police is nonexistent. “For years it’s always been very hostile,” Ross said. “Everybody in this community. Everybody in this city has been a victim of DWB (driving while black).”

Protesters have camped out at the police station nearly constantly since the shooting, holding signs that read “Guns down for Mike Brown.”

“People here are angry, frustrated. There needs to be justice,” said Corey Crawford, 36. “If you can find a single person in this community who trusts the police, that is like finding a four-leafed clover.”",58,NA,NA,NA

He and other reporters were working in a McDonald’s in Ferguson when about half a dozen police officers came into the restaurant, Lowery said. Some officers were in regular uniforms, while others were dressed in riot gear and carrying assault weapons.

“It was tense,” Lowery said via telephone from the police station on Wednesday night. “I’ve been afraid several times while reporting on the ground here in Ferguson.”

Lowery has been reporting on the situation in the city outside St. Louis following the death of Michael Brown, who was shot and killed by police over the weekend.

Patrons working in the McDonald’s, which reporters had been using as a staging area near demonstrations, were ordered to leave, Lowery said. When the journalists said they were working members of the media, the police told them that was fine, but they couldn’t guarantee their safety.

Police then left and returned a short time later, Lowery said, this time demanding that the reporters leave. Lowery began filming a video on his phone while also using his other hand to pack up his things. An officer objected, Lowery said, but did not press the issue.

Lowery was directed to leave through one door, and then told to go through another, at which point his bag fell off of his shoulder.

“‘Okay, let’s take him,'” one of the officers said, according to Lowery.

Lowery said that at this point, he was slammed against a soda machine and plastic cuffs were placed on his wrists. He was trying to make it clear he was not resisting arrest, but it did not appear the officers believed him.

“That is probably the single point at which I’ve been more afraid than at any point.” Lowery said after. “More afraid than the tear gas and rubber bullets, more afraid during the riot police. I know of too many instances where someone who was not resisting arrest was assaulted or killed.”
Another journalist, Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, was also in the McDonald’s, arguing with a police officer, and was also handcuffed.

The two reporters were taken outside to a police van, where a man inside the van was complaining that he could not breathe and that the handcuffs were too tight. Lowery and Reilly were then taken to the back of a police car, where they sat alongside a member of the clergy who had also been cuffed, Lowery said.

At this point, they were taken to a holding cell inside the Ferguson police station. News of their arrest quickly began spreading on social media, and the Ferguson police chief was alerted to their arrests by a reporter for the Los Angeles Times. About a half an hour after arriving at the holding cell, they were told that all media members could leave without any charges being filed.

Lowery said he repeatedly asked for the name or badge number of the officers involved and was denied. He also said that he was given a case number by an officer and told a report would be available within two weeks.

“‘The chief thought he was doing you two a favor,'” the officer said, according to Lowery.

In a statement issued Wednesday night, Martin D. Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, said “there was absolutely no justification for his arrest” and said the organization was appalled by the conduct of the officers involved.

Lowery was illegally instructed to stop taking video and followed police instructions, Baron said, after which he was slammed into a machine and handcuffed.

“That behavior was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news,” Baron said. “The physical risk to Wesley himself is obvious and outrageous.”

The Ferguson Police Department did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Wednesday night.

Here is what Lowery said in his own words before and after his arrest:

Since the shooting, the department has been criticized for how police have handled the response to the incident and for {not disclosing key details}<hyperlink="""">, including {the name of the officer involved}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-wont-identify-officer-who-shot-and-killed-michael-brown/?tid=a_inl"">.
The department bears little demographic resemblance to the citizens of this St. Louis suburb, a mostly African American community whose suspicions of the law enforcement agency preceded Saturday afternoon’s shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old who this week had been headed to technical college.
But while the racial disparity between the public here and its protectors has come to define the violent aftermath of Brown’s death, the department’s problems stretch back years and include questions about its officers’ training and racial sensitivity.

The office of Missouri’s attorney general concluded {in an annual report}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf""> last year that Ferguson police were {twice as likely to arrest African Americans during traffic stops}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/the-breaking-point-for-ferguson/?tid=a_inl""> as they were whites.
And late last year, the state chapter of the NAACP filed a federal complaint against the St. Louis County police department, whose officers are now assisting Ferguson’s force since the shooting, over {racial disparities in traffic stops}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/the-breaking-point-for-ferguson/?tid=a_inl"">, arrests and other actions.

Tensions between residents and the police have shaped the aftermath of Brown’s death in unpredictable and alarming ways. Those include {the nightly clashes}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/report-police-wound-man-in-ferguson-protest-over-michael-brown-killing/?tid=a_inl""> between young residents, most of whom are African American, and a predominantly white police force dressed in full riot gear and armed with tear gas and rubber-coated bullets.

Early Wednesday morning, a St. Louis County police officer {shot and critically wounded}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/report-police-wound-man-in-ferguson-protest-over-michael-brown-killing/?tid=a_inl""> a man who pointed a gun at the officer, a police spokesman said. Police had responded to calls regarding four men armed with shotguns and wearing ski masks in St. Louis as well as calls about shots fired in the area. People fled the scene when police arrived, but one person pointed a handgun at an officer, who shot the man, spokesman Brian Schellman said.

Police officials have provided little information about Brown’s shooting and have withheld the name of the police officer involved, citing security reasons. The vacuum has been filled by social media, which {has displayed in real time}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/watching-the-situation-in-ferguson-unfold-in-real-time/?tid=a_inl""> street confrontations between police and demonstrators, documenting the fraught interactions in {images, videos and short dispatches}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/watching-the-situation-in-ferguson-unfold-in-real-time/?tid=a_inl"">.
On Wednesday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged the problems facing his department and asked the community for help in restoring its trust.

“Apparently, there has been this undertow that has bubbled to the surface,” Jackson said at a news conference. “It’s our priority to address it and to fix what’s been going wrong.”

St. Louis is among the most segregated metropolitan areas in the nation. Ferguson, one of the 91 municipalities in largely white St. Louis County, has seen its population shift in recent years. About two-thirds of the city’s 21,100 residents are black. That’s a significant increase from 2000, when blacks made up just over half of the population. White residents, who had accounted for 44 percent of the population, now make up just under 30 percent.
Yet the police force patrolling Ferguson has not changed along with the population. The police force has 53 members, and three of them are black. The city’s mayor and police chief are white, as are most of the members of the Ferguson City Council.

“I’ve been trying to increase the diversity of the department ever since I got here,” Jackson said Wednesday. He pointed out that he had promoted two black superintendents.

“Race relations is a top priority right now,” Jackson said. He said his force is working with the Department of Justice’s community relations office to improve how police interact with the citizens. “I’ve told them, ‘Tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.’ ”

Residents have described Brown’s death as a breaking point that finally pushed years of tension to the fore.

“People here are angry, frustrated,” said Corey Crawford, 36. “There needs to be justice. If you can find a single person in this community who trusts the police, that is like finding a four-leafed clover.”

It has been “very hostile” for years, said Anthony Ross, 26, who lives nearby. He called the relationship between residents and police nonexistent.

“Everybody in this city has been a victim of DWB [driving while black],” he said.
For at least a decade, there have been complaints about racial tensions between police and black communities in the St. Louis County area. Communities, some residents say, can have less-experienced, poorly-equipped police departments and highly uneven levels of protection.

This year, St. Louis County invited researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles to help study complaints that county police had engaged in racial profiling and to help them improve protocols for matters ranging from traffic stops to neighborhood monitoring.

This came after a former lieutenant with the county police who had been accused of ordering officers to target black people at stores was fired. An investigation determined that he had made “inappropriate racial references.”

A St. Louis Post-Dispatch investigation in 2003 found that dozens of small police departments in the region suffered from poor training owing to a lack of funding, leading to inadequate investigations of complex crimes and an uneven use of force. The newspaper further found that this led to problematic officers moving easily between one city’s force to another without punishment.

As attention has shifted to the protests and nightly standoffs on Ferguson’s streets, key details regarding the shooting remain unclear. Authorities have yet to say how many times Brown was shot or where he was struck. Earlier in the week, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said that Brown was shot multiple times but did not elaborate.

But on Wednesday, Jackson, Ferguson’s police chief, would not say how many times Brown was shot. The only update regarding the confrontation came Wednesday, when Jackson said that the officer’s “face was swollen” after the encounter, so he required medical treatment. Police have said that Brown was shot after a physical confrontation with the officer, including a struggle over the officer’s gun, which witnesses have disputed.

During a separate news conference Wednesday, Robert P. McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, also declined to say how many times Brown was shot.
“We want to test the veracity and accuracy of anybody who comes to us with a statement and says they saw something,” McCulloch said.

Jackson said in an interview Wednesday that he was driving with his children to lunch Saturday when a sergeant called him about the shooting. Before even arriving at the scene, Jackson called county police to take over the investigation.

But as protesters from the community and neighboring city flooded Ferguson’s streets for both prayer vigils and tense standoffs, Ferguson again called on the county for help. Hundreds of officers from St. Louis County police, the city of St. Louis and the Missouri State Highway Patrol arrived to help deal with the looting that had broken out.

In audio recordings released Wednesday by the hacking collective Anonymous, a voice identified as belonging to a county police dispatcher indicated that Ferguson police were unaware that one of their officers had been involved in Saturday’s shooting.

The female dispatcher noted that she had received two calls about an “officer-related shooting” on Canfield Drive.

“We just got another call about an officer-involved shooting . . . there,” she said. “This came from the news, so [unintelligible] don’t know.”

A few seconds later, the dispatcher, apparently frustrated that the information appeared to be coming from news accounts, said she couldn’t get confirmation from the police in Ferguson.

“We just called Ferguson back again, and they don’t know anything about it,” she said.

County police did not respond to a request for comment regarding the dispatch tape’s veracity.

Anonymous became widely known for its cyberattacks on government Web sites and credit card companies.

Jay Nixon (D) called the situation in Ferguson, Mo.,  ""deeply troubling"" late Wednesday and announced he would change his schedule in order to visit the city on Thursday, signaling a new, more intense level of engagement than in previous days.

“The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans,"" Nixon said in a statement. ""While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.""
Nixon said he is ""committed to ensuring the pain of last weekend’s tragedy does not continue to be compounded by this ongoing crisis. Once again, I ask that members of the community demonstrate patience and calm while the investigation continues, and I urge law enforcement agencies to keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press during this difficult time.""
The comments from Nixon marked a shift following four days of more restrained input. On Monday, the governor issued a statement calling for a federal investigation into the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed by a police officer on Saturday, triggering days of confrontations between police and angry protesters. On Tuesday, at a meeting of civic and faith leaders, Nixon {asked}<hyperlink=""https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/remarks-gov-nixon-community-meeting-civic-and-faith-leaders-north-st-louis-county""> for patience and peace as facts are being gathered in the case.

[tweetbegin 499763706297741313 tweetend]
Nixon's schedule change came as the situation in Ferguson remained tense. Wednesday was another day of heated clashes between protesters and police. Authorities reportedly used tear gas. And at least two reporters, including The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery, were arrested.

Other elected officials have also been reacting carefully.

The state's two U.S. senators tweeted late Wednesday that they were in touch with state and federal officials. The last time Sens. Claire McCaskill (D) and Roy Blunt (R) had weighed in on the Ferguson situation on Twitter before then had been Monday, when both {released statements}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/11/missouri-pols-call-for-transparent-investigation-of-michael-brown-shooting/""> calling for a ""transparent"" investigation into Brown's death.

Rand Paul]",Ilya Somin,08/14/2014,02/25/2016,"Paul Waldman of the Washington Post’s Plum Line blog {takes libertarians to task}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/13/why-arent-libertarians-talking-about-ferguson/?tid=a_inl""> for supposedly being silent about events in Ferguson, Missouri, where a police officer shot an unarmed black teenager, and then the authorities reacted to demonstrators with excessive force. He speculates that the silence is because libertarians “believe that when somebody’s grandson has to pay taxes on their inheritance, it’s a horrifying injustice that demands redress, but when somebody else’s grandson gets shot walking down the street, that’s just how things go sometimes.”

Waldman’s speculation is based on a false premise. Libertarians have in fact had plenty to say about both Ferguson specifically and overaggressive policing generally. Walter Olson of the Cato Institute – the nation’s leading libertarian think tank – recently {wrote a post}<hyperlink=""http://www.cato.org/blog/police-militarization-ferguson-nationwide""> describing the events in Ferguson as an example of indefensible police militarization, an issue he and others at Cato have focused on for years. As Waldman partially recognizes, Reason – probably the nation’s leading libertarian publication – has {posted numerous items about Ferguson on its site}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/search?q=ferguson"">, nearly all of them highly critical of the authorities.

Perhaps more importantly, libertarians have for many years criticized the War on Drugs and the militaristic police tactics it has helped foster. Libertarian Radley Balko has written more about this than any other commentator, and last year published {the leading book on the subject}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1610392116/?tag=thevolocons0d-20""> , which I reviewed here. The War on Drugs, which libertarians have denounced since its inception, is {responsible for many of the violent interactions between police and young black males that lead to tragedies like the death of Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/13/the-true-stereotypes-behind-michael-brown-s-death.html"">.You can certainly argue that libertarians should focus on these issues even more than they already do. But they have opposed both the War on Drugs and police militarization longer and more consistently than adherents of any other political movement. If they are at fault for not doing more, so too are liberals and conservatives, and to a substantially greater extent.

Waldman is right that libertarian-leaning Republican politicians Justin Amash and Rand Paul had not yet commented on Ferguson at the time he wrote his post. But as {Ed Krayewski points out}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/blog/2014/08/13/tonight-on-the-independents-radley-balko"">, many prominent liberal politicians have not said anything either, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. I don’t think that any of these politicians’ failure to comment proves that they approve of what has happened in Ferguson, or are indifferent to the issue. But for what it is worth, Amash {recently denounced the government’s tactics in Ferguson on Twitter}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/blog/2014/08/13/justin-amash-calls-images-from-ferguson"">. For his part, Rand Paul has {called for scaling back the War on Drugs and reducing sentences for drug offenders}<hyperlink=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/08/08/right-wing-takes-lead-reforming-crime-policy/zHD2ZJTsziq5qpEfKQHzML/story.html"">. He hasn’t gone nearly as far in this direction as most libertarians would like, but still farther than most other prominent politicians, including most Democrats.

Like almost everyone else, libertarians sometimes pay too little attention to some issues and too much to others. I personally {think that libertarians should put more emphasis on liberalizing immigration laws}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/03/02/debating-immigration-policy-as-if-immigrants-were-people-too/?tid=a_inl"">. But it’s hard to argue that libertarians have been remiss about either Ferguson specifically or the issue of police abuses more generally – not unless you are also willing to conclude that most liberals and conservatives are even more to blame.

UPDATE: I realize that there has been looting and violence by angry protestors in Ferguson, and the police can legitimately use force to prevent that. At the same time, however, the police have also {used force against peaceful protestors}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/reporters-ryan-reilly-and-wesley-lowery-arrested-ferguson"">, and {even against at least one journalist}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/blog/2014/08/13/another-confrontation-potentially-brewin"">.
UPDATE #2: Hours after I put up the original version of this post, Senator Rand Paul published {an op ed}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> about Ferguson in Time, where he describes the situation as an example of dangerous police militarization and racial disparities in the criminal justice system:

The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.

The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action….

There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement.
ot surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement….

When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.

Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.

This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri….
Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.

But Ferguson police shoot it at protesters.,Terrence McCoy,08/14/2014,02/25/2016,"The first thing you hear is the bang. Then the clatter of something metallic hitting and rolling across the pavement. Then, out of the black of night, come the screams.

The location, {according to video}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXhtvd0o2Fw"">, is a darkened street somewhere in Ferguson, Mo. And the cops, marching inexorably down the street and flanked by bright lights and squad cars, just fired several rounds of tear gas.

“They bombing on us now,” a local musician named Haiku says as he {videotapes}<hyperlink=""https://www.instagram.com/p/roG9aKIXl4/?modal=true""> another batch of gas. “They bombing on us now. And they got us blocked in from the other side. Are they shooting?”

His fear of tear gas is appropriate. Despite its ubiquity across the globe and in United States, tear gas is a chemical agent banned in warfare per the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, which set forth agreements signed by {nearly every nation}<hyperlink=""https://www.opcw.org/about-opcw/member-states/""> in the world — including {the United States}<hyperlink=""https://www.opcw.org/about-opcw/member-states/member-states-by-region/western-europe-and-other-states/member-state-united-states-of-america/"">. The catch, however, is that while it’s illegal in war, it’s legal in domestic riot control. That means Turkey got to use it on its protesters last year. That meant Bahrain got to the do the same. And now, in Ferguson, {cops are likewise blasting}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/police-use-tear-gas-on-crowd/?tid=a_inl""> residents protesting the police for the killing of an unarmed teen named Michael Brown.

“I was just trying to get to my sister’s house,” one 23-year-old sobbed on his lawn, according to this {harrowing report}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/police-use-tear-gas-on-crowd/?tid=a_inl""> by The Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery, who was {arrested}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl""> by police Wednesday. The man said police had pelted him with rubber bullets and sprayed his face with tear gas.
Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson has defended the use of tear gas. “There are complaints about the response from some people,” {he said}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/ferguson-police-tear-gas-clashing-protesters/story?id=24957752"">, “but to me, nobody got hurt seriously, and I’m happy about that.”

While that appears to have held true as of Thursday morning, some scientists and international observers contend the tactic of spraying people with tear gas, which commonly uses the chemical agent {2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS_gas""> (CS), can pose serious dangers. “Tear gas under the Geneva Convention is characterized as a chemical warfare agent, and so it is precluded for use in warfare, but it is used very frequently against civilians,” Sven-Eric Jordt, a nerve gas expert at Yale University School of Medicine, {explained to National Geographic}<hyperlink=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/06/130612-tear-gas-history-science-turkey-protests/"">. “That’s very illogical.”
Technically not a gas, Jordt said, tear gas is an aerosol. “Tear gases are nerve gases that specifically activate pain-sensing nerves,” {Jordt told National Geographic}<hyperlink=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/06/130612-tear-gas-history-science-turkey-protests/"">. And when used properly, in lower doses and deployed in open spaces, its effects are more or less harmless. Those affected sneeze and cough and panic — and may even temporarily go blind — but those symptoms subside after several hours. A {2003 study}<hyperlink=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15071820""> found there “is no evidence that a healthy individual will experience long-term health effects from open-air exposures to CS or CR, although contamination with CR is less easy to remove.”

But sometimes things don’t go as planned. “The use of tear gas in … situations of civil unrest, however, demonstrates that exposure to the weapon is difficult to control and indiscriminate, and the weapon is often not used correctly,” {wrote}<hyperlink=""http://sujalsymposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/JAMA-Tear-Gas-89.pdf""> Howard Hu in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1989. “Severe traumatic injury from exploding tear gas bombs as well as lethal toxic injury have been documented.” Hu {found}<hyperlink=""http://sujalsymposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/JAMA-Tear-Gas-89.pdf""> that if exposed to “high levels of CS,” some victims experienced heart failure or even death. “An infant exposed to CS in a house into which police had fired CS canisters to subdue a mentally disturbed adult developed severe pneumonitis requiring therapy with steroids, oxygen, antibiotics, and 29 days of hospitalization.”
The levels of toxicity of the gas that most police departments deploy in the United States is lower than what’s found in places like the Middle East, according to Yale researcher Jordt, though some domestic uses have stirred controversy. On April 19, 1993, the FBI {sprayed tear gas}<hyperlink=""http://www.texasobserver.org/the-standoff-in-waco/""> into a large compound in Waco, Tex., that housed a religious sect called the Branch Davidians. A fire eventually consumed the center and more than 75 people, including 28 children, died. Investigators wrote in a {subsequent report}<hyperlink=""http://www.veritagiustizia.it/docs/gas_cs/CS_Effects_Waco.pdf""> that if the victims hadn’t been able to leave the compound, “there is a distinct possibility that this kind of CS exposure can significantly contribute to or even cause lethal effects.”
More recently, in 2011, a Palestinian man named Mustafa Tamimi was killed when a tear gas canister hit him in the head at close range, {according to Amnesty International}<hyperlink=""https://www.amnesty.org/fr/library/asset/MDE15/002/2014/en/349188ef-e14a-418f-ac20-6c9e5c8d9f88/mde150022014en.pdf/"">. Later that year, another Palestinian died of inhaling tear gas. Earlier this year, in April, one Palestinian woman died of tear gas inhalation, {Agence France-Presse reported}<hyperlink=""http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/04/15/Palestinian-woman-dies-after-inhaling-tear-gas-medics-say.html"">.
In Egypt, policemen shot tear gas into the back of a vehicle carrying supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi to prison, {asphyxiating and killing}<hyperlink=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27748355""> 37 inside. “Of all the ways to die,” {Foreign Policy reported}<hyperlink=""http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/20/how-36-egyptian-prisoners-suffocated-to-death-in-the-back-of-a-police-van/"">, “this was one of the most horrible.” The men’s lawyer would later say that the men’s faces were so distorted and blue that most thought they had been burned.
Burning is a common feeling when tear gas hits. It’s a refrain victims return to from Egypt to Gaza, from Istanbul to Ferguson.

That, and the suddenness of it. How quickly the gas chokes.
“These m———— came out of the cut and sprayed me in the face like this is a f—— video game or something,” one Ferguson man {told The Post}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/police-use-tear-gas-on-crowd/?tid=a_inl"">.

The boys who live are so scarred. I have looked inside more than a few; they are hiding bullets in each quadrant of heart and brain. There are shells lodged in their arteries. Memory, not metal, ticks within them. When they laugh you can hear it rattling like real tin. One false move and their minds or their wills or their ability to feel at all will be gone.

And they will tell you: when I was five, a man nodded at me as he strolled past my house and by the time he reached the end of the block all I saw was his blood. And they will tell you: my brother, my cousin, my best friend, my little sister, my first crush was killed, and the cluster of stuffed bears and balloons we left at the scene was gone within the week. They will tell you: I am not sure how long I will live.

The truth is: you are not sure, either, and there will be very little left to say in the face of that actuality. Besides, it is all the things they won’t say, all the numbness and fatalism and resignation they are too afraid to acknowledge — and the ulcerous pain underneath it — that are the real sites of worry.

The Anger in Ferguson by Jelani Cobb | {The New Yorker}<hyperlink=""http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/anger-ferguson"">
The truth is that you’ve read this story so often that the race-tinged death story has become a genre itself, the details plugged into a grim template of social conflict. The genre is defined by its tendency toward an unsatisfactory resolution of the central problems. Two years ago, I visited St. Louis to give a talk at a museum. My visit fell in the wake of a rally in which hundreds of local residents turned out to demand an arrest in [Trayvon] Martin’s death. (Brown’s family has now retained Benjamin Crump, the attorney who represented Martin’s family.) Martin was killed nearly a thousand miles away, but when I spoke to people about the rally they conveyed the sense that what had happened to him could happen anywhere in the country, even in their own back yards. For those people in Ferguson pressed against the yellow police tape separating them from Brown’s remains, the overwhelming sentiment is that it already has.

In defense of black rage: Michael Brown, police, and the American dream by Brittney Cooper | {Salon}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/08/12/in_defense_of_black_rage_michael_brown_police_and_the_american_dream/"">
It seems far easier to focus on the few looters who have reacted unproductively to this tragedy than to focus on the killing of Michael Brown. Perhaps looting seems like a thing we can control. I refuse. I refuse to condemn the folks engaged in these acts, because I respect black rage. I respect black people’s right to cry out, shout and be mad as hell that another one of our kids is dead at the hands of the police. Moreover I refuse the lie that the opportunism of a few in any way justifies or excuses the murderous opportunism undertaken by this as yet anonymous officer. …

… Every week we are having what my friend Dr. Regina Bradley called #anotherhashtagmemorial. Every week. We are weak. We are tired. Of being punching bags and shooting targets for the police. We are tired of well-meaning white citizens and respectable black ones foreclosing all outlets for rage. We are tired of these people telling us what isn’t the answer.

The answer isn’t looting, no. The answer isn’t rioting, no. But the answer also isn’t preaching to black people about “black-on-black” crime without full acknowledgment that most crime is intraracial. The answer is not having a higher standard for the people than for the police. The answer is not demanding that black people get mad about and solve the problem of crime in Chicago before we get mad about the slaughter of a teen boy just outside St. Louis.

America is Not For Black People by Greg Howard | {Deadspin}<hyperlink=""http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/america-is-not-for-black-people-1620169913/all"">
Officers have tanks now. They have drones. They have automatic rifles, and planes, and helicopters, and they go through military-style boot camp training. It’s a constant complaint from what remains of this country’s civil liberties caucus. Just this last {June, the ACLU issued a report}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf""> on how police departments now possess arsenals in need of a use. Few paid attention, as usually happens.

The worst part of outfitting our police officers as soldiers has been psychological. Give a man access to drones, tanks, and body armor, and he’ll reasonably think that his job isn’t simply to maintain peace, but to eradicate danger. Instead of protecting and serving, police are searching and destroying.

If officers are soldiers, it follows that the neighborhoods they patrol are battlefields. And if they’re working battlefields, it follows that the population is the enemy. And because of correlations, {rooted}<hyperlink=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/""> in historical injustice, between crime and income and income and race, the enemy population will consist largely of people of color, and especially of black men. Throughout the country, police officers are capturing, imprisoning, and killing black males at a ridiculous clip, waging a very literal war on people like Michael Brown.

Trying and Failing to Make Sense of the Murder of Mike Brown by Ryan Sides | {Very Smart Brothas}<hyperlink=""http://verysmartbrothas.com/trying-and-failing-to-make-sense-of-the-murder-of-mike-brown/"">
I contemplated whether our parents and grandparents experienced these types of moments, this numbness in the face of a seemingly insurmountable force. Assuming they must have, the only solace I’ve found is in knowing that despite what must have looked like a journey into an even darker night, they pressed on. They fought and prayed until things changed. And this gives me a resolve; reminding me that I need to work through the numbness and press through that feeling of helplessness because, well, I have no other choice. I need to do this. There’s work to be done.

When news broke of the murder of Mike Brown, I was deciding where I wanted to spend my evening. I didn’t go out that night, but I woke up the next morning with a renewed hunger for results that shifted me out of a paralyzing fear and into a feeling of purpose. I need to do this. There’s work to be done.

Demonstrations have blown up each night nearby. But inside there’s WiFi and outlets, so it’s common for reporters to gather there.

That was the case Wednesday. My phone was just about to die, so as I charged it, I used the time to respond to people on Twitter and do a little bit of a Q&A since I wasn’t out there covering the protests.

As I sat there, many armed officers came in — some who were dressed as normal officers, others who were dressed with more gear.

Initially, both Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post and I were asked for identification. I was wearing my lanyard, but Ryan asked why he had to show his ID. They didn’t press the point, but one added that if we called 911, no one would answer.

Then they walked away. Moments later, the police reemerged, telling us that we had to leave. {I pulled my phone out and began recording video}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/national/post-reporter-detained-in-ferguson/2014/08/13/b0fc5720-2354-11e4-8b10-7db129976abb_video.html?tid=a_inl"">.
An officer with a large weapon came up to me and said, “Stop recording.”

I said, “Officer, do I not have the right to record you?”

He backed off but told me to hurry up. So I gathered my notebook and pens with one hand while recording him with the other hand.

As I exited, I saw Ryan to my left, having a similar argument with two officers. I recorded him, too, and that angered the officer. As I made my way toward the door, the officers gave me conflicting information.

One instructed me to exit to my left. As I turned left, another officer emerged, blocking my path.

“Go another way,” he said.

As I turned, my backpack, which was slung over one shoulder, began to slip. I said, “Officers, let me just gather my bag.” As I did, one of them said, “Okay, let’s take him.”
Multiple officers grabbed me. I tried to turn my back to them to assist them in arresting me. I dropped the things from my hands.

“My hands are behind my back,” I said. “I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting.” At which point one officer said: “You’re resisting. Stop resisting.”
That was when I was most afraid — more afraid than of the tear gas and rubber bullets.

As they took me into custody, the officers slammed me into a soda machine, at one point setting off the Coke dispenser. They put plastic cuffs on me, then they led me out the door.

I could see Ryan still talking to an officer. I said: “Ryan, tweet that they’re arresting me, tweet that they’re arresting me.”

He didn’t have an opportunity, because he was arrested as well.

The officers led us outside to a police van. Inside, there was a large man sitting on the floor between the two benches. He began screaming: “I can’t breathe! Call a paramedic! Call a paramedic!”

Ryan and I asked the officers if they intended to help the man. They said he was fine. The screaming went on for the 10 to 15 minutes we stood outside the van.

“I’m going to die!” he screamed. “I’m going to die! I can’t breathe! I’m going to die!”
Eventually a police car arrived. A woman — with a collar identifying her as a member of the clergy — sat in the back. Ryan and I crammed in next to her, and we took the three-minute ride to the Ferguson Police Department. The woman sang hymns throughout the ride.

During this time, we asked the officers for badge numbers. We asked to speak to a supervising officer. We asked why we were being detained. We were told: trespassing in a McDonald’s.

“I hope you’re happy with yourself,” one officer told me. And I responded: “This story’s going to get out there. It’s going to be on the front page of The Washington Post tomorrow.”

And he said, “Yeah, well, you’re going to be in my jail cell tonight.”

Once at the station, we were processed, our pockets emptied. No mug shots. They removed our restraints and put us in a holding cell. Ryan was able to get ahold of his dad. I called my mom, but I couldn’t get through. I couldn’t remember any phone numbers.

We were in there for what felt like 10 or 15 minutes. Then the processing officer came in.
“Who’s media?” he asked.

We said we were. And the officer said we were both free to go. We asked to speak to a commanding officer. We asked to see an arrest report. No report, the officer told us, and no, they wouldn’t provide any names.
I asked if there would ever be a report. He came back with a case number and said a report would be available in a week or two.

“The chief thought he was doing you two a favor,” he said.

The Ferguson Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lowery’s detention.

The following is a statement on the incident from Washington Post Executive Editor Martin D. Baron:

Wesley has briefed us on what occurred, and there was absolutely no justification for his arrest.

He was illegally instructed to stop taking video of officers. Then he followed officers’ instructions to leave a McDonald’s — and after contradictory instructions on how to exit, he was slammed against a soda machine and then handcuffed. That behavior was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news. The physical risk to Wesley himself is obvious and outrageous.
After being placed in a holding cell, he was released with no charges and no explanation. He was denied information about the names and badge numbers of those who arrested him.

We are relieved that Wesley is going to be OK. We are appalled by the conduct of police officers involved.

In the video, a voice urged demonstrators in cities from Chicago to Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., to “stand in solidarity with the people of Ferguson” who are “currently fighting for their right to peacefully protest” after the police-involved shooting of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

[tweetbegin 499763706297741313 tweetend]
The statement said:

The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans. While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.

I have been closely monitoring the situation and will continue to be in communication with local leaders, and I will be in north St. Louis County tomorrow. As Governor, I am committed to ensuring the pain of last weekend’s tragedy does not continue to be compounded by this ongoing crisis. Once again, I ask that members of the community demonstrate patience and calm while the investigation continues, and I urge law enforcement agencies to keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press during this difficult time.

Earlier in the day on Wednesday, Anonymous released the alleged police dispatch {audio}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zta9FyoA7TU""> from moments following the shooting that killed Brown.

Throughout the day on Wednesday, police in Ferguson had greeted protesters in riot gear, semi-automatic weapons and armored vehicles. Few incidents were reported.

By nightfall, teargas canisters were being thrown to disperse crowds and armored vehicles flooded the streets with blinding lights.

Appearing before reporters at a school in Martha's Vineyard, where he has been vacationing, Obama sought to strike a balance to calm tensions in the St. Louis suburb, while also promising a thorough investigation into the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown last Saturday.
""Now is the time for healing,"" said Obama, dressed in a navy blazer and checkered dress shirt without a tie. ""Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done.""

His remarks came after another night of violence in the Ferguson community Wednesday. Police {fired tear gas at protesters}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/national/ferguson-protesters-run-from-tear-gas/2014/08/14/df2ff215-c7da-42ff-860c-d94c6caf92fa_video.html?hpid=z2&tid=a_inl""> and two reporters, including one from The Washington Post, {were arrested}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl""> while covering the events.
A White House official told reporters  that Obama, who had been attending a birthday party for a friend on Martha's Vineyard, was briefed on the developments late Wednesday night by senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.

The tense and chaotic atmosphere in Ferguson made for an awkward contrast to {the scene in the Vineyard}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/08/13/white-house-spokesman-tweets-while-ferguson-erupts-a-good-time-was-had-by-all/"">, where Obama dined on “surf and turf and pasta,” while mingling with guests that included Bill and Hillary Clinton at the party for Ann Jordan, wife of longtime Clinton confidante Vernon Jordan, according to a White House readout.

In the five days since Brown was shot dead by a police officer on Saturday -- the day Obama began his scheduled two-week vacation -- the administration has tried to calibrate a response. Holder pledged Monday -- and Obama reiterated Thursday -- that the Justice Department would assist local investigators in undertaking a “fulsome review.” He said that “aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”


On Tuesday, Obama issued a {one-paragraph written statement}<hyperlink=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/12/president-obama-issues-statement-death-michael-brown""> calling Brown’s death “heartbreaking” but urging the community in Ferguson and across the nation to “remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.”

The ongoing unrest convinced Obama and his advisers to more directly address the community’s {fraying trust in its police departmen}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2&tid=a_inl"">. Images of Ferguson police in full riot gear and armed with tear gas and rubber bullets while confronting residents in street clothes have contributed to deep uncertainty about the ability of the local leadership, or state officials, to restore calm and regain trust in the community.

Obama said Thursday he had spoken with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) and ""expressed my concern over the violent turn events had taken on the ground.""

For the nation’s first African American president, the racial dynamics -- most of the Ferguson leadership and police are white and a majority of residents, including Brown, are black — adds another layer of complexity. Obama, at times, has spoken on a deeply personal level about his own feelings on race, but he also has been criticized by black leaders for not speaking out quickly or forcefully enough.

In the case of Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old Florida youth shot and killed by a man on neighborhood watch patrol, in 2012, Obama made brief remarks within weeks, saying that if he had a son he would “look like Trayvon.” But the president held off on a deeper discussion of the case until after the verdict more than a year later, when he held an impromptu news conference at the White House and {spoke on the case}<hyperlink=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/19/remarks-president-trayvon-martin""> for 20 minutes.

In his remarks back then, Obama called for an end to racial profiling and said that he could have been in Martin’s position 35 years earlier.
“Based on my experience with the president, he comes to a situation like this and doesn't look at it as a politician. He tends to analyze it as a father,” Joshua DuBois, a former Obama aide who oversaw faith-based and neighborhood partnerships, said in an interview this earlier week.

But DuBois added that Obama’s instinct is to “speak to issues where he thinks his voice can help achieve a practical result, if he thinks his remarks can bring healing to that family and community. But if he has a sense it would further deepen the divide that exists, he will not... The role of the president is not only to express concern, but to point the way forward. Until the facts are sorted out, it’s difficult to define what the way forward is.”

Early in his tenure, Obama faced a public backlash when he waded quickly into a racially charged dispute in Cambridge, Mass., after Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., who is black, was arrested by a white officer and charged with disorderly conduct. Obama initially said police “acted stupidly” after the charges were dropped, but the president later regretted his words and invited Gates and the officer, Cambridge police Sgt. James Crowley, {to the White House for beers}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/29/AR2009072903273.html?tid=a_inl"">.

In Ferguson, civil rights leaders said they expected Obama to weigh in on the matter. {NAACP president Cornell William Brooks}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/who-is-the-naacps-new-president-cornell-william-brooks/2014/07/16/854b1610-0b6d-11e4-b8e5-d0de80767fc2_story.html?tid=a_inl"">, who traveled to Ferguson on Monday, attended a community meeting with hundreds of residents. Brooks said White House officials had contacted him before he left Washington and again late Monday night after he had arrived in Ferguson. “They were concerned about what was going on on the ground, how secure was the community itself,” Brooks said Tuesday, declining to name which officials he spoke with at the White House.
Obama, Brooks said, has demonstrated his ability to act as the “consoler in chief” in the wake of natural disasters and so it followed that “it would be entirely appropriate for him...to speak to the concerns and apprehension of this community.”
Brooks cautioned that the president’s involvement should not be considered a one-off statement of empathy, but rather the start of a national discussion over the pervasive persecution and harassment of black residents by law enforcement in their own communities. “It’s entirely appropriate, given that the president has often talked about the fierce urgency of now, as I stand on the street talking to young people with tears running down their faces, asking what is somebody going to do about this -- this feels like fierce urgency of now,” Brooks said.

After the Martin verdict, Obama spoke of the need for rethinking law enforcement techniques, though he did not roll out any new federal efforts. This year, the White House rolled out a program called {“My Brother’s Keeper”}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-obama-to-launch-major-new-effort-on-young-men-of-color/2014/02/11/cc0f0a98-92cd-11e3-b227-12a45d109e03_story.html?tid=a_inl""> aimed at counseling African American young men and helping keep them in school and out of prison.

Benjamin Jealous, the former president of the NAACP, said in an interview this week that the president is well-versed on the issues of racial profiling. Jealous said he first heard Obama’s name when Obama helped win passage of a bill during his time in the Illinois state legislature to require police agencies to record the race of everyone pulled over in a traffic stop.
“For a lot of people who voted for this president, improving the quality of justice for all of us was central to our early and long motivations,” Jealous said. “I think he understands that.”

In the live feed, one woman in Ferguson could be heard clearly. ""Where are the politicians at?"" she asked. ""They want our vote, they want the black vote, but they won't come out here.""

It wasn't only the White House that missed the chance to respond appropriately to the unrest. Missouri's Gov. Jay Nixon (D) was quiet, save this tweet.
That was at 7:37 p.m., as you can see, well after Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly -- who was arrested with Lowery -- tweeted this:

While eventually released, Lowery was detained for not packing up his bag fast enough while being forced out of the McDonald's he was reporting from -- and told by an officer to stop recording video of the encounter on his smartphone.
But Washington Post editor Marty Baron noted in his statement responding to the incident that the order to stop filming was illegal. Courts have held that, as a general rule, individuals have {a right to record law enforcement officers}<hyperlink=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/13/6000833/you-have-a-right-to-record-the-police""> carrying out their duties in public spaces. And as the video archive of questionable police tactics from citizen observers grows, it's clear there's a certain benefit to keeping a digital eye on the police: Knowing there is a record of their actions can help put everyone on their best behavior -- or at least make sure there's evidence of misbehavior when it occurs.

Many police stations have long recorded at least some of their officers' interactions with the public, most frequently through dashboard cameras that capture traffic stops. Indeed, elsewhere in the world -- such as Russia -- car owners often purchase their own dashcams to gather evidence for insurance purposes and to record their interactions with the police and others.

But there's also a growing movement in the United States to have on-duty officers use body cameras to record their interactions with the public. Police officers in Rialto, Calif., started wearing cameras in February 2012. The result? The volume of complaints filed against officers fell by 88 percent compared with the previous year, and use of force by officers fell by almost 60 percent, according to the {New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/us/in-california-a-champion-for-police-cameras.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"">. The tactic adds an extra layer of accountability on police actions and creates a record that officers can fall back on if their account differs from that of an arrestee.

Other jurisdictions have also started using cameras on officers. Police in Laurel, Md., started using them {last summer.}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/police-body-cameras-spur-privacy-debate/2013/11/10/7e9ee504-2549-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html?tid=a_inl""> Not long after that, a federal judge {ordered}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/nyregion/order-that-police-wear-cameras-stirs-unexpected-reactions.html""> police officers in some New York precincts to use bodycams to monitor how they were enforcing the city's controversial stop-and-frisk program -- something then-mayor Michael Bloomberg opposed, even though he was generally in favor of increased surveillance elsewhere.
Even the American Civil Liberties Union, which typically raises the alarm over practices that potentially infringe on privacy, has endorsed the idea. ""Although we generally take a dim view of the proliferation of surveillance cameras in American life, police on-body cameras are different because of their potential to serve as a check against the abuse of power by police officers,"" the group argued in a {position paper}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all?redirect=technology-and-liberty/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all#control""> released last fall.

Still, the civil liberties group did note the policy questions raised by the technology's use. Control over the actual device and its recordings is important, the ACLU argues. ""If the cameras do not record continuously, that would place them under officer control, which would create the danger that they could be manipulated by some officers, undermining their core purpose of detecting police misconduct,"" the group says.

The ACLU also suggests that video be deleted after a certain amount of time unless a recording has been flagged -- and that period should be weeks, not years. There are other concerns, too, such as how to handle the recordings when officers enter a private residence.

As technology progresses, other new privacy concerns will no doubt be raised, such as the potential for facial recognition technology to be run against police bodycam footage to create a record of an individual's movements. But so far it seems like keeping a digital eye on the police can be a powerful tool for checking the power imbalance between citizens and the law enforcement agents who interact with them.

In the case of the Michael Brown shooting, much of the information we have comes from eyewitness accounts. If the police had an unedited video of the encounter, there would be little doubt about what exactly occurred, and perhaps accountability would be easier to achieve.",79,NA,NA,NA

Let’s go through the basics.

Who is Antonio French?
Antonio French is a Democratic alderman in St. Louis, {representing Ward 21}<hyperlink=""https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/aldermen/profiles/antonio-french.cfm"">. He’s been documenting protests of the {police-involved shooting of Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-of-an-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri/?tid=a_inl""> pretty heavily, and on Wednesday night he was arrested in Ferguson, {according to reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/article_0806541b-ed48-5d06-9267-323531ad6cf1.html"">.
Where is Ward 21?
Here’s {a map}<hyperlink=""https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/planning/documents/upload/Ward-21_Map_August2011.pdf""> of Ward 21. It’s a few miles from Ferguson.

What has he been doing in Ferguson?
French has been actively recording the scene in Missouri. You’ve probably seen his Vines or tweets this week.
[tweetbegin 499737037545951232 tweetend]
Here’s {a local TV interview with Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/13/alderman-antonio-french-on-social-media-crisis-in-ferguson/"">, in which he discusses his dispatches:

Why was Antonio French arrested Wednesday?
That’s still a little unclear. The {St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Thursday morning}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/another-night-of-unrest-in-ferguson-officials-ask-for-patience/article_0806541b-ed48-5d06-9267-323531ad6cf1.html""> said no details of his arrest were released. The Washington Post called the Ferguson jail and police department but has not been provided with any information either.

OK … what else can you tell me about him?
He’s not an amateur at this. {Here’s a St. Louis Public Radio report}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/are-state-and-local-governments-ready-their-closeup""> about French’s experience before he was elected. The basic gist is that he “{created and managed}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/are-state-and-local-governments-ready-their-closeup"">” a {Web site}<hyperlink=""http://pubdef.net/""> that uses video to document government and politic activities. Since being elected alderman, he has sponsored local legislation that would support similar efforts.

According to the report:

“I think a lot of people would be amazed that our activities are not recorded,” said French, D-21st Ward, last week during a hearing of the board’s legislation committee. “There are no transcripts of what we do. When we have very important hearings, like today for instance, that provides information that the public would probably want to know, we don’t really have a mechanism for them to get that.”

Oh, he also appears to be an {Auburn football fan}<hyperlink=""http://www.northcampus.org/staff-bios/""> and has a young son, if you’re interested in his personal bio.

WashingtonPost,wapo53,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/despite-reports-name-of-officer-in-michael-brown-shooting-still-unknown/,"Despite reports, name of officer in Michael Brown shooting still not publicly known",Mark Berman; Carol Leonnig,08/14/2014,02/26/2016,"In the days since Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., one missing bit of information has dominated much of the conversation and fueled much of the frustration: The name of the officer who shot Brown is still not publicly known. Police and other law enforcement officials have repeatedly declined to identify the officer, despite having said they would do so earlier in the week.

At least two names have surfaced online, but both of them have been called incorrect by police.

On Thursday, a name released by the hacking collective Anonymous began circulating, but St. Louis County Police said that the name was inaccurate. The same kind of thing happened Wednesday, as another name began floating around and gaining traction. Ferguson police said that that name was also inaccurate, telling The Post that these reports were false.

A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police was critical of the group Anonymous for releasing the information.

“People really need to harshly judge the accuracy of this group, given that they’ve now given false information about several important things,” Sgt. Colby Dolly said on Thursday.

Dolly said that authorities were trying to locate the person identified by Anonymous on Thursday to warn him.

Much of the friction spoke to the dual realities at work in the wake of the shooting. Ferguson police had planned to release the officer’s name, but they {reversed course on Tuesday}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-wont-identify-officer-who-shot-and-killed-michael-brown/?tid=a_inl""> due to threats they said they had received. But in the era of social media, rumors can spread quickly in the absence of confirmed facts, allowing untruths to gain momentum and to reach people who may take them as fact.

In addition, for residents still shaken by the shooting and the days of confrontations that have followed, the failure to identify the officer — along with other details, including the number of times Brown was shot — feeds their frustration.
Anonymous, which promoted transparency and openness in the past, has also released accurate information about the shooting case in recent days. {Audio recordings that appeared to capture a police dispatcher’s confusion}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2&tid=a_inl""> in the wake of Brown’s death, released by Anonymous on Wednesday, were confirmed as authentic by county police.",138,NA,NA,NA

There's one obvious reason for a politician to be cautious before offering his or her opinion: Saying the wrong thing or rushing to judgment in a fraught situation with lots of conflicting details could do much more harm than good in the long run. (An easy example: President Obama's {comments on the arrest}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/22/AR2009072203800.html?tid=a_inl""> of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates.)

There's another reason for caution: Police agencies have long been unusually politically powerful. Politicians never want to purposely alienate anyone, but they are particularly wary of crossing the cops.

It's clear why.
People (read: voters) largely trust the police.

First and foremost, the police are popular.

Each year, Gallup polls Americans to evaluate how much confidence they have in various institutions. In the most recent iteration of that research, police were {rated third-highest}<hyperlink=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx"">, behind the military and small businesses. Americans have more confidence in the police than they do in organized religion.
Compare that with confidence ratings for Congress, which have fallen, continue to fall, and don't have much further they can drop. Branches of the military, the institution in which Americans have the most confidence, can't (and shouldn't, for clear reasons) endorse elected officials. But local police forces and, more specifically, local police unions, can and do.

People who trust the police more also vote more.

Not only that, but the police have stronger support from groups that vote more frequently. Below, data from {Gallup}<hyperlink=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/166487/honesty-ratings-police-clergy-differ-party.aspx""> breaking down how honest the police are perceived to be by political party and age.
{Gallup also found}<hyperlink=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/163175/minorities-less-confident-police-small-business.aspx""> that nonwhite Americans were substantially less likely to share white Americans' confidence in the police. Forty-eight percent of nonwhites had a ""great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in cops, compared to 68 percent of whites.

Whites, {Republicans}<hyperlink=""http://cookpolitical.com/story/5776"">,  and older Americans are also more likely to regularly vote, including in off-cycle elections where local politicians are on the ballot.
Politicians love to say they're endorsed by police -- and fear a ""soft on crime"" image.

If you've ever been near a television during October in an even-numbered year, you've seen a police officer on television, describing why Candidate X is backed by the police. If you've ever actually looked at the mail you receive that same month, you'll see pieces of mail that, somewhere, have a little gold badge prominently displayed.
Getting the endorsement of the police is not a golden ticket to election. But it beats the alternative: Police suggesting that a candidate will be dangerous for the community. Think of the Willie Horton ad President George H. W. Bush ran against Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race, a {revolving door}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmwhdDv8VrM""> in a prison gate. Ads like these, featuring local cops in recognizable communities, are the nightmares that keep politicians up at night.

Politicians and police have to work together after Election Day.

When Bill de Blasio ran for mayor of New York City last year, he regularly criticized {the police department's stop-and-frisk policy}<hyperlink=""http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/07/8531551/de-blasio-says-policing-politics-separates-him-pack"">. The move lost him {the endorsement}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2013/11/04/joe-lhota-for-new-york-city-mayor/""> of the conservative New York Post, but police unions {stayed out of the race}<hyperlink=""http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/10/8534870/spurning-de-blasio-and-lhota-police-unions-choose-not-choose"">, recognizing, in part, that de Blasio was sure to win.

Once he did, de Blasio quickly extended an olive branch,appointing veteran cop Bill Bratton to lead the NYPD. The move was {praised by police}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/pols-agencies-react-de-blasio-police-chief-pick-article-1.1538563""> and was greeted warily by the progressive base that swept de Blasio into power. But, it was a reflection of political reality: The police had just become de Blasio's employees, and he needed their help.

Earlier this month, that relationship became clear. De Blasio {defended}<hyperlink=""http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/13/de-blasio-defends-bratton-after-garner-death-sparks-weeks-of-backlash/""> Bratton following harsh criticism of the NYPD following the death of Eric Garner, the man who died after a police officer put him in a chokehold on Staten Island. Candidate de Blasio was in the unusual position of being able to criticize the NYPD's behavior, given his massive lead in the polls.

But Mayor de Blasio is responsible for the NYPD, so the agency gets a level of deference that it might not otherwise have received. He hired the guy that runs the police; what they do is a reflection of him. Cautiousness to that end can be tricky.
[tweetbegin 499935283400679424 tweetend]
In many places, there's an additional concern for elected officials: Negotiations over salary and benefits. Police officers are not allowed to strike and, in many places, have a binding arbitration process that is the final step in any dispute over pay and benefits. For elected officials with fiduciary responsibility over budgets, keeping a close relationship with police makes sense.
Add all of this up, and the political potency of the police is obvious. Voters love them, and politicians want their help before and after election day. So when a police force takes a step past its boundaries, as it appears to have done in Ferguson, politicians are rarely eager to be the first ones to point it out.",31,NA,NA,NA

“Ryan, tweet that they’re arresting me, tweet that they’re arresting me,"" The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery told Ryan Reilly, a reporter for the Huffington Post. But it was too late: Reilly himself was being put in handcuffs.

The two reporters were in a local McDonald's when police arrived to clear the place out. Apparently frustrated that the journalists weren't moving quickly enough, the officers slammed Lowery into a soda fountain machine, cuffed him and put him in the back of a van.

In an earlier time, Lowery might have phoned his editors to let them know he'd been detained. But this is not then.

[tweetbegin 499730277707833344 tweetend]
Back in The Washington Post newsroom, staffers monitoring social media were the first to become concerned about Lowery's whereabouts. Tweets may be little, ephemeral bits of information, but when they wind up launching a major national news story, 140 characters may as well be 140 pages. Within minutes of the reporters' arrest, other journalists were tweeting about the men's disappearance from social media. Those tweets were quickly picked up at The Post, and one editor tweeted to Lowery to call him. Lowery's uncharacteristic radio silence told those back in the newsroom everything they needed to know. Soon, Post staff members alerted executive editor Martin Baron.
[tweetbegin 499708529851113474 tweetend]
Social media is often wrongly credited for spurring, causing or creating events. And in large, movement-scale cases, the criticism may sometimes be valid. But Lowery's arrest is an example of an acute crisis, one that Twitter shaped and even helped resolve. Journalists routinely use Twitter as a documentary tool. But in Lowery and Reilly's case, it quickly became much more than that -- as the dividing line between observer and participant disappeared.

Had Lowery been able to follow through on his impulse to tweet first and call later, he might have been released by police even more quickly. As it was, it hardly took any time for the news to reach The Post, and for the journalists to be released. Equally noteworthy was how the newsroom first found out — not through a phone call, or a fax, or even an e-mail, but by watching the Twitter feeds of other journalists and noting Lowery's and Reilly's absence from those feeds. It's safe to say that how this unfolded would've looked completely different 10 years ago.
The incident highlights broader changes in the way that digital technology is changing how arrests take place. It would not be hard to hack together a program that delegated this task: ""If my smartphone winds up in a police station, automatically send this pre-written tweet."" Other tools have cropped up to handle similar situations. In 2011, Google developed a feature called {Speak2Tweet}<hyperlink=""http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-02/01/google-voice-to-tweet-for-egypt"">, which allowed Egyptians without access to the Internet to call an international number and leave a voicemail that would be converted into a tweet.

People have never been more technologically empowered to document their police interactions — which, by the way, is {completely legal}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/08/14/yes-you-can-record-the-police-and-maybe-the-police-should-be-recording-the-police/"">.",13,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo56,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/08/14/president-obamas-desire-to-reshape-race-relations-runs-into-stark-realities/,President Obama’s vision of post-racial America faces another stress test with Ferguson,Chris Cillizza,08/14/2014,02/26/2016,"The speech that made Barack Obama famous cast him as a post-racial figure offering a vision of America no longer divided along black and white lines.

""I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters,"" Obama, then an Illinois state senator, said in {his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19751-2004Jul27.html?tid=a_inl"">, adding: ""I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible."" Later, in perhaps the most quoted and quotable line of that speech, Obama insisted: ""There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America.""

And yet, from Obama's introduction to the national stage that night in Boston to today, as the country's collective eyes turn toward the ongoing racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo., the president's relationship to the issue of race has been far more complicated — and fraught — than he could have possibly imagined on that night a decade ago.  Obama was careful, particularly during his 2008 campaign, not to cast himself as a black man running for president but rather as a man running for president who just happened to be black. (He never used the words ""black"" or ""African American"" during the {entirety of his 2008 acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/28/us/politics/28text-obama.html?pagewanted=print"">.)
For Obama, the reality of just how hard it would be to be a post-racial politician hit home in the form of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Wright, a pastor at the church the Obamas attended in Chicago, became a major issue in spring 2008 when some of his {controversial remarks}<hyperlink=""http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/the-wright-controversy/""> came to light.  At first, Obama sought to downplay both Wright's comments and his relationship with him. But as the brushfire grew into a five-alarm fire, Obama responded with what, to my mind, is the single best speech he has ever given.

""I have brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles and cousins, of every race and every hue, scattered across three continents, and for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible,"" Obama said in that {speech}<hyperlink=""http://gochicago.about.com/od/barackobamaschicago/p/barack_obama_barbershop.htm"">, delivered at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. ""It's a story that hasn't made me the most conventional candidate. But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts — that out of many, we are truly one.""

That speech effectively quelled the Wright controversy — {John McCain's campaign cut an ad featuring Wright but never ran it}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/gop-super-pac-considering-jeremiah-wright-attack-on-obama/2012/05/17/gIQABYtzVU_blog.html?tid=a_inl""> — and took race, at least as a public-facing issue in the campaign, off the table.

But once Obama actually became president, his ability to defuse racial controversies in the country — either by word or deed — became significantly more difficult.
In summer 2009, Obama was quick to comment on an incident involving the arrest of Harvard Prof. Henry Louis Gates as he attempted to enter his own home — saying that the police had ""acted stupidly"" in the incident. Following an outcry from the police community, Obama backed off of his initial comments and {eventually convened the decidedly hokey ""beer summit""}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/gop-super-pac-considering-jeremiah-wright-attack-on-obama/2012/05/17/gIQABYtzVU_blog.html?tid=a_inl""> between Gates, the arresting officer, himself and Vice President Biden.

The Gates episode quite clearly influenced Obama's approach to other national issues with a racial tinge as his presidency continued. In March 2012, as his reelection bid ramped up, Obama briefly addressed the ongoing controversy over Trayvon Martin, an African American youth, who was shot and killed by a man named George Zimmerman in Florida. ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,"" {Obama said}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/23/obama-trayvon-martin_n_1375083.html"">, although he was very careful not to wade much deeper into the incident — citing a desire not to interfere in the ongoing legal proceedings. It wasn't until more than a year later — in July 2013 — that Obama addressed the death of Martin more fully. In that speech, {Obama spoke candidly from his own personal experience}<hyperlink=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/19/remarks-president-trayvon-martin"">:
There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store.  That includes me.  There are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars.  That happens to me — at least before I was a senator.  There are very few African Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.  That happens often.

On the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager shot and killed last week in Ferguson, Obama has, to date, issued only a {single, paragraph-long statement that read in part}<hyperlink=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/12/president-obama-issues-statement-death-michael-brown"">:
I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.  We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.  Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.

On Thursday, Obama delivered a measured statement from Martha's Vineyard, urging calm. ""I'd like us all to take a step back and think about how we will be moving forward,"" he said.

On one level, Obama's decision to watch and wait on high-profile incidents in which race seemed to play a role makes perfect sense.  As president — and particularly as the country's first African American president — his words carry tons of weight.  He and his team know that and want to do everything they can to help calm situations while also allowing those in charge on the local level to do their jobs. At the same time, Obama is caught between a genuine — and much-expressed — desire to use his own unique experiences to move the country beyond its divisive racial past and the realities on the ground, which suggest we aren't in that post-racial America just yet.

In many ways, Obama's difficulty in navigating matters of race as president mirrors his struggles in other areas as well. He has repeatedly and eloquently spoken about race — and his own experiences in navigating the world as the son of a white woman and a Kenyan father — over the past decade. But those words have done little to heal the racial wounds that exist in the country. Perhaps it's too much to expect for anyone — even the president — to help finally close such a deep and long-standing gash on the country's conscience. But such is the historic nature of Obama's presidency that many people — both white and black — expect him to do just that.

Today at least, Obama's vision of a post-racial America looks even further away than it did that night a decade ago in Boston.",70,NA,NA,NA

The program provides things like office equipment, tents, generators, pick-up trucks and ATVs, according to a PowerPoint presentation {on its website}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/1033ProgramFAQs.aspx"">. But law enforcement agencies can also use it to obtain military {aircraft}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/Pages/FileNotFound.aspx"">, {weapons}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/Pages/FileNotFound.aspx""> (including grenade launchers), and {heavily armored tactical vehicles}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/Pages/FileNotFound.aspx"">. You can see an example of one of these vehicles below, pictured in Ferguson (although it's unclear if local law enforcement there received the vehicle through the DOD program).
Law enforcement agencies can {browse online}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/Pages/FileNotFound.aspx""> to obtain small arms and other materials. Getting an armored personnel carrier is slightly more complicated, requiring the completion of a {one-page request form}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Documents/LESO%20Forms/vehiclerequest.pdf""> in which you can indicate your preference for a vehicle that has either wheels or tracks like a tank. ""Once ordered, arrangements for pick-up or delivery must be made within 14 days,"" according to the website.

Like many of our current {criminal justice excesses}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/30/the-meteoric-costly-and-unprecedented-rise-of-incarceration-in-america/"">, the 1033 program has its roots in the war on drugs. It arose from ""Subtitle C--Counter-Drug Activities"" in the {National Defense Authorization Act}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Documents/LESO%20Forms/FY1997NDAA.pdf""> of fiscal year 1997. The act gives preference to ""those applications indicating that the transferred property will be used in the counter-drug or counter-terrorism activities of the recipient agency.""

Part of the thinking behind the 1033 program was that if law enforcement personnel were waging a drug war, they should be outfitted like warriors. Priority for tactical vehicle requests is still given to law enforcement agencies in ""high intensity drug trafficking areas,"" which {according to the DEA}<hyperlink=""http://www.dea.gov/ops/hidta.shtml""> cover about 60 percent of the total U.S. population. Among other things, the program's FAQ page states that law enforcement agencies can use its four wheel drive vehicles to ""{haul away marijuana}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/Pages/FileNotFound.aspx"">.""
Taken at face value the program makes a certain degree of sense: military equipment that would otherwise be destroyed instead gets diverted to cash-strapped local law enforcement agencies. But in some cases, particularly with the heavy equipment, the program may actually be a money loser.

According to an interview with Marine General Joseph Dunford in {DoDBuzz}<hyperlink=""http://www.dodbuzz.com/2014/03/14/u-s-must-demolish-thousands-of-its-vehicles-in-afghanistan/"">,  an online defense journal, the heavily armored tactical vehicles known as {MRAPs}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/04/18/congratulations-your-tiny-town-has-an-mrap-and-is-ready-for-war/?tid=a_inl""> might cost about $10,000 each to destroy in the field in places like Afghanistan. But it costs up to $50,000 to bring each one back to the States.

Beyond financial considerations, there doesn't seem to be much wisdom in arming small town police agencies like military forces. The police chief of Keene, NH (pop. 23,000) famously justified the acquisition of an armored tactical vehicle to patrol the town's ""Pumpkin Festival and other dangerous situations,"" according to {The Economist}<hyperlink=""http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21599349-americas-police-have-become-too-militarised-cops-or-soldiers"">.
The needs of an occupying military force are--or at least should be--distinct from those of a local law enforcement agency. Effective policing requires much more than overwhelming firepower. It entails, among other things, working with the local community to gain its trust. But it's difficult to do that when you're staring community members down from atop the gun turret of an armored vehicle, as St. Louis County police officers did last night in Ferguson.",0,NA,NA,"Link re: website and weapons, etc. not working"

This comes after Wesley Lowery, a reporter for The Washington Post, {was arrested}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/washington-post-reporter-arrested-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl""> on Wednesday night along with Ryan J.

The American Society of News Editors described the situation in Ferguson as “a concerted, top-down effort to restrict the fundamental First Amendment rights of the public and the press” in a statement Thursday.

“From the beginning of this situation, the police have made conscious decisions to restrict information and images coming from Ferguson,” David Boardman, president of the association, said in the statement. “Of course, these efforts largely have been unsuccessful, as the nation and the world are still seeing for themselves the heinous actions of the police. For every reporter they arrest, every image they block, every citizen they censor, another will still write, photograph and speak.”

In {a statement issued Wednesday night}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/statement-from-martin-d-baron-on-the-arrest-of-wesley-lowery/2014/08/13/a8dd6e66-235f-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html?tid=a_inl"">, Martin D. Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, said the organization was “appalled” at the way Lowery was treated by police.

“That behavior was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news,” Baron said. “The physical risk to Wesley himself is obvious and outrageous. After being placed in a holding cell, he was released with no charges and no explanation. He was denied information about the names and badge numbers of those who arrested him.”

On Wednesday, the National Association of Black Journalists said it strongly condemned the arrests of Lowery, a member of the group, and Reilly.

“Journalists have a constitutionally protected right to work without the government interference,” Bob Butler, the association’s president, said in a statement. “We call on — and fully expect — the authorities to investigate what appears to be a violation of the First Amendment and to hold the officers involved to account, if necessary.”
Even before the arrests, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri {had accused the police}<hyperlink=""http://www.aclu-mo.org/files/5314/0796/6988/ACLU-MO_letter_to_Chief_Thomas_Jackson_8.13.14.pdf""> of infringing on the First amendment rights of protesters and the media.

For veterans of the wars that the Ferguson protests so closely resemble, the police response has appeared to be not only heavy-handed but out of step with the most effective ways for both law enforcement and military personnel to respond to demonstrations.

“You see the police are standing online with bulletproof vests and rifles pointed at peoples chests,” said Jason Fritz, a former Army officer and an international policing operations analyst. “That’s not controlling the crowd, that’s intimidating them.”

The protests in Ferguson began in earnest just a day after Brown was killed, when a prayer vigil for the slain teen turned into an evening of looting.

Scriven King, a 10-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force’s law enforcement component and a SWAT officer, attributed the initial spasm of violence to a lack of leadership and mismanagement of public  perception on the Ferguson Police Department’s behalf.

“The first thing that went wrong was when the police showed up with K-9 units,” Scriven said. “The dogs played on racist imagery…it played the situation up and [the department] wasn’t cognizant of the imagery.”

King added that, instead of deescalating the situation on the second day, the police responded with armored vehicles and SWAT officers clad in bulletproof vests and military-grade rifles.

“We went through some pretty bad areas of Afghanistan, but we didn’t wear that much gear,” said Kyle Dykstra, an Army veteran and former security officer for the State Department. Dykstra specifically pointed out the bulletproof armor the officers were wearing around their shoulders, known as “Deltoid” armor.
""I can’t think of a [protest] situation where the use of M4 [rifles] are merited,” Fritz said. “I don’t see it as a viable tactic in any scenario.”

Ferguson police have defended their handling of the protests and said some demonstrators have been trying to “co-opt” peaceful protests. But while the Ferguson and St. Louis county police departments may have made their presence felt in the streets, they have made only limited use of social media.

“They’ve kept people in an {information black hole}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/frustration-mounts-in-ferguson-as-little-new-information-is-available/?tid=a_inl"">,” King said, mentioning that their decision not to share details about operations more widely has only exacerbated the situation.

“There has not been a dialogue about the tactical situation the officers faced,” he said, referring to the fact that there might have been a reason that caused the officers to respond with such heavy equipment. “There could have been threats to the officers, but that information has not been shared to the public.”

As the violence continued to escalate over the course of the week, King said, Ferguson police also exacerbated tensions by allowing individual officers to engage with protesters.

“Officers were calling the protesters ‘animals,’ ” King said. “I can’t imagine a military unit would do that in any scenario.”

King added that if it were a military unit in a similar situation there would be a public affairs officer or civil affairs engagement team that would help bridge the gap between the riot control elements and the general population.

“I would hate to call the Ferguson response a military one,” he said. “Because it isn’t, it’s an aberration.”",450,NA,NA,NA

Rand Paul: De-militarize the police,Nia-Malika Henderson,08/14/2014,02/26/2016,"Sen. Rand Paul, who has stood apart from his party in directly addressing race and the criminal justice system, is now among the first to speak out forcefully on the police confrontations with protestors in Ferguson, Mo. in the wake of the shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, by a police officer.

In an op-ed in {Time Magazine}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> published Thursday, Paul framed the anger and police reactions through the lens of race, pointing to discrepancies in treatment:

 Anyone who thinks that race does not skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. And the root of the problem is big government. The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation. If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.

Paul, who has {taken on the inequity in drug sentencing and called for reform}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/07/08/cory-booker-rand-paul-team-up-on-sentencing-reform-bill/"">, blamed big government for what he called an outsized and militarized approach to the protestors.  Over the last four days, social media and major media outlets have shown pictures of police officers clad in riot gear and wielding guns at people with their hands up.
The senator argued that ""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies — where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.""

As he eyes a 2016 bid, Paul has tried to court African American voters and broaden the GOP tent -- and his op-ed appeared to validate their frustration:

Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.

This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.",101,NA,NA,NA

Transcript courtesy of Federal News Service.

PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good afternoon, everybody. Sound system’s really powerful.

Today I’d like to update the American people on two issues that I’ve been monitoring closely these last several days.
First of all, we continue to make progress in carrying out our targeted military operations in Iraq. Last week I authorized two limited missions: protecting our people and facilities inside of Iraq, and a humanitarian operation to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians stranded on a mountain.

A week ago, we assessed that many thousands of Yazidi men, women and children had abandoned their positions to take refuge on Mount Sinjar in a desperate attempt to avoid slaughter. We also knew that ISIL terrorists were killing and enslaving Yazidi civilians in their custody and laying siege to the mountain. Without food or water, they faced a terrible choice: starve on the mountain or be slaughtered on the ground.

That’s when and enslaving Yazidi civilians in their custody and laying siege to the mountain. Without food or water, they faced a terrible choice -- starve on the mountain or be slaughtered on the ground. That’s when America came to help.

Over the last week, the U.S. military conducted humanitarian airdrops every night, delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons of fresh water. We were joined in that effort by the United Kingdom and other allies pledged their support. Our military was able to successfully strike ISIL targets around the mountain, which improved conditions for civilians to evacuate the mountain safely.

 Yesterday, a small team of Americans -- military and civilian -- completed their review of the conditions on the mountain. They found that food and water had been reaching those in need and that thousands of people have been evacuating safely each and every night. The civilians who remain continue to leave, aided by Kurdish forces and Yazidis who are helping to facilitate the safe passage of their families.
So the bottom line is, is that the situation on the mountain has greatly improved and Americans should be very proud of our efforts. Because of the skill and professionalism of our military and the generosity of our people, we broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar, we helped vulnerable people reach safety and we helped save many innocent lives.

 Because of these efforts, we do not expect there to be an additional operation to evacuate people off the mountain and it’s unlikely that we’re going to need to continue humanitarian airdrops on the mountain. The majority of the military personnel who conducted the assessment will be leaving Iraq in the coming days. 

And I just want to say that as commander in chief, I could not be prouder of the men and women of our military who carried out this humanitarian operation almost flawlessly. I’m very grateful to them. And I know that those who are trapped on that mountain are extraordinarily grateful as well.

Now, the situation remains dire for Iraqis subject to ISIL’s terror through the country. And this includes minorities like Yezidis and Iraqi Christians. It also includes many Sunnis, Shia and Kurds. We’re going to be working with our international partners to provide humanitarian assistance to those who are suffering in northern Iraq. Wherever we have capabilities and we can carry out effective missions like the one we carried out on Mount Sinjar without committing combat troops on the ground, we obviously feel a great urge to provide some humanitarian relief to the situation. And I’ve been very encouraged by the interests of our international partners in helping on these kinds of efforts as well.
We  will continue airstrikes to protect our people and facilities in Iraq. We have increased the delivery of military assistance to Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting ISIL on the front lines. And perhaps most importantly, we are urging Iraqis to come together to turn the tide against ISIL, above all by seizing the enormous opportunity of forming a new inclusive government under the leadership of Prime Minister-designate Abadi. I had the chance to Prime Minister-designate Abadi a few days ago, and he spoke about the need for the kind of inclusive government, a government that speaks to all the people of Iraq, that is needed right now. He still has a challenging task in putting a government together, but we are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction.

Now, second, I want to address something that’s been in the news over the last couple of days, and that’s the last situation in Ferguson, Missouri. I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we’ve seen in the heartland of our country as police have clashed with people protesting, today I’d like us all to take a step back and think about how we’re going to be moving forward. 
This morning, I received a thorough update on the situation from Attorney General Eric Holder, who’s been following and been in communication with his team. I’ve already tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI to independently investigate the death of Michael Brown, along with local officials on the ground. The Department of Justice is also consulting with local authorities about ways that they can maintain public safety without restricting the right of peaceful protest and while avoiding unnecessary escalation. I made clear to the attorney general that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done. 

I also just spoke with Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri. I expressed my concern over the violent turn that events have taken on the ground, and underscored that now’s the time for all of us to reflect on what’s happened and to find a way to come together going forward. He is going to be traveling to Ferguson. He is a good man and a fine governor, and I’m confident that working together, he’s going to be able to communicate his desire to make sure that justice is done and his desire to make sure that public safety is maintained in an appropriate way.

Of course, it’s important to remember how this started. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old, and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again. And when something like this happens, the local authorities, including the police, have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death and how they are protecting the people in their communities. There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. And here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.

Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority. I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened. There are going to be different accounts of how this tragedy occurred. There are going to be differences in terms of what needs to happen going forward. That’s part of our democracy. But let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law, basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest, a reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us, and the need for accountability when it comes to our government.

So now is the time for healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done. And I’ve asked that the attorney general and the U.S. attorney on the scene continue to work with local officials to move that process forward. They will be reporting to me in the coming days about what’s being done to make sure that happens.
Thanks very much, everybody.

He also referred to issues that have been facing journalists covering the protests.

While it’s true that there have been incidents of rioting, looting, and violence directed at police, the initial protests against Michael Brown’s killing were peaceful.* The only hint of violence at the first protest was described by an Associated Press reporter, who reported chants of “kill the police.” That report has since been disputed by people at the protest, who have suggested that the AP journalist or police misheard other chants. From what I can find, that report was also never confirmed by any other journalist. The problem lies in how local police responded to that initial protest. They brought out the full riot arsenal.

Here we have a community that doesn’t see itself reflected in the police force. {Ferguson is 67 percent black, while its police force is more than 90 percent white}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl"">. It’s a community with long-simmering racial tension between police and the people they serve. It has now been well-reported that blacks are significantly over-represented when it comes to stop-and-frisks, traffic stops, and arrests in Ferguson, even though the town’s white residents are more likely to be caught with contraband like drugs or illegal weapons. It isn’t difficult to see why black residents of Ferguson may have already felt as if the police are an outside force that has been imposed upon them, rather than a group of public servants selected from the community to protect them from harm.

We then have an incident that represents all of these problems in a very concentrated form — an unarmed black man was killed by a (reportedly) white police officer who had stopped him as he was walking home. The police have since refused to release the officer’s name. They’ve said they have no intention of releasing the autopsy performed on Michael Brown. Police Chief Thomas Jackson refused to even say how many shots were fired at Brown. (He claimed he didn’t know, though that would be pretty easy to figure out.) Though the police department has body cameras, it hasn’t required its officers to actually wear them. All of this only adds to perception of a Ferguson Police Department that is detached, unaccountable, opaque, and unconcerned with how it is perceived by the community it serves. ({Gassing, arresting, and threatening journalists}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/journalists-attacked-police-ferguson_n_5677098.html?&""> doesn’t help with the perception that they feel they’re above transparency.) The police then showed up at a peaceful protest with military vehicles and weapons. If a town’s citizens are reminded over and over again that the law has no respect for them, we shouldn’t be surprised if they begin to lose respect for the law. This isn’t an excuse for the looting and rioting. But it does contextualize what we’ve seen.

This raises a question I’ve seen on Twitter and Facebook from a number of people — how should police respond to protest? And how should they respond when protests turn violent?

One of the pioneers of community policing — a form of policing that stresses interaction over reaction, deescalation over brute force, and that police should have a stake in the communities they serve —is Jerry Wilson, who was appointed police chief for Washington, D.C. in 1969. Wilson was of course appointed during a very turbulent time in America, and he took office just after the riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. had ripped the city apart. But Wilson went to great pains to recruit police officers from the city’s residents, and to try to make the police force more reflective of the city. He also took a much different approach to protest. I interviewed Wilson for {my recent book on police militarization}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Warrior-Cop-Militarization-Americas/dp/1610392116/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0"">. Here’s a passage from the section about Wilson’s approach to protest:

Wilson believed that an intimidating police presence didn’t prevent confrontation, it invited it. That didn’t mean he didn’t prepare, but he put his riot control teams in buses, then parked the buses close by, but out of sight of protesters. Appearances were important. In general, instead of the usual brute force and reactionary policing that tended to pit cops against citizens—both criminal and otherwise—Wilson believed that cops were more effective when they were welcomed and respected in the neighborhoods they patrolled. “The use of violence,” he told Time in 1970, “is not the job of police officers.”

It’s worth noting that during Wilson’s tenure, not only did Washington, D.C. not see the level of rioting and protest violence we saw in other parts of the country, crime actually fell in the city, even as it soared across the rest of the country.

The 1999 WTO protests in Seattle represent another landmark moment in how police handle protest in America. Those protests also began peacefully, but eventually evolved into rioting, mostly after police responded to peaceful protesters with teargas. Reports after the protests conducted by the city of Seattle and state of Washington found that police overreaction, paranoia, and misinformation played a major role in escalating the situation. Seattle’s chief of police at the time, Norm Stamper, now says his response to those protests was the biggest mistake of his career. I also interviewed Stamper at length for my book. Here’s an excerpt:

The “Battle for Seattle” is commonly looked back upon as the start of the modern anti-globalization movement. But it as also a landmark event in the way police and city officials react to protests. Though, again, there were few injuries and no fatalities, the images that emerged from Seattle depicted a city that had lost control. Going forward “control” would be the operative word in how police handled protests. In the years to come, the “Darth Vader” look would become the standard police presence at large protests. Cities and police officials would commit mass violations of civil and constitutional rights, and deal with the consequences later. There would violent, preemptive SWAT raids, mass arrests, and sweeping use of policed powers that would ensnare violent protesters, peaceful protesters, and people who had nothing to do with protest at all.

Stamper calls his decisions in Seattle “the worst mistake” of his career because he’s seen how the police response to protest has changed since 1999. “We gassed fellow Americans engaging in civil disobedience,” Stamper says. “We set a number of precedents, most of them bad. And police departments across the country learned all the wrong lessons from us. That’s disheartening. So disheartening. I mean, you look at what happened to those Occupy protesters at U.C. Davis, where the cop just sprays them down like he’s watering a bed of flowers, and I think that we played a part in making that sort of thing so common—so easy to do now. It’s beyond cringe-worthy. I wish to hell my career had ended on a happier note.”

The Occupy protests were also a fascinating case study in protest and how governments should respond to them. Because the protests went on all over the country, and because the police responses were so varied from city to city, we can look at the different approaches, the results those approaches produced, and perhaps gain some insight into how to best protect safety and property without infringing on the civil rights and liberties of protesters.

{Maj. Max Geron}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/MaxDPD""> is in charge of the Media Relations Unit, Community Affairs and Planning Unit of the Dallas Police Department. He’s also a security studies scholar who recently wrote his master’s thesis on policing and protests at the Naval Postgraduate School. Specifically, his thesis studied police reactions to the Occupy protests in Oakland, New York, Portland, and Dallas.  “The ideal police response to a protest is no response at all,” Geron says. (Geron emphasized that he was speaking as a scholar, and his views don’t necessarily represent those of the Dallas Police Department.) “You want to let people exercise their constitutional rights without interference.”
Barring that, Geron says, it’s important for police to communicate with protesters to establish expectations. “The technical term is negotiated management. What that means is that you want to come to an agreement about what’s expected, what’s allowed, and most important, you want to reach an agreement about what won’t be allowed.”

But Geron cautions against setting arbitrary expectations, such as mandatory dispersal times. “Most protesters will meet, protest, and go home when they feel they’ve made their point. If they aren’t breaking any laws, they can be left to express themselves.” Establishing a dispersal time then gives protesters something to rebel against. “When you establish arbitrary rules that have no basis in law, the police then feel they have to enforce those rules or they look illegitimate. They can set these rules with the best of intentions, but they just end up creating more problems for themselves.”

Geron also stresses fluidity and the ability to adjust on the fly. Police organizations are fond of protocol and standard operating procedures. But protests can be unpredictable. “The standard or by the book response may not be the best response,” he says. He points specifically to the Ferguson Police Department not releasing the name of the police officer who shot Michael Brown. “That may be the policy there. But you have to look at the situation. You have a community that is upset, that feels wronged. It’s important to establish trust with them. A big part of that is helping them to believe that you’re being straight and transparent with them. You have to be sure to protect the officer’s safety, but to win trust you have to be aware of the people’s fears, and you need to show you’re willing to make concessions to accommodate those fears.”

One active police chief who has adopted a less reactionary approach was Chris Burbank in Salt Lake City. {I profiled Burbank}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/30/chris-burbank-salt-lake-city_n_4170154.html""> last fall for the Huffington Post. Here’s what happened when the Salt Lake city council told Burbank he’d have to remove the Occupy protesters from the park where they had been encamped.

Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank, 46, was in charge of the eviction. But Burbank {took a decidedly different approach}<hyperlink=""http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700211373/Civil-servant-Chief-Chris-Burbank-strives-to-build-relationships-with-community-do-what-he.html""> from his counterparts in other cities who used aggressive, confrontational measures to oust their own Occupy encampments.

Burbank {showed up at the camp and talked to the protesters}<hyperlink=""http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705394223/19-arrested-as-police-clear-Occupy-Salt-Lake-tent-city-from-Pioneer-Park-Most-participants-left.html?pg=all"">, in some cases one on one. He explained that they’d need to start leaving the park at night, although they could come back during the day. He said that when the time came for them leave, they could do so peacefully, or they could choose to be arrested. He even asked them how they’d like their arrests to take place, in case they wanted the TV and newspaper cameras to photograph them giving themselves up for their cause . . .

When it came time to evict the Occupy protesters in Pioneer Park, then, {Burbank and his officers wore their standard, everyday uniforms}<hyperlink=""http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705394223/19-arrested-as-police-clear-Occupy-Salt-Lake-tent-city-from-Pioneer-Park-Most-participants-left.html?pg=all"">, not riot gear, as police units in other cities had. Burbank also made sure he was first on the scene — that the first person the protesters saw was the one with whom they had already had a conversation.

Most of the 200 protesters left voluntarily. Some took advantage of Burbank’s offer to have his officers help with their belongings. Nineteen chose to be arrested. There was no violence, no rioting and little anger. And so as images of violent clashes between Occupiers and police in other cities made headlines across the country, in Utah, some Occupiers even praised Burbank for the way he had handled their eviction. It’s one reason why the Salt Lake Tribune {named Burbank its 2011 “Utahn of the Year.”}<hyperlink=""http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/sltrib/home2/53155068-183/burbank-chief-lake-salt.html.csp"">
""I  just don’t like the riot gear,” Burbank says. “Some say not using it exposes my officers to a little bit more risk. That could be, but risk is part of the job. I’m just convinced that when we don riot gear, it says ‘throw rocks and bottles at us.’ It invites confrontation. Two-way communication and cooperation are what’s important. If one side overreacts, then it all falls apart.”

Burbank also dismisses the idea that his approach could only work in a smaller city like Salt Lake. “I think it should be applied everywhere. That’s exactly how we as a nation should approach these events. We should approach it asking, ‘How can we best facilitate these people’s free speech?’ Putting them nine miles away from whatever they’re protesting doesn’t allow them to get their message across.

“Doing it this way takes extra time, and sometimes you take a little criticism from your officers,” he says. “But if my officers feel unsafe, that’s when it’s my responsibility as chief to show up personally.”

Burbank’s approach is far from common, but there are at least some other police officials who share his philosophy. One of them is {former Madison, Wisconsin Police Chief David Couper.}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/09/how-to-respond-to-a-prote_n_3893683.html"">
Since the days of the the labor and civil rights movements and through the era of the protests against the war in Vietnam, we seem to have learned very little about the best way for government officials to respond to those who disagree with them.

This is a sad situation in a country such as ours which professes the values of freedom and justice that it does . . .

In a democracy, police have a very complex role compared to what is expected of the police in other systems. The power of the state must be balanced with the rights of an individual; other systems have no balance requirement—only to use the power given them by the state. Uniquely, police in a democracy don’t exist solely to maintain order on behalf of the state, but also to assure that the fundamental rights guaranteed to every citizen are protected in the process. “This is never more evident as when a totalitarian state responds to public protest. In this instance, the goal of the police is to prevent or repress, not facilitate, protest. We see that in today in Syria, China, and other less-than-democratic governments. In these instances, the very act of disagreeing with the government is illegal and subject to police action . . .

Early in my police career, I began to re-think the role of police and protest after I had witnessed and participated in too many that had gone wrong.

I was beginning to see that proximity mattered, being close was safe—just like on the beat. Get close, talk, stay in contact. The further the police positioned themselves from people in the crowd, the greater the chance the crowd would depersonalize them; to see them as objects and not people. Therefore, getting closer to the people, whether in managing crowds or patrolling neighborhoods on foot, seemed to be a good basic strategy that needed to be experimented with.

So, that’s what I did when I came to Madison. For over 20 years, we in Madison responded to anti-war rallies, civil rights demonstrations, student block parties, and other mass gatherings without substantial incident. How did that happen? We developed what today is being called the “soft approach” (see the recent work of Dr. Clifford Stott at the University of Liverpool). What Stott and others found is that dialogue and liaison are effective police strategies in crowd situations because they allowed for an on-going risk assessment that improved command-level decision-making. Using this strategy, there was a better outcome because it also encouraged ‘self-regulation’ in the crowd and thus forestalled the use of unnecessary force by police during moments of tension.

Geron also emphasizes personalization, pointing out that when police show up in full riot garb, especially gear that covers their faces, they dehumanize themselves to protesters. This is especially dangerous when the protests are against the police themselves, as was the case in Ferguson. “You make all of your officers look  like one another. To the protesters, to the people, your officers are no longer individual human beings with faces. You’ve just made each of them a faceless symbol of the police institution that the protesters are reacting against.”

The police in Ferguson are almost a textbook example of how not to react to protest. “When you start by rolling out the the SWAT team, and you then position a sniper on top of an APC with his gun pointed at the protesters, what kind of message are you sending? Did they really expect the sniper would need to start shooting people? It was just a show of force,” Geron says. He adds that it’s particularly important for police leaders to prepare their officers when the protests are aimed at police, and to stress the importance of separating themselves from criticism directed at the agency, or at policing in general. “It’s a crucial conversation that you need to have with your commanders and your officers. And you have to expect that they won’t get it at first. You have to tell them that it isn’t personal ‘They’re going to be critical of us. They may yell at us. But that’s okay. That’s their right. And our job is to protect their rights.'”

The buzz phrase in policing today is officer safety. You’ll also hear lots of references to preserving order, and fighting wars, be it on crime, drugs, or terrorism. Those are all concepts that emphasize confrontation. It’s a view that pits the officers as the enforcer, and the public as the entity upon which laws and policies and procedures are to be enforced.
Note the contrast between that and the approaches recommended by Geron, Burbank, Couper, Stamper, and Wilson. They all pit police officers not as enforcers, but as servants. Their primary function isn’t to impose order, but to preserve and protect the rights of citizens. In a strictly academic sense, preserving order and protecting rights are the same thing. Operationally, they’re radically different approaches to policing.

One final, important point: Policing is often cast as a balance between safety and freedom. The problem with that formulation is that it implies that to get a little more of one, we have to give up a some of the other. You need only look at Ferguson to see why that isn’t true. I doubt the residents of that town feel particularly safe or particularly free right now. The corollary to this is that there’s also a zero-sum relationship between officer safety and less aggressive, less militaristic more community-oriented policing. You have to give up some of one in order to get more of the other. Again, Ferguson is a pretty compelling argument to the contrary. The town is essentially a martially law zone right now. And I’d be surprised if you could find many officers on duty these last few nights who would tell you they feel safer today than they did a few weeks ago.

WashingtonPost,wapo64,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/14/obama-weighs-in-on-ferguson-likely-satisfying-no-one/,"Obama weighs in on Ferguson, likely satisfying no one",Paul Waldman,08/14/2014,02/26/2016,"This afternoon, President Obama made his first public statement about the situation in Ferguson, MO (he had issued a {written statement}<hyperlink=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/12/president-obama-issues-statement-death-michael-brown""> on Tuesday), but if anyone was hoping for something unexpected or far-reaching, they will be disappointed. And some certainly were dissatisfied, both with the content of Obama’s statement and his tone, that characteristic cadence he uses when reading something and trying not to inject it with too much emotion.

Here’s the heart of {what he said}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-president-obamas-remarks-on-unrest-in-ferguson-mo-and-iraq/2014/08/14/c8ce971e-23c7-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?tid=a_inl"">:
Of course, it’s important to remember how this started. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old, and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again. And when something like this happens, the local authorities, including the police, have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death and how they are protecting the people in their communities. There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. And here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.

Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority. I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened. There are going to be different accounts of how this tragedy occurred. There are going to be differences in terms of what needs to happen going forward. That’s part of our democracy. But let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law, basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest, a reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us, and the need for accountability when it comes to our government.

So now is the time for healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done.

It’s understandable to hear Obama talk this way. First of all, he was probably eager to avoid saying anything that would get anyone too riled up, particularly while the situation is ongoing. And since the Justice Department is participating in the investigation, it’s important for him as the head of the federal government not to express an opinion (yet) about what actually happened between Michael Brown and the officer who killed him, lest it appear that that investigation is anything but an objective one.

All that may be true, but it still won’t go down easy. We expect the president to be not just the head of the government but the leader of the nation and its people, which means we want him to give voice to our emotions. When so many of us watch this situation and say, “This is insane!” we want the president to come out and say the same thing. And when we have a situation where race is such a critical part of the equation, one can’t help but notice that not a word about that factor passed Obama’s lips.

So it may be left to other politicians not only to express the emotions so many people are feeling, but to do something else Obama didn’t do — ask how the events in Ferguson relate to policy, and how those policies might be changed.

Yesterday, I wrote {a post}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/13/why-arent-libertarians-talking-about-ferguson/?tid=a_inl""> asking about the response to Ferguson from libertarians, particularly libertarian politicians, to the situation in Ferguson. The post made a lot of libertarians very mad; amid the river of mindless venom directed at me in the last 24 hours, there were some critiques that actually had a reasonable point to make, about the way I had framed the question and had overgeneralized (if you’re interested, I addressed that this morning in {this lengthy discussion}<hyperlink=""http://prospect.org/article/trying-learn-criticism-even-when-its-misguided-or-rude""> of what one can learn from one’s critics). In response, some people asked, “So where are the liberal politicians?” It’s a good question.
After all, the situation in Ferguson is a vivid reminder of problems that liberals have been concerned about for a long time, most particularly the way black people are treated by the police in big cities and small towns all over America. This has been evident in both Michael Brown’s death and the way the police in Ferguson have reacted to protests by residents there, treating them not like American citizens who are upset and have every right to let the world know, but instead like they’re some kind of invading army that must be met with force. As many have pointed out, if you’re white, like Cliven Bundy’s supporters, you can literally point rifles at federal officials, and the response will be to politely ask whether this whole thing can’t be worked out, but if you’re black you can get tear gassed in your own front yard for holding your hands up and saying “Don’t shoot.”

And then there’s the related issue of the way in the last few years, first as a part of the War on Drugs and then under the banner of “homeland security,” police forces everywhere have been militarized to a frightening degree, which makes confrontations like this one far more likely to turn violent. When you have your police officers put on their military-style uniforms, strap on all their military-style gear, grab their military-style rifles, then pile into a military-style assault vehicle, they will arrive at their destination prepared to wage war. The people they’ll be seeing through their gas masks and riot shields won’t be citizens worthy of respect and consideration, they’ll be the enemy. Despite the efforts of some journalists, most particularly {Radley Balko}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/?tid=a_inl"">, the militarization of America’s law enforcement remains an issue that is not discussed nearly enough. But it is something that liberals have expressed plenty of concern over in the past, and now’s the opportunity to bring it to the fore.

So even if you could argue that we don’t gain very much by having every backbench member of Congress “weigh in” on the situation, all of that may confer on liberals an obligation to at least make their feelings known, if for no other reason than the fact that the more prominent people there are who do so, the greater the pressure to both resolve this situation and address the underlying problems it highlights. One politician whom I saw mentioned frequently when people were asking “What about the liberals?” is Elizabeth Warren; this morning, she made her first statement about it, a {tweet}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/499904279961149440"">  that read, “This is America, not a war zone. The people of #Ferguson just want answers. We all want answers.”

Beyond “weighing in,” what more should we demand from members of Congress? For starters, they ought to be asked what kind of contributions national policy has made to this situation, and how that might be changed in the future. For example, one of the main reasons police forces have become so militarized is that the federal government has been giving them all manner of military equipment — not just guns, but even things like armored vehicles built for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to {this recent ACLU report}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf"">, an estimated 500 local police departments have even been given MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) vehicles, which are designed to resist armor-piercing roadside bombs. Perhaps the madness of an ill-trained but overly-equipped police force in Ferguson confronting American citizens with that kind of equipment should prompt a reexamination of the transfer of all that military equipment. That’s something members of Congress can do something about, so we ought to press them to see if they plan to.

The greater a national constituency a politician has, the greater their influence and the more responsibility they have to offer something constructive. I was glad to see Rand Paul, who does have such a national constituency, offer {this op-ed}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> in Time Magazine this afternoon talking about the federal government’s role in arming local police forces way beyond their actual needs. There’s a great opportunity for him to join with his liberal colleagues to advocate legislation to address this situation. If Paul got together with someone like Warren, they could create a powerful coalition to actually accomplish something. For a whole variety of reasons, it may not be realistic to expect Barack Obama to be the primary vehicle for constructive change coming out of the Ferguson debacle in the short term. But maybe other politicians from both parties could step into that void.",363,NA,NA,NA

But the St. Louis County Police Department responded to the ACLU’s request with a note saying that the report wasn’t going to be released because the investigation is ongoing. (At the request of the Ferguson Police Department, the investigation has been turned over to the county.)
The ACLU said it also received an e-mail response to the request, which consisted of a “CAD Calls List” record that included the date, the address and time of a call simply labeled as “SHOOT.”

According to the lawsuit, the ALCU wants the court to declare that the incident report is an open record and to enter an injunction forcing the county to release the document. The group is also asking the court to impose a civil penalty against the county for violating the Sunshine Law and to order the county to pay the ACLU’s legal fees.

That disparity is hardly unusual, both in police departments across the country and in other local government agencies.

Whites are more likely to hold jobs with local governments than African Americans, Hispanics or other non-white minorities. Whites are much more likely to hold high-paying jobs within those governments.

And while the disparity between white and non-white employment has narrowed over the last half century, with the implementation of anti-discrimination laws and the country’s increasing diversity, it remains the fact that whites are employed more, and at higher wages, than their non-white counterparts
Start with police departments themselves. In a country in which 64 percent of the population is white, according to the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows almost 75 percent of full-time sworn law enforcement personnel are white ({The New Republic}<hyperlink="""">  first pulled this data from a BJS publication).

African Americans make up 12 percent of law enforcement agencies, just about in line with their 12.2 percent share of the population. In police departments, it’s Hispanic officers who are the most underrepresented: Though they account for 16 percent of the population, just 10.3 percent of law enforcement officers are Hispanic.

Smaller cities tend to have much less diverse police populations, which is not terribly surprising given that smaller cities tend to have higher percentages of white residents (Ferguson is a relatively rare example of a small city with an overwhelmingly non-white population). In cities with fewer than 100,000 residents, more than 80 percent of law enforcement officers are white.
In other government agencies, too, whites are overrepresented among higher-wage earners. Whites make up 74.8 percent of high-wage earners in local government agencies, 10 points higher than their share of the population. Blacks make up 11.2 percent of those high-wage earners; Hispanics account for just 8.8 percent, about half their actual representation in the general population, according to {a study}<hyperlink=""http://metrotrends.org/commentary/race-and-local-government.cfm""> conducted by Census Bureau historian Todd Gardner for the Urban Institute.
""While high-wage local government employment has become more diverse over time and has generally paralleled the increasing diversity of the population, keeping up with the rapid pace of diversification has been a longstanding challenge for local government employment,” Gardner wrote.

The percentage of minorities in local government increased dramatically after passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, which banned employment discrimination on the basis of race. In 1960, blacks made up just 4 percent of high-wage government employees, a little more than one-third the percentage they account for today. Blacks made up 9.8 percent of low-wage government workers in 1960, and they make up 17.1 percent today. Hispanics went from 2.3 percent of the low-wage government workforce in 1960 to 15.1 percent today.

In the 100 largest metropolitan areas, the disparity is even more stark: Whites make up 57.8 percent of the population in those cities, and 69.7 percent of high-wage jobs. By contrast, blacks make up 13.8 percent of the population and account for 20.6 percent of low earning jobs.

Mainly, it’s Hispanic and Asian American populations missing out on government jobs. While the proportion of African Americans in high-wage jobs has equalized in recent decades, other non-white populations remain significantly below proportional representation.
Government positions, which usually come with stability and good benefits, have long been a route to upward social mobility, Gardner wrote. Even half a century after the Civil Rights Act, African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans remain at a disadvantage in getting those jobs — especially in police departments.",9,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo67,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/14/why-republicans-arent-quite-sure-how-to-talk-about-ferguson-either/,Why Republicans aren’t quite sure how to talk about Ferguson either,Sean Sullivan,08/14/2014,02/26/2016,"One of the many important questions the Republican Party is grappling with as it seeks to remake itself ahead of the 2016 election is this: Does it want to renew its tradition of being the tough on crime, zero tolerance party of law and order? Or does it want to shed its long-established reputation for toughness and embrace a more compassionate platform?

Either way, one thing is clear: the '90s are over.

A fitful evolution for the GOP has been thrown into sharp relief this week by the heightened tensions in suburban St. Louis. Five days after a police officer fatally shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in the city of Ferguson, most Republicans have been conspicuously silent on the escalating conflict between protesters and law enforcement. And of the handful of vocal lawmakers, the majority have spoken out sharply against the police, adopting postures that would have seemed far out of the GOP mainstream just a decade or two ago.
President Obama has {faced difficulties}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/14/white-house-walks-a-careful-line-on-ferguson/""> finding the right tone and timing with his response to what happened in Ferguson, strained by the optics of being on vacation and the tricky balance he's sought to strike between calming the strife and demanding accountability.

Republicans, squeezed between competing law enforcement ideologies, have found it just as tough.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a libertarian-leaning likely presidential candidate, {wrote on Time Magazine's Web site}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> Thursday that police have overreacted by brandishing weapons and tactics normally reserved for the military.

“There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response,” he wrote. “The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.”
Protesters in Ferguson have complained about what they see as overly aggressive attempts at control by the police. And a firestorm was set off when officers arrested two journalists, including The Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery. Police, meanwhile, say they have been trying to curb looting by maintaining an active presence.
Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), another libertarian-leaning Republican with a well-established reputation for eschewing traditional GOP views, voiced concerns on Twitter that law enforcement was being too aggressive.

“Images & reports out of #Ferguson are frightening. Is this a war zone or a US city? Gov't escalates tensions w/military equipment & tactics,” he tweeted Wednesday.
[tweetbegin 499740253633388546 tweetend]
The weigh-in from Paul and Amash was strikingly similar to language coming from across the aisle: Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) argued Thursday, in a statement released around the same time as Paul's, that authorities need to “de-militarize this situation—this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution.”

The emergence of Paul and Amash as prominent GOP figures has signaled that the party is no longer exactly it was back in the 1990s, when New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani became a national Republican hero thanks to his tough crackdown on crime by way of measures many Democrats viewed as draconian.

But the fact that Paul and Amash haven't been joined by a chorus of other Republicans suggests the shift isn't quite universal. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) adopted a much more measured posture Thursday, offering his condolences for Brown's death but not criticizing law enforcement.

""In the wake of this terrible tragedy, my thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of Michael Brown. I strongly support a full and thorough investigation of the events surrounding his death, and subsequent actions, including the detention of journalists covering this heartbreaking situation,"" he said in a statement.

Meanwhile, most of the party's 2016 presidential candidates have yet to weigh in.

“There is an opportunity, I think, for leaders to stop being afraid and really kind of step into the conversation and help guide it,” said Michael Steele, a former Republican National Commitee chairman.

But Steele, who is African American, says he doesn't fault most Republicans for staying silent on such a volatile and complex matter.
""I don’t think it belongs in the realm of the partisan,” he said. “I’m not going to excoriate them for not saying anything or not saying the right thing because who the hell knows that the right thing is to say is.""

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) was less critical of law enforcement than Amash or Paul. He released a careful statement Thursday that seemed to empathize with all parties – police, the protesters, the press and civil libertarians.

“Reporters should never be detained -- a free press is too important -- simply for doing their jobs. Civil liberties must be protected, but violence is not the answer. Once the unrest is brought to an end, we should examine carefully what happened to ensure that justice is served,” he said.

Law enforcement endorsements are still prized possessions in politics. And being seen as too weak on crime remains a drawback -- even if the definition of ""weak"" seems to have shifted. Walking a careful line, as Cruz is trying to do, may become standard practice for many Republicans looking to project an image of strength without alienating a growing base of libertarian-leaning activists.

Paul, for his part, is clearly trying to endear himself to that base full-bore, embracing the role of de facto standard-bearer.

""Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security,"" he wrote Thursday. ""This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.""",5,NA,NA,NA

Is it literally that black and white?
Political scientists {Christian Davenport}<hyperlink=""http://christiandavenportphd.weebly.com/""> and {David Armstrong}<hyperlink=""http://uwm.edu/political-science/people/armstrong-david/""> along with colleague {Sarah Soule}<hyperlink=""http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/sarah-soule""> studied how the race of protesters affect how police respond to protest events in their paper, “{Protesting While Black? The Differential Policing of American Activism, 1960 to 1990}<hyperlink=""http://asr.sagepub.com/content/76/1/152.short"">” (see ungated version {here}<hyperlink=""http://christiandavenportphd.weebly.com/uploads/1/8/3/5/18359923/protesting_while_black.pdf"">). In their research of more than 15,000 protest events that took place in the United States between 1960 and 1990, they find that:

… when compared with other groups, African American protesters are more likely to draw police presence and that once police are present they are more likely to make arrests, use force and violence, and use force and violence in combination with arrests at African American protest events.

What constitutes a protest event? The Davenport et al. study drew data from daily editions of the New York Times and included a wide range of protest events: rallies, demonstrations, marches, vigils, picketing, civil disobedience, ceremonial events, motorcades, dramaturgical demonstrations, symbolic displays, riots, mob violence and attacks. To be included, the protest events had to have three characteristics:  

There had to be more than one participant at the event (e.g., uncoordinated hunger strikes or acts of self-immolation were excluded).
Participants at an event had to have articulated a claim, whether a grievance against or an expression of support for a target.
The event had to have happened in the public sphere or have been open to the public.
What is an “African American protest?” The authors coded a protest as an “African American protest” when at least some of the participants at an event were African American. (Because the authors used newspaper articles as their data source, they were unable to compute a ratio of African American to white protesters at any given event.) From 1960 to 1990, 25 percent of the protest events studied by the authors had African American participants.

How do the authors measure police response? The authors go beyond simply capturing police presence to include analysis of arrests and use of force by police. In their data, they found that police were present at about 38 percent of protest events. At events where police were present, police did nothing at 33 percent of the events, made arrests at 34 percent, used force or violence at 25 percent, and used force/violence in conjunction with arrests at 8 percent of protest events.

The figure below from {the study}<hyperlink=""http://christiandavenportphd.weebly.com/uploads/1/8/3/5/18359923/protesting_while_black.pdf""> shows the difference in police presence when protests were coded as “African American” or not (over time). In general, African American protest events were more likely to be policed. Even when controlling for other factors that might lead to police presence (e.g., protester use of violence and property damage; protests targeting the government; presence of counter-demonstrators), African American protest events were still more likely to draw police presence (see Table 1 {in the paper}<hyperlink=""http://christiandavenportphd.weebly.com/uploads/1/8/3/5/18359923/protesting_while_black.pdf"">).
Perhaps even more relevant to the current events in Ferguson, Mo., are the findings from the study on the actions police engage in when at protests. Again, when controlling for a host of other factors that would affect how police respond, the authors found that once police arrive at a protest event with African Americans present, “they are more likely to make arrests, to use force/violence, and to use force/violence in conjunction with arrests than they are to do nothing, although only the last of these outcomes is significantly more likely” (see Tables 2 and 3 {in the paper}<hyperlink=""http://christiandavenportphd.weebly.com/uploads/1/8/3/5/18359923/protesting_while_black.pdf"">).
It's important to note that the study also shows that the effect — what the authors call “Protesting While Black” — has varied over time. Their study suggested that the impact of “Protesting While Black” was historically bounded to the earlier period, prior to the enactment of civil rights legislation.
Before folks get comfortable with the idea that perhaps things are better now than they were in the ’60s, I’ll leave you with a bit from one of the authors’ concluding paragraphs:

… our findings suggest that different racial groups experienced the right to protest freely unevenly across the 1960 to 1990 period. As a result, the concerns expressed by African American protesters (who in our period of inquiry may have turned to protest because they did not have equal access to institutional political channels) may have gone unaddressed. This could have led members of the African American community to simply stop protesting (as Figure 1 suggests). In summary, our findings imply that in many years, white protesters enjoyed a greater privilege of protest, and thus greater access to democratic institutions, than did African American citizen/protesters.

I am curious to learn whether there has been any extension of the work done by Davenport and colleagues to include the past 25 years.

This morning, I looked in a very different direction, to “{The Andy Griffith Show}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA21YA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000NA21YA&linkCode=as2&tag=thewaspos09-20&linkId=SZUCJ4IUUBW6PUMU"">,” which debuted on CBS in 1960 and starred Andy Griffith as Mayberry’s Sheriff Andy Taylor.
The gap between Ferguson and Mayberry is striking and important. As {my colleagues have reported}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl"">,  Ferguson’s overwhelmingly white police force “bears little demographic resemblance to the citizens of this St. Louis suburb, a mostly African American community whose suspicions of the law enforcement agency preceded Saturday afternoon’s shooting.”

Even when it began, executives acknowledged that “The Andy Griffith Show” was a nostalgic portrait of small-town life. But it expressed an ideal that has leached out of American pop culture and public policy, to dangerous effect: that the police were part of the communities that they served and shared their fellow citizens’ interests. They were of their towns and cities, not at war with them.
Much of the crime-related tension in “The Andy Griffith Show” comes from the contrast between what people think real police work is and what the Sheriff knows it to be. In the pilot episode of the sitcom, the only crime is a case of jaywalking by an elderly woman, brought in by Taylor’s overzealous deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts).

In another episode, a manhunt for an escaped criminal brings higher authorities to town. Barney frets: “What are the state police going to think when they come here and find we got an empty jail? They’re gonna we’re just a hick town where nothing ever happens!” For Barney, the welfare of the community is an abstraction compared with his idealized sense of what it means to be a cop.

Sheriff Taylor ultimately outsmarts the overreaching state cops to catch the fugitive. He knows his town well enough to guess which back road the fugitive might use, to read the concern in an elderly woman’s voice and to direct the wanted man to a leaky row boat as an escape vessel, enabling the state police to pick him up without firing a shot.
And his work is not confined to crime. Sheriff Taylor is the kind of man who opens up for a drug store owner who is running late to work and helps an elderly woman deal with a new pharmacist who does not want to give her pills without a prescription. He helps a talented local guitarist who is making a nuisance of himself find a job with a traveling musician. When his housekeeper gets married, Sheriff Taylor performs the rites. His kindness and his sense of Mayberry matter far more than his capacity for violence.

Not only is this sort of work absent from contemporary pop culture about policing, the idea that such service to the community is not quite real police work lingers under two of the funnier and more thoughtful recent movies to engage with the idea of the idea of an escalated war on crime.

Instead of disabusing their notions, both films indulge these characters by providing threats that demand a military-style response.

In “Hot Fuzz,” rural cop Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) is bitterly disappointed when Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), a newcomer to the small town where Butterman grew up, fails to confirm the idea of urban police work that Butterman has gleaned from American movies like “Point Break” and “Bad Boys II.”

The joke of “Hot Fuzz” is that the over-the-top tactics and weapons Danny dreams of employing turn out to be necessary. A sinister cabal is murdering anyone who mars the small-town charm. Butterman, Angel and their fellow cops dust off their moldering riot gear, take a weapons cache out of evidence and lay waste to the criminals.

In “21 Jump Street,” rookie cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are bitterly disappointed when they are assigned to patrol a local park. When action arrives, they lack the basic competence to respond. After they arrest a drug dealer, he has to be released because Schmidt and Jenko forget to read the man his Miranda rights. But their dream of action heroism redeems them. The drug dealers reappear, and Schmidt and Jenko are the only people who are strapped up with enough weaponry to defeat them.
These are the movies that are actually engaging with the idea of police escalation rather than simply adopting such tactics in the name of exciting action sequences.

That is actually rather generous: most superhero movies involve threats so large that the police are irrelevant in the response, showing up mostly in crowd sequences to promise their support on the ground to costumed avengers who are fighting in the air.

The legacy of Mayberry stays alive in the world of television showrunner Michael Schur, the co-creator of “{Brooklyn Nine-Nine.}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GTZWS5A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00GTZWS5A&linkCode=as2&tag=thewaspos09-20&linkId=XEJE5OPZ3RGBHLCS"">” In that show, like ABC’s short-lived drama “{The Unusuals}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025KVKDO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0025KVKDO&linkCode=as2&tag=thewaspos09-20&linkId=5DCFTCQDKR34Q5VT"">,”  the police deal with a range of misdemeanors and violent crimes rather than going to war with high-tech criminal syndicates or fiendishly clever serial killers.

The cops are defined by their relationship to their neighborhood and the department. One officer, Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) grew up in Brooklyn, as did the precinct secretary (Chelsea Peretti), while their colleague Charles is a relative newcomer to the neighborhood and a devotee of the borough’s foodie culture. Their captain, Ray Holt (Andre Braugher) was one of the first New York City cops to come out on the job, but he is ambivalent about the department where he has had to fight to succeed.

But even in “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” cops train to raid buildings. And the first season ended with Jake getting his dream assignment: a chance to go up against some real criminals as part of a task force targeting the mafia.

“We need more TV shows and movies that reflect the world we’re seeing in news reports from Ferguson, and we need ones that do so directly,” Vox’s VanDerWerff wrote. “Fiction helps us process and make sense of the world, and there’s room in the images out of Ferguson (and so many other cities) for an earnest and nuanced consideration of what happens when police officers are given military-grade weaponry.”

It would be nice if culture were honest about the consequences of scenarios that make for high-stakes police chases and artfully choreographed action sequences. But that is still only a partial solution to a culture that is deeply invested in the idea that being a cop means going to war against criminals rather than being a part of a community. I don’t know that we can go back to Mayberry, if it ever existed. But American fiction and American towns could use more cops like Sheriff Andy Taylor and fewer warriors like the ones in Ferguson.",57,NA,NA,NA

""If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off,"" Paul writes. ""But, I wouldn't have expected to be shot."" He goes on to make the case for a demilitarization of the police in America within the framework of a broader criticism of ""big government""; ""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies — where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement,"" Paul writes.
Paul also ties what is happening in Missouri to his broader campaign against the government's expanded reach into average Americans' phones and e-mail accounts.  ""When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury — national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture — we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands,"" he writes.

And, finally, Paul addresses the racial element of the situation. ""Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention,"" writes Paul. ""Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately.""

Now, imagine any other Republican — literally, ANY OTHER ONE — writing something like that without taking a huge amount of incoming about being late to the issues, etc.  That goes double for the other people Paul is likely to face off against for the Republican primary nomination in two years' time.
The Ferguson op-ed is the latest piece of evidence that Rand Paul is simply fishing in different waters than many of the people who want to lead the Republican party in 2016. While his appeal to libertarian-minded Republicans gets most of the ink — {Robert Draper did a terrific piece on that angle last weekend in the New York Times magazine}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/magazine/has-the-libertarian-moment-finally-arrived.html""> — Paul's ability to appeal to younger people, a part of which is tied in with his libertarian leanings, and his real attempt to court non-white constituencies sometimes gets lost.

Paul's attempts to broaden the GOP coalition by speaking out on things like the NSA surveillance program and what should be done to prevent another Ferguson come as virtually everyone within (and without) the party acknowledge that if Republicans can't grow their coalition beyond white voters, they will have major problems winning national elections in the future.  In 2012, only one in ten people who voted for Mitt Romney weren't white, a figure that is simply not sustainable for a national party.
Paul's critics will note that being ""interesting"" is not the same thing as being electable. And, there's no question that Paul is more willing to take risks on issues — Ferguson being only the latest example — than more establishment politicians. Those risks can pay off — Paul's filibuster against NSA surveillance turned him into a national star — but can also backfire if/when more information comes out that undermines the initial conclusions. (That reality is why {President Obama continues to be decidedly temperate in his remarks on the death of Michael Brown.}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-speaks-about-shooting-of-michael-brown-in-ferguson-mo/2014/08/14/d49f63ac-23c7-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z1&tid=a_inl"">)

All fair points. But the electoral and demographic realities of the nation right now mean that the Republican party will need to take some risks in terms of stretching what the party says — and who they say it to — if they want to win. That doesn't mean abandoning core principles. It does mean, however, making sure that when moments like Ferguson happen, the GOP has a credible voice both diagnosing the problems and offering solutions. And that's exactly what Paul is doing.",92,NA,NA,NA

It didn't take long for him to face a backlash on social media, with {repeated calls}<hyperlink=""http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2014/08/14/jay-nixon-ferguson-race-police-shooting/""> for the governor to step in. It's easy in the short term to assume that this slip will cause lasting damage to Nixon's career. But he's faced heavier opposition in the past and rebounded -- including on racially divisive issues.
The first time then-state Sen. Jay Nixon (D) ran for statewide office in Missouri, he got demolished, losing by more than 30 percentage points to incumbent Sen. John Danforth (R) in 1988. Four years later he ran -- and won -- a bid to be Missouri's Attorney General.
A year later, Nixon {filed a motion}<hyperlink=""https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&dat=19931122&id=prQfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ENcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2316,3334613&hl=en""> in district court seeking to end St. Louis' school desegregation program. At that point, black students from the city were being bused to white districts elsewhere in St. Louis County, part of a 12-year-old effort to decrease the racial homogenization of the state's education system. Nixon argued that the expense of the program wasn't worth it. (The program was revised in the late 1990s.)

Nixon's position infuriated the local NAACP, anger that was resurrected shortly before he decided to again seek a Senate seat again in 1998. While he was speaking at a Democratic dinner that June in St. Louis, 15 protestors marched outside the hotel, as {CQ reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/06/16/cq/missouri.html""> at the time. Among the signs they carried were ones reading ""Deseg Yes, Segregation No,"" and ""WHATEVER HAPPENED TO INTEGRITY?"" One leader said flatly, ""As of now, I'm going to vote for the Republican."" Another {compared him}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/13/us/political-briefing-black-voters-exiting-this-campaign-bus.html""> to Alabama's George Wallace. For the second time, Nixon lost.

Nixon won election as governor in 2008, and reelection to the position -- by a wide margin -- in 2012. He's occasionally popped up on the national radar since, but, as the Post {noted last year}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/09/19/missouri-gov-jay-nixon-steps-forward-but-toward-what/"">, has stayed largely focused on Missouri.
That changed this week, with the racially charged unrest in Ferguson, which brought him into the spotlight with as much elegance as a prisoner spotted trying to escape. But after his stumbling start, Nixon has been very active, {telling an audience}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/nixon-you-all-will-see-a-different-tone-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl""> on Thursday that they would ""see a different tone"" in the city moving forward.

Later in the day, Nixon held a press conference in which he announced his planned course of action. ""What's gone on in the last few days is not what Missouri is about,"" he said. ""It's not what Ferguson is about. This is a place where people work, go to school, raise their families and go to church. ... Lately it's looked like a war zone and it's unacceptable."" He announced that the state police would be taking charge of maintaining safety in Ferguson and pledged to work with the community. When asked why the police had been so heavy-handed, he demurred, offering a telling response: ""I'm not looking backward. I'm looking forward.""

A recovery would not be a surprise, given his political adeptness. Part of the reason that the Post spoke with Nixon last year is that it seemed possible, if unlikely, that he might throw his hat into the ring in 2016. {At the time}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/09/19/missouri-gov-jay-nixon-steps-forward-but-toward-what/"">, he'd had a string of wins, including pushing back against {a Republican tax cut proposal}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/us/in-missouri-governor-turns-tax-cut-debate-against-gop.html?pagewanted=all&_r=3&""> that, Nixon argued, would gut the state's social services.

Since that interview, Nixon has been at the perimeter of two volatile issues. Earlier this month, he {vetoed}<hyperlink=""http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article663238.html""> a tough restriction on abortions, after having previously {allowed other restrictions}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/jay-nixon-allows-new-abortion-restrictions-to-become-law/article_1f822a61-f5d6-5018-98aa-6db84805ae8d.html""> to go into effect. The differentiation on this bill, the governor argued, was the lack of exemptions in cases of incest and rape.

Nixon has also presided over {a number of executions in the state}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/06/missouri-carries-out-its-7th-execution-this-year-tying-texas-and-florida-for-the-most-in-2014/?tid=a_inl"">, including the seventh of the year just last week. When he was attorney general, Nixon was a strong proponent of the death penalty, saying, at one point, that appeals were {""total hokum.""}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/jay-nixon-s-decision-on-death-penalty-case-out-of/article_78b06360-1d62-5f72-927b-01661d99e111.html""> As governor, he's been more measured, including a {surprise commutation}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/jay-nixon-commutes-richard-clay-s-death-sentence-to-life/article_fe0b5e30-b753-57e3-9f46-27e8dbe75085.html""> of a convict's sentence in 2011.
Those measured shifts are another reason that it seemed very possible Nixon might be looking for other, higher career opportunities. So far, though, his in-state colleagues don't appear to be in any rush to support him.

Holder also announced that Missouri officials had on Thursday accepted an offer of “technical assistance” from the Justice Department aimed at helping these local authorities improve their response to the crowds in suburban St. Louis.

“At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,” Holder said.

The announcement came as state and national figures seemed to finally mobilize in response to the situation in Ferguson, which has been the site of repeated confrontations between protesters and heavily armed police since an officer {fatally shot teenager Michael Brown on Saturday}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-of-an-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri/?tid=a_inl"">. Gov.

It is unclear precisely what these changes could entail, but Holder’s statement suggests that federal forces could be part of the shifting police presence in Ferguson. Residents in the city have criticized the heavy-handed police response, while also complaining that other state officials had not come in to take over in recent days. The situation in Ferguson has been fraught since Brown’s death, with {looting Sunday night}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/dozens-arrested-following-missouri-violence/?tid=a_inl""> and police deploying {tear gas and rubber bullets}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/police-use-tear-gas-on-crowd/?tid=a_inl""> the following nights.

Holder also discussed the importance of increasing “diversity in law enforcement,” which has become a part of the discussion in the wake of the shooting. Two-thirds of Ferguson’s residents are black, but just three of its 53 police officers are black, and this dissonance between the residents and those sworn to protect them is seen as {playing into the tension that has been building in the city}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl"">.

In  addition, he said that “journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told,” seemingly a reference to {the arrest of two reporters}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/news-organizations-speak-out-against-arrest-of-reporters-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl""> (including The Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery) on Wednesday night.

But should they share them?,Caitlin Dewey,08/14/2014,03/02/2016,"David, a.k.a. Pharaoh, doesn’t hold a political office or opine for CNN. But this week, the 14-year-old hacker mounted what might have been one of the more {personally damaging attacks}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/13/amid-ferguson-protests-anonymous-hacktivists-wage-cyberwar/?tid=a_inl""> against Ferguson, Mo.’s embattled police department: the name — and the address, and the Social Security number — of St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar.
That’s not all. Pharaoh, a self-proclaimed member of the loosely affiliated hacker collective Anonymous, has also obtained the name and Social Security number of a Ferguson police officer he believes was involved in 18-year-old Michael Brown’s fatal shooting last weekend. The Ferguson Police Department {has said that name is not correct}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/despite-reports-name-of-officer-in-michael-brown-shooting-still-unknown/?tid=a_inl""> — though that doesn’t faze Pharaoh.

“The Ferguson PD actually tweeted at us saying that this is not the officer responsible for the murder,” Pharaoh said in a lengthy chat via IRC, Anonymous’s preferred communication platform. “But they could be lying.”
And if they’re not?

“There would be no collateral damage if the government would be answerable to its citizens,” another Anonymous member said.

This is the central paradox at the heart of “doxing,” a form of {vigilante Internet justice}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/05/19/dox-the-powerful-on-darth-and-the-complex-politics-of-anonymity-online/?tid=a_inl""> that has surfaced in almost every national debate, scandal and tragedy of the past three years. The practice — deployed, in its purest and most high-profile form, by Anonymous — involves exposing the personal information of targeted individuals, often so that the public can harass them. Anonymous claims it is forcing transparency and putting power back in the hands of ordinary people. Police, and other critics, point out that doxing often amounts to little more than a mob-style witch hunt … and that Anonymous, not infrequently, gets its targets wrong.

Just this morning, the Twitter account {@TheAnonMessage}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TheAnonMessage""> — one of Anonymous’s more popular mouthpieces, with more than 75,000 followers — tweeted the name of a “guilty” Ferguson police officer who, it later turned out, actually works in another town entirely. Twitter quickly suspended the account, but a replacement, {@TheAnonMessage2}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TheAnonMessage2""> , sprang up in its place.

“The powers that be will stop at nothing to silence us,” that account tweeted, later adding: “I’m not the only one with the dox … who’s to say someone else will release them?”

That idea — that everyone is potentially responsible, and thus nobody is — is central to Anonymous’s core ethical code, such as it exists. In psychology, this phenomenon falls in the same realm as the bystander effect: When responsibility is diffused among a network of people, no one individual feels accountable if/when something goes wrong.

For Anonymous, where even minor undertakings are crowdsourced among groups of faceless hackers, that’s particularly true: One faction gets the alleged officer’s name, another cross-references his identity against databases like Thomson Reuters’s Clear, and another undertakes the actual doxing. From there, more shadowy characters, none of them named — even, in most cases, among themselves — will publicize the information, max out the officer’s credit card or order 100 pizzas to his house. (That little stunt is called {pizza-bombing}<hyperlink=""https://encyclopediadramatica.es/Pizza_Bomb"">, and it’s a lot less fun than it sounds.)

To Pharaoh, this is a morally justifiable process; he says he “trusts the other guys,” even if he doesn’t know them well. But what if, I ask him, he publishes the Social Security number of an innocent man, and it totally wrecks that guy’s life?

“You must remember that I was not directly involved with the people who found him or blamed him,” Pharaoh said. “I’m just his ‘doxer,’ I guess.” On Twitter, Pharaoh was little more strident:
.{@ExquisiteBeast_}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ExquisiteBeast_""> {@TheAnonMessage}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TheAnonMessage""> {@Coding_Language}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/Coding_Language""> you know what doesn’t seem right? Letting an officer murder someone without consequence.
Pharaoh is also not alone in believing that there’s a higher purpose in his work; that innocent people, doxed undeservedly, are essentially “collateral damage” in Anonymous’s larger war against government overreach. After all, there’s no doubt that power in Ferguson lies, unreservedly, with the police — to the detriment of free speech, free assembly and, some have argued, justice. Hacking is an opportunity, Anonymous argues, to seize justice back for the people. But even given that context, it doesn’t mean that doxing is morally all right.
""When doxing knowingly exposes others to a significant risk of dangerous vigilante action, it is unethical, for reasons that should be plain,” said Shannon Vallor, an associate professor of philosophy at Silicon Valley’s Santa Clara University. “But in cases such as Ferguson and Steubenville [the site of a controversial rape case], the unethical act arises partly from the perception that there are powerful thumbs on the scales of justice. You can try to stop it from happening by technical or legal means, but the most effective prevention is probably to keep your thumb off the scale.”

Until things in Ferguson are that simple, Pharaoh is sitting on some very valuable information.",29,NA,NA,Link re: pizza-bombing may be corrupt?

Protests have continued for several days since an officer shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson on Saturday. Dozens of people have been arrested, including Washington Post reporter {Wesley Lowery}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl"">. And reports from Ferguson suggest that some local authorities might be falling short of their obligations to respect the rights of citizens and to comply with judicial interpretation of the First and Fourth Amendments. Below are a few areas in which local authorities could be violating people's rights.

1. The mayor asked protesters to be respectful and to go home at night.

Ferguson's mayor and the city council issued a letter Wednesday asking protesters to restrain their activities. ""We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner,"" the letter read. Thomas Jackson, the police chief, explained to {the New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teenager-and-officer-scuffled-before-shooting-chief-says.html""> that the request was not a curfew, but last night police seemed {intent on enforcing it}<hyperlink=""http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/saw-ferguson""> as such anyway.

It is unclear whether the city government had the authority to issue its letter, given that the First Amendment protects ""{the right of the people peaceably to assemble}<hyperlink=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment"">.""
This same issue arose during the World Trade Organization's meeting in Seattle in 1999, when the city prohibited anyone from entering a 25-block area downtown, except for those participating in the meeting. Protesters were enraged and sued the city. The Ninth Circuit Court {ruled}<hyperlink=""http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1137149.html""> that Order No. 3, as the city of Seattle's ban was known, was constitutional. The court held that the city had broad authority to prevent violence and maintain public order, though the ruling noted with a few caveats. For one, the court said that city police had overstepped their bounds in apparently focusing on protesters who were opposed to the WTO and ignoring those who supported it.

In Ferguson, while there was certainly some looting and vandalism over the weekend, it is not clear there is still any danger to public safety or whether the peaceful protests are obstructing officers who are trying to apprehend vandals, as the Ninth Circuit determined had occurred in Seattle.
In  any case, there does not appear to be any justification for asking protesters to be ""organized and respectful,"" said Lee Rowland, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. ""I think there are many people in Ferguson who are feeling that the police are not especially deserving of respect right now, and the First Amendment does not mandate that,"" she said.

2. Police have asked citizens not to record their activities.

Lowery wrote that before he was taken away, an officer told him to stop recording video. Other protesters have also said that they've been told to put away their phones. As The Post's {Andrea Peterson}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/08/14/yes-you-can-record-the-police-and-maybe-the-police-should-be-recording-the-police/""> has explained, the courts have consistently recognized that citizens have {a right to document}<hyperlink=""http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/files/alvarez-ruling.pdf""> police activity. Police also need a warrant to confiscate or search citizens' cameras {or phones}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/us/supreme-court-cellphones-search-privacy.html"">.

3. Police are deploying tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.

The police have to use force from time to time to apprehend criminals and keep the public safe. That's why they're there. That doesn't mean all forms of police violence are always justified.

The Supreme Court defined the judicial standard for police violence in the 1989 {case}<hyperlink=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4306215806680760770""> of a diabetic man who, desperate for sugar, had gone into a convenience store for a bottle of orange juice. He saw the store was crowded and decided to go elsewhere, but a police officer saw him leave hurriedly, became suspicious and stopped the man's car. By this point, the man was apparently delirious. He got out of the car and ran around in circles before passing out on the ground. The officer called for reinforcements, who treated the man roughly while denying his requests for sugar. ""I've seen a lot of people with sugar diabetes that never acted like this,"" said one officer, according to the court. ""Ain't nothing wrong with the m-----f----- but drunk. Lock the son of a b---- up.""

The court ruled that the police officers' use of force in the case was ""objectively unreasonable"" and unconstitutional. In the 25 years since, lower courts have interpreted this admittedly imprecise standard of reasonableness in various ways.

The situation in Ferguson in the past few days has at times been chaotic and violent, but, by all accounts, the demonstrations have generally been peaceful. It is difficult to say whether a court would agree that it is reasonable to shoot tear gas canisters or rubber bullets at protesters who pose no obvious threat to public safety.
4. Area law enforcement consistently arrest and search black people more frequently than whites.
 
In {a report last year}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl"">, Missouri's attorney general concluded that Ferguson police were twice as likely to arrest blacks as whites during traffic stops. Jeffrey Mittman, director of the ACLU's Missouri chapter, said the pattern is indisputable.

""The numbers are consistently shocking, disheartening, and show a racial disparity,"" he said. ""If you are African American, you are more likely to be stopped, you are more likely to be searched, you are more likely to be arrested, and you are actually less likely to have contraband on you than if you are white.""

The state conference of the NAACP has also filed a complaint against St. Louis County police on the same grounds. The county police department has been tasked with investigating Brown's death, and one of Missouri's congressmen, Rep. Lacey Clay, has {written a letter}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/michael-brown-wheels-justice-may-turn-slowly""> suggesting county police cannot be trusted to do so impartially. A pattern of discrimination on the part of law enforcement would be a violation of federal law, Clay wrote.",0,NA,NA,NA

She was among those arrested {during protests this week}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/fourth-night-of-protests-in-ferguson-ends-in-chaos-tear-gas-arrests/?tid=a_inl""> after the Saturday shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a Ferguson police officer.

This, she said, is what she remembers most clearly about Wednesday night: “When the tanks had rolled in, they were all in the street. And immediately, the whole crowd dropped to their knees and put their arms up.

“So what I see, when I see this night, is a line of essentially soldiers and a line of civilians, I would call them, on their knees, with their hands up.”

Flannery is a former teacher who works at {an education nonprofit}<hyperlink=""http://www.northcampus.org/staff-bios/""> with Antonio French, {a St. Louis alderman}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/who-is-antonio-french-the-alderman-providing-updates-from-ferguson/?tid=a_inl"">, who also was arrested Wednesday.

Flannery was charged with a noise violation and with failing to follow a direct police order. She was released on $300 bail.

“The first thing going through my mind was that I was angry that it had come to that. Because we had done nothing wrong,” she said. “I still believe we had done nothing wrong, and I don’t think the charges are going to stick. And so I was more just angry that the whole situation was happening. Kind of couldn’t believe that it was happening.”

Michael Brown, 18, was {fatally shot}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-will-investigate-death-of-black-teenager-in-missouri/2014/08/11/991b3dce-2165-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html?tid=a_inl""> in an apparent confrontation with police.

In the days since, protesters have gathered in Ferguson, the site of the shooting. The name of the officer involved has not been released.

“I want people to keep their eyes on it,” Flannery said. “I want people to know what’s happening in St. Louis. I want people to form their own opinions based on the facts. But, most of all, I want people to know that what we’re fighting for is justice for Michael Brown, and that’s the bottom line. Nothing else aside from that. Just justice.”
Michael Powers — legislative director to Lewis Reed, president of the Board of Aldermen — also was among those arrested Wednesday night. He described a restless night in jail, where people were jogging in place to stay warm.

“Everybody was freezing,” Powers said. “People were using toilet paper and wrapping their arms with it.”

When he was released, Powers said, an officer insinuated that the facility’s air conditioning could be used as a “tactic to punish.”

“Having the world see St. Louis in this light, in this militarized way, is just sad for all of us, I think,” Powers said. “Because this is not who we are. We are not this divided. We are not this scared.”",3,NA,NA,Link re: education non-profit not working

It’s a pictorial statement in the wake of the fatal police shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., on Saturday. The students who organized the photo shoot, during an orientation meeting Wednesday night with move-in-day volunteers, said they saw the pictures of the riots , looting and violence that ensued. But they wanted to show something else.

“If you take anything from that image, it’s that even our innocence is lethal,” said Khalil Saadiq, a 19-year-old sophomore who asked fellow students to {pose with their hands raised}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/howarduniversity/posts/10151995916617185"">.
""It’s the epitome of ‘I’m innocent,’ ” added Ikenna “Ike” Ikeotuonye, a 20-year-old senior and vice president of the university’s student government association.

Ikeotuonye took the picture, which had more than 9,000 retweets by Thursday afternoon.

""I think the biggest thing for me was seeing everyone’s face in the crowd,” he said. “The crowd fell silent. Everyone was talking and laughing before . . . and you could see the somber attitude that waved over the crowd.”

A university spokeswoman said a {former student}<hyperlink=""https://www.instagram.com/spookwrites/"">, Mya White who graduated in 2012, was shot while demonstrating in Ferguson after Brown’s death. So the fatal shooting of Brown, though far away, really hit close to home.

“It makes me feel less than. Less than our racial counterparts,” Ikeotuonye said of the shooting. “It happens in other races — it’s not just a black thing . . . [but] these things don’t happen as often as they do in the black community.”

Speaking from Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., where he is on vacation, Obama called for national unity and healing following the police shooting Saturday of Michael Brown, 18, in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. Obama said many Americans “have been deeply disturbed” by images of clashes between police and protesters, and he called for a thorough investigation “to see that justice is done.’’
Soon after, his attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., issued a statement saying he was “deeply concerned” about “the deployment of military equipment and vehicles” to combat protesters in Ferguson. He said that a federal civil rights probe of the incident is escalating, with investigators having already interviewed eyewitnesses on the scene, and that Missouri officials have accepted federal assistance “to conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.’’

Obama’s remarks, his most comprehensive on the shooting to date, were the latest and most visible step in a rapid coalescence among political and community leaders to tamp down the violence and find ways to prevent it while multiple investigations of the tragedy move forward.

In a sudden burst of interest fueled by images of {heavily armed police}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/14/the-pentagon-gave-nearly-half-a-billion-dollars-of-military-gear-to-local-law-enforcement-last-year/""> that swirled on social media, politicians from both sides of the aisle rushed on Thursday — five days after the shooting — to condemn the tactics of the nearly all-white police force in the predominantly African American town.

The reactions were remarkably similar from political opposites across the spectrum. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), for example, called for authorities to “de-militarize this situation,’’ while Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), a likely Republican presidential candidate, condemned “the militarization of our law enforcement’’ in a Time magazine essay.
The increased concern also extended to state officials, with {Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D)}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/nixon-you-all-will-see-a-different-tone-in-ferguson/?hpid=z1&tid=a_inl""> announcing that the state highway patrol would supervise security operations

Local forces will still be working on the ground, Nixon said, but the highway patrol “will be the lead agency.”

“I think you all will see a different tone,’’ Nixon said during an appearance at a chuch in Florissant.

Obama addressed the issue after a fourth night of clashes between police and residents in Ferguson. The {fatal shooting}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-of-an-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri/?tid=a_inl""> by police of Brown there has evolved into a national debate over justice in African American communities.

“There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,” Obama said, before adding:“There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. And here in the United States of America, police should not be arresting or bullying journalists who are just trying to do their jobs.”
According to a {friend who says he witnessed the incident}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html"">, Brown was walking down a Ferguson street when a police officer in a car ordered him to get on the sidewalk. Brown had his hands in the air to show he was unarmed when the officer shot him multiple times, the friend said. The police version is that Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to grab his gun.

Obama attended a birthday party in Martha’s Vineyard for a friend Wednesday during the latest unrest. Police {fired tear gas at protesters,}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/national/ferguson-protesters-run-from-tear-gas/2014/08/14/df2ff215-c7da-42ff-860c-d94c6caf92fa_video.html?hpid=z2&tid=a_inl""> and two reporters, including one from The Washington Post, were {arrested while covering the events.}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl"">
In concluding his remarks about Ferguson on Thursday, Obama said that while “emotions are raw right now” in the suburb and accounts of the tragedy differ, “let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family.”
""Now is the time for healing,” Obama said. “Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done. And I’ve asked the attorney general and the U.S. attorney on the scene to continue to work with local officials to move that process forward.”

Obama did not take questions from reporters after his remarks.
The Justice Department’s civil rights division, along with the U.S. attorney’s office in St. Louis and the local FBI field office, are investigating the shooting in a parallel probe to the state investigation. Holder, who met with Obama on Thursday to discuss the case, said: “Our review will take time to conduct, but it will be thorough and fair.”

The Ferguson police department {bears little demographic resemblance}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2&tid=a_inl""> to the mostly African American community, where residents harbored suspicions of law enforcement long before the shooting.

In a {one-paragraph written statement}<hyperlink=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/12/president-obama-issues-statement-death-michael-brown""> Tuesday, Obama called Brown’s death “heartbreaking.” He urged Ferguson and communities across the country to “remember this young man through reflection and understanding,” adding, “We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.”

Before Obama spoke Thursday, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said in an interview on CNN that the arrest of the two reporters Wednesday night “appeared regrettable.” He added, “We will make sure that reporters are treated in a proper fashion.”

Knowles also said that the release of names of police officers by the group Anonymous has jeopardized their safety. “None of those officers have anything to do with what went on,” he said. “Anybody now who’s named is absolutely in danger.”

In a midday news conference, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson sought to explain the arrest of peaceful protesters, saying that police could not distinguish them when moving against crowds involved in violence or vandalism.

“It’s a crowd,” Jackson said. “If the crowd is getting violent, and you don’t want to be violent, get out of the crowd.”
He said that “journalists are not a target” for the police and that he did not know why the two reporters were arrested Wednesday night.

Asked if he was concerned about the “militaristic” image that the local police have presented, Jackson said: “The whole picture is being painted a little bit sideways from what’s really happening. It’s not military. It’s tactical operations. It’s SWAT teams. That’s who’s out there: police. We’re doing this in blue.”

The police killing of Michael Brown potentially offers another area of left-right agreement, as it has focused national attention on the over-militarization of our police forces, particularly in the wake of days of {standoffs between protestors and heavily armed police}<hyperlink=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2014/08/ferguson_police_attack_protestors_with_tear_gas_rubber_bullets_on_site_reporting.html"">.
Today Rand Paul weighed in {with a striking op ed piece on the Brown shooting}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> called: “We must demilitarize the police.” In it, Senator Paul linked the “militarization of law enforcement” directly to race:

Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them….Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.

In an interview this afternoon, Dem Rep. John Conyers Jr. — the dean of the Congressional Black Caucus and longtime civil rights figure — told me he found Senator Paul’s quotes “heartening.”

“I never thought of him in that light before,” Conyers said of Paul. “It certainly is heartening. I’m encouraged by that kind of observation.”

With the Department of Justice investigating the Brown shooting, Conyers and the Congressional Black Caucus sent Attorney General Eric Holder a {letter}<hyperlink=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/236821491/CBC-letter-on-DOJ-inquiry-Into-Michael-Brown-death""> asking him to broaden the scope of federal involvement to include an investigation of the “legal and civil rights ramifications” of the shooting, as well as “the potential for any pattern or practice of police misconduct by the Ferguson Police Department.” The letter cited “evidence of racial profiling by the department” to bolster the case for a broader federal probe.

Conyers, who is also the ranking Dem on the House Judiciary Committee, suggested Paul’s acknowledgment of the racial dimension of police militarization was exactly the sort of expression of support from libertarian conservatives that civil rights liberals should welcome.

“We hope for it — and every now and then it happens,” Conyers told me, adding that he would reach out to Paul to gauge his support for a broader federal look at the shooting. “I could see something like that happening,” he said.
In {his op ed piece}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/"">, Paul talked about how “big government” is to blame for the militarization of police, a broad-brush statement that many liberals would reject. But his discussion of Washington’s role in incentivizing the militarization of police departments in the name of the war on drugs or terrorism is an area for overlap with the left. Indeed, a {massive ACLU report}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf"">  recently documented “the excessive militarization of American policing” with an emphasis on “federal incentives” and the toll of the war on drugs.

Laura Murphy, the director of the ACLU’s Washington legislative office, also says she sees potential in Paul’s response to the Johnson shooting. “We’ve been working towards a left-right alliance on militarization that also acknowledges the racial dimension,” she said. With the shooting focusing the nation’s attention, she added, “there is a stronger chance that a left right alliance will develop in Congress to bring attention to these issues.”

Murphy suggested Paul could help the cause further. “We would welcome Senator Paul’s support for a deeper investigation by the Justice Department into the causes of racial profiling and ways to thwart it,” she said.

Beyond any probe of the Brown shooting, it’s not impossible that with discussion increasingly focused on sentencing reform, the war on drugs, and police militarization in general, criminal justice issues could gain traction more broadly. {Ezra Klein}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002175/its-not-just-ferguson-americas-criminal-justice-system-is-racist"">:

Jay Nixon (D) announced on Thursday afternoon that the Missouri Highway Patrol would be taking over security operations in Ferguson, a town that has witnessed a series of tense standoffs between residents and heavily-armored police officers.

Nixon said that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would assume control of the law enforcement response to the protests in Ferguson.

Local officers from Ferguson and the county police would remain involved, as they have been all week, but the state highway patrol would direct security on the ground.

“We are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we’re in this together,” Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, said during a news conference with Nixon.

Johnson, who grew up in the region, promised a different approach with the highway patrol in charge. He vowed that he would be on the ground himself on Thursday night and said he planned to visit the QuikTrip that has become ground zero for the protesters.

“I understand the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling, and our officers will respect both of those,” said Johnson, who has been the head of the highway patrol’s troop in the region since 2002.

The highway patrol, along with police from the city of St. Louis, had been called in by the St. Louis County police on Sunday when looting broke out in Ferguson and neighboring cities.

News that the patrol would take over the security response from local police came as criticism has mounted over the heavy police response to protests in Ferguson. The city has been fraught with tension since a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown on Saturday, and daytime protests have given way to nighttime confrontations that saw police launch tear gas and fire rubber bullets.

After five tense nights, the state’s top elected official stepped in, {promising residents “a different tone”}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/nixon-you-all-will-see-a-different-tone-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl""> in his first visit to the area since Brown was killed.

What amazes me is the sheer number of people sitting at desks miles away who gazed into the news from Ferguson and saw there only confirmation of their previous biases.

Every time there is a story like this it reminds me of the tale of the blind men groping at an elephant. The elephant, one reported, was exactly like a tree (he had gotten hold of the leg). The elephant, another said, was exactly like a fan. (He had the ear.) The elephant, another said, was like a snake (he’d gotten the trunk). You can grab the same thing and come away with a completely and radically different idea of it — not even because you went in with any bias, just because the picture you saw was incomplete and you framed it for yourself as best you could.

This story is not about the press or about the Thing You Want It To Be About. This story is about the people of Ferguson.

But it is, a little bit at least, about the difference between looking at and seeing.

The situation in the aftermath of the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson has been gaining attention. This is the kind of story that doesn’t always make the national news. The fact that it’s something we’re hearing about is because people are making a point to pay attention and keep it trending.

This is the power of social media. This could have not been a story. Or it could have just been a local story. Or it could have been something that we saw only from a distance, through the usual filters. Instead, it gathered steam. Read this. Follow this. Look at this. No one’s been telling you this story. Listen. There have been clear efforts by the police force in Ferguson to keep the media out. But they haven’t succeeded.  That this has become a national story both because and in spite of the efforts to shut down the media have reinforced what an important story it is to tell.
But there are many ways of diverting attention from it. And one is to make it about only what you want to look at.

The images coming out of Ferguson have been breathtaking. Tear gas. Police in riot gear. Police wielding military equipment. Protesters with their hands up. Police arresting members of the media. {Angry protesters}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000003055806/standoff-with-police-in-ferguson.html?smid=tw-share"">.
But a picture can hide as much as it reveals. Look on Twitter and you’ll hear conflicting opinions about who’s throwing what in this image? Is this a molotov cocktail?

Is this a {picture}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/Lestat01265/status/499973575151865857""> of Michael Brown that “they” didn’t want us to see? (No. It is not. It is {someone else entirely}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/09/jodah-cain-micus-ward-murder-jacqueline-bell_n_4069914.html"">.)
As the hashtag “IfTheyGunnedMeDown” illustrated, the selection of image says a lot. Are you judged by your mistakes or by your triumphs? Who curates how you’re seen? What is the story that the picture tells? And what is the story that people read in the picture?

A picture can settle neatly into your understanding of how things were. It’s a magic-eye picture. Do you focus on these images or these? What emerges from the clouds of smoke? Is the story here that this is “Fergustan”? Is the point of the picture that this looks like Somewhere Else? Is this about Gun Control? Is this {Selma 1965}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jbouie/status/499970363292672001"">?
This story is not about the media, clearly. This isn’t about the reporters (including one for The Post) who got arrested or detained. It’s about the people of Ferguson. But it does illustrate why we need the media: to tell the story that does matter. These have not been the kindest years to our trust in the national media. But still, when people are trying to take reporters into custody when they are just doing their job, we know it’s a sign that something is wrong. When police are shutting down cameras, it is a sign that they know the truth is not going to be kind to them. As another night of protests approaches, it matters that this is a national story. It matters that the media are there to go in and capture as much of the truth as possible. It is possible to assemble a narrative for yourself, brokenly, on social media, only seeing what you want to look at, coming at it with your biases loaded, amplifying what you agree with, muffling what unsettles your viewpoint. That the Ferguson police are terrified of a media presence is a reminder of how much that presence can matter and help tell an important story, as honestly as possible, looking at everything. We fall short often. We can only do so much. But it’s worth striving.

Here’s what he thought about the violence in Ferguson, Mo., where police unleashed tear gas Wednesday night on a largely peaceful crowd protesting the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown. This interview has been edited for clarity.
The ratio of citizen demographics to police department demographics is always something being looked at. There’s greater diversity in urban areas than suburban or rural areas. We find that demographics are better in bigger cities, but only 500 cities have more than 50,000 people. That leaves us with a national police presence that is {overwhelmingly white}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/police-staffing/?tid=a_inl"">.
The association that works on accreditation for police departments, {CALEA}<hyperlink=""http://www.calea.org/"">, has 480 standards. One of them is that the police department should demographically reflect the community. And if it doesn’t, you have to show that you’re trying to recruit to balance your demographics. There are currently about 1 million cops. In 1987, we saw that one in six officers was non-white. Now we’re seeing one in four. It’s getting better, but very often the police departments look like this because of recruitment issues.

The riots in the 1960s were a different time in the country and a different time in law enforcement. In the ’30s and ’40s, police officers walked beats, and they were really more a part of the community. In the professional era, starting in the ’60s, police rolled up their windows, and they weren’t part of the community. In the ’70s and ’80s, we were moving back toward the community policing era, and problem-solving. It’s extremely important that police departments be integral and positive parts of their communities. You can’t just enforce the laws and walk away.

When we make a procedural change that is going to begin to improve policing, it has to diffuse through 18,000 departments. It takes a long time in the United States because of that home rule concept. The {Home Office}<hyperlink=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office""> in the UK really oversees all policing — there’s a national police academy. We have them in every state.

It’s not that [departments like Ferguson’s] are holdouts. I think everyone in theory wants to do community policing, but they don’t have the resources, wherewithal or knowledge.

A lot say they’re doing it, and they legitimately think they are, but there’s so many interpretations of it and no efficient method to get out training. The Department of Justice has its {Community Oriented Policing Services}<hyperlink=""http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/""> unit, but where do I get the money to send people to these schools? Where do I get the expertise?

POLICE ARE NOT SOLDIERS, AND THEY SHOULDN’T STRIVE TO BE. SOLDIERS HAVE ENEMIES, AND POLICE DO NOT. POLICE HAVE COMMUNITIES.

Police depend on legitimacy for the efficiency of doing their job. You can arrest someone, but if you do it in a procedurally just way, it increases the legitimacy of the police in the eyes of the community. Robert Peel’s {Nine Principles of Policing}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_principles""> from 1829 — ‘the police are the people and the people are the police’ — are just as germane today.

The NYPD has 36,000 officers. They’re in a position to learn. They have training and resources and funding; they’re in the public eye every day. After the {WTO demonstrations in Seattle}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests"">, it was a learning curve. What they found was that they can’t force people to do what people don’t want to do. Crowd control became subsumed in a community policing model. The {police officer spraying pepper spray}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Davis_pepper-spray_incident""> — that’s exactly what you don’t want to do. Vancouver BC, around the Olympics, {used all these soft techniques}<hyperlink=""http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&article_id=2198&issue_id=92010""> — they didn’t have any trouble. And when they did start to have trouble, it was mitigated, because they didn’t use outright force.

With {military equipment}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/14/military-veterans-see-deeply-flawed-police-response-in-ferguson/?hpid=z1&tid=a_inl"">, we saw a decided militarization of police in the United States. Having done the job for 34 years, I want to say this without any equivocation: Police are not soldiers, and they shouldn’t strive to be. Soldiers have enemies, and police do not. Police have communities. With about a million cops in the United States, there’s a culture of policing. Very often, what we see is the tail wagging the dog. What they see is, they pick up a police magazine, and you see all these cats in black with shoulder weapons and everything, and cops think, “Well, that’s what we’re supposed to do!” We don’t have a mechanism to say, “Hell no! That’s not what you’re supposed to be doing!”
When I was police chief, we had three goals: prevent crime, prevent fear of crime, increase the quality of life in the community. That exemplified my belief in policing. It had nothing to do with the military. The chief I took over from told me: “You’re going to have all these people going out 24/7, and they’re going to be carrying guns. And you’re going to be worried all the time that something’s going to be going wrong.” The fact that we don’t have more of them is really a testament to the fact that policing is really not going in a bad direction. We do {national surveys on a federal level}<hyperlink=""http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdc&dcid=251&iid=1"">; they ask people what happened — “Did you feel that it was fair?” — and it’s getting better all the time. The overwhelming majority of people think that police do their job well and fairly.

And, unfortunately, it’s the kind of job where a police officer makes a mistake; it’s serious. Cops are the most visible form of American government. When they do make mistakes, it’s something that needs to be corrected because they’re the part of the government that uses force.
There’s no cogent connection between the research that’s being done and the people on the ground. I {studied four cities}<hyperlink=""http://www.cap-press.com/books/isbn/9781611635904/Police-Leaders-in-the-New-Community-Problem-Solving-Era""> — we found out what works best, how to enter into community engagement. It’s going to be one of those books we’re going to use as textbooks, but police chiefs won’t have access. I wrote an article in a journal, Police Quarterly, and like eight other academics are going to read it. It’s important; it’s about eyewitness identification. Cops don’t read that journal. They don’t even have access to it.

How do we give departments with 10 to 100 officers that information? We don’t have the money! We spend $123 for every man, woman and child on policing. That’s a lot of money. You know what it all goes for? It goes for running the police department, reacting to crime. Very little goes to accreditation, and training and research partnerships.",0,NA,NA,NA

Before he stood in the crowd with his hands in the air, before the photo of him doing that went viral, before he heard about the 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a police officer, Khalil Saadiq was a senior in high school ready for his moment.

He had come from Birmingham, Ala. to explore a historically black college in D.C.  At his high school, all his peers seemed to talk about was when the next party was, or when the next shoe was being released. As he walked through the campus of {Howard University}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/howard-u-students-take-stand-in-ferguson-shooting-pose-for-picture-that-goes-viral/2014/08/14/8ccf5c0e-23cb-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?hpid=z3&tid=a_inl"">  that March, the chatter he heard was about the death of Trayvon Martin and the upcoming trial. The students around him weren’t just talking about what had happened — they were trying to decide what they could do about it.

That’s exactly what Saadiq was doing a year and a half later, while getting his dorm room ready this week for his sophomore year at Howard.

“If you’re not a part of the discussion of how to contribute to progress, then you’re part of the problem,” he had learned.

It was Wednesday, and by now, everyone understood that the problem in the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael Brown wasn’t just a Missouri problem. It was the same problem that Saadiq felt he’d been dealing with for 19 years.

As he organized his clothes, he thought of his parents: a cosmetologist and an Army reservist who made it possible for him to be majoring in economics at Howard.

He thought about his friend who also lived in Ferguson, and how scared she had sounded when she told him about that night.

He thought about the times he had been followed around by store clerks at the mall, and the way it seemed they assumed he would steal.

And then, the idea. That night, roughly 300 students would gather at {Howard}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/howard-u-students-take-stand-in-ferguson-shooting-pose-for-picture-that-goes-viral/2014/08/14/8ccf5c0e-23cb-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?tid=a_inl""> for a meeting about helping with freshman move-in. Three hundred students, black students, who could make a statement.

Saadiq called a friend. They called a few more friends. They got approval from the meeting’s coordinator.

And by Wednesday evening, Saadiq was on stage at the Cramton Auditorium, holding a microphone and saying, “I am guilty until proven innocent every single day.”

He wore khaki slacks and a plaid Tommy Hilfiger button-up. Like those students deciding what to do about Trayvon Martin, this is what Saadiq would do about Michael Brown.

The students would put their hands in the air, just as the police instruct — the same way, he said, that Brown had been standing when he was shot.

“To show that even our innocence is threatening,” Saadiq told the crowd.

He set down the microphone, climbed off the stage, and stood in the center of the group. No one had to participate, but it seemed to him that everyone did. By the time they would be moving in the freshmen the next day, the photo would be re-tweeted more than 10,000 times.

They raised their hands. He stared into the camera that a fellow classmate was holding.

And after Wednesday night’s chaos, we know why McCaskill’s hug is so powerful.

Watching the surreal scene of a local police force tricked out in militarized riot gear going after mostly peaceful protesters with tear gas and assault weapons, I took to Twitter to ask a question that should not have to have been asked. {Where is Gov.

While they both condemned the looting and provocations of law enforcement by a precious few over the last few days, they also placed a sharp, critical focus on the excesses on display by the militarized police on Wednesday.

There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting.  There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.  And here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.  — President Obama

For one thing, while the vast majority of protests have been peaceful, acts of violence by members of the public cannot be condoned. Looting and willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers who are genuinely trying to protect the public do nothing to remember the young man who has died. Such conduct is unacceptable and must be unequivocally condemned. By the same token, the law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them. Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told. — Attorney General Holder

Most notably, the reactions reflect a shift away from the usual support and sympathy conservatives typically show for law enforcement in such situations. Although possibly unique to the circumstances of the events in Missouri this week, the changing reaction on the right is clear evidence of a rising and more vocal libertarian wing within the Republican Party.

No better sign of that came Thursday than in an article by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) published on {Time’s Web site}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/#3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/"">.
“If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off,” he wrote. “But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.”

In his piece, Paul criticized what he called the growing militarization of local police forces. “There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace,” he wrote, “but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.”
Paul also bluntly pointed to the role that race continues to play in law enforcement. “Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention,” he wrote.

Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist, said, “It’s an interesting left-meets-right dynamic, and probably Rand Paul is at the center of it.”

Those people alarmed by the militarization of local police, he said, are the same people troubled by the widespread surveillance programs of the National Security Agency or the increasing use of drones as military weapons.

Paul is a prospective 2016 presidential candidate and the leading proponent of libertarian philosophy among elected officials. In Ferguson, he has found circumstances almost tailor-made to advance his worldview. In doing so, he continues to set himself apart from others in the Republican Party with the hope of expanding the party’s coalition and advancing his own political future.
In this case, he blames the militarization of local police on big government and especially Washington’s willingness to provide such materiel to local communities. His comments on race mark another moment in which he is trying to show an openness to the issues affecting African Americans that sets him apart from others in his party.

John Weaver, a Republican strategist, said in an e-mail: “There is a growing concern across the country — and finally across demographic and ideological lines — of the militarization of local police, the often quick escalation in lieu of law enforcement defusing a situation, and the erosion of guaranteed rights under the Constitution. The growing libertarian wing of our party is pushing, rightfully, in this direction.”

The images of police in riot gear, with armored vehicles and heavy weaponry, firing a tear-gas canister at an Al Jazeera camera crew (and then putting their lights and camera onto the ground after the crew fled in terror) have drawn alarming reactions from the left and the right.
The {rough treatment}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z1&tid=a_inl""> and detainment of two journalists, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, has added to the public outrage about the Ferguson Police Department’s handling of the protests over Brown’s killing.

For more traditional conservatives who also might join the presidential race in 2016, the events in Ferguson have been a cause for more careful reactions.

Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) said, in part, “I’m very concerned by recent events in Ferguson, including the violence that has gripped that community and the inexplicable jailing of two reporters. As the FBI looks into allegations regarding the police department there, I hope Americans all over the country will voice their opinions through peaceful means and not resort to violence.”

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), whose conservatism is far different from Paul’s, walked a careful line in his written reaction that was posted on his Facebook page, balancing what he called the tragedy of Brown’s death with the challenges local police face. He also spoke of the need to protect civil liberties and the right of reporters to cover the news without being intimidated.
Pete Wehner, a White House official during George W. Bush’s presidency and a frequent commentator from the right, highlighted what has changed within the conservative movement. “Libertarians are reacting as one would anticipate, but there are more libertarian voices within the Republican Party today than in the past,” he said in a telephone interview.

But in noting the restrained reactions of more traditional conservatives, he offered this caution to those suggesting that libertarianism is gaining widespread support with the GOP.

“I think a number of people who are conservative are somewhat troubled by the images coming out of there,” he said. “I don’t think that’s indicative of a broader trend among conservatives that is less pro-law enforcement. I think it’s to the specifics” of what has happened in Ferguson.

Stevens predicts a growing audience for these views, particularly among younger Americans. “To be younger and more anti-authoritarian is not unusual,” he said. “More younger voters who are conservative are fine with legalization of marijuana and are fine with gay marriage.”

The strength of the libertarian movement within the Republican Party will be tested more significantly if Paul seeks the presidency in 2016. But at this moment, its advocates are making their voices heard.

“They’re not the largest force by any means,” Wehner said. “But they’re more influential than they have been in the past, and you’re seeing some of that in the reactions to what’s going on in Ferguson.”",1167,NA,NA,NA

The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.

The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action….

There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement.

Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement….

When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.

Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.

This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri….

Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.

The op ed should help put to rest the notion – {never very plausible to begin with}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/08/14/libertarians-have-been-anything-but-silent-about-police-misconduct-in-ferguson-missouri/?tid=a_inl""> – that libertarians are ignoring these issues. Paul has not gone as far in opposing the War on Drugs and police militarization as I and many other libertarians would like. I would prefer to abolish the War on Drugs completely, not just cut it back and reduce sentences, as Paul has advocated. But he has gone much farther on both than the vast majority of other mainstream politicians, including most Democrats.

Much more importantly, the situation in Ferguson offers an opportunity for a variety of people concerned about the harmful effects of police militarization and the War on Drugs to work together to promote reforms. As Paul and many others have pointed out, much of the unjustified police violence that occurs in poor and minority communities is driven by the War on Drugs, which in turn both contributes to and is exacerbated by the adoption of aggressive military-style police tactics.

The events in Ferguson and the broader trends they exemplify have drawn condemnation not only from libertarians and many on the left, but also from less likely quarters such as conservative commentators at the National Review (e.g. {here}<hyperlink=""http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/385391/name-and-name-not-kevin-d-williamson"">).
The assorted, conservative, libertarian, and liberal critics of police misconduct in Ferguson are far from reaching a complete consensus on what should be done about the problem. But they should at least be able to agree on some reforms, including eliminating {federal programs that incentivize police militarization at the state and local level}<hyperlink=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/america-police-military-swat-ferguson-westcott-tampa"">, holding police accountable for unjustified violence against civilians, and rolling back at least part of the War on Drugs. Doing any of these things will require an uphill battle. But we are more likely to succeed if adherents of different ideologies are willing to work together.",148,NA,NA,NA

Ronald S. Johnson on Thursday.

“We are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we’re in this together,” {Johnson, a Ferguson native, told reporters Thursday afternoon}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/missouri-highway-patrol-to-take-over-security-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl"">.  “I understand the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling, and our officers will respect both of those.”

One immediate change under Johnson’s command: The heavy riot armor, the SWAT trucks with sniper posts, the hostile glares were gone.

Thursday night, protesters in Ferguson had a new leader: Johnson, who walked with demonstrators.
“I’m not afraid to be in this crowd,” declared Johnson, a towering African American man who wiped sweat from his brow as he pointed out neighborhood hangouts and restaurants he used to frequent.

“I grew up here, and this is currently my community and home,” he’d said earlier in the day.

Johnson, who heads the highway patrol’s troop in the region, hugged and kissed community members as they passed, slapping backs and sharing laughs.

Not only did Johnson march with the protesters, but he vowed to not blockade the street and to ensure that residents’ rights to assemble and protest were not infringed upon. Officers working crowd control, he said, were told they must take off their gas masks.

“When I see a young lady cry because of fear of this uniform, that’s a problem,” he said. “We’ve got to solve that.”

Johnson is a 27-year veteran of the highway patrol and currently oversees Troop C, which covers 11 counties including St. Louis.

“I’ve worked with him for many years, even before I was chief,” St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson {told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/patrol-captain-tapped-for-ferguson-duty-understands-urban-policing/article_c2d38428-b5a4-590d-973f-d9d814e1ba97.html"">. “You couldn’t have a better partner for the region. He’s smart, he’s professional, he comes from the area.”

Dotson told the newspaper that Johnson’s father-in-law, Charles McCrary, had been a deputy chief for the St. Louis Police Department.

Johnson earned a degree in criminal justice from Florissant Valley Community College, according to reports, and joined the highway patrol in 1987, {according to the newspaper}<hyperlink=""https://business.highbeam.com/435553/article-1G1-92075247/patrol-here-gets-new-captain"">. The Post-Dispatch reported that Johnson was promoted to corporal in 1995 and sergeant in 1997. In 2002, officials made him captain of Troop C; Johnson was 39 at the time.
In 2007, Missouri’s then-governor, Matt Blunt (R), {appointed Johnson}<hyperlink=""http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2007/07/02/daily19.html""> to the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission.

As of 2010, Johnson lived near Ferguson, in Florissant, Mo., according to court filings. The court records also indicate that Johnson has two children in their 20s and that his wife worked at the time as a self-employed consultant.",70,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo92,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/08/14/visualizing-the-rapid-racial-change-in-ferguson-over-the-past-decade/,Visualizing the rapid racial change in Ferguson over the past decade,Philip Bump,08/14/2014,03/03/2016,"""This feels a little like an old wound that has been hit again,"" Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) said during a news conference about racial tensions in the city of Ferguson on Thursday. ""So the pain you feel is not just from the individual action. It feels like a little bit of a long time simmering."" By {many accounts}<hyperlink=""http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140812-st.-louis-suburbs-long-simmering-racial-tensions-boil-over-after-police-shooting.ece"">, this is true. But the racial composition of Ferguson has also changed very quickly — and very recently.
The city looks significantly different now than it did 10 years ago. As Ferguson's white population has declined, its black population has increased, but unevenly. We compiled data from the Census Bureau and the state of Missouri to put together a portrait of that change.

The static maps below show the most important change, depicting the change in the density of the black population in St. Louis County between 2000 and 2012. (Full, interactive maps of St. Louis County for both years are at the bottom of the post.) The data is broken out by Census tract, with Ferguson outlined in white. (The city overlaps with parts of several tracts; thinner white lines are areas that aren't entirely Ferguson.)
The reason for the change is fairly simple. In each of the census tracts that overlap Ferguson, the white population dropped, by a total of more than  5,000 people since 2000. And in each, the black population increased, by more than 3,000.
That increased the density of the black population in each area. On average, the percentage of the six census tracts that is African American increased by 14 percentage points.
You can see in the map at the top that this was not specific to Ferguson. The entire area northwest of the city of St. Louis became more heavily black; Ferguson was simply part of that.

Which brings us to the police. As many outlets have noted, there has been a consistent discrepancy between the extent to which whites and blacks have been arrested by the Ferguson Police Department.
In 2000, whites comprised a slightly larger percentage of the population, but were just over a third of the police stops and only one-fifth of the arrests. By 2013, blacks were in the majority, and the gap between black and white stops and arrests grew. In other words, before the population shift, there was a disproportionate focus by Ferguson police on blacks. After the population shift, it became more stark.
At the same time, the composition of the police force is heavily white — 50 white officers {to three black}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl"">. As Megan McArdle notes {at Bloomberg View}<hyperlink=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-08-14/change-and-chaos-in-ferguson"">, there's a possible explanation. While the population changed, it's likely that the police force changed more slowly. While a 50-to-3 ratio would not have been representative of the population in 2000, and while the city's mayor {protests}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-department-diversity-questioned-officers/13976879/""> that the police have hired ""everyone that we can get,"" it almost certainly got more misrepresentative as the population changed. (We called the Ferguson Police Department to try and ascertain the average length of service of its officers; the department's spokesperson's voice mail was not accepting new messages.) As Ferguson moved in one direction, the police force didn't.

Countless municipalities change and grow and evolve over time without tension erupting. But it's not hard to see why tension between an increasingly black population and a very white police force would emerge after an incident like the death of Michael Brown at the hands of an unnamed officer.",12,NA,NA,"Interactive graphs, not saved as photos"
WashingtonPost,wapo93,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/images-coming-from-ferguson-mo-reveal-unfiltered-uncomfortable-truths/2014/08/14/5235f68e-23df-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html,"Images coming from Ferguson, Mo., reveal unfiltered, uncomfortable truths",Philip Kennicott,08/14/2014,03/03/2016,"A photograph is never sufficiently proportional to truth. The truth — the full story, the context of things — is too large and complicated to be encompassed by any single image. So from Ferguson, Mo., where daily protests have erupted after Saturday’s police shooting of an unarmed African American teenager, we get only photographic data points.

A man lights a rag in a bottle and prepares to throw a Molotov cocktail; militarized police sit atop armored vehicles, guns drawn and aimed at protesters who have their hands raised. Both are volatile images, and both confirm aspects of the truth: There are provocateurs among the mostly peaceful protesters, and the police have adopted a terrifyingly aggressive posture in relation to the citizens they supposedly serve.

But these images aren’t coming from Egypt or the Gaza Strip or Ukraine. These are our own, homegrown documents of social unrest and they can’t, like images from more distant lands, be kept safely at bay.

The manipulation of photography has become so complex and widespread that images from conflict zones often tend to cancel one another out. Propaganda has trickled down from the state to the DIY level, and it’s hard to tell the difference between the two.

The resulting frustration, our inability to be certain of the authenticity of the image and the accuracy of the caption, is in many ways a relief: If we can’t be sure whether the bloodied corpse of a child was the result of a bomb from Hamas or the Israeli army, we push it aside, grateful not to have to take a moral position on the conflict. The self-
canceling nature of images releases us from the responsibility to think things through.
We don’t have that luxury when it comes to the images out of Ferguson, because this is us. These are the cities we have made, the police we have hired and paid to protect us, the social fissures we have allowed to fester, the social inequity we accept as necessary collateral damage from our larger pursuit of prosperity. So we must ask: Do these images really cancel one another out? Does the man with the Molotov cocktail in some mathematical way create a deficit in the social order that requires the compensation of a military confrontation? Are both sides of the equation balanced?

The state was once well served by its near monopoly on the ability to manipulate and control imagery. But today, just the opposite is true. People in authority benefit from our distrust of images because that distrust feeds a seeping, nihilistic detachment, which leads to civic disengagement. We turn away from our responsibility to watch the Watchmen; we tend our own garden.
Police brutality, caught on tape so many times now that it is a wonder more communities have not erupted in outrage like Ferguson, can only be dismissed if the citizenry is adept at disbelieving what it sees. The video gone viral on Facebook or YouTube, we are told again and again, does not capture the context of the beating, the Tasering or the shooting. It must be interpreted by professionals; you can’t believe what you see. We’ll form a task force and get back to you . . . after you’re no longer interested, or angry.

Many of us, children of the Cold War and still keenly aware of the great propaganda regimes of the violent 20th century, have been so well trained, for so long, to disbelieve images that we are at the mercy of our own robust sense of suspicion. To be a sophisticated consumer of images, we became reflexive skeptics; that same reflexive skepticism is the thing that propaganda manipulates.

But where certainty is elusive, common sense is the best defense. Every photograph requires two very different kinds of motion: The photographer moves through the world, quickly looking for images that dramatize and illustrate what he or she thinks is happening; and the world, slowly, over long arcs of time, comes to exist in a way that offers the photographer opportunities and material. One is a rapid motion of searching and selection, the other a near-glacial movement of social and historical forces. The photographer, or the photo editor, or the person who describes the events in an image, may all indulge chicanery and manipulation, but if the world keeps presenting itself, over and over again, in the same way, revealing the same things, that is much more difficult to ignore, dismiss or contextualize away.

Put another way, an image of a man with a Molotov cocktail captures one man with a Molotov cocktail; but multiple images of a phalanx of men in riot gear, deploying tear gas, wielding machine guns, can exist only if disparate and complex social, economic and historical forces have conjoined to produce the events represented therein. The actions of a few angry people are asymmetrical to the existence of sophisticated weapons, the troops and the authority deploying them. These images do not cancel one another out because it takes a lot more social energy and investment to produce a hostile police force terrorizing its citizens than it does to create a handful of violent protesters co-opting peaceful assembly.

That, at least, is what common sense tells us. But the people of Ferguson are telling us the same thing, too.
“If you can find a single person in this community who trusts the police, that is like finding a four-leafed clover,” Corey Crawford told Washington Post reporters in Ferguson.

It’s also what the details in some of these images are telling us. We have armed and equipped our police like our military, and that equipment is now shaping the men and women who use it. Ferguson is a city of low-slung buildings, with lots of fast food, chain stores and quickie marts, a classic “near-in suburb” that hasn’t benefited from the rejuvenation of the urban core; it is a land of cars, disconnected from the popular light-rail line that connects other parts of St. Louis County. That, too, is probably shaping the larger social context of these events — and might presage a new era in which the suburb is the focal point of social unrest.
And now Ferguson has become a place where the distrust and despair are so deep that no one is afraid of what political animals call “the optics” of the moment. White men with assault rifles are facing down African Americans, who have discovered and made instantly iconic a new gesture of social resistance — hands held up in the air, in angry, ironic “surrender.” One side seems immune to the shame of playing the role of authoritarian enforcer; the other side angry enough to wear the indignity of surrender as a badge of defiance.

On Thursday, {President Obama}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-speaks-about-shooting-of-michael-brown-in-ferguson-mo/2014/08/14/d49f63ac-23c7-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z1&tid=a_inl""> weighed in, calling for healing.

Images from far away might cancel one another out as we seek to evade their meaning. But the images coming out of Ferguson now seem cumulative, their impact escalating, and they do not seem far away at all, but deeply connected to larger national trends. The man with a Molotov cocktail and the military showdown by lethally armed soldiers of the state are both true; taken together, they show us the world we have built, the injustice we have tolerated, the cynicism we have indulged. They show us the most intimate truth: We have come to this.",0,NA,NA,NA

There are always specific conditions that lead to racial disturbances, but a broader question might be: Why do they keep happening? Are lessons ever learned?

Sometimes, but experts say enduring racial inequality and police failings practically guarantee more wrongful killings and civil disorder.

“It’s a darn shame,” Fred Harris says. “There’s too much of this going on — police shooting people.”

Harris, an 83-year-old former Democratic senator from Oklahoma, has a unique perspective on recurring racial tensions and police violence in America. He is one of the last living members of the Kerner Commission, which examined the social inequalities that led to rioting in black communities in Detroit, Newark and 21 other cities in 1967. It also made recommendations to reduce police overreaction to protests, build trust within communities and increase racial diversity of police forces.

“With all that’s happening in Ferguson, I’m hoping we can go back to recommendations we had on the Kerner Commission,” Harris, a political science professor at the University of New Mexico, said Thursday.

But across the country, experts say, many police forces have yet to adopt some of the most basic techniques to curb the possibility of police brutality and subsequent unrest. These strategies include having police live in the communities where they enforce the law and building connections with the residents.

“The only way to stop these situations is before they happen, not after they happen,” said Chuck Wexler, a law-enforcement expert who has studied federal civil rights investigations of local police departments.
""It’s particularly important to establish credibility with the community, and particularly with the black community, because there isn’t a built-up reservoir of trust.”

He recalled what an aide to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan once told him: “Make friends before you need them.”

“The default is to have this strained relationship between the police and communities of color. That emanates from our history,” says Lorie A. Fridell, a criminology professor and chief executive of Fair and Impartial Policing, which trains police to address implicit racial bias. “Where there is trust and confidence, that’s been produced with a lot of hard work on the part of the police and law enforcement.”

Among the trust-building tactics: putting out information quickly and owning up to mistakes, which, protesters point out, has not happened in Ferguson.

With 18,000 police departments in the United States, achieving a conformity in training and community relations is impossible.

“However, so much has been accomplished in the past 20 years and written about that today no department should have to learn the lessons that Ferguson has,” Wexler says. As head of the Police Executive Research Forum, he has worked with a number of police forces that have struggled with racial incidents, including working with the Cambridge police after the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates in 2009.

Mary Frances Berry, a former head of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, oversaw several reports on police and minorities, including one titled “{Who is Guarding the Guardians?}<hyperlink=""http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/guard/main.htm"">,"" which was revisited after four New York City police officers shot and killed Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant from Guinea, in 1999.

“We did all of these hearings on police issues,” she recalls. “The police said they were always afraid and — no matter how much training they had — that a natural reaction was to think about reaching for the gun.”
A questionable shooting is certain to cause questions and anger, but some academics also point to a broader context of inequality for blacks: more poverty, lower education and income rates, continued residential segregation.

“We remain a society marked by severe racial inequalities in virtually every sector of life,” says Rogers M. Smith of the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of {“Still a House Divided: Race and Politics in Obama’s America.”}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691159629"">
“Any photo in which you’re seeing unarmed young black folks on one side, and on the other side you see police officers in riot gear, that immediately causes you to think about the dogs and the hoses that were prominently deployed against protesters in the civil rights era,” says Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of black popular culture at Duke University.

Those protests and later race riots spawned a library of books and reports, many aimed at making sure that kind of conflict never engulfed another American city. But, Berry said, “nothing changes.”

One of the first witnesses called by the Kerner Commission was a distinguished scholar named Kenneth B. Clark. He told the panel that he read several reports on past disturbances, including one on the 1919 race riot in Chicago, “and it is as if I were reading the report of the investigating committee of the Harlem riot of ’35, the report of the investigating committee on the Harlem riot of ’43, the report of the McCone Commission on the Watts riot.

“It is a kind of Alice in Wonderland,” Clark added, “with the same moving picture re-shown over and over again, the same analysis, the same recommendations, and the same inaction.”",102,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo95,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/08/14/pulling-back-from-the-brink-in-ferguson-and-throughout-america/,Pulling back from the brink in Ferguson — and throughout America,James Downie,08/14/2014,03/03/2016,"No American should ever have to face the heavy-handed police response that has bludgeoned the citizens of Ferguson, Mo., and the journalists covering them over the past several days. Ferguson and St. Louis County police have fired tear gas at peaceful protesters and people standing in their own back yards, and have confronted nonviolent demonstrations with riot gear and armored personnel carriers. On Wednesday night, St. Louis County police arrested local alderman Antonio French, as well as The Post’s Wesley Lowery and the Huffington Post’s Ryan J. Reilly. The situation, simply put, is out of control. But the root causes of the local police actions go way beyond Ferguson, and even partly fixing them will take not only a thorough investigation of Michael Brown’s death, but also a broader change in how police operate around the country.

First, the investigation has to be handed over to actually competent authorities. It took five days for police to interview Dorrin Johnson, the friend of {Brown who was walking with him when he was cut down}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/dorian-johnson-michael-brown_n_5676101.html?&ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067"">, even though Johnson had been interviewed by numerous media outlets, including MSNBC, CBC and local St. Louis media. St. Louis County police originally decided not to interview him {on the grounds that he was running away when the shooting happened}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/police-shooting-draws-massive-protests-317336131948"">. (As if we’re supposed to do something else when a police officer shoots our friend?) Never mind that Johnson’s claim — that Brown ran away after the police officer tried to pull him into his squad car — is far more credible than the current St. Louis police narrative that Brown, an honor student with no criminal record and a good reputation, would randomly decide to take an officer’s gun, then suddenly give up. That the St. Louis County police have stuck to this unlikely narrative tells you all you need to know about their partiality in this case.

Second, police in Ferguson and elsewhere need to remember whom they are serving. Like so many other departments across the country, the St. Louis PD refuses to confront the worst about its own people, while believing the worst about the people they are supposed to protect. We see this play out time and again around the country. Eric Garner is confronted by New York police for ostensibly selling unmarked cigarettes, and then is choked to death. {John Crawford is shot to death}<hyperlink=""http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/man-police-shot-in-walmart-killed-over-fake-gun-fa/ngw77/""> by Beavercreek, Ohio, police outside a Wal-Mart while holding a toy gun for his child. And on a broader level, as my colleague Radley Balko has shown for years, police have continued to default more and more to the use of force, and to acquire tanks and heavy armor and weaponry that seem to ensure that the surrounding community will attack them with weapons normally found in war zones. (Though after the pictures and events of the past week, {one could be forgiven for thinking Ferguson was now a war zone}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/08/14/7-ways-ferguson-carries-echoes-of-foreign-conflicts/"">.) In addition, if Ferguson residents demand that the name of the police officer (i.e. a public employee) who shot Brown be released, then {the Ferguson police should stop hiding him from accountability}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/despite-reports-name-of-officer-in-michael-brown-shooting-still-unknown/?tid=a_inl"">.
Third, it should be clear by now that most local police departments’ strategies of responding to protests with intimidating force are like throwing gasoline on a fire. As {Balko notes in a post Thursday}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/08/14/after-ferguson-how-should-police-respond-to-protests/?hpid=z2&tid=a_inl""> and in his recent book, it has been clear for decades that “an intimidating police presence didn’t prevent confrontation, it invited it.” “Less reactionary” police presences have generally been most successful at dealing with such protests. Even military veterans, who, unlike police officers, are generally supposed to protect themselves before civilians, {have criticized the Ferguson police presence}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/14/military-veterans-see-deeply-flawed-police-response-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl"">:
For veterans of the wars that the Ferguson protests so closely resemble, the police response has appeared to be not only heavy-handed but out of step with the most effective ways for both law enforcement and military personnel to respond to demonstrations.

“You see the police are standing online with bulletproof vests and rifles pointed at peoples chests,” said Jason Fritz, a former Army officer and an international policing operations analyst. “That’s not controlling the crowd, that’s intimidating them.”

Fourth, Ferguson is just the latest evidence that we need to seriously reevaluate how America’s criminal justice system treats minorities. As Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) wrote in Time on Thursday, “Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them. … Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.” Garner and Crawford were just two of countless minority victims of out-of-control police officers. Not only do {the Ferguson and St. Louis County police both have long records of trouble with racial sensitivity}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl"">, to put it mildly, but as this {Washington Post chart}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/police-staffing/?tid=a_inl""> shows, “the vast majority of cities have a police presence that is a lot whiter than their population.”

Late Thursday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced that the state highway patrol would take over security in Ferguson. Early reports suggest they’d taken several of the above suggestions to heart, particularly in backing off of protesters.

Speaking from Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., where he is on vacation, President Obama called for national unity following the police shooting Saturday of Michael Brown, 18, in this St. Louis suburb. “Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,’’ Obama said. “Let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family.’’

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. then announced a series of steps his department is taking, including a meeting held Thursday with civic leaders to calm tensions and an escalating civil rights probe in which federal investigators have already interviewed witnesses to the shooting.
In unusually blunt remarks, Holder said that he was “deeply concerned” about “the deployment of military equipment and vehicles’’ on Ferguson’s streets and that Missouri officials have accepted federal assistance “to conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.’’

Even as dozens of protesters continued their campaign near the shooting scene for a fifth day on Thursday, state officials followed the federal lead. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) announced that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would take over security operations in Ferguson, led by Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, an African American who grew up in the area. “We are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we’re in this together,” Johnson said.
As a result, the heavy riot armor, the SWAT trucks with sniper posts and the gas masks were gone from the streets of Ferguson Thursday night, and Johnson marched with the crowd, eliciting cheers from the protesters. Johnson vowed to not blockade the streets, to set up a media staging center, and to ensure that residents’ rights to assemble and protest were not infringed upon.

“I’m not afraid to be in this crowd,” Johnson declared to reporters.

Obama’s remarks were the most visible step in a rapid coalescence among political and community leaders to tamp down the violence, as images of riot police, tear gas and government intervention provoked a national debate about race and justice that recalled civil rights battles of a half-century ago.

In a sudden burst of interest fueled by photos and video of {heavily armed police}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/14/the-pentagon-gave-nearly-half-a-billion-dollars-of-military-gear-to-local-law-enforcement-last-year/""> that swirled on social media, politicians from both sides of the aisle rushed on Thursday — five days after the shooting — to condemn the tactics of the nearly all-white police force in the predominantly African American town.

The reactions were remarkably similar across the political spectrum. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), for example, called for authorities to “de-militarize this situation,’’ while Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), a likely Republican presidential candidate, condemned “the militarization of our law enforcement’’ in a Time magazine essay.

But on the ground in Ferguson, the support from politicians at all levels was met with skepticism, and it was unclear how much effect it would have.

Eddie Hasan, a St. Louis resident who helped organize a forum Thursday night at a local Baptist church for young people to voice their concerns, called on elected officials to play a greater role in calming tensions. “This forum, this chance for the youth to speak out absolutely should have happened sooner,” he said. “Hopefully it helps us get some resolution to the issue.”

State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, who has been active in planning recent protests and was tear-gassed Monday, said local and state officials have been woefully absent. “There hasn’t been a single white Democrat down here,” Chappelle-Nadal, who represents Ferguson, said on Wednesday before Nixon’s visit. “Mark my words, the Republicans might start showing up before they do.”

Underlying the dispute was the continuing lack of clarity about just what happened Saturday night in Ferguson.

According to a {friend who says he witnessed the incident}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html"">, Brown was walking down a Ferguson street when a police officer in a car ordered him to get on the sidewalk. Brown had his hands in the air to show he was unarmed when the officer shot him multiple times, the friend said.

The police version is that Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to grab his gun. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said during a news conference on Wednesday that the officer was struck in the face during the encounter. The side of the officer’s face was “swollen,” Jackson said, and he was treated at a hospital.
Federal investigators are still trying to sort out the conflicting versions of events but are proceeding cautiously and deferring to state investigators for now, a federal law enforcement official said Thursday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the investigation is a high priority for the Justice Department and FBI but it is far too early to determine if any charges will be brought.

The Justice Department’s civil rights division, along with the U.S. attorney’s office in St. Louis and the local FBI field office, are investigating the shooting to determine if anyone’s civil rights were violated. The federal probe is running parallel to the state investigation.

Holder, who met with Obama on Thursday to discuss the case, said: “Our review will take time to conduct, but it will be thorough and fair.”

Another source of frustration for residents is that police, who initially promised to identify the officer involved in the shooting, have backtracked because of what they say are threats to his safety.

The lack of specifics about the shooting, combined with anger over the show of police force, has many protesters vowing to continue their campaign. Dozens of people did so on Thursday near the shooting scene and also outside the Ferguson police station.

On the fourth day of demonstrations, the crowds still rivaled the size at comparable points on previous days, with dozens standing around the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store and half a dozen or so on the center divider — with one man laying face down in the street and the others pointing their fingers like guns at him.

“Hands up, don’t shoot!” they declared, words that have been the soundtrack of Ferguson’s unrest.

Many residents said that they do not care if elected officials ever show up. “I don’t want to see any governors, or any mayors, or even any more cameras,” said Derrick Beavers, 32, a protester who said he knew Brown. “I want justice.”

In Massachusetts, Obama also called on federal officials to ensure “that justice is done.”
“There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,” the president said, adding: “There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.’’

In concluding his remarks, Obama said that while “emotions are raw right now” in the suburb and accounts of the tragedy differ, “Now is the time for healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done. And I’ve asked the attorney general and the U.S. attorney on the scene to continue to work with local officials to move that process forward.”

Obama did not take questions from reporters after his remarks.

In Missouri, Nixon said the highway patrol would assume operational control of the law enforcement response to protests but that local officers from Ferguson and the county police would remain involved, as they have been all week.

When Johnson took the podium, it seemed clear that things had changed, at least rhetorically. “I understand the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling, and our officers will respect both of those,” said Johnson, who has been the head of the highway patrol’s troopers in the region since 2002.

Johnson vowed that he would be on the ground himself on Thursday night and said he planned to visit the QuikTrip store that has become ground zero for the protesters.",738,NA,NA,NA

The heavy riot armor, the SWAT trucks with sniper posts, the hostile glares: tonight in Ferguson they were gone.

A stunning change in tone radiated through the suburban streets where protests had turned violent each of the last four evenings following the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

But Thursday night, when more than a thousand protesters descended on the remains of QuikTrip – which was burned during riots on Sunday – they had a new leader.

The man at the front of the march, was Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, a Ferguson native.

“I’m not afraid to be in this crowd,” Johnson declared to reporters.
Johnson, a towering African American man who wiped sweat from his brow as he pointed out neighborhood hangouts and restaurants he used to frequent, was put in charge of crowd control earlier in the day, replacing the St. Louis County police who had been overseeing the police response to the protests.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) announced Thursday afternoon that Johnson would take over security, and vowed that officers would take a different approach to handling the massive crowds that have taken to Ferguson’s streets each night.
Not only did Johnson march with the protesters, but he vowed to not blockade the street, to set up a media staging center, and to ensure that residents’ rights to assemble and protest were not infringed upon. Officers working crowd control, he said, have been told they must take off their gas masks.
“When I see a young lady cry because of fear of this uniform, that’s a problem.” Johnson said. “We’ve got to solve that.”
And the difference from protests at similar times in the evening on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday was massive. By this time on Wednesday, police had detained protesters, by this point on Monday officers had begun deploying tear-gas canisters at residents who would not disperse.

Johnson hugged and kissed community members as they passed, slapping backs and sharing laughs.

One man stopped, telling Capt. Johnson that his niece had been tear gassed earlier this week – “What would you say to her?”

Johnson reached out his hand and replied: “Tell her Capt. Johnson is sorry and he apologizes.”

Johnson spent a considerable amount of time talking to media, explaining that the decision to tone down the show of force was deliberate, a calculation he said was made by St. Louis County police officials. He said he met with protest leaders and the NAACP Thursday afternoon, asking them their plans for the march and telling them they could march without fear of restriction. After fielding more than a dozen questions, Johnson began walking toward the protests – it had broken off its route and doubled back.

Johnson marched down the center of the street, trailed by media, as the march’s leader’s brought hundreds of chanting and sign-waving residents.

They met head on.

“Just wanna know where you are going,” Johnson said.

“Up to the Quick Trip and then stopping,” the man with the megaphone responded.

“OK! Go ahead,” Johnson said, smiling and stepping aside as hundreds of residents streamed past him.

Protesters said they were still angry, demanding justice for Brown and answers from local police about why he was shot and who the offending officer was.

But, they said, Johnson’s willingness to physically interact with them, rid the streets of heavy police equipment, and help them coordinate protests was a welcome change in tone.

“Thank you so much for being here,” said Karen Wood, who fought back tears as she held both of Johnson’s hands imploring him to bring answers to residents and maintain calm in the streets.
“This is about human rights, about human beings,” she cried. “It takes cooperation…our youth are out here without guidance, without leadership.”

Moments later, as he rallied the crowd and demanded justice and information about the shooting, the man with the megaphone declared:

“They respect us,” referring to police. “ So let’s respect them. They’ve given us the sidewalk so lets stay out of their street.”

Across town, as dozens of protesters continued their demonstration,  the mood struck was less enraged and more defined.

A massive stash of water, chips and other snacks sat at the corner of the parking lot across the street.

As the crew for CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360 prepared a guest to appear on camera, protesters approached with baskets in their outstretched hands:

“Want a granola bar?”

Protesters at the Ferguson police station waved American flags and held signs declaring “Cops should make you feel safer.”

Loud chants of “hey hey ho ho, these killing cops have got to go!” And “no justice no peace” rang out.

The protesters remained angry about Brown’s killing — but unlike Wednesday night when they furiously demanded the release of family members being detained, the scene was not tense.

Organizers worked through the crowd, handing out “community talking points” outlining the goals of the protest.

“This is what our community was like before a child was killed in our streets,” said Jerroll Sanders, one of the protest organizers. “But what we’ve seen is a change in the policing approach. The aggression was never brought on by us.”",660,NA,NA,NA

But the situation demands a lot more than a stand-down by assault-rifle-toting police. It might require an act of Congress.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said officers would “facilitate” protests, which began on Sunday after a police officer shot an unarmed black teenager on Saturday. President Obama assured the country that the FBI and the Justice Department were keeping a close eye on how local officials were handling the shooting investigation and the outraged street demonstrators. Some of those involved in forcefully dispersing protests won’t have a chance to do better: Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) officially relieved the St. Louis County Police, the principal authority on the ground in Ferguson, and put the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge.

That was justified in light of what {Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. termed}<hyperlink=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-eric-holder-latest-developments-ferguson-missouri""> “unnecessarily extreme displays of force.” Nothing justifies looting or assaulting police, but law enforcement officers in Ferguson did not need to respond to mostly peaceful protests by deploying armored vehicles, pointing sniper rifles at civilians and tossing tear gas and shooting rubber bullets liberally into crowds. These tactics have been an affront to a community that needs to be heard, not suppressed.

Nor does the cause of public safety excuse the documented abuse of several journalists, {including The Post’s Wesley Lowery}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2&tid=a_inl"">, whom police detained for “trespassing” in a McDonald’s, and an Al Jazeera film crew, which was tear-gassed.

Our objection to the brandishing of tools of war in a crowd-control operation raises the further question of whether police departments have obtained too much military hardware from the Defense Department. Police officers with the wrong attitude can do a lot of damage with a nightstick or a pistol. It would be a good idea for the Pentagon to reconsider whether a local police force should ever need, say, a {mine-resistant armored vehicle}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/04/18/congratulations-your-tiny-town-has-an-mrap-and-is-ready-for-war/?tid=a_inl"">.

We are glad to see that several successive nights of chaos seem to have snapped state and local leaders to attention. But they should have reacted days ago. Instead, they let angry feelings in Ferguson, already festering in a mostly African American town with a white-dominated police force, expand further. Police can only do their jobs if they have a basic level of trust from the community they are charged with protecting. If that existed before the recent events in Ferguson, it does not now.

The next steps must include the deescalation that leaders are promising, a full and fair investigation into the shooting and a thorough review of Ferguson’s and St. Louis County’s police training and staffing policies. The Obama administration deserves credit for pushing its investigation forward. It should not hesitate to pressure local leaders further if they continue to fumble.",92,NA,NA,NA

He sought to {strike a balance}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-speaks-about-shooting-of-michael-brown-in-ferguson-mo/2014/08/14/d49f63ac-23c7-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl""> between calming tensions and promising a thorough investigation into the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown last weekend.

“Now is the time for healing,” said Obama, dressed in a navy blazer and checkered dress shirt without a tie. “Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done.”

The president’s remarks came as his administration faced mounting pressure from civil rights leaders to help restore public trust in Ferguson, amid images of police in military-style riot gear clashing with residents in street clothes. In the five days since Brown was shot dead by a police officer Saturday, Obama and his advisers have attempted to calibrate a response to the fast-moving but still murky set of events.

For the nation’s first African American president, circumstances have presented additional complexities because most of Ferguson’s law enforcement authorities are white and most protesters are black. Obama, at times, has spoken on a deeply personal level about his own feelings on race, but he also has been criticized by black leaders for not speaking out quickly or forcefully enough.
Obama and his aides are also mindful of the stark contrast between his posh vacation setting on the island and the gritty scenes in Ferguson. New reports late Wednesday evening of police firing tear gas at protesters and arresting two reporters came as Obama dined on {“surf and turf and pasta”}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/08/13/white-house-spokesman-tweets-while-ferguson-erupts-a-good-time-was-had-by-all/""> while mingling with Bill and Hillary Clinton at the birthday party of a mutual friend, according to the White House.

The president, briefed by senior aides late Wednesday night, believed that “his voice could help quell the violent reaction,” said a high-ranking administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation. When Obama first learned of Brown’s death, he felt “a very deep sense of loss” on a “very personal level from one parent to another,” the aide said.
Even as he addressed the situation in Ferguson, however, Obama steered clear of directly addressing the racial tensions, instead emphasizing the “heartbreaking and tragic circumstances” of Brown’s death and the need for legal equity. He chided those in the community who exploited the subsequent peaceful protests to engage in looting, and he reprimanded law enforcement officers who used excessive force in their response.

“Let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family,” the president said. “We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law.”

Some high-profile African American supporters said Obama didn’t go far enough. In his statement after the not-guilty verdict for George Zimmerman — accused of shooting unarmed ­17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 — Obama talked about the pain among many African Americans, who looked at that case “through a set of experiences and a history that doesn’t go away.”

Anthea Butler, a religion and black studies professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said of Obama’s remarks on Ferguson — which came after he provided an update on U.S. military operations in Iraq — that “people expected a lot more, and they weren’t impressed.”

She added that the president “didn’t address the issue. Part of it is that this is really painful and we have seen him step out in painful events and have a lot of compassion. This is a particular pain that comes from racism.”

Obama’s words instead echoed his administration’s response earlier in the week, when Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced that the Justice Department would assist investigators in undertaking a “fulsome review” of Brown’s death.

For the president, the issue of race has long presented an opportunity and a risk.

In the Zimmerman case, Obama made brief remarks within weeks of the shooting, saying that if he had a son, he would {“look like Trayvon.”}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAPtUfOs7Gs""> But the president held off on a deeper discussion until after the verdict more than a year later, when he held {an impromptu news conference and}<hyperlink=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/07/19/president-obama-speaks-trayvon-martin""> called for an end to racial profiling.
“Based on my experience with the president, he comes to a situation like this and doesn’t look at it as a politician. He tends to analyze it as a father,” Joshua DuBois, a former Obama aide who oversaw faith-based and neighborhood partnerships, said in an interview.

But DuBois added that Obama’s instinct is to “speak to issues where he thinks his voice can help achieve a practical result, if he thinks his remarks can bring healing to that family and community.”

Early in his tenure, Obama faced a public backlash when he waded quickly into a dispute in Cambridge, Mass., after Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., who is black, was arrested by a white officer and charged with disorderly conduct. Obama initially said police “acted stupidly” after the charges were dropped, but the president later regretted his words and invited Gates and the officer {to the White House for beers}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/29/AR2009072903273.html?tid=a_inl"">.
{NAACP President Cornell William Brooks}<hyperlink="""">, who traveled to Ferguson on Monday, said he hoped that Obama’s involvement would spark a national dialogue over the persecution and harassment of black residents by police in their own communities.

“It’s entirely appropriate,” Brooks said, “given that the president has often talked about the fierce urgency of now, as I stand on the street talking to young people with tears running down their faces, asking what is somebody going to do about this — this feels like fierce urgency of now.”

This year, the White House rolled out a program called {My Brother’s Keeper}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-obama-to-launch-major-new-effort-on-young-men-of-color/2014/02/11/cc0f0a98-92cd-11e3-b227-12a45d109e03_story.html?tid=a_inl""> aimed at counseling young African American men. The administration has also sought to {shorten mandatory sentences}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2014/04/21/305638263/obama-seeks-wider-authority-to-release-drug-offenders""> for lesser drug offenses.

Benjamin Jealous, the former president of the NAACP, recalled Obama’s efforts to help {win passage of a bill}<hyperlink=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/illinois-obama-led-fight-racial-profiling""> during his time in the Illinois state legislature to require police agencies to record the race of everyone pulled over in a traffic stop.

“For a lot of people who voted for this president, improving the quality of justice for all of us was central to our early and long motivations,” Jealous said. “I think he understands that.”",2,NA,NA,NA

On front porches across Barry Farm, a public housing complex in Southeast Washington, folks are talking about the shooting of an unarmed teen, followed by days of riots, in Ferguson, Mo. What happened there resonates here, especially among African Americans who have had tense encounters with police officers in the past.
“The police? We don’t know them. They don’t know us. We just stay. Out. Of. Their. Way,” said another woman, who, like everyone else I talked with, didn’t want her name in the paper if she was going to say what she thinks about the police.

But that shouldn’t be the case in D.C., where the police department has changed dramatically over the past 40 years. The nearly all-white force that a civil rights activist named Marion Barry {called}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/dc/barry/79change.htm?tid=a_inl""> an alien “army of occupation” in 1970, just two years after riots ripped the city apart, became a department that mirrors the city’s demographics.

The current police chief, {Cathy Lanier}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/gray-keeping-lanier-as-police-chief-is-hailed-as-signature-accomplishment-in-crime-fight/2014/02/16/3d981c30-927a-11e3-b227-12a45d109e03_story.html?tid=a_inl"">, is white and hugely popular across the city. In the past, though, we’ve had black police chiefs. Six of the seven police district commanders are African American, and the force is 58 percent black in a city that is now 50 percent African American.
So how could it be that some residents still feel vulnerable and at odds with the department when it looks so much like them?

Part of the powder keg that is erupting before the nation’s eyes in Missouri, after all, is the product of {long-simmering racial tensions}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl"">. Only two percent of the Ferguson police department is African American, in a town that is 65 percent black.

That kind of {imbalance}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/08/13/what-caused-the-ferguson-riot-exists-in-so-many-other-cities-too/?tid=a_inl""> is the perfect stage for a police force to take on the role of an occupying army.

An academic study dating back to 1968 found that residents of 14 cities consistently had better relationships with police departments whose makeup reflected the community. A {2008 study}<hyperlink=""http://jrc.sagepub.com/content/45/4/398.abstract""> compared the District with Chicago, where the majority-white police force was widely mistrusted by African American residents. The District scored higher in every category.

But there’s still plenty of mistrust — the kind that may have led to the gunfire that killed {18-year-old Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mike-brown-notched-a-hard-fought-victory-just-days-before-he-was-shot-a-diploma/2014/08/12/574d65e6-2257-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html?tid=a_inl""> in Ferguson. Brown died in a scenario that every black parent in America faces and fears.

A lot of parents in the District call Ronald Hampton, who gives a little seminar on this subject about twice a month.
“It’s basically what to do if you’re stopped by police,” said Hampton, a former D.C. police officer who retired to a life of activism as executive director of the National Black Police Association after 23 years on the force. “This is a dinner table conversation that takes place in black homes; it doesn’t happen in white homes.”

Mostly he speaks to local African Americans after someone they know is pulled over, profiled or harassed. It happened to him, not long after he left the department.

“The officer told me, ‘You should’ve said you were a police officer,’ ” after Hampton chided him for profiling and for being rude and unkind. “It shouldn’t matter that I was a police officer. You just don’t treat people like this.”

When Hampton was on the force, the percentage of African American officers was even higher than it is now. We first talked back in 2000, when it was about 66 percent black and he was advocating for more leadership roles for black officers.

He has some fiercely held beliefs about how an officer should act on the job — white, black, brown, whatever.

“I talked to people, got to know them,” he said. That was called building “community capital,” and it paid off. “When I was out there, I didn’t hide. I stopped to talk to people. And if they didn’t want to talk to me because there was an awful police officer a while back, I told them not to judge me based on that officer,” he said.

Putting that much trust in people isn’t always easy for police officers. There’s a memorial wall honoring those killed just doing their jobs. Last year, a D.C. police officer, Scott Williams, was shot in both legs during the attack at the Washington Navy Yard.

That’s a lot of judgment to overcome on both sides.

At Barry Farm, residents I talked with said police officers wave at kids when they drive past but don’t engage with the adults. None of the two dozen people I talked with knew the name of any of the neighborhood cops. Didn’t want to know their names, either.

“Even if they did come up to me, I ain’t going to talk to them. Nobody’s telling them nothing,” said a 36-year-old mother of two, who said officers once searched her home the day before Christmas, ripping it apart, including gifts she’d wrapped for her older son. “I’m never going to forget that. They didn’t find a thing. And ever since then, I don’t trust police and my kids will never trust the police.”
A 41-year-old man sitting outside said that sometimes an officer will stop to talk with him but that he clams up. “I just stay out of their way. Don’t want nothing to do with them,” he said.

No wonder. He described being pistol-whipped by a police officer when he was a teenager. He was doing nothing but riding his bike between the apartments and the lines of laundry hanging out back.

It’s never easy to move past the sins of our country’s history. Especially when some of that history is only hours old and still being played out on Instagram.

That D.C. officer trying to strike up a conversation isn’t the cop who hit kids back in 1983.

That kid riding his bike isn’t every hooligan who’s wreaked havoc.

It was a working-class area that did not figure or matter much in my world. For all I knew, it was a foreign country.

In those days, St. Louis was a city segregated by suspicion and class affinity. And sometimes by race. I remember an African American friend of my older brother being denied entry to the pool at my father’s golf club. Membership information had been misplaced. Better to come back later.
When I asked my wife, who is Korean-born and also from the St. Louis suburbs, how minorities were treated during her youth, she thought a moment and responded: “I was the minority.” She could not recall attending classes with another minority child until late in high school.

St. Louis, like nearly everywhere else in the United States, has grown more multicultural (though less quickly than many other places). Immigrants to the area have lately come from Bosnia, India and China. But events in Ferguson demonstrate the paradox of American diversity: An increasingly multicultural nation remains deeply divided by race and class. There are many more friendships and marriages between white and minority Americans ({about one in 12 marriages are interracial}<hyperlink=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/02/16/the-rise-of-intermarriage/2/"">) — but at the same time racially charged suspicion and anger persists among millions. And a broad perception of our own racial enlightenment and acceptance has created a different form of isolation — a self-satisfaction that obscures or masks deep social divisions.

The killing of Michael Brown is not primarily a symbol, an example or a wake-up call. It is a specific human tragedy, on a specific street, involving a serious factual dispute. It is the reality that matters most: the deadly struggle over a gun or the murder of a man with his hands in the air. When an unarmed man is killed by a police officer, it is the police who have the burden to demonstrate that it was somehow justified. When protests begin, it is community leaders who have the burden to channel the outrage constructively.
But the Brown killing, as part of a {grim series of similar tragedies}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/14/required-reading-on-race-michael-brown-and-ferguson-mo/?tid=a_inl"">, has quickly become symbolic. As usual, the incident confirms people’s existing ideological narratives. It shows a racism deeply rooted in U.S. legal structures. Or it demonstrates the opportunism of the media and the grievance industry. It is evidence of structural rot or of anti-police bias. It indicts the militarization of police forces or reveals the well-armed challenges they face.

But many people I know who differ on these matters shared the same immediate, emotional reaction: The {images of tear gas, rubber bullets and sniper rifles}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/vandalism-looting-after-vigil-for-missouri-man/2014/08/11/d21bfd62-2169-11e4-8593-da634b334390_gallery.html?tid=a_inl#item0""> from Ferguson don’t look like America.

In a sense, it is a different country. As the United States has grown more diverse and prosperous over the past several decades, the economic and social isolation of some communities has only increased. This is not entirely a function of race. Many in the white working class have also felt segregated from the promise of America. But problems are concentrated among African American males, who have disproportionately low levels of workforce participation, disproportionately high levels of incarceration and little sympathetic attention from the broader society.
This is not an excuse or even an explanation for any specific incident. It is just a context. African American males are in a long-term, economic and social crisis for which there are many economic and social explanations. But their most likely interactions with public authority are a squad car or a demand for child support.

These actions can’t be the only outreach, the main interaction, our society has with young black men. A merely criminal justice response to their problems will ensure future resentment, kindled into anger by future controversies. As a practical matter, it becomes increasingly difficult to enforce order in the absence of opportunity. We often expect too much of police and prisons.

During civil strife, it is necessary to establish public order — against both criminal elements and {abusive police power}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/the-breaking-point-for-ferguson/?tid=a_inl""> ({which undermines order}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl""> as well). But our most admirable, influential leaders have attempted to do something more: to build a single nation of justice and opportunity. And surrendering this objective for any group of Americans would leave a nation both diverse and divided.

In another, a group dressed like soldiers advances on a man, guns drawn and faces obscured by gas masks.

In their response to the protests and civil unrest after the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer last Saturday, local authorities have employed armored vehicles, noise-based crowd-control devices, shotguns, M4 rifles like those used by forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, rubber-coated metal pellets and tear gas.

The anger of residents at first revolved largely around a desire for information about the shooting, but that rage is now rivaled by anger over the authorities’ show of force since the weekend.
“What struck me as I watched on TV was that I was looking at sniper rifles being pointed during the day at peaceful protesters,” said David Goldstick, 38, a former Marine who said that images from clashes Wednesday night impelled him to come out and join the demonstration. “The violence seems to be incited almost exclusively by the police — and it’s not even police, it’s a paramilitary force.”

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson challenged that characterization Thursday afternoon during a news conference.
“It’s not military, it’s tactical operations,” he said. “It’s SWAT teams.”

He said he was satisfied that no one had been seriously injured in a city that he described as a “powder keg.” However, one officer was hit with a brick and broke an ankle, and a second also was hurt.

Gov. Jay Nixon (D) promised Thursday to change the tone of the response, announcing that the Missouri Highway Patrol would take over security.

But the show of force highlights what civil liberties advocates describe as a decades-long militarization of America’s police forces and elicits strong responses from some local and federal officials and veterans of recent wars.

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said he was “deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.”
Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) of Missouri called on authorities to “demilitarize this situation,” adding in a statement that “this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) complained in a Time magazine essay that “Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies.”
One program often credited as a source of military resources deployed by police department is the Defense Department’s Excess Property Program — also known as the 1033 program — which gives equipment, including weapons, to law enforcement agencies.

Transfers through the program have increased dramatically in recent years.

In 2006, it made 34,708 transfers worth $33 million to law enforcement agencies. Last year, the number grew to 51,779 transfers valued at $420 million, according to data provided by the Defense Logistics Agency, which manages the program. Through April of this year, the agency had made 15,516 transfers of equipment worth $206 million.

“Of all the equipment provided to law enforcement agencies through the LESO [1033] program, only 5 percent are weapons,” DLA spokeswoman Michelle ­McCaskill said. Since the program started nearly two decades ago, it has transferred equipment valued at $5.1 billion.

The Ferguson Police Department has received a small amount through the program in recent years, including non-tactical items such as field packs, first-aid kits, wool blankets and medical supplies.

The Defense Department would not provide a breakdown of tactical items given to the Ferguson police exclusively but said that law enforcement agencies within St. Louis County — which includes Ferguson — have in recent years received a dozen 5.56mm rifles, half a dozen .45-caliber pistols, night-vision goggles and a bomb-disposing robot.

But 1033 is just one of a set of federal programs that have facilitated the militarization of local law enforcement agencies, said Kara Dansky, senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Center for Justice and the lead author of a June report on the issue. Police departments also have access to billions of dollars in funding from the Justice and Homeland Security departments.
“The militarization of policing is actually not a new problem,” Dansky said.

The police response in Ferguson was so strong that officials in nearby St. Louis wanted nothing to do with it.

Ward 18 Alderman Terry Kennedy e-mailed St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson on Wednesday night to ask him to stop providing assistance in Ferguson. Only four traffic officers had been involved, Dotson replied, promising none would offer assistance Thursday.

“My gut told me what I was seeing were not tactics that I would use in the city, and I would never put officers in situations that I would not do myself,” Dotson later told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

For some war veterans, the response has appeared to be not only heavy-handed but out of step with the most effective ways for both law enforcement and military personnel to respond to demonstrations.

“You see the police are standing in line with bulletproof vests and rifles pointed at people’s chests,” said Jason Fritz, a former Army officer and an international policing operations analyst. “That’s not controlling the crowd, that’s intimidating them.”

Scriven King, a 10-year veteran of the Air Force’s law enforcement component and a SWAT officer, attributed the initial spasm of violence to a lack of leadership and mismanagement of public perception by the Ferguson Police Department. “The first thing that went wrong was when the police showed up with K-9 units,” King said. “The dogs played on racist imagery. . . . It played the situation up, and [the department] wasn’t cognizant of the imagery.”

King added that, instead of de-escalating the situation on the second day, the police responded with armored vehicles and SWAT officers clad in bulletproof vests and military-grade rifles.

Local law enforcement has for decades become increasingly militarized, Dansky said.

“It has been going on, particularly in poor communities and communities of color, for decades,” she said. “The problem is that it has been underreported and under-documented in those communities.”
The trend swelled after the Sept. 11 attacks, as a new stream of Homeland Security assistance to local law enforcement opened to combat terrorism, according to the ACLU report.

In it, Dansky and her colleagues reviewed data on more than 800 SWAT team deployments conducted by 20 law enforcement agencies from 2011 to 2012.

In 79 percent of the incidents, a team was deployed to search a home, and more than three in five SWAT deployments involved searches for drugs.

“The use of a SWAT team to execute a search warrant essentially amounts to the use of paramilitary tactics to conduct domestic criminal investigations in searches of people’s homes,” the report’s authors wrote.",126,NA,NA,NA

{Brown was killed Saturday}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-of-an-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri/?tid=a_inl""> in Ferguson, Mo.; Knijah died the following day in Landover, Md. Both victims were African American. Both had their whole lives before them. The salient difference is that Brown was shot to death by a white police officer, according to witnesses, while the fugitive suspect in Bibb’s killing is a 25-year-old black man with a long criminal record.
I want to be clear: From what we know so far, the anger over Brown’s death is understandable and appears justified. Absent a full narrative from the police officer’s side, we are left with witness accounts alleging that the fatal encounter was triggered when Brown committed the unpardonable crime of “walking while black.”

We’ve been through this so many times. Brown, from all reports, was a good kid who had just graduated from high school and was about to enroll in college. But young black men are automatically assumed to be dangerous thugs — and are not given the benefit of the doubt that young white men are accorded. This is racist and wrong, and it must change.

But we should be just as outraged over Knijah’s death — and just as determined that this kind of killing should never happen again.

According to police, Knijah’s family was visiting friends at a house in Landover on Sunday afternoon. Among the people who lived at the address was a young woman whose boyfriend, {Davon Antwan Wallace}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/manhunt-continues-in-weekend-slaying-of-3-year-old-knijah-bibb/2014/08/12/8bd1fece-223b-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl"">, had also dropped by.

Wallace got into a heated argument with the girlfriend’s teenage brother, police and family members told The Post. At issue was clothing that belonged to Wallace — and that the brother had apparently been wearing. Wallace allegedly left, went to his car, got a gun and fired about six shots at the second floor of the house, apparently aiming for the brother’s room.

“She liked to wear silver boots in the summer,” Knijah’s grandmother, Brenda Bibb, told The Post. “She had a Hello Kitty sticker on one boot and a Dora [the Explorer] on the other.”

That feeling should be universal. The near-constant background noise of black-on-black violence is too often ignored. Yet it continues to claim victims at a rate that our society should consider outrageous and unacceptable.

Most of the victims fortunately do not have life-threatening injuries, but at least one was reported to be in grave condition, and one has died.

I’ve written about the sad customs that have developed in neighborhoods plagued by this senseless violence — the makeshift memorials of teddy bears and balloons, the speed with which T-shirts bearing a victim’s likeness are produced. This kind of death should never be thought of as ordinary.

The phrase “black-on-black violence” is more often used to distort rather than clarify. Crime depends largely on proximity and thus reflects patterns of racial segregation; the overwhelming majority of white murder victims are killed by whites, just as the overwhelming majority of black victims are killed by blacks. By the standards of most other developed countries, “white-on-white violence” in the United States is also of crisis proportions.

But it is disingenuous to pretend that a shocking disparity does not exist. According to {FBI statistics}<hyperlink=""https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2012.xls"">, in 2012, the last year for which figures are available, 2,614 whites were killed by white offenders and 2,412 blacks were killed by black offenders — similar numbers. But the non-Hispanic white population is almost five times as large as the African American population, meaning the homicide rate in black communities is staggeringly higher.

Treating every young black man as a criminal — as may have happened to Michael Brown — is not the solution. We can understand the socioeconomic causes of violent crime without surrendering to them. We need to get angry — before we have to mourn the next Knijah Bibb.",407,NA,NA,NA

The crowd shouted slogans such as “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” and “Black Lives Matter!” and they chanted demands for justice and an end to deaths at the hands of police. At times, demonstrators shouted down event organizers with words of anger and demands for more than talk in a park.

“Can we just march?” Rockville filmmaker Jasmine Bryant yelled at event leaders as she urged protesters to move from the vigil at Meridian Hill Park, also known as Malcolm X Park, into the city streets and toward the White House.

With a bullhorn to his mouth, organizer Jonathan Lykes responded, “Tonight, can I just mourn for the people we’ve lost?”

On Aug. 9, Michael Brown was walking on a street in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson when, according to a friend of his, a police officer ordered the 18-year-old to move to the sidewalk. The friend said Brown was shot repeatedly after raising his hands to show that he was unarmed. Police have said that Brown attacked the officer and reached for his gun.
The shooting has sparked days of clashes between protesters and police, as well as a federal inquiry into the incident.

When Lykes tried to get the crowd to engage in small-group discussion about feelings of hurt and potential action plans, Justice Woods, 26, shouted down the idea.

Woods, of the Brookland neighborhood, told the crowd of the anger that he felt about his friend and fellow Howard University graduate Mya White, who was shot as she protested Brown’s death in Ferguson.

In an interview, Woods said he hoped that the crowd would channel its emotions toward action, as White did. “When you walk away from here, what are you going to do?” Woods asked. “Get angry. And use it.”

As the event ended, hundreds lingered in the park to exchange ideas for action.

Jasmine Savoy, 22, and teachers Kyle Walcott, 23, and Rennard Westley, 26, wondered whether they should they organize an economic boycott, join a civil rights organization or organize a protest themselves.
No matter which direction he takes, Westley said, he needed time with like-minded people, so he stayed rather than return to his couch.

“I think it’s important to stick around and try to collect your thoughts and try to process it all,” he said.",0,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo105,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/08/14/how-anonymous-got-it-right-and-wrong-in-ferguson/,How Anonymous got it right and wrong in Ferguson,Andrea Peterson,08/14/2014,03/10/2016,"On Thursday, a Twitter account self-identified with the hacking group Anonymous released the name and photos of an officer they claimed was responsible for the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager killed by police Saturday in a St. Louis suburb. Just the day before, a different name had been circulating online.

Both names were {wrong}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/despite-reports-name-of-officer-in-michael-brown-shooting-still-unknown/?tid=a_inl"">, according to the St. Louis County Police Department. But other information, like  audio recordings of police dispatchers in the area, have turned out to be real -- and people on the ground still credit Anonymous with being one of the best sources of information they have access to, especially as they believe local police have not been forthcoming with details of the tragedy.
Anonymous has gained an international following for its reputation for sifting through online data to piece together stories and information about ongoing events. But as Ferguson shows, the group is not infallible.

Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University, who is perhaps the foremost academic expert on the group (and will soon publish {a book}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Hoaxer-Whistleblower-Spy-Anonymous/dp/1781685835""> on her research), helped us parse just how Anonymous works, what went wrong in Ferguson and where the group goes from here.

So what happened? 

After hearing from local rap artist Tef Poe about the tense situation in Ferguson after the shooting, the group launched ""OpFerguson"" to raise the profile of the incident, Coleman says. According to the rapper, he didn't so much specifically reach out to the group for help as they responded to his postings on social media about the situation. Then members of the group began sharing messages of support through social media, while a subset began developing a strategy in an online chat program known as IRC.

That set this operation apart from more recent campaigns the group has undertaken, according to Coleman. IRC, she says, was largely abandoned by the group in favor of more secure communication networks after a series of prosecutions targeting the group. ""That was interesting because it felt very old school -- but on the other hand, from a security question, it raised eyebrows as well,"" she says.
Historically, Coleman says, investigations have been led by a select group of skilled Anonymous members -- often working privately, but closely with individuals in the community affected. They would meticulously comb through online information and connect with those who have first-hand knowledge of the situation in an attempt to bring transparency and accountability to some of the most heart wrenching cases, she says.

Many of those veterans, some of whom she says had largely backed away from the group, came back online for OpFerguson -- but there was also a deluge of newcomers to the movement. The newcomers may have emerged because of how prominent the issue had become, said Coleman. In the past, Anonymous helped elevate stories from the local to national level -- but the Brown shooting was already being covered nationally by the time Anonymous became involved.

Wait, so let's talk more about how this was all coordinated? 

This morning, Coleman says, there was a public debate on the OpFerguson IRC channel in which pictures of the individual some claimed was the officer were shared, along with circumstantial evidence from his Facebook page.

Coleman says she isn't surprised that the group got it wrong, because many on the IRC channel argued against releasing the name.  ""It’s definitely the case this morning, when they were debating whether to release the name [that] a lot of people admitted the evidence was strong but circumstantial,"" Coleman says. But ""they still favored releasing it because it would force the police department to eventually release the real name.""

Twitter postings from another self-identified member of Anonymous appear to confirm that there was an internal dispute about the veracity of the name before one self-identified member of the group released it on Twitter.

Why did tactics, like the move back to IRC, change? 

Coleman has a few theories: One is that popular attention to Ferguson has attracted new activists to the group -- not all of whom may know about the potential pitfalls of using IRC for sensitive communications.
Another, perhaps more concerning  theory is that this may be a so-called ""false flag"" operation, she says. That's when government agents or others who oppose the group plant erroneous information or urge members to move forward without the full picture to hurt the groups' credibility, she says.

While Coleman admits she has no evidence for this latter theory, she argues it's well within the realm of possibility. Government agents or moles have been known to infiltrate activist groups and allegedly encourage the worst of their behavior in the past, after all. (See: {COINTELPRO}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO"">)
According to Coleman, some on the IRC channel raised concerns that the push to release a name this morning may have been a false flag. And, she says, it's not the first time members of the collective have suspected as much: In Operation BART, a project responding to fatal shootings by officers associated with the San Francisco transit system, some within the group believed a {hacker}<hyperlink=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/BART-website-hacked-customer-info-leaked-2335175.php""> attacked and leaked customer data from Web sites associated with the transit system in order to discredit the group.

""In the end there was actually very little evidence that it was a false flag, and the person who did it wrote this justification about why she went and did it. She claimed to be a 13-year-old French hacker who was hacking for the first time, which I don’t think is quite true,"" Coleman says. ""But ever since then, many different operations that are controversial will spur Anonymous to ask that question -- understandably.""

How often does Anonymous get it wrong?

On the whole, the group is actually pretty accurate, according to Coleman -- she specifically points to {Operation Steubenville}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2013/05/13/the_woman_behind_anonymous_steubenville_operation/""> as an example of when Anonymous got many things correct and located important data.

And the group has made some correct calls in Ferguson as well: Audio recordings released by the group Wednesday that appear to show confusion among dispatchers on the day of the shooting were {confirmed}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2&tid=a_inl""> as authentic by the county police -- it's unclear exactly how the group found the audio, but it seems like it was obtained through an online service that re-broadcasts local emergency responder radio signals, rather than through illicitly infiltrating systems.

According to Tef Poe, Anonymous has been an important source of information for those on the ground -- amplifying relevant news on Twitter and serving as a source of new information as the local population struggles with the lack of new facts about the Brown shooting from local law enforcement.
""The only facts that the people St. Louis and Ferguson get -- the only new leads -- are from Anonymous, because the police department won't tell us anything,"" he told the Post. ""You hear people in the street talking to people about Anonymous -- it's completely wild to me, because you hear 40-year-old women saying, 'Well, Anonymous said this on Twitter.'""

But there has been at least one other high-profile case in which Anonymous may have pointed the finger at the wrong guy: Looking for the man who allegedly drove teen {Amanda Todd to suicide}<hyperlink=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/10/17/amanda_todd_suicide_did_anonymous_dox_the_wrong_guy.html"">.
And what happens when they do get it wrong? 

Nothing good. First, the group loses some credibility. ""People really need to harshly judge the accuracy of this group, given that they've now given false information about several important things,” Sgt. Colby Dolly, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police, {said}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2&tid=a_inl""> Thursday.

But it also may put whomever the group erroneously identifies in harm's way. According to Dolly, authorities are trying to locate the person identified by Anonymous to warn him about the potential risks.

And it seems that some in Anonymous are rethinking their finger-pointing ways. Shortly after police rebutted the identification made by some in the group Thursday, the Twitter account that released the name was suspended by the social network. That person's backup Twitter account then said they were getting out of the identification game, as least for now.

So how much of Anonymous is about publicity and transparency versus hacking?

That's sort of a tricky question. Those who associate with Anonymous have widely different political and ideological beliefs -- from anarchists to progressives, and almost everywhere in between. As such, there is a lot of controversy around tactics and methodology inside the group. A majority just want to bring attention to an issue, says Coleman, and aren't entirely comfortable with the idea of violating the privacy of non-public figures. But some still believe identifying the officer who shot Brown would be in the public interest.
In the hacking community, ""it attracts those with some pretty deep technical skills to those with no technical skills,"" Coleman says. ""Definitely a handful of people"" are very bright programmers and hackers, she says, but they tend to be in the minority. Many of the more prominent technical exploits, like distributed denial of service attacks, require less skill. Even those with less technical prowess can assist in those types of attack, which typically knock Web sites offline and can be achieved by buying the computing power of a botnet to overwhelm a target. According to {local reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/how-computer-hackers-changed-the-ferguson-protests/article_d81a1da4-ae04-5261-9064-e4c255111c94.html""> , Ferguson’s Web site went dark Tuesday morning due to a flood of traffic that ""just kept coming,"" which is consistent with this particular kind of digital assault.

And what happens next? 

That's unclear. There are changes afoot in Ferguson -- the {Missouri Highway Patrol}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-speaks-about-shooting-of-michael-brown-in-ferguson-mo/2014/08/14/d49f63ac-23c7-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl""> has taken over crowd control there, and Tef Poe says things appeared to be settling down when he left for a show in Memphis.

It wasn’t the nicest street. Florence, where Ford was walking, has one of the {highest rates of violence in Los Angeles County}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lapd-kills-mentally-ill-man-activists-demand-answers-20140813-story.html"">.
It’s not clear what Ford was doing. Ford had a history of mental illness and had been convicted of marijuana possession and illegal possession of a loaded firearm. In January, he was put on probation for trespassing in Long Beach. But there’s not yet information about what he was doing wrong, if anything. And it’s not yet clear why he was stopped by police.

What is clear: After he was stopped, Ford was killed, shot by two members of the Los Angeles Police Department.

Even as the LAPD released {a detailed account}<hyperlink=""http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/56794""> of the incident Wednesday, {the Los Angeles Times reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lapd-kills-mentally-ill-man-activists-demand-answers-20140813-story.html"">  that “residents and community activists are demanding answers” about the shooting.

According to {the LAPD’s news release}<hyperlink=""http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/56794"">, two veteran gang officers saw Ford walking on a South Los Angeles sidewalk Monday night and stopped their patrol car and attempted to speak to him. But Ford, the statement said, “continued walking and made suspicious movements, including attempting to conceal his hands.

“When the officers got closer and attempted to stop the individual, the individual turned, grabbed one of the officers, and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, they fell to the ground and the individual attempted to remove the officer’s handgun from its holster.” The other officer, police said, “fired his handgun and the officer on the ground fired his backup weapon at the individual.”

Police said Ford was detained, then transported to a hospital where he later died.

Ford’s relatives have offered a vastly different account of what transpired Monday.
The {Los Angeles Times reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lapd-shooting-of-mentally-ill-man-stirs-criticism-questions-20140813-story.html""> that Dorene Henderson, a family friend, witnessed part of the incident and “saw no struggle between the officers and Ford.” Henderson said that neighbors began yelling at the officers: “He’s got mental problems.”

Ford’s parents said he was diagnosed with depression and later schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A man who identified himself as Ford’s cousin {told Los Angeles news station KTLA}<hyperlink=""http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/"">: “They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division, knows that — that this child has mental problems,” the man said. In addition: “The excessive force … there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in the back while he’s laying down? No. Then when the mom comes, they don’t try to console her … they pull the billy clubs out.”

KTLA reported that Ford’s mother, Tritobia Ford, said her son “was lying on the ground and complying with the officers’ commands when he was shot three times.”
“My heart is so heavy,” she told the station. “My son was a good kid. He didn’t deserve to die the way he did.”

Police took another view.

“There is a lot of misinformation out there,” LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said, according to the Times.

Ford, Smith said, “didn’t comply with any of the officers’ instructions. He was grabbing the officer’s gun with the officer underneath him.”
The LAPD said it is still investigating the shooting “in coordination with investigators from the Office of the Inspector General and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office.”

“The LAPD views any loss of human life as a great tragedy,” the news release said.

The Times reported that Ford had prior convictions for marijuana possession and illegal possession of a loaded firearm.

Jay Nixon stumbled in Ferguson. He’s trying to regain his footing.,Sean Sullivan,08/15/2014,03/10/2016,"A week ago, Jay Nixon was a Democratic governor with a promising political future. Today, he’s a guy with a rocky recent past.

The second-term governor of Missouri has been thrust into the harshest brand of national spotlight, thanks to the recent turmoil in his home state -- and widespread grousing that he’s done little to resolve the standoff between police and protesters in Ferguson.

How Nixon handles the next few days could determine whether his prospects of being a vice presidential contender -- or even a presidential hopeful -- will recover, or evaporate.
Nixon spent Thursday in Ferguson. But, say political observers, that's not nearly enough.

“Do more than just visit,” encouraged Michael Steele, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland and ex-chairman of the Republican National Committee. “You cannot just go there and take a walkabout amid the destruction and the tension and then go back to the state capital and say, ‘Well, I’ve done that.’”

Nixon appeared to share that assessment, laying out a range of new moves Thursday. He announced in the afternoon that he had directed the state highway patrol to take over security efforts in Ferguson, substituting for the embattled police force there. He vowed all would see a “different tone” from law enforcement, which has clashed with protesters since Sunday.

But in the eyes of many, it was too late.

Nixon didn’t intend to come to Ferguson until late Wednesday evening. He’d been scheduled to appear at the state fair until he scrapped those plans at the last minute as criticism mounted and the skirmishes intensified. Confrontations between police and protesters have been ramping up since Sunday, leading many to question why the governor hadn't stepped in more firmly, and far sooner.

Here’s a sampling of the heavy backlash Nixon faced on Twitter Wednesday:

""It will have to be Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a man whose every instinct is to dodge bad news whenever possible. Sorry, governor. But you asked for the job.""

Nixon won re-election by 12 percentage points in 2012, an impressive feat in a conservative state. He's not a polarizing figure. And he got high marks for his response to the tornado that devastated Joplin in 2011.
That resume has made him a not-to-be-ignored political figure ahead of the 2016 presidential election. He {signaled}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/09/19/missouri-gov-jay-nixon-steps-forward-but-toward-what/""> his desire to become a bigger player in national politics in an interview with The Washington Post last year. And he's {talked about the importance}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/jay-nixon-democrats-need-voice-2016-108838""> of having the heartland's voice heard in Washington.

As a Democrat who can connect with conservatives, Nixon would make an intriguing vice presidential candidate. If Hillary Rodham Clinton decides not to run for president, his name would have been expected to suddenly pop up on many presidential short lists.

But backlash over events in Ferguson threatens to undercut all that. These are the sorts of situations people tend to remember.

Nixon is trying to combat the perception that he was slow to address a critical situation. The governor said Thursday he felt it was important for local agencies to solve the problems in Ferguson as much as possible. When he saw that wasn't working, he said, he stepped in.

""I just felt at this particular point, the attitudes weren't improving,"" he explained.

Nixon {discussed}<hyperlink=""https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/remarks-gov-nixon-community-meeting-civic-and-faith-leaders-north-st-louis-county""> the situation in Ferguson with civic and faith leaders in St. Louis County on Tuesday, his team notes. On Monday, he asked the Department of Justice to probe Brown's death.

But the images Wednesday broadcast widely on cable news and social media -- of a city in turmoil, of police using tear gas, of journalists being arrested -- were overwhelming to many. And Nixon's absence from Ferguson made those images even harder for people to accept.

So now he's there, hoping to ease the tensions. It may be the right move. The question is whether he made it in time.",12,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo110,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/08/15/its-time-to-stop-calling-rand-paul-a-tea-partier/,It’s time to stop calling Rand Paul a tea partier,Aaron Blake,08/15/2014,03/10/2016,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is {the most interesting man (or woman) in the Republican Party}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/08/14/his-op-ed-on-ferguson-shows-why-rand-paul-is-the-most-interesting-voice-in-the-gop-right-now/""> today. He is known as a staunch conservative on fiscal issues, but he's working with Democrats on criminal sentencing reform. He woos religious conservatives in Iowa, but he also flirts with a more libertarian stance on social issues. And as unrest continues in Ferguson, Paul said something no other Republicans are saying: That the ""militarization"" of police is harmful to African Americans.

We think Benjy Sarlin said it best:
[tweetbegin 499921420651364352 tweetend]
Rand Paul is an enigma wrapped in a riddle. And four years after he burst on to the scene in the 2010 Kentucky Senate race, we're still trying to figure out precisely who he is.
What he's not, though, is a tea partier. That's far too simple a label.

As we've written before, {the ""tea party"" tag has been vastly over-applied}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-misappropriation-of-the-tea-party-label-and-the-headaches-its-causing/2011/03/17/ABws7Il_blog.html?tid=a_inl""> throughout the last few years. It was basically used on every Republican who won office in 2010, even as many of them had little to do with the movement -- either ideologically or in their actions. (Case in point: Chris Christie {was once seen as a tea partier}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/chris-christie-conservative-hero/2011/04/20/AFPxLHIE_blog.html?tid=a_inl"">. Think about that.) Since then, it has been used to refer to basically any Republican who beat the GOP establishment in a primary.

Given Paul's political rise -- he defeated an establishment-aligned Republican in a 2010 primary -- it was natural to label him a tea partier. We have done it too -- repeatedly. It's the easiest short-hand for a GOP outsider. But more and more, it's looking like that label doesn't really fit. While Paul is certainly aligned with the tea party on a lot of stuff, the label doesn't describe him as well as it does someone like Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah). An op-ed Paul wrote Thursday in Time magazine was just the latest example of that. The things Paul said in it are not the kind of things you would expect from a tea partier.

And indeed, it seems actual tea partiers are apparently noticing that Paul isn't exactly their cup of tea. The new {McClatchy-Marist College poll}<hyperlink=""http://maristpoll.marist.edu/814-clinton-leads-gop-rivals-but-loses-ground/""> of the 2016 GOP presidential primary shows Paul's share of the tea party vote dropping from 20 percent in April to 7 percent today -- tied for fifth. Cruz, meanwhile, leads this demographic with 15 percent.
Similarly, an {NBC News/Marist College poll}<hyperlink=""http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/misc/IApolls/IA140707/2016/Complete%20July%2017,%202014%20Iowa%20NBC%20News__Marist%20Poll%202016%20Release%20and%20Tables.pdf""> of the Iowa GOP caucuses last month showed Paul leading Cruz and tied for first overall. But while Cruz's support was almost completely among tea partiers, Paul actually did no better among that segment than he did overall. He was tied with Rick Santorum among tea party supporters.

Both of these polls have small sample sizes and shouldn't be taken as gospel, but it's notable that Paul doesn't appear as reliant on tea party support as the other big supposed tea party candidate, Cruz. That's by design. Paul is reaching out to the minority groups and religious conservatives for a reason; he knows he's not the tea party-est of the tea partiers and that he can't/won't rely on their votes to deliver the GOP nomination in 2016.
With Paul, it's not so much that the tea party won't like him -- he will definitely get support from many tea partiers if and when he runs, and especially if Cruz doesn't -- as it is that it over-simplifies a pretty complex politician.

The trouble with Paul is that no well-known labels seem to fit him well. While his dad, Ron Paul, is a pretty straight-line libertarian, that's not really who the younger Paul is. He's not an establishment Republican, a neo-conservative, an arch-conservative or a moderate Republican.

We still don't know what label would be better than ""tea party,"" but it's becoming clearer and clearer that this label doesn't really fit. Maybe he's just a Rand Paul Republican.",162,NA,NA,NA

The Defense Logistics Agency, which runs the program, provided me with a dataset giving detailed numbers on every equipment transaction going back to 2006. These figures show exactly what kinds of equipment are being provided, where the equipment is going (down to the county level), and how the flow of equipment has increased dramatically over the past eight years.

Below, some key top-level findings from the data.

1. ""Military equipment"" means more than just guns

The dataset contains records of 243,000 transactions encompassing roughly 2.8 million individual items. Small firearms, like rifles, pistols, and grenade launchers, account for some 37 percent of the transactions, but only about 5 percent of the individual items. Weapons parts and components make up the remaining items, along with vehicles, clothing, and miscellaneous supplies.

2. The amount of military goods flowing to local law enforcement agencies has increased dramatically in recent years

In 2006, the Pentagon transferred roughly $33 million worth of goods to local agencies. By 2013 that number had risen more than tenfold, to at least $420 million. Much of this can be explained by the winding down of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As those missions ended, more surplus goods became available for domestic use.
3. Heavy armored vehicle transfers have risen dramatically as well

In 2012 the Pentagon transferred 27 mine-resistant vehicles and other armored combat vehicles to local law enforcement agencies. That number jumped more than sevenfold the following year. In 2014 so far, heavy armored combat vehicles account for nearly half of the total dollar value of gear transferred to local agencies. These figures do not account for a variety of other vehicle transfers, like four-wheel drive vehicles and run-of-the-mill armored trucks.

4. Some states are more enthusiastic participants in the program than others

Florida has scooped up $252 million worth of military equipment since 2006, making that state #1 in terms of raw dollar amounts. That's more than twice as much as Alabama, the next-highest state on the list, with $117 million. Texas, California and Tennessee round out the top five.
In order to correct for population, we can look at dollars of equipment transferred per sworn law enforcement officer in each state. By this measure Alabama is on top, receiving more than $10,000 worth of military goods since 2006 for every sworn officer in the state. Delaware is second, at a relatively modest $5,800 per officer. Tennessee, Florida and D.C. are ranked three through five, respectively.

Interestingly Alabama's neighbor, Mississippi, is one of the states receiving the least amount of goods from the program, at only $216 per sworn officer. Hawaii receives the smallest amount, at $161 per sworn officer.
Undoubtedly, the surplus equipment transfers are a boon to cash-strapped local law enforcement agencies. There's no reason why these organizations shouldn't avail themselves of basic supplies like tools, office equipment, clothing, and even trucks and light vehicles.

But the free flow of combat gear like assault rifles and grenade launchers, and especially the sudden steep rise in transfers of heavily armored combat vehicles, should give anyone pause. While observers have been sounding the alarm about the {militarization of local police forces}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Warrior-Cop-Militarization-Americas/dp/1610392116""> for decades now, the influx of these tank-like combat vehicles is a new development brought on by the end of our overseas wars.

When law enforcement agencies have these weapons in their arsenals they will be tempted to use them. And as this week's events in Ferguson, Missouri have shown, showing up to a peaceful demonstration armed with tanks and assault rifles only inflames tensions.

Fortunately if last night's events are any indication, the withdrawal of the combat troops has {lightened the mood on the ground has lightened considerably}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/with-highway-patrol-hugs-and-kisses-replace-tear-gas-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl"">.

However, hours later, authorities said that {the robbery was not the reason for the encounter}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-chief-encounter-between-officer-and-michael-brown-did-not-relate-to-robbery/?tid=a_inl""> that ended with Brown shot to death on a suburban St. Louis street, suggesting that it was unrelated to the confrontation.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who took no questions at a news conference Friday morning, described Wilson as a six-year veteran with no disciplinary record. Wilson was publicly identified for the first time Friday following many complaints from residents that the police had not named him.

After identifying the officer, Jackson detailed a robbery and released a police report identifying Brown as a suspect. At a separate news conference later in the day, Jackson said the robbery was unrelated; when asked why the police released the robbery information to begin with, Jackson said that it was in response to media requests.

At the afternoon news conference, Jackson {provided a reason for the encounter}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-chief-encounter-between-officer-and-michael-brown-did-not-relate-to-robbery/?tid=a_inl"">. He said that the confrontation occurred because Brown and a friend were walking in the street and “blocking traffic.” This account matches what Dorian Johnson, the friend who was with Brown at the time, has {said in multiple interviews}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/witness-brown-did-not-reach-for-the-officers-weapon/?tid=a_inl"">.
Still, many residents as well as family members of Brown were angered that police had announced Wilson’s name and immediately followed it with information regarding the robbery without specifying whether the robbery was even related.

Michael Brown’s family was sharply critical of the decision to release the robbery photos and footage, saying in a statement that they were “beyond outraged” at the decision.

“The family feels that was strategic,” Anthony Gray, a lawyer for Brown’s family, said during a news conference Friday. “They feel it was aimed at denigrating their son. It was an attempt at character assassination.”
And as of Friday afternoon, key details still remained unknown, including precisely what happened when Wilson encountered Brown and why Brown was shot and killed.

Police handed out a 19-page document packet Friday morning, saying it was in response to Freedom of Information Act requests they’ve received from media members this week.
The documents related to an alleged robbery at a convenience store that took place prior to the shooting.

According to the report, Ferguson police officers received a call at 11:51 a.m. about a robbery in progress at a convenience store and were given the description of a suspect.

The suspect was described as a black male in a white T-shirt walking north toward a QuikTrip convenience store.

“I did not see the suspect in the area,” the officer wrote in the report.

The officer wrote that the store clerk got the description of the suspect as wearing a white T-shirt, khaki shorts, yellow socks and a red St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap. The officer was also told that another black male was with him.

A partially redacted witness report in the packet given to media – which did not state who provided the information – said that a woman inside the store came out of the bathroom during the altercation.

She told police she saw Brown tell the store employee that he and his companion wanted several boxes of cigars from behind the counter.

“As [redacted employee name] was placing the boxes on the counter, Brown grabbed a box of Swisher Sweet cigars and handed them to [Dorian] Johnson who was standing behind Brown,” the report stated. Johnson has said in interviews that he was with Brown when he was killed.

The witness said that the store employee then told Brown he had to pay first, and then Brown reached over the counter to grab more packs of cigars and turned to leave the store.

According to the witness account, the employee called 911 and attempted to block Brown from leaving by standing in front of the door.
“That is when Brown grabbed [redacted employee name] by the shirt and forcefully pushed him back into a display rack,” the report said.

The police report goes on to state that surveillance video from the store shows Brown and Johnson entering the store before Brown hands  the pack of Swisher Sweets to Johnson.

“An apparent struggle or confrontation seems to take place with Brown, however it is obscured by a display case on the counter,” the report stated. “Meanwhile, Johnson sets the box he was handed back on the counter.”

Wilson, who had been responding to a different call shortly before noon Saturday, left that area after the 911 call regarding the “strong-arm robbery” at the store.

A description of a possible suspect and the suspect’s location was also given over the radio.

Wilson left the call he had been responding to and encountered Brown on Canfield Drive at 12:01 p.m., Jackson said.

Within minutes, Wilson shot and killed Brown, though the exact circumstances of how this occurred remain unknown.

Police also released these stills depicting what police say is a confrontation between Brown and a convenience store worker during the reported robbery:

Michael Brown’s family’s strongly-worded statement Friday denouncing the police decision to release the information related to the robbery called it an outrageous attempt to divert attention from the killing.

“There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender,” the statement said.

“It is no way transparent  to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.

“The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention from being  focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.”
About two dozen protesters had gathered on the outskirts of the area Friday morning where Jackson made his first announcement, near the QuickTrip that was burned when protests turned violent Sunday night.

“I wanted to be out here this morning to support the cause,” Mark Jackson, 43, of Ferguson, said before the news was released. He held a sign declaring: Justice 4 Mike Brown. “And I want to see what information they’ll finally give us.”

The announcement from police identifying the officer and naming Brown as a robbery suspect came after the calmest night in Ferguson since Brown was {shot and killed Saturday afternoon}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/anger-mounts-at-death-of-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri-fbi-launches-investigation/?tid=a_inl"">. His death sparked outrage and protests, with hundreds marching in the days that followed.

Still, key questions, including Wilson’s identity, had remained unanswered for days. In the wake of Brown’s killing, police had only released minimal information regarding the officer. They said only that he was a six-year veteran of the force, but did not elaborate on his police record. Wilson was placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting, police said.

Police and witnesses have offered very different accounts of what happened Saturday in suburban St. Louis. The account offered by police {described a physical confrontation}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/anger-mounts-at-death-of-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri-fbi-launches-investigation/?tid=a_inl""> between Brown and Wilson that involved a struggle over the officer’s gun. But the version {described by}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/witness-brown-did-not-reach-for-the-officers-weapon/?tid=a_inl""> Johnson has Wilson confronting Brown before shooting him as he tried to surrender. The witness said Brown did not reach for Wilson’s weapon.

After offering updates in news conferences in the days after the shooting, police largely stopped providing new details. Authorities repeatedly declined to say how many times Brown was shot or where on his body he was struck. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar did say Brown was hit “multiple times” and died about 35 feet from the police car where the confrontation occurred. This lack of information was {fueling much of the frustration in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/frustration-mounts-in-ferguson-as-little-new-information-is-available/?tid=a_inl"">, residents said.

WashingtonPost,wapo115,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/15/morning-plum-how-far-right-is-joni-ernst/,Morning Plum: How far right is Joni Ernst?,Greg Sargent,08/15/2014,03/10/2016,"National political reporters love the story about Iowa Dem Senate candidate Bruce Braley’s dispute with a neighbor over chickens. But analysts appear to see less significance in Republican opponent Joni Ernst’s string of eyebrow-raising statements about everything from impeachment to the United Nations.

Commentators have widely claimed that Braley has committed a series of missteps that have helped Republicans paint him as out of touch. And it’s true that the race remains a {dead heat}<hyperlink=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-iowa-senate-ernst-vs-braley"">. But Democrats believe Ernst’s true views and policy positions have not received a full airing out before Iowa voters.

Case in point: Back in March, Ernst seemed to suggest that Medicaid recipients “have no personal responsibility for their health.” A Democrat points out that {in a newsletter Ernst sent to constituents last year}<hyperlink=""http://www.redoakexpress.com/content/notes-capitol-medicaid-education-dominate-des-moines"">, in which she laid out her objection to the state’s Medicaid expansion, she said this:

Participation in the broken Medicaid program has doubled over the past decade. Iowa has nearly 500,000 Medicaid enrollees. If the program is expanded, it is estimated the Medicaid population will grow by an additional 110,000 to 181,000 recipients who have no personal responsibility for their health and no accountability for the care provided.

Asked for clarification, Ernst spokesperson Gretchen Hamel said Ernst didn’t mean Medicaid recipients themselves are not taking responsibility for their health:

Her concern was that bureaucrats overseeing the program would have “no personal responsibility or accountability” for the care being delivered. She was referring to bureaucrats not those receiving care. On the other hand, through his vote for Obamacare, Bruce Braley is the only candidate running who has voted and successfully cut over $500 billion from Medicare.

In fairness, it’s hard to know precisely what Ernst meant here, but there may be a legitimate clash of policy views underlying it. It’s a fairly standard conservative argument that safety net programs trap people in a web of dependency, and this could be a very stark way of expressing that. For liberals, of course, the suggestion that recipients need to take “personal responsibility” for care is seen as code for making people pay for it, which they can’t afford to do — the rationale for such programs in the first place.

This comes after a string of surprising statements from Ernst. She {suggested}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/joni-ernst---impeachment--of-obama-should-be-on-the-table-204439051.html""> impeachment of Obama should be on the table, though she subsequently {clarified}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/joni-ernst-seeks-to-walk-back-talk-of-impeaching-obama-015747572.html""> that she has not seen “evidence” he should be removed. Video {recently surfaced}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/28/exclusive-gop-senate-candidate-caught-saying-states-can-nullify-laws.html""> of Ernst asserting: “We should not be passing laws as federal legislators — as senators or congressman — that the states would even consider nullifying.”

Yahoo News {has also unearthed examples of Ernst commenting}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/will-joni-ernst-s-flirtations-with-the-political-fringe-haunt-her-in-november-223054974.html""> on “Agenda 21,” a preoccupation of conspiracy-mongering on the right, in which she suggests Agenda 21 could force farmers from their land and exert vast control over Iowans. She subsequently {backed off}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/will-joni-ernst-s-flirtations-with-the-political-fringe-haunt-her-in-november-223054974.html?soc_src=mediacontentstory""> the idea, but her original dabbling in it prompted Yahoo’s Meredith Shiner to {accuse}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/will-joni-ernst-s-flirtations-with-the-political-fringe-haunt-her-in-november-223054974.html""> Ernst of “flirtations with the political fringe.” Steve Benen {recently observed}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/iowas-ernst-has-raised-fears-agenda-21-conspiracy""> that Ernst “seems to hold beliefs that put her squarely on the furthest fringes of American political thought.”
The new Medicaid quote above isn’t in this territory. But taken all together, emerging Ernst quotes raise the question of whether she is the most ideologically far right GOP Senate candidate of the cycle. That would seem to be as worthy of attention as a dispute over chickens.

This quote, from McCarthy constituent and HIV positive William McKenzie, is perfect:

“Without this plan, I would probably be in the ground,” McKenzie said after a recent appointment at a community health center in Bakersfield. Medicaid pays for his $113 tests to measure his viral levels and the $1,200 monthly cost of antiretroviral medications.

He attributed the violence against civilians to police militarization, or some other derivative of the “m” word, eight times, and to race several more.

That was until Thursday, when Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and some other politicians seized on an issue: The over-militarization of the police.

""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies — where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement,"" {Paul wrote}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/08/14/his-op-ed-on-ferguson-shows-why-rand-paul-is-the-most-interesting-voice-in-the-gop-right-now/"">.
As it turns out, that issue is a political winner.

A December poll for the libertarian magazine Reason showed there is bipartisan agreement that the police are going too far by using things like drones, military weapons and armored vehicles. Strong majorities of Democrats and independents (60 percent of both) say that, {according to the Rupe poll}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/poll/2013/12/13/reason-rupe-december-2013-national-surve"">, as do 53 percent of Republicans and 60 percent of tea partiers.

Overall, Americans say these tactics go too far by a 21-point margin, 58-37.
(The Reason-Rupe poll was conducted Dec. 4-8, 2013, among a random sample of 1,011 adults on landlines and cellphones. The results among the full sample have an error margin of 3.7 percentage points.)

The poll question isn't a perfect approximation of what we saw in Ferguson (to our knowledge, no drones were used), but it shows the potential for a message like Paul's to resonate. The scenes in Ferguson were at first all about the unrest; then they became about heavy-handed policing. Law enforcement backed off its show of force Thursday night, and the scene was marked by peace.

Talking about police equipment and tactics is also less likely to inflame racial tensions — while at the same time addressing a concern that is real in the African American community. The poll shows 67-31 that African Americans think police equipment goes too far.

This isn't a totally easy political issue, however. As our own Philip Bump noted this week, {the police are a powerful political force}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/08/14/why-the-police-are-so-politically-powerful/"">,  and it's unlikely they want to see these kinds of tools taken off the table.

But as a starting point, what Paul is talking about is pretty fertile and safe territory.",6,NA,NA,NA

The aggressive response to protesters that unfolded in front of cameras Wednesday night drew new attention to a longstanding policy allowing police agencies across the country access to military gear no longer needed by the Department of Defense. The Post's Christopher Ingraham has documented the department's {1033 program}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/14/the-pentagon-gave-nearly-half-a-billion-dollars-of-military-gear-to-local-law-enforcement-last-year/"">, , which allows a simple application process for police forces to request items.

Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) plans to introduce a bill that would change that program. Johnson has long argued against the militarization of police departments, including co-authoring {an opinion piece}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/03/10/america-police-military-weapons-column/5789445/""> in USA Today in March. ""Americans should ... be concerned,"" he wrote then, ""unless they want their main streets patrolled in ways that mirror a war zone."" It's a call that was echoed in Sen. Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) {essay in Time}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> on Thursday. ""There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response,"" he wrote.
Once Congress returns to D.C. next month, Johnson plans to introduce a bill that would overhaul the legislative authorization for the program (granted under 10 U.S. Code §2576a). A full delineation of the changes he proposes is at the bottom of this article, but it can be summarized fairly easily.

Limiting the types of equipment that can be issued to police forces, including disallowing distribution of armored vehicles and large-caliber weaponry
Creating an annual accountability system for the equipment
Verifying that officers are trained in using it
Removing references to fighting the war on drugs from the policy
It's not yet clear how much support Johnson's proposal will receive. If it passes, however, it could mean a gradual scaling back of military-grade equipment owned — and therefore used — by local police forces.

There's another proposed piece of legislation that has garnered some attention in the wake of the Ferguson tension. A state legislator in Missouri introduced a bill that would {add the identity of police officers}<hyperlink=""http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills141/biltxt/intro/HB1466I.htm""> involved in shootings to the {list of things}<hyperlink=""http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C600-699/6100000021.HTM""> mandated to remain private during public records requests, unless the officer was charged with a crime.

The proposal, from state Rep. Jeff Roorda (D), predates the events in Ferguson by several months. Roorda's motivation  appears to be his experience working with law enforcement. In addition to serving in the legislature, Roorda is also the business manager of the police officer's union in St. Louis. He {explained his position}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/naming-officers-who-fire-shots-far-from-routine-in-st/article_bfcfdb6f-018d-5ed9-9d98-a46eafcd29fe.html""> to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in response to the events in Ferguson. ""These guys face threats during their eight-hour shifts. They shouldn’t have to face them at home.""

This echoes the argument the Ferguson police used in withholding the name of officer Darren Wilson until Friday: That identifying him put him at risk of retaliation. Roorda's proposal didn't go anywhere in the current session of the legislature, and it isn't clear whether it will be reintroduced.

Holder Jr. was set to arrive to personally oversee the federal investigation.

A spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said a grand jury planned to begin hearing evidence Wednesday in the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson police officer. It remained unclear whether Wilson would face charges in the Aug. 9 incident, which has triggered days of chaotic confrontations between protesters and heavily armed police.

“We know this is {of interest to a lot of people around the country,”}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/18/racial-reactions-to-ferguson-even-stronger-than-to-trayvon-martin/?hpid=z1""> the spokesman, Edward Magee, said in an interview. “We’re going to do this fairly and also attempt to do it in a timely manner.”

As darkness fell Tuesday in Ferguson, police officers and protesters braced for a repeat of the late-night confrontations.

In the early evening, as usual, there was calm. The night began with a procession of people chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot.” A group of elementary-school girls handed out flowers. Police were dispersed throughout the crowd, instead of facing down protesters in a long line.
At that point, only some officers seemed to be enforcing a rule that protesters could walk but could not stand still or congregate.

“I saw the police arrest a lady because she had stopped walking,” said Bryan Maynard, 35, who had come to see the protests firsthand Tuesday. It was his first night on West Florissant Avenue, the suburban thoroughfare that has become the scene of repeated nighttime clashes. “It’s more than heavy-handed.”

But the worst time in Ferguson has never been the early evening.

“At some point every night, it’s like a switch is flipped. Sometimes a rock gets thrown. An unruly march. A Molotov cocktail,” said Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief, early in the night.

Later, about 9:30 p.m. local time, hundreds of people looped up and down the street, alternating chants of “We ready!” and “No justice, No peace, No racist police” and “We are, Mike Brown.”
Near the center of the street stood Alerion Smith, a 6-year-old who waved in his hand a “know your rights” booklet.

His mother said that the other day he came up to her and said, unprompted: “Having your hands up means ‘Don’t shoot.’ It means surrender.” That was when she decided he was ready to see the protests for himself.
""Obvious this is something he had heard about and was affecting him,” said Alexis Simpson, 29. “So I decided to bring him out to see what is going on in his own neighborhood.”

About 10 p.m. local time, TV cameras showed officers making arrests. One night earlier, on Monday evening, at least 59 people had been arrested in Ferguson, according to figures from the St. Louis County jail. All but three were charged with “refusal to disperse,” a misdemeanor. Of the others, one was charged with “interfering with an officer. And two were charged with “unlawful use of a weapon,” a broad charge that could mean firing a weapon or simply exhibiting it in “an angry or threatening manner.”

Most of those arrested Monday — 41 of the 59 — were from Missouri. The others came from as far away as Chicago and San Diego. Also on the rolls were at least five journalists, including three {German}<hyperlink=""http://www.thelocal.de/20140819/german-journalists-held-in-ferguson-unrest""> reporters and two Americans, a reporter and a photographer.

On Tuesday — even before the grand jury had heard evidence about the shooting — it was obvious that there was enormous political pressure on prosecutors in this case.

In the afternoon, a small group of protesters gathered outside the county prosecutor’s office in the suburb of Clayton, Mo., then rushed to the glass-front atrium of the county office building. They were met by a wall of heavily armed police officers. At least two people were arrested.

In addition, St. Louis County’s chief executive and other local black leaders have said they believe the county prosecutor is not fit to handle the case. That’s because McCulloch’s father, a police officer, was killed in the line of duty when the prosecutor was 12 years old. McCulloch is white. The man who shot his father was black.
McCulloch has declined to step aside and has said his father’s death will not affect his judgment. On Tuesday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) said he has not asked McCulloch to recuse himself from the case.

His investigation of Brown’s death is being monitored by the Justice Department and the FBI, which are also investigating the shooting in an expanding federal probe that has yielded more than 200 interviews. Holder will arrive in Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with federal prosecutors and agents.

Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, is on paid administrative leave and has temporarily moved out of his home. He has told investigators that he struggled with Brown in his police cruiser and opened fire out of fear for his life after Brown charged at him, according to people familiar with Wilson’s interview with investigators.

Brown’s family has said their son was shot with his hands in the air in an execution-style slaying.

The Justice Department, which ordered its own autopsy of Brown’s body, has reached conclusions similar to those reached in two other autopsies, people familiar with the findings said Tuesday. Those autopsies, by the county medical examiner and by a medical examiner brought in by the teen’s family, concluded that Brown was shot six times.

At all levels, the citizens of Ferguson remain frustrated with law enforcement, Missouri state Rep. Sharon Pace (D) said Tuesday. Pace, who represents the section of Ferguson where Brown was killed, said county and federal officials need to publicly define their roles in the investigations and outline the next steps they will take.
""We aren’t getting any information,’’ Pace said in an interview. “What can we expect to happen and in what order will it happen? They need to tell us where we go from here. We don’t want to rush the process but we need information.”

Earlier in the day, police said they had come under “heavy gunfire” Monday in another night of violence in this battle-scarred community of 21,000 people.

At a news conference, Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said officers refrained from firing back at the protesters. Numerous fires were also set, he said.

Johnson said Monday night’s two shooting victims were both men, but he had no information on their condition or identities. He stressed that “not a single bullet was fired by officers.”
Johnson also had harsh words for the news media, saying journalists have been failing to clear areas that police need to access. He also asked reporters not to “glamorize the acts of criminals.”

Standing in front of a table that displayed two handguns and a Molotov cocktail, Johnson said the weapons had been seized from “criminals” who were hiding behind those peacefully protesting.

“All of these criminals at night that are masking themselves and hiding themselves behind peace, let them come at night so we can identify them, so we can take them away from our community and put them away and make our streets clear,” Johnson said.

Why this disparity? There are two culprits: the timing of municipal elections and the nature of the ballot in these elections.

Ferguson holds municipal elections in April of odd-numbered years. In doing so, the town is hardly unique. Approximately three-fourths of American municipalities hold their elections in odd years, a Progressive-era reform intended to shield municipal elections from the partisan politics of national contests, but one that {has been shown}<hyperlink=""http://www.ppic.org/main/pressrelease.asp?i=282""> to have a dramatic effect on reducing turnout.

Ferguson also holds nonpartisan elections (where party labels do not appear on the ballot), another Progressive reform, and one that has been shown to reduce both {what citizens know about candidates}<hyperlink=""http://people.umass.edu/schaffne/schaffner_streb_poq.pdf""> as well as their {likelihood of voting}<hyperlink=""http://people.umass.edu/schaffne/schaffner_streb_wright_prq1.pdf"">. These consequences are worse for people with less education and less income.
Two charts tell the story of why Ferguson’s elected officials look so little like its population. The charts based on data from {Catalist}<hyperlink=""http://www.catalist.us/"">, which maintains a database of information about American adults based on state voter files and other databases.  Although Missouri itself does not track the race of voters, Catalist has developed an algorithm based on an individual’s name, age, and geographic location that predicts the race of the individual.

The first chart shows turnout rates among African Americans and whites in Ferguson for both the 2012 general election in November and the 2013 municipal election in April. In 2012, African Americans and whites turned out in nearly identical numbers (54 percent and 55 percent, respectively). In the April 2013 municipal election, turnout was dramatically lower among both groups, but whites were three times more likely to vote than African Americans.
The second chart shows the consequences of this differential turnout for the composition of the Ferguson electorate.
In 2012, when turnout was high and African Americans voted at a similar rate to whites, 71 percent of Ferguson voters were black. However, in 2013, whites became a majority of the Ferguson electorate, by a margin of 52 percent-47 percent. This is a dramatic difference, and it would almost certainly help to account for the extent to which Ferguson’s elected officials are of a much different racial makeup than its population.
More broadly, the electoral politics if Ferguson point to broader discrepancies in representation in local elections across the United States — ones that might improve if these elections were held in even-numbered years.",29,NA,NA,NA

“I would have liked to have been consulted,” Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald S. Johnson said at a news conference Friday morning.

Michael Brown was shot and killed on Saturday by Darren Wilson, an officer with the Ferguson police. On Friday morning, Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, said that {the teenager was a suspect}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-releasing-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown/?tid=a_inl""> in a convenience store robbery that occurred shortly before the unarmed 18-year-old was killed.

Johnson said he would be meeting with Jackson later on Friday “to talk about how that was released,” acknowledging that he felt the information’s release was not flawless.
Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) also spoke about the release of the information, noting that these “pieces of information” are not the complete picture.

“I think the focal point here remains to figure out how and why Michael Brown was killed and to get justice,” he said.

Nixon also cautioned that there is still much to be done in the course of the dual investigations being carried out. Local law enforcement and the FBI are conducting separate investigations.

“Nothing should deter figuring out how and why Michael Brown was killed,” Nixon said. “There are a lot of steps between now and when justice is served.”

Nixon and Johnson spoke at a news conference discussing the different scene in Ferguson on Thursday night. Nixon on Thursday said he was {putting Johnson and the highway patrol}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/missouri-highway-patrol-to-take-over-security-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl"">  in charge of security in Ferguson, taking over command from the local law enforcement.

Following this change, {the shift on the ground in Ferguson was remarkable}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/with-highway-patrol-hugs-and-kisses-replace-tear-gas-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl"">, with calm gatherings replacing the tense standoffs that had been occurring each night between residents and a heavily-armed police force.

“Yesterday we handled it just right,” Johnson said Friday. “We shook hands, we hugged…what happened last night is what’s going to happen here forward.”
Johnson said that police did not deploy tear gas, put up roadblocks or make a single arrest.

“It was a good night,” he said. “People were talking, people were inspiring each other, people were getting their voices out.”

Still, after the Ferguson police said that Brown was the suspect in a robbery, concerns emerged about new tension forming in Ferguson and whether this would spark a new, different round of protests.

“This inner anger, we have to make sure that we don’t burn down our own house,” Johnson said.",912,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo124,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/15/a-new-test-for-conservatives-on-ferguson/,A new test for conservatives on Ferguson,Paul Waldman,08/15/2014,03/10/2016,"Just when we thought the news out of Ferguson, MO was getting more hopeful, the Ferguson PD, apparently trying to confirm their reputation as America’s worst police department, has now endeavored to make this situation even more rancid than it already was. As expected, they finally {released the name}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-releasing-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown/?hpid=z1&tid=a_inl""> of the officer who killed Michael Brown on Saturday. They did not, however, release any information on the shooting. No description of the officer’s story, no synopsis of accounts of the multiple witnesses, nothing about the shooting at all.

But there was something else they released: a {report}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/michael-brown-suspect-robbery-ferguson-police-shooting""> on a robbery that occurred at a convenience store some time before. They now claim that Michael Brown was a suspect in that robbery. That they are saying this for the first time is more than a little strange. But it threatens to pull this case back into a familiar pattern, just when it looked like liberals and conservatives could agree on some things.

If you watched the news last night, you would have seen {something incredibly heartening}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/with-highway-patrol-hugs-and-kisses-replace-tear-gas-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl""> in Ferguson. After nights of tear gas and rubber bullets, law enforcement officers stood amid protesters, talking to them, listening to them, even hugging them. There was no violence. And it happened because the Missouri governor told the inept Ferguson police to stand the hell down, and brought in the state highway patrol to bring a little sense to the situation.

Meanwhile, there were signs that {a cross-ideological effort to address some of the problems the case highlighted might be a real possibility}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/14/when-john-conyers-and-rand-paul-agree/?tid=a_inl"">.  Even some conservatives were talking not just about the militarization of law enforcement, but also about the unequal treatment of black people by the police. Rand Paul wrote an {op-ed}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> about it. Conservative pundit Erick Erickson, not ordinarily anybody’s idea of a conciliator, {wrote a piece}<hyperlink=""http://www.redstate.com/2014/08/15/must-we-have-a-dead-white-kid/""> essentially pleading with his white audience to care about this (“just because Michael Brown may not look like you should not immediately serve as an excuse to ignore the issues involved”).

That isn’t to say that some conservatives out there weren’t taking a different tack. Fox News’ coverage offered clips of looting on the first night after the shooting running on an endless loop, along with plenty of talk about “riots” and “violent protesters.” However, there was a division among conservatives, with more than a few rejecting the storyline of violent, threatening black people out of control.
But today, after the geniuses at the Ferguson PD put out their new information, plenty of conservatives on Twitter are saying, essentially, “See? Michael Brown was no innocent kid!” (If you want to read some, {Jamelle Bouie}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jbouie""> has been retweeting them.) The same message is no doubt going to show up on talk radio this afternoon. The implication is clear: he had it coming.

We don’t yet know whether the person who took the cigars from that convenience store was Michael Brown. The police officer didn’t know either — if indeed the reason he confronted Brown was because Brown matched a description he had been given of the suspect. But the point is, that’s utterly irrelevant. Being suspected of shoplifting isn’t grounds for a roadside execution.

We have to give credit to the conservatives who were able to step out of the usual divide we so often see in cases like this one, and say clearly that we all should care about the pathologies that affect policing in America. Now that some of their brethren are going to be trying to convince the country that Michael Brown was a thug who got what he deserved, they’ll face a test. Can they stand up for the principles they’ve already articulated, even as the debate gets uglier? Let’s hope so.",684,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo125,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/08/15/the-complete-guide-to-anonymous-and-opferguson/,The complete guide to Anonymous and OpFerguson,Andrea Peterson,08/15/2014,03/10/2016,"In Operation BART, I think Anonymous was central in transforming the issue from sort of a regional issue into sort of a national issue. [Ferguson] is one that became national almost right away. But then Anonymous hopped in there and definitely kind of amplified what was going on in terms of the media stories, but wasn’t necessarily essential in transforming it from kind of regional issue to national issue. But in many, many other similar operations they’ve gotten involved with in the past -- with Steubenville, with BART -- that was their really sort of unique and important role.

Do you think that shift in how and when Anonymous came into this topic influenced who came onboard -- like the influx of newcomers who may be unfamiliar with their general methodology and security practices?

Absolutely. Also, I do think it’s really interesting to see that it’s one of the first times that we’ve seen large African American populations on Twitter taking notice of Anonymous and starting to debate them. There've been some fascinating questions raised about how -- because protests on the streets and marches don't work anymore -- not necessarily just in Ferguson, but in general. And of course, other people [were] being critical of what they’re doing, but it’s certainly the case that with something like Anonymous people outside the tech community seem to [notice]. Feminists came across them through the rape cases, and now the African American population is coming across them through Ferguson. These different population come across Anonymous at very different moments, and their understanding is understandably colored by those specific operations.

Can we talk about the different tactics being used here? It seems like there are almost two distinct, parallel tracks at play -- a campaign to provide transparency and accountability, but also reports of people trying to hack the police department.

I would say that that has always been a kind of classic bifurcation in Anonymous where the great majority involved are simply wanting to publicize the issue -- they’re not wanting to kind of engage in controversial actions that kind of contradict their mantra. So a lot of people in anonymous are for privacy. But then obviously some people go ahead and hack and release people’s personal information, and that violates privacy, right?

This constantly recurs in Anonymous, where the great majority are for privacy and don’t want to see people’s privacy violated -- then someone goes ahead and does that... It’s usually pretty controversial within Anonymous. That being said, I think many people wouldn’t mind having Anonymous release the name of the officer, if they got it right. And the reason for that is that they would say that the public has the right to know: He’s a public official, he did something that has grave political importance, and that name should be public. That would be uncontroversial.

Going ahead and doxing [releasing identifying information about] all sorts of other people... Some people would support that, a minority, for the purposes of getting media attention, period. It’s like, this is a mean that justifies the ends. Then there’s another kind of group that would say that it’s unnecessary -- and this all exists within Anonymous. It’s always this cacophonous, discordant group where there’s some consensus on some issues and a lot of dissension on a number of the most controversial issues.

You mentioned there that the great majority are really just interested in publicizing the issue. Can you go a little more into what you think the motivations are?

One of the things that’s really interesting and was surprising about my research was that once people started to be unveiled because of arrests and these sorts of things, Anonymous really attracts a diverse number of geeks and hackers whose motivations and political orientations are quite distinct.

For this operation, for example. Some people operating under the banner of Anonymous are classic anti-capitalist anarchists with a huge dislike of the police. Part of their reason for getting involved in this is part of that anarchist sensibility.

Many Anons are not anarchists. They have different political sensibility -- from being Democrats and Social Democrats to liberals or progressive, or not identifying with any political orientation offline at all -- [and] are involved because they see it as battling injustice and corruption. It’s certainly the case that with Anonymous, if one of their operations gets picked up by the media and it balloons and mushrooms, that alone seems to attract people, as well, to continue to participate in the operation. So there’s sort of a feedback loop, as well.

What’s the general technical level of skill required for some of the hacking exploits being pursued by some in the group?

This is another interesting thing about Anonymous: It attracts those with some pretty deep technical skills to those with no technical skills -- one can find a place and a home with Anonymous. Historically, and with Ferguson and OpBART and even LulzSec, many of the hacks were not rocket science, as I like to say -- it’s more a reflection of the sorry state of security on the Web. That said, definitely a handful of people like Jeremy Hammond and Mustafa Al-Bassam are really, bright hackers -- extremely bright. That’s, I think, the interesting thing about Anonymous -- you definitely don’t need people with deep, deep skills.",0,NA,NA,NA

The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.

It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.

Claims of excessive force, racial profiling, and illegal arrests were hard to prove.   In the rare cases when prosecutors brought charges against errant police officers, jurors often did not convict.  “The police were just doing their job” has been a common refrain.

But we’ve discovered we’re now holding one of the most powerful tools for social activism in our purses and back pockets. Last year, for the first time, the majority of Americans (56 percent) owned smart phones, {according to a survey by the Pew Research Center}<hyperlink=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/06/05/smartphone-ownership-2013/"">. That was a landmark development with great consequences for criminal justice and citizen oversight of law enforcement. There’s been a power shift in favor of everyday citizens and it’s being recorded on iPhones and Androids – then Facebooked, tweeted and Instagrammed. Now all the world has seen how a few bad cops do their job.

This summer, ordinary citizens have put those phones to good work.  They have allowed us to see {a New York City police officer put Eric Garner in an illegal choke-hold}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3016326/eric-garner-video-police-chokehold-death/"">. We saw Marlene Pinnock, a 51-year-old grandmother, {get held down and punched in the face 10 times}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2014/08/11/13883477/""> by a California Highway Patrol officer.

And then there’s Ferguson, Mo.  We have seen how the police responded to people who, in the main, peacefully protested the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black man.  {We saw the police}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zApzDwjxfgs"">, using assault rifles, rubber bullets, tanks, tear gas, and smoke bombs, wage a “shock and awe” campaign seemingly out of the Operation Desert Storm playbook.

The world witnessed these outrages, in part, because citizens had the courage to videotape what the police were doing.  It takes guts because bad cops don’t like being caught on tape and, in some recent cases, they’ve gone after the photographer. Police in Petersburg, Va. {stormed the porch of a young man taping an arrest in his front yard}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbc12.com/story/25969540/second-family-says-petersburg-police-went-too-far"">, causing a violent confrontation. Nearby months later, a teenager said police assaulted him for {filming a police arrest}<hyperlink=""http://wric.com/2014/07/10/lawyers-call-for-petersburg-officers-arrest/"">, too. Then this week in Ferguson, police arrested — on drummed up allegations that they were never charged for — Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly when they were {videotaping the cops}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/washington-post-reporter-arrested-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl"">.
The law is simple, and it is entirely on the side of the citizen photographers.  The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right of anyone to record police in a public place.  The police can place reasonable restrictions on photographers by, for example, not allowing them to enter a crime scene.  But they cannot stop people from standing on the street and filming them while they make arrests, detain suspects, or otherwise enforce the law.
If the police see you filming, they cannot force you to turn over your camera.  They cannot make you delete what you have filmed.  Of course, they can ask you to do any of these things — and the police are very good at making requests sound like orders.  But all you have to do is say something like “Officer, I refuse to consent to you to look at my photos.”  Then you have the constitutional right to be left alone.

It takes guts to record the police, even if it is perfectly legal.  As I often tell my law students, the Bill of Rights is not for wimps.   But think of it as an act of patriotism. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed, in 2011, the right to video-record the police.  The Court stated  “Gathering information about government officials in a form that can readily be disseminated to others serves a cardinal First Amendment interest in protecting and promoting ‘the free discussion of governmental affairs.’”

Police should support these efforts. Cameras improve working conditions for the majority of police officers who are hard-working and law-abiding.  In jurisdictions where police cars are equipped with dashboard cameras, {police misconduct complaints have gone down}<hyperlink=""http://policecomplaints.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/office%20of%20police%20complaints/publication/attachments/Final%20policy%20rec%20body%20camera.pdf""> – along with the taxpayer expenditures to settle them. That’s partly why Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier has recommend a pilot program in which D.C. officers will wear body cameras.   She sees it as a win-win, protecting cops as much as civilians.  The police will have evidence for their cases, and citizens will have evidence when they allege mistreatment. It also can address complaints about discourteous treatment by police – rude conduct or abusive language.   Officers say some citizens don’t treat them very well either.  Knowing a camera is running should make everyone nicer.

The next time you see the police doing something that concerns you, don’t just get mad.  Take out your phone and make a recording.   Think of it as the American thing to do.

The festival, which is basically a public screening of curated YouTube videos, went down at Walker Art Center in Minneapolis on Thursday night and drew, per the center’s publicist, an estimated 9,000 people. This year the videos were curated by Will Braden, a graduate of the Seattle Film Institute and the guy behind the “Henri, Le Chat Noir” series, which are maybe the closest cat videos come to bona fide art. (Roger Ebert {called}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ebertchicago/status/241709223610810368""> the second installment “the best Internet cat video ever made.” High praise!)

The festival, for all its admitted silliness, does spring from an intriguing conceptual premise: Essentially, organizers wondered, can a phenomenon that is so manifestly “of the Internet” translate into “real life”? And can a genre that is consumed almost entirely by individuals, on their personal, intimate screens, be appreciated in a mass setting?

Given the success of the festival over its three-year run — it’s now so popular that it tours outside Minneapolis and has spawned copycats (heh) all over the country — the answers to both questions are, apparently, yes.

{Per Braden}<hyperlink=""http://www.vita.mn/crawl/270772661.html"">, this year’s curator, his picks ranged from “really nicely produced documentaries” to “surreal music videos” to “something that just happened when someone pointed a camera at a cat.” You can view some of the selections below — they make a good, cuddly antidote to an otherwise unpleasant week.

Incidentally, the Festival coincides with the launch of another cat-related arts event in Minneapolis: Coffee House Press, a major nonprofit publisher, recently {launched a Kickstarter}<hyperlink=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/301071279/catstarter""> for a book examining the Internet’s cat video fetish. The book, if the Kickstarter campaign reaches its $25,000 goal, will be titled “Cat is Art Spelled Wrong,” and examine themes like what makes something art, whether art is good or bad, and how taste develops. In other words, cat videos can actually be … pretty serious.

“The initial contact between the officer and Mr. Brown was not related to the robbery,” Thomas Jackson, the police chief, said during a news conference Friday afternoon.

Rather, it stemmed from the fact that Brown and his friend were “walking down the street blocking traffic,” Jackson said.

While this corresponds with what Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson, {had been telling media outlets}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/witness-brown-did-not-reach-for-the-officers-weapon/?tid=a_inl"">, it does appear to contradict the conclusion that many had drawn from {a news conference Jackson had held earlier in the day}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-releasing-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown/?tid=a_inl"">. Jackson had said that Brown was the suspect in a robbery that occurred not far from where he was killed, releasing a police report and video footage connected to the robbery.
On Friday morning, Jackson had said that Darren Wilson, the officer who killed Brown, had been responding to a call when a radio dispatcher reported the robbery as well as the suspect’s description and approximate location.

Wilson then left the call he had been responding to and encountered Brown a short time later, Jackson said Friday morning.

Jackson and the Ferguson police then released the robbery report and footage, saying it was in response to requests from media outlets. However, Jackson did not specify if the robbery was the reason for the encounter, and he did not disclose any additional details regarding the confrontation and Brown’s death.

Several hours later, Jackson held another news conference. When asked if Wilson knew about the robbery call when he encountered Brown, Jackson replied: “I don’t know. I know his initial contact was not related to the robbery.”
Jackson described Wilson, the officer involved in the shooting, “a gentle, quiet man” and “a distinguished officer.”",100,NA,NA,NA

Attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., also issued a statement saying that during a time of intense strain between the police and the local community, he was “deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.""

By Thursday evening, the situation in Ferguson had improved significantly after the Missouri State Highway Patrol took over security in the town; authorities have also accepted help from the Justice Department to handle the protests.

In the long-term, though, there are some policy options for how the administration can help the people of Ferguson and similar towns around the country where the use of military weaponry in police departments can spin out of control.

The Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense all run major programs providing hundreds of millions of dollars annually to local police departments. Often, these programs allow law enforcement to acquire heavy weaponry and armored vehicles with little or no value for policing.

The programs ""all point to the same issue, which is the federal government fueling the militarization of local police,"" said Kara Dansky, senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.

Holder said Thursday that the Department of Justice would work with police departments, including in Ferguson, on controlling crowds ""without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.""

Holder's proposal is a useful one, but his counterparts at Homeland Security and the Pentagon have even more influence over local law enforcement. While Holder has comparatively little control over the Justice Department's grants, which are mandated by Congress, the other departments' programs are discretionary.
Homeland Security has delivered around $800 million in grants annually to local governments for counterterrorism measures (although the total has declined significantly in recent years). A report from the department's inspector general {criticized the program}<hyperlink=""https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2012/OIG_12-92_Jun12.pdf"">, which lacked a system for holding grant recipients accountable for how they used the money.

The Pentagon's program is different: instead of awarding grants, the department makes in-kind transfers of surplus military equipment to local authorities, as The Post's {Chris Ingraham}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/14/the-pentagon-gave-nearly-half-a-billion-dollars-of-military-gear-to-local-law-enforcement-last-year/""> and {Thomas Gibbons-Neff}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/14/military-veterans-see-deeply-flawed-police-response-in-ferguson/?tid=a_inl""> has explained. These transfers have increased sharply as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have concluded, and the department transferred equipment worth nearly $500 million last year.

Earlier Thursday, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) {proposed a bill}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/hank-johnson-stop-militarizing-law-enforcement-act""> that would prohibit the Pentagon from transferring some military-grade equipment under this program. Obama doesn't have to wait for Congress, though.

In Russia, they provide an opportunity, in this era of sanctions and new Cold War-style sentiments, to accuse America of being a giant hypocrite.

In the United States, “which has positioned itself as a ‘bastion of human rights’ and is actively engaged in 'export of democracy' on a systematic basis, serious violations of basic human rights and barbaric practices thrive,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Friday, in a special commentary on the situation in Ferguson. “We would like to advise American partners to pay more attention to restoring order in their own country, before imposing their dubious experience on other states.”

Such ministerial-level tongue-lashing might not seem out of place at the present moment, as the United States and Russia trade everything from vitriol to sanctions over their competing stances on Ukraine -- and more generally, are experiencing the worst diplomatic unraveling since the breakup of the Soviet Union.

But the riots and protests in Missouri aren’t just registering with diplomatic officials: They are also prime-time gold.

The United States' problems with racism have long been a favored topic for Russians, dating back to the heyday of the Soviet Union.
During the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet leaders pointed to the existence of Jim Crow laws in the United States as a way of asserting the moral superiority of the Soviet Union. Racism, which was illegal in the Soviet Union, was deemed a systematic byproduct of capitalism.

In the civil rights era, especially, the Soviet Union used American anti-black racism as fodder to challenge the United States’ claims to leadership of the “free world.”

Soviet and modern-day Russia alike have had their own problems with racism as well, of course – to the point where Russia was recently rated by one publication as one of the worst countries for people of color to travel in.

But that stigma doesn’t cause the Russian government to pull any punches with the United States over the situation in Ferguson – or to refrain from using it as an opportunity to highlight America’s race problems to their fullest extent.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said the “police murder of an African-American teenager in the city of Ferguson” had happened in the context of the United States' generally “inhumane” treatment of black Americans, listing medicinal testing and forced sterilization of inmates who are “mostly black,” as well as police abuse of non-whites.

""The low level of American participation in international treaties on human rights does not contribute to solving these often long-standing problems,"" the ministry added. ""Notwithstanding this, in Washington, they don't hesitate to declare their own 'exceptionalism' and leadership in the fortunes of the world.""",15,NA,NA,NA

The foundation makes grants to groups that try to get people to acknowledge and understand long-held biases and work to erase them.
She The People asked Christopher, who is vice president for program strategy with Kellogg, to talk about the events of the past week in Ferguson.

Q: What do the events in Ferguson say about the state of race relations in our country?

A: I think it is a powerful reflection or mirror of the work that has yet to be done. It reflects residential segregation; it reflects the legacy of discriminatory hiring practices; it reflects the persistence of a discriminatory policing culture, which is rampant in this country, driven as much by unconscious bias as conscious intent. As with the Trayvon Martin situation, and all the others, they all reflect the unfinished business, the need for true racial healing in America.

Q. But things have changed since the 1960s, haven’t they? This summer we also celebrated signing the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act, the 60th anniversary of the Brown decision, the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer.
A. I think it’s important to put all of that progress in a context that considers those were episodes in our history, episodic moments in terms of the fight. The civil rights era didn’t last a long time if you compare that to the centuries of the embedded practice of racial hierarchy, both during slavery and after slavery. Those were centuries. We can’t expect brief episodes of activity like the civil rights era to have fixed it. We were naïve to think that that period was going to be the solution to a protracted, embedded belief and institutionalization of a system of racial hierarchy.

Q. But how did we manage to elected a black president?

A.  The disparities in wealth, incarceration rates and residential segregation levels were the same on the day before and on the day after the election of our nation’s first African American president. How did we, and how did he, overcome our nation’s racial divide to win, twice? A careful analysis of the votes shows that despite the impressive number of votes that he did receive from whites, it was the “minority” votes, and particularly the young minority votes, that made the difference. The subsequent campaign to limit access to voting may well be part of the backlash to this phenomenon. The long-standing racial divides in America may have become more pronounced as part of the backlash to his election. His election is a critically important symbol and evidence of progress, but it does not mean that our nation has healed the legacy of more than three centuries of embedded belief and practice of racial hierarchy.

Q. So, did some of us get ahead of ourselves, declaring the country to be “post-racial” because of Obama’s election?

A. The idea of racial differences not mattering, which is the post racial frame — it’s really an aspirational expression. Wouldn’t it be nice if that were true! But it isn’t true. And the idea of, and I like to talk about it as a belief, the idea of a natural and embedded hierarchy of human value based on physical characteristics, that’s what racism is. That idea is so deeply entrenched in our country that to evolve beyond that will take a concentrated and persistent effort. It’s not something that can be solved by protest alone. We have embedded that belief in our science, in our legal system, in our economic system. We have to undo it in all of those systems and institutions, and we have to replace it with the true nature of our humanity, which is we are one human family.

Q. Demographers and political scientists point to the growing population of people of color, who will not have the same racial divisions. Is it just a matter of the old guard dying off?

A.  If the upcoming group faces the economic and opportunity barriers, [such as] our current education system, which is driven by residential segregation and economic segregation, and if these conditions continue, then the next generation of young people will face the same racial divides.

As a foundation, our commitment is to children, and we have a commitment to racial equity and racial healing because we see what the future is projecting for our children. We decided that in addition to all the other things we need to invest in — health, education, family economic security – we had to deal with the fundamental issue of racism. We’re also investing in helping communities around this country move to a willingness to work together, across racial lines, to heal this legacy that continues to shape institutions, communities and systems.
Q. How is it in 2014 the dynamic between white police officers and black men seem the same as it was in the 1960s?

A. One of the questions that’s being asked is “What about this young man’s role?”  The response is he was not armed, so his actions or behaviors are not likely to have warranted him being shot and killed, from what we can see right now. We don’t know what actually happened, but there are better ways to manage the behavior of teenagers than shooting and killing them, especially if [they are unarmed]. It would appear that our police forces in general need better skills and a different set of expectations about their behavior, and that’s what that community is asking for. If you combine the propensity to use lethal force with the unconscious bias that exists, particularly within in a racially disparate situation of mostly white police officers and young black people, the risks for inappropriate use of force are going to be greater. This requires special training, in addition to diversifying the force. We have to acknowledge a high-risk situation, and we need to minimize those risks both from the standpoint of young people and the police force.

Q.  Which of society’s institutions is best suited to help improve race relations, and why haven’t they been more effective?

A. The church has a very powerful role to play. And if you look historically at when there has been progress, whether it was the abolition movement or the civil rights movement, to a limited degree faith community did play a role and has a much bigger role to play now and needs to be engaged. It’s beginning to happen. The organization Sojourners had a big conference about a month ago about helping the faith community to deal with racism. It’s beginning to happen, but it would be wonderful if more mainline religious organizations played a much more active role in overcoming this legacy.

It’s a private-sector issue, a public-sector issue. When you think about it, the future economic viability of our country requires that we do this, and our standing in the world. It’s a public challenge, a government challenge. We would be more respected by the rest of the world if we lead and do this well. We’ve got to stop being in denial and being afraid to acknowledge the absurdity of the persistence of the legacy of racial hierarchy. It’s just crazy. As human beings we are 99.9 percent the same — the human genome project told us that. We need to jettison this 18thcentury mindset.

It’s personal, and it’s institutional, and it’s structural. People make up institutions, so we can’t deny personal responsibility and personal role. But we’ve got to work to get to where we make the right choices to build into our systems the opportunities, not to manifest our innate prejudices, and help ourselves overcome our biases. We have to move beyond denial of the need to do it. Many of our grantees and other community-based nonprofit organizations are already engaged in this work. I believe we need a more robust commitment to the challenging work of racial healing, not just from philanthropy. It is an urgent call for leadership from all sectors of our society … the private, government and the public sectors. It’s hard to establish priorities, and with all the stuff that’s going on in the world, how do you make it a priority? I think we have to because of our children — and Michael Brown was one of our children.",6,NA,NA,NA

Jackson later said the initial contact between officer Darren Wilson and Brown — which ended with Brown’s death on a Ferguson street last weekend — {was not actually connected to the robbery}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-chief-encounter-between-officer-and-michael-brown-did-not-relate-to-robbery/?tid=a_inl"">. The family called the decision to release the report “character assassination.”

There is still a lot that is unknown after reading the report, which was filed by an officer who responded to a 911 call about the alleged convenience store robbery. Details about what might have occurred during Brown’s fatal encounter with Wilson, for instance, are scant.

Here is the Ferguson Police Department’s version of what transpired Saturday, based on the report and the chief’s public statements. The report also included images from a surveillance camera. Time stamps are included where available.
11:52 a.m.

According to the officer who filed the robbery report, Brown entered the store with a person identified as Dorian Johnson at 11:52 a.m. The two allegedly approached the register. A witness who had just come out of the bathroom said that Brown allegedly asked the convenience store cashier for “several boxes of cigars,” according to the report.

“Brown hands a box of Swisher Sweets to Johnson,” the report said. A witness said that the cashier told Brown that he had to pay for the cigars, the report stated. Brown allegedly reached across the counter and grabbed several packets of Swisher Sweets.

“An apparent struggle or confrontation seems to take place with Brown, however it is obscured by a display case on the counter,” the report continued. Brown allegedly turns to leave the store, when the cashier comes out from behind the counter with keys in his hand.
“According to [redacted witness], [redacted cashier] was trying to lock the door until Brown returned the merchandise to him,” the report states. That’s when the photos show what allegedly happened next:

11:53 a.m.

“[Redacted] then stands between Brown and the exit door. Brown, still holding a box [sic] Swisher Sweets in his right hand, grabs [redacted] by his shirt with his left hand,” the report said.
Witness: “That’s when Brown grabbed [redacted] by the shirt and forcefully pushed him back into the display rack.”
“Brown aggressively pulls [redacted[ in close to him and immediately pushes him back into a display rack. Johnson continues out the door and out of camera frame."" “[Redacted] Backed away and Brown and Johnson exited the store with the cigars.”
“[Redacted], no longer between Brown and the door, stops and watches Brown as walks toward the exit door.”
11:54 a.m.

“Brown then abruptly turns back around and advances on [redacted]. Brown towers over [redacted] appearing to intimidate him.”
“Brown then turns back around and walks out of camera view,” the report said.
The officer who filed the incident report said he received a call about the robbery about 11:51 a.m. (He subsequently said that the 911 call was made sometime after 11:52 a.m.) When he arrived at the scene, he was unable to locate the subject.

by 12:01 p.m.

According to Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, Darren Wilson encountered Brown on Canfield Drive.

12:04 p.m.

“This isn’t America.”
“I can’t believe this is happening in America, in 2014.”

These quotes from friends, and the sentiments they represent, were pretty common responses to the shocking events that unfolded in Ferguson, Mo., this week. After the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen last Saturday by a Missouri police officer, the community took to the streets to demand answers from authorities. The largely peaceful protests were met with police donned with military-style combat gear. Tear gas. Mine resistant land vehicles. Rubber bullets. LRAD {sonic}<hyperlink=""http://boingboing.net/2014/08/13/ferguson-protesters-hold-peac.html""> weapons blasting the crowd with noise.

The reality, though,  is this is America. Ferguson is a mirror, and it represents exactly what America is and has been. What causes the discomfort is how far this falls short of the ideals we have for ourselves and project around the world.

The truth is America is a country where black people, especially men, face higher risks of brutality by the police. America is a country where “stop and frisk” exists.  Just this summer, Eric Garner, who died from an New York police officer’s chokehold, and Ezell Ford, killed on Monday by the Los Angeles Police Department, two highly disturbing cases of unarmed black men dying at the hands of police have made national news. In Ford’s case, family members and witnesses {told}<hyperlink=""http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/""> local media that Ford was shot in the back while lying on the ground, complying with police orders.

America is a country where citizens of color live in economically isolated communities, where the police force tasked to “serve and protect” them are white and don’t live there. Ferguson, for example, is {67 percent black}<hyperlink=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/08/14/ferguson_missouri_government_why_is_it_so_white.html"">, but the police force is 94 percent white. Ninety-two percent of all arrests were of the black residents. Ferguson community residents were called “animals” and taunted by the same police who were sent to keep order. Reports on Twitter flowed from community members who claimed to call the police hotline and were met with racial insults or just flatly hung up on.

And as we have seen now, America is a country where weaponry and tactics that were supposed to be used in the war of terror, to protect us at home and promote American ideals abroad, have been turned on its own citizens.

While it is regrettable what happened to my fellow journalists, there are people in communities of color all across America who face excessive police conduct every day.

America is a place, as Ferguson has shown us, where those rights and freedoms that we commend our military personnel for fighting in faraway lands for can be taken away under questionable circumstances.

Brown, a black 18-year-old, was fatally shot by Officer Darren Wilson last Saturday in Ferguson, Mo. Wilson is white.

Dooley’s spokeswoman, Pat Washington, said there have been long-standing concerns among many black leaders in the community regarding County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch’s ability to handle such cases because his father was killed in the line of duty when McCulloch was 12 years old. The man who shot his father was black.
Most recently, she said, Dooley feels McCulloch crossed a line when he publicly criticized a decision this week by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) to bring in the State Highway Patrol to lead efforts to quell the violent street protests that erupted after the shooting of Brown.

“He injected himself in a matter in a way that further exacerbates the community distrust of him,” Washington said. “Rather than stay focused on the investigation, the prosecuting attorney decided to wade over into a whole other area and challenge the governor. He inflamed the community, which already distrusts him.”

Washington said Dooley had called the state attorney general’s office to determine how a special prosecutor could be appointed in place of McCulloch and was told there was a petition process for doing so, which he is looking into. Dooley was planning to meet Friday night with several local and state elected officials who Washington said have voiced similar concerns about McCulloch, but she declined to identify who would be at the private meeting.

Ed Magee, a McCulloch spokesman, said his office believes the county prosecutor cannot be removed from the case.

“There is no petition process,” Magee said. “We are working with the county police. We will continue to work with them if it proceeds to the grand jury and beyond if necessary.”
Magee declined to comment further about Dooley’s accusations.

McCulloch has been the St. Louis County prosecutor for more than 20 years, and during that time has been involved with a support group called BackStoppers, which helps the families of police officers killed in the line of duty.

The prosecutor’s father, Paul McCulloch, was a St. Louis police officer when he was gunned down July 2, 1964, at age 37 while trying to arrest a kidnapper. He had answered a call by an officer in need of assistance at a housing complex and died in a shootout. One of the shooters was wounded and was later convicted of murder.

This is not the first time McCulloch’s objectivity has been questioned because of how his father died.

In July 2000, questions were raised about his leading an investigation into two white police officers who fatally shot two black men. The two officers, undercover drug agents, shot Earl Murray and Ronald Beasley, both unarmed, on June 12, 2000, in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant in the St. Louis suburb of Berkeley. A county grand jury declined to indict the officers; McCulloch said he agreed with the decision.

“My father was killed many, many years ago, and it’s certainly not something you forget, but it’s certainly not something that clouds my judgment in looking at a case,” McCulloch told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at the time. “It certainly makes you more aware of the severity of it.”",65,NA,NA,NA

And at the rear of Wilson’s house, there is also a marked police car sitting in the parking lot of the church.

A neighbor said that police have been here a couple days watching Wilson’s house on Manda Lane in Crestwood, a mostly white city of 11,000 people about 18 miles southwest of mostly black Ferguson.

The officer, who has been placed on administrative leave, left the neighborhood a few days ago.

The neighbor said the family got “spooked and took off pretty quickly before the name was announced.”

According to public records, Wilson, 28, was an honor roll student at St. Charles High School near Ferguson in 9th and 10th grade. His mother died when he was 16.

On Friday afternoon, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson {described Wilson}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-chief-encounter-between-officer-and-michael-brown-did-not-relate-to-robbery/?tid=a_inl""> as “a gentle, quiet man” and “a distinguished officer.”

Joe Adlon, 49, who has lived here 40 years, said he knew Wilson. Adlon said he’s “sure” that Wilson didn’t mean to do it.

“Cops go through a lot,” said Adlon, who was watering his grass. “It’s hard to say what was going through this mind.”

Martha Arnoldy, 60, wife of the Crestwood police chief, who lives on the same street as Wilson, said there is an increased police presence in the neighborhood.

“It’s just a concern the thugs that did that stuff in Ferguson will show up here,” Arnoldy said. “Ferguson was a thriving community that had rebuilt itself. There’s a farmers market there on weekends. For this image to be out that Ferguson is a powder keg is not good.”

Arnoldy said that Wilson and his family “are in a safe place.”

Goldfarb,08/15/2014,03/11/2016,"When President Obama emerged after a night of dancing, surf and turf, and partying in Martha’s Vineyard to address rioting and aggressive displays of police behavior in Ferguson, Mo., he said there is no “excuse for violence against police.” But, he added, “there’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests.”

That was enough to anger a group representing police across the country, which argued that Obama ought not weigh in on how the authorities are carrying out their legal duties more than a thousand miles away.

“I would contend that discussing police tactics from Martha’s Vineyard is not helpful to ultimately calming the situation,” Fraternal Order of Police executive director Jim Pasco {told}<hyperlink=""http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/215178-police-chief-hits-obama-for-ferguson-remarks""> the Capitol Hill publication The Hill.

Pasco’s office said he would not be commenting further. But his criticism highlighted both the risks Obama took in weighing in on a criminal justice issued with strong racial overtones — and the tricky optics of doing so while on vacation more than a thousand miles away.

Obama hit the links just four minutes after making his statement Thursday, calling for peace and restraint following the shooting of an unarmed black teen.
But all year long, he has faced criticism, usually from conservatives, for taking leisure time in the face of crisis. He drank beer and played billiards with the governor of Colorado while dismissing calls to visit children detained at the border. He enjoyed a golfing weekend in California as the Iraqi city of Mosul fell to the terrorist group known as the Islamic State. He opted to continue with a previously planned vacation in Key West, Fla., as Russia annexed Crimea.

Now, he is vacationing in Martha’s Vineyard as crises in Ukraine, Gaza, Iraq and Syria all crest anew — and a St. Louis suburb is rocked by violent clashes between police and protesters.

Obama isn’t the first president to face vacation-linked leadership questions. His predecessor, George W. Bush, drew critiques for spending more than a year of his presidency at his Texas ranch.
White House officials reject that brand of criticism, noting that the president is always on duty, even while he’s away from the Oval Office. They point out that Obama received briefings all week long on the situation in Iraq and the riots in Ferguson.

On Thursday, the president made his first public comment on the situation there other than a written statement earlier in the week. He called for calm and mutual respect. “I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,” he said.

But with his comment questioning whether the police are using excessive force against protests, Obama stirred passions of his own.

“I think what he has to do as president and as a constitutional lawyer is [to] remember that there is a process in the United States and the process is being followed, for good or for ill, by the police and by the county and by the city and by the prosecutors’ office,” Pasco, the Fraternal Order of Police executive director, told The Hill.

The criticism was reminiscent of an early stumble in Obama’s term, when the president said a Cambridge, Mass., police officer “acted stupidly” when he arrested Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates outside his house. The comment, delivered at a White House news conference, stirred outrage in the law enforcement community.

Obama ultimately was forced to hold a “beer summit” at the White House in order to smooth over relations.

Since that kerfuffle, Obama largely steered clear of issues of race and criminal justice. In his second term, he has more squarely addressed the issues, usually without provoking much criticism. He addressed the nation after the verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman, who was accused of killing Trayvon Martin.

His attorney general, Eric Holder, has usually been the one to weigh more directly into criminal justice issues with strong racial backdrops.

On Thursday, Holder said he was “deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,” questioning the judgment of local authorities. Holder briefed Obama in Martha’s Vineyard.
And indeed, the president has increasingly found support across the aisle. Republican lawmakers also raised concern about the militarization of local police forces.

On policy, Obama and the law enforcement community have often found themselves in step. Police groups backed Obama’s unsuccessful efforts, for example, to tighten gun controls, often standing behind him as the president held events calling on Congress to act.

Brown; Jerry Markon,08/15/2014,03/11/2016,"Authorities in this restive suburb of St. Louis on Friday began telling their version of the events surrounding the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer, but the halting, contradictory nature of the account revived popular anger here and brought criticism from other law enforcement agencies.

Nearly a week after 18-year-old Michael Brown’s death sparked days of protests, police identified the officer who killed him as Darren Wilson, who has six years of service with no disciplinary record. But they provided virtually no information about the officer, instead focusing on linking Brown to a convenience store robbery that occurred just before the shooting.

At a tense early morning news conference, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Brown had been the prime suspect in that robbery — in which several boxes of cigars were stolen — and that his description was broadcast over police frequencies just before his encounter with Wilson. Police dramatized the allegation, releasing security camera photos showing a person they identified as Brown towering over and menacing the store clerk, images that were circulated nationwide.
Yet, despite the implication that Brown was stopped because of the robbery, Jackson later {appeared to reverse himself}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-chief-encounter-between-officer-and-michael-brown-did-not-relate-to-robbery/?hpid=z2&tid=a_inl"">, saying at a second news conference that the confrontation “was not related to the robbery.” Instead, he said, Brown was stopped because he and a friend were walking in the street.

Hours later, Jackson returned again to the robbery theme, telling the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the officer saw cigars in Brown’s hand and realized he might be the robber.

Read the documents
{Ferguson Police incident report on Aug. 9 robbery}<hyperlink=""http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/ferguson-police-department-incident-report-on-aug-9-robbery/1256/"">
The confusion appeared to further inflame tensions roiling this community of 21,000. Scattered protests continued, and the police actions drew a rebuke from Brown’s family, which accused Jackson of deliberately besmirching the teen’s character.

“The family feels that was strategic,” Anthony Gray, an attorney for Brown’s family, said during a news conference Friday. “They feel it was aimed at denigrating their son. It was an attempt at character assassination.”
Added Eric Davis, a cousin of Brown’s mother: “It infuriated us.”

There were also signs Friday of {a rift among state and local authorities}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/missouri-governor-highway-patrol-captain-acknowledge-concerns-over-police-report-on-michael-brown/?hpid=z1&tid=a_inl""> involved in the case, only one day after political and community leaders mounted a renewed effort to tamp down the violence and find ways to prevent future outbreaks while multiple investigations of the shooting proceed.
In an unusual public disagreement, the law enforcement official newly in charge of security in Ferguson appeared to question the decision to name Brown as a robbery suspect. “I would have liked to have been consulted,” Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald S. Johnson said Friday, adding that he would meet with Jackson to discuss “how that was released.’’

Johnson, an African American who grew up in the Ferguson area, had been put in charge Thursday by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) when the governor announced that the State Highway Patrol would take over security operations after days of images of riot police and tear gas in the streets.

Law enforcement officials typically strive to present a united front, yet Nixon’s decision prompted an unusual public attack from St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, who was angered that the move would take control of the scene away from St. Louis County police. “For Nixon to never talk to the commanders in the field and come in here and take this action is disgraceful,” McCulloch told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “It’s shameful what he did.’’

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley later said he is leading an effort to remove the county prosecutor from the investigation because of bias. McCulloch is the person who will decide whether state charges will be filed against the police officer.

It was not clear Friday whether the evident turf battles would hamper the state investigation of Brown’s shooting. The Justice Department and FBI, which are conducting a parallel investigation to determine whether Brown’s civil rights were violated, are deferring for now to state investigators but are also monitoring them.
The announcements from police identifying the officer and naming Brown as a robbery suspect came after the calmest night in Ferguson since Brown was killed. His death has sparked outrage and protests, with hundreds marching in the streets in the days that followed.

Little information about the shooting has been publicly released, and the media frenzy to learn more about Wilson yielded only scattered bits of information.

According to public records, Wilson, 28, was an honor roll student at St. Charles High School near Ferguson in the ninth and 10th grades. His mother died when he was 16.

The officer, who is on administrative leave, a few days ago left his neighborhood in Crestwood, a city of 11,000 people about 18 miles southwest of Ferguson. Dark blue unmarked police cars were parked outside his house on Manda Lane, with a marked police car in the parking lot of a church to the rear of the house.

Most people in the neighborhood of brick ranch houses and manicured lawns declined to comment. A sign on the door of a neighbor next to Wilson’s house read: “We have two children. Do not knock. No comment.”

Joe Adlon, 49, whose parents’ house is about a block away, described Wilson as “a nice person. Very, very good. It’s tragic this happened. It is a shame.’’

Jackson, the police chief, described Wilson as “a gentle, quiet man” and “a distinguished officer.”

The sequence of events in Brown’s shooting is still unclear. According to a friend who says he witnessed the encounter, Brown was walking along a Ferguson street when a police officer in a car ordered him to get on the sidewalk. Brown had his hands in the air to show he was unarmed when the officer shot him multiple times, the friend said.

The police say Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to grab his gun.

Police gave far more detail Friday about the robbery at the convenience store, handing out a 19-page packet of documents.

According to the documents, Ferguson police officers received a call at 11:51 a.m. Saturday about a robbery in progress at the store and were given the description of a suspect: a black male in a white T-shirt walking north toward a QuikTrip convenience store.
“I did not see the suspect in the area,” an unidentified officer wrote in the report.

The officer wrote that the store clerk described the suspect as wearing a white T-shirt, khaki shorts, yellow socks and a red St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap. The officer was also told that another black male was with the suspect.

A partially redacted witness report in the packet — which did not state who provided the information — said that a woman inside the store came out of the bathroom during the altercation.

She told police she saw Brown tell the store employee that he and his companion wanted several boxes of cigars from behind the counter.

“As [redacted employee name] was placing the boxes on the counter, Brown grabbed a box of Swisher Sweet cigars and handed them to [Dorian] Johnson who was standing behind Brown,” the report states. Johnson has said in interviews that he was with Brown when he was killed.

The witness said that the store employee then told Brown he had to pay first, but Brown reached over the counter and grabbed more packs of cigars, then turned to leave the store.

According to the witness account, the employee called 911 and tried to prevent Brown from leaving the store by standing in front of the door.

“That is when Brown grabbed [redacted employee name] by the shirt and forcefully pushed him back in to a display rack,” the report says.

The police report goes on to state that surveillance video from the store shows Brown handing a pack of Swisher Sweets to Johnson.

“An apparent struggle or confrontation seems to take place with Brown, however it is obscured by a display case on the counter,” the report states. “Meanwhile, Johnson sets the box he was handed back on the counter.”

Wilson had been responding to a different call shortly before noon Saturday. A description of a suspect and the suspect’s location were also given over the radio, police said.

Wilson left the call to which he had been responding and encountered Brown on Canfield Drive at 12:01 p.m., Jackson said. These details, provided by police early Friday, helped to create the impression that Wilson knew about the robbery.
Minutes after their encounter began, Wilson fatally shot Brown, although the exact circumstances of how this occurred remain unknown.",3362,NA,NA,NA

Brown; Wesley Lowery; Jerry Markon,08/15/2014,03/11/2016,"Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Saturday declared a state of emergency in this roiling St. Louis suburb and imposed an overnight curfew, telling a group of shouting residents that order must be restored after days of protests over the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer.

The governor’s extraordinary action came as the attorney for a key witness described the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown as an execution-style slaying. Lawyer Freeman Bosley Jr. said Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown’s, has told the FBI that Officer Darren Wilson confronted the two because they were walking in the middle of the street.

Wilson cursed at the pair and ordered them onto the sidewalk, Bosley told The Washington Post. When they refused to comply, he said, the officer grabbed Brown’s throat through the window of his cruiser, pulled out a pistol and shot him. Wilson then chased Brown, shot him in the back and shot him five to six more times as Brown’s hands were raised, Bosley said.
Neither Ferguson police nor the FBI responded to requests for comment on Bosley’s account.

The account, combined with Nixon’s declaration, made for another day of chaos and confusion in this small community, which has been whipsawed for days as police initially put down protests in a paramilitary fashion, then vowed cooperation with demonstrators, and are now cracking down again. The demonstrations have racked Ferguson and ignited a national debate about race and justice in African American communities.
With tensions rising, it was unclear how authorities would enforce the midnight-to-5 a.m curfew and whether it would stop the rioting that resumed late Friday, with protesters looting stores and clashing with police wearing riot gear and deploying tear gas.

Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, the Missouri State Highway Patrol commander now in charge of security in Ferguson, said Saturday that the curfew would be enforced through communication, not physical force. “We will be telling people, ‘It’s time to go home,’ ” he said.
As the curfew approached and rain fell, protesters continued to line the streets shouting and chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot.”

A woman stood in the middle of the main avenue with a sign that said “Pray for Peace.” At the Quiktrip, crowds gathered under the awnings, chanting. Police in riot gear stood quietly in front of the doors of businesses.

Several blocks away, hundreds of police waited in the shopping center parking lot, which has become their staging area.

There were signs earlier that the federal civil rights investigation into Brown’s killing is intensifying. Nixon (D) said it is being “beefed up,’’ with additional FBI agents canvassing the area over the next few days. On Saturday, agents were passing out cards encouraging residents to come forward with information about the shooting.

U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had criticized the use of force against demonstrators, and it was unclear Saturday how federal officials — who are also monitoring a state investigation of Brown’s death — would react to Nixon’s curfew.
The anger still coursing through the community was visible at Nixon’s news conference Saturday. The governor said he had signed an executive order imposing the extraordinary measures in an effort to find a balance between the protesters’ First Amendment rights and the community’s safety.

Noting that most protesters on Friday night had been peaceful, Nixon said he “cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the goodwill of the many, while putting the people and businesses of this community in danger.’’

“This is not to silence the people of Ferguson,’’ Nixon said, “but to address those who are drowning out the voice of the people with their actions. We will not allow a handful of looters to endanger the rest of this community.’’

But after his opening remarks, Nixon quickly lost control of the crowd, with the images being recorded for a national television audience.

“You need to charge that police [officer] with murder!’’ one person yelled. Others demanded to know how the curfew would be enforced. “Going to do tear gas again?” someone asked.
When Nixon began answering that “the best way for us to get peace” was for everyone to go home and get a good night’s sleep, another resident interrupted him, shouting: “We don’t need sleep! We need justice!”

The crackdown was triggered by the wild scene on the streets of Ferguson late Friday night and into Saturday morning. In the main stretch of downtown, which had been tranquil the day before, at least four businesses were looted and reporters were threatened by a small group of rioters. Police deployed tear gas and flash grenades, which dispersed many but seemed to further incite the angriest in the crowd.

Yet the renewed protests were apparently triggered by the actions of the authorities, who have been wrestling for days with how to balance public safety with the right of demonstrators to assemble. On Friday, Ferguson police had named Brown as the prime suspect in the robbery of a convenience store that occurred just before the shooting, and they released a video of the robbery. The footage showed someone they identified as Brown towering over the store clerk and menacing the person, images that were circulated nationwide and drew a sharp rebuke from Brown’s family.

The video’s release was criticized by the highway patrol and came over the objections of federal authorities, a law enforcement official told CNN on Saturday. The Justice Department had said that distributing the images would heighten tensions in the community, but Ferguson police released it anyway, the official said.

As has been the case the morning after each night of violence, residents hit the streets Saturday morning to help business owners clean up broken glass and other signs of destruction. Business owners and workers were upset both at the looters and at the highway patrol officers. They said officers did not intervene during the looting and had not offered any help afterward with cleanup or investigating the incidents.

“They said they’re not going to do anything,” said Jay Kanzler, the attorney for the Ferguson Market, a liquor and convenience store that was the site of the robbery allegedly committed by Brown. The store was looted Friday night.
Cpl. Juston Wheetley, a spokesman for the highway patrol, did not directly respond to the allegations but said that at least two officers received minor injuries during the rioting.

“There was a lot of looting. Officers got in an area that was trapped. They were pummeled with rocks and bricks in their cars,” Wheetley said. “We feared for their safety. We sent in backup to remove officers from the situation. Backup arrived on the scene and received bricks. That’s when they deployed tear gas.”

On Saturday, hundreds of protesters again marched down West Florissant Avenue, the main strip in Ferguson, shouting “Hands up, don’t shoot!’’

About a quarter-mile away, a crowd gathered at the site of where Brown’s body lay for hours the previous Saturday. Supporters have created a memorial in the middle of the street, with flowers, posters and candles.

Only 37 percent of whites said they think blacks are treated less fairly by police.

A similar sentiment extends to the courts: 68 percent of black Americans said they believe they are treated less fairly than whites by the courts. Only 27 percent of whites said that, according to Pew.

That massive discrepancy in attitudes has to do, in part, with personal experiences: More than a third of African American respondents told Pew that police had personally treated them unfairly because of race in the past year.

Nixon declares curfew as angry Ferguson crowd demands answers,Colby Itkowitz,08/16/2014,03/11/2016,"A press conference to announce a curfew in Ferguson quickly turned into a shouting match as frustrated protesters voiced their anger that a week after Michael Brown was shot and killed, so many questions remain unanswered.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, announced that he had declared a state of emergency and was implementing a curfew between midnight and 5 a.m. He said the intention was to find a balance between First Amendment rights and the community’s safety.

“… we cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the goodwill of the many, while putting the people and businesses of this community in danger,” Nixon said.

He said the “eyes of the world” were watching Ferguson, and that justice would only prevail if there was peace. “In the morning, this community will rise with the sun to renew its quest for justice.”

But after his opening remarks, Nixon quickly lost control of the crowd.

Someone yelled from the crowd, “You need to charge that police with murder.” Others demanded to know how the curfew would be enforced. “Gonna do tear gas again?” one person asked.

“The best way for us to get peace is for everybody to help to make sure everyone gets home safe tonight and gets a good five hours sleep tonight,” Nixon began, as someone yelled, “We don’t need sleep. We need justice!”

Nixon did not say how long the state of emergency would last. Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, the State Highway Patrol commander who took over security in Ferguson on Thursday, said the curfews would be enforced through communication, not physical force.

“We will be telling people, ‘It’s time to go home,’ ” he said.

Johnson also said FBI agents were advancing its investigation in the neighborhoods and interviewing witnesses. He said they were passing out cards to encourage people to report what they know.

It has also energized groups around the country to come out against what many have called excessive enforcement by some police officers.

The group that gathered Saturday walked in a circle carrying signs urging “justice and equality” and “stop police brutality now” and some taped their mouths shut with American-flag-patterned duct tape. They also called for legislation that would require officers to wear cameras.

The protest was organized by Autumn Colbert, 30, a licensed Maryland social worker who described herself as a “concerned citizen” over the shooting of Michael Brown. The demonstration was not affiliated with any official group.

“I was completely shocked and stunned even though it’s happened before,” Colbert said of the shooting of an unarmed black man. “I had to start organizing.”
Colbert started posting on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram about the protest, where most said they had heard about the event. Colbert added that she wanted to protest in front of the White House “because we need to bring it to the national stage.”

Among the protestors was Porsha Doyle, 27, who carried a poster with a photo of her 1-year-old nephew Christopher and the words “Will he live to go to college?”

“The people of Ferguson deserve a voice,” said Doyle, who grew up in St. Louis. She recalled walking to a friend’s house when she was 19 and being stopped by cops who searched her car after misinterpreting her move to get something in her purse.

“People aren’t just mad for no reason,” she added.

Some of the protestors said they wanted a stronger national response to the Ferguson shooting.

“This shows systemic problems in police forces across the country,” said Adrien Schless-Meier, 24. She cited {President Obama’s}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-addressess-ferguson-mo-turmoil-says-now-is-the-time-for-healing/2014/08/14/3176c004-2399-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html?tid=a_inl""> and {Attorney General Eric Holder’s speeches}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/holder-criticizes-police-response-in-ferguson-says-he-is-deeply-concerned-about-use-of-military-equipment/?tid=a_inl""> mentioning concern over looting before discussing the police’s actions as a source of frustration.
“Looting is such a loaded term,” Schless-Meier said, adding it “perpetuates the idea that black people are criminals.”

But Alexandria resident Victoria Comsa, 60, described the president’s response as “okay.”

“I’m glad he got Eric Holder involved immediately,” she said, as she held a sign over her Obama 2008 shirt.

After the protest, the demonstrators walked to 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, where they introduced themselves to each other and shared hugs. Colbert encouraged them to take the signs home with them.

Michael Brown, an 18-year-old recent high school graduate, and a friend allegedly rob a convenience store for a box of cigars.

Walking with his friend about 10 minutes later, Brown is confronted by police officer Darren Wilson. A confrontation occurs and Wilson shoots Brown multiple times. Brown dies in the middle of the street.
The community outcry begins, and protesters gather in the streets.

Sunday, Aug. 10

Ferguson police begin to provide details about the shooting, saying that Brown was unarmed, but that there had been a physical confrontation.

At night, a candle-light vigil for Brown turns violent as some protesters riot and loot nearby stores. Police arrest 32 people and two officers are injured.

Monday, Aug. 11

FBI announces it will be investigate Brown’s death.

Brown’s parents hold a news conference demanding justice for their son.

Protesters gather again and police use tear gas to disperse the crowd.

Tuesday, Aug. 12

Dorian Johnson, the friend who was with Brown when he was shot, gives an interview to MSNBC and says that Brown did not “touch the officer in any type of a threatening way.” He said in another interview that Wilson had continued to shoot Brown even though Brown had his hands up.

For the third night, protesters and heavily armored police clash.

Wednesday, Aug. 13

In the very early morning, a protester is shot and wounded.

That afternoon, police arrest two reporters, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, at a McDonald’s in Ferguson.

Police in riot gear throw tear gas to clear the crowds as violence in the streets continues for a fourth night.

Thursday, Aug. 14

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon comes to Ferguson. He announces security will be turned over to the Missouri Highway Patrol and that Capt. Ron Johnson, an African-American raised in the community, would be in charge.

President Obama addresses the Ferguson shooting for the first time. He says it’s “time for healing.”

The protests are peaceful on their fifth night as Johnson marches with protesters.
Friday, Aug. 15

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson names Darren Wilson as Brown’s shooter. He also says Brown was a suspect in a robbery the morning he was shot. He releases reports and video surveillance of the robbery.

Hours later, Jackson says the robbery and the shooting were unrelated incidents. He says the confrontation began because Brown and his friend were walking in the street and “blocking traffic.”

Late at night and into the early morning, protests turn violent again as some take to rioting and looting, though many peaceful protesters attempt to stop it. The militarized police return and tear gas is once again used to clear the crowd.

Brown; Wesley Lowery,08/16/2014,03/11/2016,"It took just three minutes.

A speck of time on a snoozy side street, a stretch of asphalt winding through a modest working-class neighborhood of three-story garden apartment buildings that’s easier to find a way into than out of.

There, two lives intersected when a white police officer named Darren Wilson and a black teenager named Michael Brown — one in a patrol car, the other on foot — found themselves together on Canfield Drive in the middle of a summer Saturday.

When they met at 12:01 p.m. on Aug. 9, the two were coming from different places, different mind-sets —Brown filling free hours with a friend, Wilson coming off an emergency call about a 2-month-old baby struggling to breathe.

Brown, barely 18, stood 6-foot-4 and 292 pounds and wore a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap. Wilson, a lanky 28-year-old with short-cropped blond hair who had six months earlier won a commendation for “extraordinary effort in the line of duty,” steered a police cruiser behind him.
At 12:04, Brown was dead, shot multiple times by Wilson. “Big Mike,” as his friends called him, did not have a gun.

The conflicting accounts of those three minutes — the tortured exercise of assigning blame — have provoked intense protests and turned this inner-ring St. Louis suburb into a parable of race, class and justice. There has been no resolution, no definitive account of what happened in that flash of a hot afternoon or of the two men at the center of it.

Police records, public documents and more than a dozen interviews on the streets here and in other St. Louis suburbs are beginning to reveal details of the killing and clarify {points on a timeline}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/16/the-timeline-of-events-and-scenes-in-ferguson-mo-since-the-shooting-of-michael-brown/""> that began with a theft of less than $50 worth of cigars from a convenience store and culminated with Brown’s death.

A key witness — Brown’s friend Dorian Johnson — has told the FBI that he thought the robbery was a “prank,” said Johnson’s attorney. In an interview with federal agents, Johnson has said Brown was hit by one bullet, then — as Brown pleaded for his life — Wilson fired “five or six” more times.
And when the shooting stopped, Johnson and his legal team have told investigators, the police officer who pulled the trigger did nothing to save the man he’d just shot. “The officer doesn’t attempt to resuscitate,” Johnson’s attorney, former St. Louis mayor Freeman Bosley Jr., said in an interview Saturday. “He does not call for medical help. The officer didn’t call it in that someone had been shot.”

Different sides of the line
Both men are now forever entwined with Ferguson, but neither had particularly deep roots here.

Brown was only spending the summer with his grandmother while making plans to attend a vocational school. Wilson was in his fourth year on the police force after working for two years on a force nearby. He lives miles away in a house with a swimming pool in the suburb of Crestwood
On the streets near the home of Brown’s grandmother, neighbor buddies remember him as a “good kid” who posted up under the basket at a Ferguson playground — more bulk and grit on the court than grace. His nickname, “Big Mike,” about summed it up.

“With his size and frame, I always tried to encourage him to do football, but he was too timid, too mild-mannered,” said Duane Finne, a family friend who lives not far from where Brown’s body lay for hours, in the center of the street, after he was shot. “Growing up in a city like this, that’s hard.”

Brown was the kid who was rhyming hip-hop lyrics. “He just loved music, talked about it all the time,” said Cynthia Barnett, a neighborhood fixture whom Brown called “Miss Cynthia.”

Hip-hop represents the hope of escape to another kind of life for many of the kids in this swatch of St. Louis suburbs, a patchwork of 91 municipalities, each with its own identity and mores. The area is frequently referred to as poor, but the reality is more nuanced.

Brown was staying in a scruffy section of Ferguson, where check-cashing stores perch in frayed strip malls, but the city’s downtown has undergone a revival.

And even in the modest $550-a-month apartments where Brown and his friends partied and traded lyrics, the problem often isn’t that the occupants don’t have jobs — it’s that they don’t have good jobs.
His mother, Tonya Harris, died when he was 16. Records show that she had a long history with law enforcement, pleading guilty to numerous counts of forgery and stealing. In 2001, she was sentenced to five years in prison, although she appears to have served most, if not all, of it on probation.

Records indicate that Wilson’s stepfather, Tyler Harris, took guardianship of him in 2003.

Wilson, who was recently divorced, is on paid administrative leave. He has left the suburban home he shares with a woman who also is a police officer, and is staying at an undisclosed location.
“People go to work and they come home,” said Alice Thomas, 51. “People are aspirational. They want something better for their children. Mike Brown’s mother keeps talking about how she wanted him to go to college, even community college. . . . She wanted better for her child.”

The fraught relationship between African Americans, a majority in Ferguson, and the nearly all-white police force long preceded the eruption of protests.

In interview after interview, black men and women talked about their fears of random stops while driving in the city, as well as in neighboring municipalities.

Marcus White, an acquaintance of Brown who works for a moving company, said he frequently has to spend the night in his employer’s office because he can’t find anyone to drive him home to Ferguson.

“They’ll tell me, ‘I don’t go past Goodfellow,’ ” he said, referencing one of the streets near the line that separates the county of St. Louis from the city of the same name.

Many here have their own catalogue of towns that they dare not drive through. They sketch long, circuitous routes to avoid the small areas where they feel most targeted, a concern buttressed by statistics that show far higher numbers of traffic stops involving African Americans than whites in the St. Louis suburbs.

“More than four people in the car, they’re going to pull you over,” said Earl Lee Jr., a 41-year-old warehouse worker who lives in a nearby suburb. “Tint on your windows, they’re going to pull you over. Too early in the morning, they think you’re up to something. Too late, they think you’re up to something. When are you supposed to drive?”

Wilson, the officer whose name was released by police on Friday, six days after the shooting, has been a central if off-stage character in the drama playing out here.

Little is known about him — not even the details of his commendation for extraordinary effort. But public records and interviews with people who knew his family indicate that he came from a troubled home that faced serious financial strain.
The house, where beach towels were hanging on a fence around the swimming pool, is being guarded by police.

Final minutes
Brown did not have traffic-stop problems with police because he apparently didn’t drive. He didn’t have a license, and his learner’s permit expired in September.

He was on foot during the final moments of his life, moments that have been parsed and debated as thousands have gathered in Ferguson each night to protest.

About 10 minutes before his death, surveillance video shows, Brown walked into Ferguson Market & Liquor, a small convenience store half a mile from the spot where he was killed.

In the images, the young man whose family described him as gentle reaches over the counter and roughly yanks out a box of Swisher Sweets cigars.

He is accompanied by his friend, Johnson, a slight 120 pounds and four years older, who has emerged as a key witness. In the footage, Brown fills the screen, thickly built and in long khaki shorts, a white T-shirt and sandals.

Boxes of cigars scatter as Brown appears to argue with a clerk. While Brown scoops the cigar boxes from the floor, the clerk comes out from behind the counter, seemingly trying to block his path and close the door.

Brown shoves the much smaller clerk into a snack display. When the clerk comes back at him, Brown puffs his chest and steps toward the clerk in a show of intimidation. The clerk retreats and Brown leaves, carrying cigars worth $48.99.

Johnson, who has not been charged, has told FBI investigators that he thought his friend was doing “a prank,” Bosley, his attorney, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Saturday.
From there, it was only short hop down West Florissant Avenue, a route that took them past faded strip-mall storefronts, a nail salon, a barbershop, a check-cashing business, a burger joint.

As they turned onto Canfield Drive, they were only blocks from Johnson’s home and the apartment of Brown’s grandmother. They walked in the middle of the street, rather than the sidewalk, hugging the center line.

Wilson drove past them in his patrol car.

He told them, “Get on the f------ sidewalk,” Bosley said Johnson has told him. Johnson protested to Wilson that they were almost home.

The officer put his cruiser in reverse, Bosley said, and pulled up so close that when he opened the door, it bumped Johnson and Brown. “Through the window of his cruiser, he grabs Big Mike by the throat,” Bosley said. “Big Mike tries to move away. The officer grabs his shirt.”

Johnson, who was a student at Lincoln University, saw the officer pull out a gun. “He shoots Big Mike somewhere in the chest or arm,” Bosley said. “Dorian sees blood coming from the chest.”

Johnson took off running and hid behind the first car he saw, Bosley said. “Big Mike runs by him. He says to Dorian, ‘Keep running,’ ” Bosley said. “The officer chases Big Mike. He fires a shot and hits Big Mike in the back. Big Mike turns around. [Brown] puts his hands up. The officer shoots him five or six more times.”

After Brown was shot and on the ground, Bosley said, Wilson did not report the shooting immediately or call for emergency medical help.

There was confusion at the emergency call center in the minutes after the shooting.
{In audio recordings}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html""> released last week and confirmed by authorities as authentic, a St. Louis County police dispatcher indicated that Ferguson police were unaware that an officer was involved in the shooting.

The dispatcher noted that she had received two calls about an “officer-related shooting” on Canfield Drive.

“We just got another call about an officer-involved shooting . . . there,” she said.

A few seconds later, the dispatcher said she couldn’t get confirmation from the police in Ferguson. “We just called Ferguson back again, and they don’t know anything about it,” she said.

A robbery suspect
Law enforcement officials have given fragmented accounts that differ from Johnson’s recollection.

In their telling, Brown was the aggressor.

Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County chief of police, has said that Brown reached for Wilson’s gun and that a shot was fired inside the vehicle. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson ended up with “a swollen face.”

But Jackson has given a series of conflicting accounts of the event.

In a news conference Thursday, he released video surveillance from the convenience store, leading many to think he was implying a connection between the robbery and the shooting.

Later that day, Jackson {reversed himself}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michael-brown-case-police-release-name-of-officer-call-brown-a-robbery-suspect/2014/08/15/38e6fd5c-249f-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html"">, saying there wasn’t a connection between the robbery and Wilson’s confrontation with Brown. Hours later there was a revision:

Jackson said Wilson saw cigars in Brown’s hand and “realized he might be the robber.”

“At no time does the officer say, ‘Hey, did you rob that store?’ or ‘Hey, are you coming from that store?’ ” Bosley said. “None of that.”

Brown’s body lay in the street for hours after the shooting — part of that time uncovered.

A photo that Bosley provided to The Post shows Brown lying on his stomach, his right cheek pressed against the asphalt. A long trail of blood extends from his head.

Barnett, the neighbor, said she watched in horror as Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, pleaded with police who were keeping back the crowd.

“Why y’all got my son out in the street?” Barnett said she recalled hearing McSpadden shout.

According to Barnett, the officers responded: “You can’t see your son. You need to calm yourself down.”

Jackson said he was “uncomfortable” with the length of time Brown’s body lay in the open. But he added that the job of processing the crime scene was delayed by the sound of gunshots ringing out, although it was never determined where those shots came from.

At least two autopsies have been performed on Brown — one by government authorities and second arranged by attorneys for his family, according to attorneys for Brown’s parents.

The family is represented by Benjamin Crump and Darryl Parks — the Florida lawyers who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed teenager whose death at the hands of a neighborhood watch volunteer sparked national outrage in 2012.

Parks declined to discuss the autopsy results.

Business again
The convenience store where the robbery took place was boarded up, but open for business on Friday. A store manager, who declined to give his name, said he fears for his life and pleaded with reporters not to suggest that he called police.

“It’s very dangerous,” he said. “They kill us if they think we are responsible. People don’t understand that.”

Johnson, Brown’s friend, has receded into the background. He is afraid of the police, Bosley said.

“He has no home right now,” Bosley said. “He is moving from place to place for safety reasons. His life is upside-down. He is traumatized.”

At the Canfield Green apartment complex, steps away from a memorial that has swelled in the street where Brown died, a sign reads: “Caution — killer cop on the loose.”

While protesters paused to mourn earlier this week, Wilson’s boss appeared on television to call him a “gentleman.”

Ongoing local and federal investigations — and perhaps, eventually, a judge or jury — may help reconcile the opposing images of those involved and the saga of what happened here. The robbery, the shooting, the three-minute collision of two lives.

For now, there’s only the stilted phrasing of a Ferguson police report about the robbery.

The case, it says, is “exceptionally cleared.”",937,NA,NA,NA

Presidents away from the White House are still very much on the job, as White House aides are always quick to point out. But most of that work takes place behind the scenes.

So this week, the public was greeted with images of a Midwest town in turmoil -- and of Obama playing golf and riding a bike. The president made a statement on Iraq -- and arrived at a golf course just four minutes later, one of six golf outings this week. On Wednesday, as news of more unrest in Ferguson filtered in, Obama was at a friend's birthday party; the White House said he danced ""to nearly every song"" and dined on surf and turf.

The contrast provided fresh grist for {critics}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-obama-vacations-as-the-world-burns/2014/08/11/58755e5e-21a5-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl""> who questioned Obama's ability to project an image of strong leadership in crisis situations -- and marked the latest episode in his long history of star-crossed presidential vacations.

In 2011, Obama was blasted for vacationing here as 14 million people were out of work. He ended up cutting the vacation {short}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/44/post/hurricane-irene-prompts-obama-to-end-marthas-vineyard-vacation-a-day-early/2011/08/26/gIQAjwvOgJ_blog.html?tid=a_inl""> because of a hurricane.

For three years in a row, Obama's Christmas vacation to Hawaii was {delayed}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fiscal-cliff-standoff-threatens-to-delay-another-presidential-family-vacation/2012/12/18/6627ea58-4542-11e2-8061-253bccfc7532_story.html?tid=a_inl""> because of fiscal faceoffs on Capitol Hill. In 2012, he skipped a summer vacation because of the presidential campaign. And earlier this year, Obama was chided for proceeding with a previously planned {weekend}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-will-still-be-president-aides-say--just-in-fla/2014/03/07/1d56ab5a-a614-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html?tid=a_inl""> in Florida, even as the situation in Ukraine escalated.
This week, White House pushed back on critiques of the president's whereabouts during a time of crisis. ""I think it’s fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that's why you’ve seen the president stay engaged,"" Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters.

And if the president didn't appear engaged, it wasn't for lack of trying. Obama addressed the press twice from Martha's Vineyard. His aides put out a stream of readouts summarizing calls he had with world leaders, including one with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and released photos of Obama being briefed by senior officials and speaking to leaders on the phone.

But much of the mechanics that make the White House function on the road remain mostly invisible to the public. “He has all the tools at his disposal no matter where he is, the same functional capabilities he has at his Oval Office desk,” said Steve Atkiss, the deputy director of advance for former President George W. Bush. When the president goes anywhere, be it a day trip or a vacation, “the infrastructure follows him.”
That means Obama travels with a massive staff entourage, and a swarm of communications equipment. On this trip, he is accompanied by National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Deputy Chief of Staff Anita Decker Breckenridge, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and others.

A White House official said Obama has received the daily intelligence briefing in the mornings, and is briefed throughout the day by advisers – sometimes in person, other times on paper, and in other cases over the phone while here on Martha’s Vineyard.

Obama was briefed very late Wednesday night about the situation in Ferguson by Attorney General Eric Holder and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. Concerned about the violence, the president made the decision that night to speak publicly about the issue Thursday, a senior White House official said.

The White House has not revealed exactly how Obama's personal schedule has played out over the past week, be it dinner at home, a day on the beach or a golf outing. It is, however, par for the course for a president or vice president to have his R and R cut short.
So if his vacation hasn't shaped up precisely as planned, Obama can at least look forward to a brief break from his break: he'll return to Washington Sunday night for two days of White House meetings -- then fly back to Martha's Vineyard Tuesday night to give relaxing one last shot.",60,NA,NA,NA

By Michael Doyle

I did not know that Michael Brown. Chances are pretty good you did not either. But the name evokes strong emotions.

His color evokes strong responses.
Ferguson’s description as an “inner-ring suburb” with a “somewhat transient” black population allows readers to quietly judge a town they never knew existed until the past week–ah, but it’s OK, we know that kind of town, and those kind of people.

His size evokes adrenaline.
But you rarely read that Michael Brown was a “large man” without “black” slipped in as well.

Well, the rational abstract mind points out, those are descriptors, nothing more. Yet we hear it over and over again–because it is effective, over and over again.

Every time you read it, your amygdala, the wordless part of your brain, flashes raw fear and anger. We read the news to fire that amygdala, to feel like we’re part of something, to feel like we’re part of anything.
Michael Brown’s killing was a public act by a public official working under the authority of a publicly run department in a public space. Please read that carefully.

If you have been paying attention, you are not surprised.

Eric Garner. 
John Crawford. 
Ezell Ford. 
Dante Parker.

All young black men killed by police in different cities within the last month.
And yet we will act shocked when the next name rolls through our newsfeed.

Those of us who teach in public schools, who earn our living using public dollars, are obligated as civil servants, and more importantly, as human beings, to carry the discussion of what it means to be public. For us to be people.
I teach young adults in a public space. Their space. My space. Our space.
Race has been criminalized in our public spaces.
Has been for a long, long time.
That’s our problem.

I have long lost hope that I can much change private discourse of folks of privilege, though I bark enough that some conversations get shorted when I’m around. But silencing private conversations will not change a damn thing, despite the ooh-goody-goody dopamine dose of self-righteousness you might feel.

Let’s talk about our roles as public teachers in public spaces publicly.
Let’s remind our students (and ourselves) that the public belongs to all of us.
Let’s remember that abstractions, as powerful as they are, are not real.

I’m not looking for a Kumbaya fest. If you’re all about the neurochemical surges of joy, we’ve got Xanax for that. No, it’s time we dug into that amygdala and stare at the beast that makes us who we are.",40,NA,NA,NA

“I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents’ dreams live on in my two precious daughters,” Obama, then an Illinois state senator, said in {his keynote address}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19751-2004Jul27.html?tid=a_inl""> at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. “I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible.”

And yet, from Obama’s {introduction to the national stage}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/24/AR2008082401671.html?tid=a_inl""> that night in Boston to today, as the country’s eyes turn toward the ongoing {racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo.}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/state-of-emergency-declared-in-missouri-amid-renewed-tensions-over-browns-death/2014/08/17/65e9836c-25c9-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html?hpid=z1&tid=a_inl""> , the president’s relationship with the issue of race has been far more complicated — and fraught — than he could have imagined on that night a decade ago. Obama was careful, particularly during his 2008 campaign, not to cast himself as a black man running for president but rather as a man running for president who just happened to be black. (He never used the words “black” or “African American” during {his acceptance speech}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/28/AR2008082804029.html?tid=a_inl""> at the 2008 Democratic convention.)
For Obama, the reality of just how hard it would be to be a post-racial politician hit home in the form of {the Rev. Jeremiah Wright}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/11/AR2010031103926.html?tid=a_inl"">. Wright, a pastor at the church that the Obamas attended in Chicago, became a major issue in early 2008 when some of his controversial remarks came to light. At first, Obama sought to play down both Wright’s comments and his relationship with the preacher. But as the brush fire grew into a five-alarm blaze, Obama responded with what, to my mind, is the {single best speech he has ever given}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/18/AR2008031801081.html?tid=a_inl"">.
“I have brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles and cousins of every race and every hue scattered across three continents, and for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible,” Obama said in that speech, echoing his words from 2004.
The address effectively quelled the Wright controversy — John McCain’s campaign cut an ad featuring Wright but never ran it — and took race, at least as a public-facing issue in the campaign, off the table.

But once Obama became president, his endeavor to defuse racial controversies in the country — either by word or by deed — became significantly more difficult.

In the summer of 2009, Obama was quick to comment on the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates as he attempted to enter his own home, saying that police had “acted stupidly” in the incident. After an outcry from the police community, {Obama backed off of his initial comments}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/24/AR2009072400451.html?tid=a_inl""> and eventually convened the decidedly hokey {“beer summit”}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073003563.html?tid=a_inl""> among Gates, the arresting officer, himself and Vice President Biden.

The Gates episode quite clearly influenced Obama’s approach to other national controversies tied to race. In March 2012, as his reelection bid ramped up, he {briefly addressed the controversy over Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/politics/obama-if-i-had-a-son-hed-look-like-trayvon-153/2012/03/23/gIQAYuOqVS_video.html?tid=a_inl"">, an African American youth who had been fatally shot by a man named George Zimmerman in Florida. “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon,” Obama said, although he was careful not to wade much deeper into the incident — citing a desire not to interfere in the ongoing legal proceedings. It wasn’t until more than a year later, in July 2013, that {Obama addressed Martin’s death}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-on-trayvon-martin-the-first-black-president-speaks-out-first-as-a-black-american/2013/07/20/41f7045c-f154-11e2-bed3-b9b6fe264871_story.html?tid=a_inl""> more fully.

In that speech, Obama spoke candidly from his personal experience: “There are very few African American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.”

On the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager fatally shot more than a week ago in Ferguson, Mo., Obama first issued a paragraph-long statement that read in part:

“I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.”
On Thursday, he delivered {a measured statement}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-speaks-about-shooting-of-michael-brown-in-ferguson-mo/2014/08/14/d49f63ac-23c7-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl""> from Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., urging calm. “I’d like us all to take a step back and think about how we will be moving forward,” he said.

On one level, Obama’s decision to watch and wait on high-profile incidents in which race seems to play a role makes perfect sense. As president — and particularly as the country’s first African American president — his words carry huge weight. He and his team know that and want to do everything they can to help calm situations while allowing those in charge on the local level to do their jobs. At the same time, Obama is caught between a genuine — and much-expressed — desire to use his unique experiences to move the country beyond its divisive racial past and the realities on the ground, which suggest we aren’t in that post-racial America just yet.

In many ways, Obama’s difficulty in navigating matters of race as president mirrors his struggles in other areas. He has repeatedly and eloquently spoken about race — and his experiences in making his way in the world as the son of a white mother and a Kenyan father — over the past decade. But those words have done little to heal the racial wounds in the country. Perhaps it’s too much to expect any one individual, even the president, to help finally close such a deep and long-standing gash on the country’s conscience.

“They kept telling me to get out of the car, but I didn’t want to make any kind of movement,” Hampton, 30, told The Post in a phone interview Sunday.

The officer by his window had a gun pointed at his chest, says Hampton, who provided a copy of his arrest report to the Washington Post. He wanted to make sure the police could see his hands at all times, and he was afraid to reach down for the door lock. Finally, the officer reached in through the open window and opened the door himself.

Hampton’s girlfriend and her friend also were in the car. The three of them had gone to a Justice for Mike Brown march earlier that evening and had returned to Hampton’s aunt’s house, where they decided to take a cigarette break.

Hampton, who owns a T-shirt-printing business, says they discussed just standing in the yard but worried it might look as if they were loitering passersby. So the trio went to his car to smoke, figuring that a private car on a private lawn would not fall under the curfew.

Instead, he says, the police ordered all three of them into the police truck, taking them first to a nearby command post.
“I just kept asking, ‘Why am I being arrested for sitting in my aunt’s driveway?’ ” Hampton says. “They said, ‘Curfew’ — and I said, ‘But I’m sitting at my aunt’s house.’ ”

The police transferred them to another vehicle, Hampton says, and drove them to the county jail, where they were photographed. Ultimately, he says, police told him that he would be released with a pending charge of “failure to disperse,” which confused Hampton. He didn’t know where he was supposed to disperse to, given that he was already on a relative’s private property.

Calls to St. Louis police officials confirmed that seven people had been arrested, but did not yield additional information on Hampton’s arrest.

Hampton grew up in {Berkeley, Mo.,}<hyperlink=""http://www.cityofberkeley.us/""> not far from Ferguson. A few days before Brown was shot, Hampton’s cousin was also shot — a stray bullet while she waited at a bus stop. This is why Hampton was in Ferguson this week: He wanted to be with his family, to check in on a cousin who had been told she might never walk again.

After about five hours, Hampton and his girlfriend were told they could leave, he says. Of the seven who were arrested, five — including Hampton and his friends — had been at the protest march, according to {Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment}<hyperlink=""http://www.organizemo.org/statement_on_7_arrested_last_night_from_the_legal_support_team"">.

Adler,08/17/2014,03/23/2016,"Mark  Steyn is not to everyone’s tastes. (Just as {Michael Mann.}<hyperlink=""http://volokh.com/2012/08/22/mann-v-steyn/"">)  But I suspect many who otherwise dislike Steyn’s work will find much with which they agree in his latest: {“Cigars, But Not Close.”}<hyperlink=""http://www.steynonline.com/6524/cigars-but-not-close""> Here’s a taste:

The most basic problem is that we will never know for certain what happened. Why? Because the Ferguson cruiser did not have a camera recording the incident. That’s simply not credible. “Law” “enforcement” in Ferguson apparently has at its disposal tear gas, riot gear, armored vehicles and machine guns …but not a dashcam. That’s ridiculous. I remember a few years ago when my one-man police department in New Hampshire purchased a camera for its cruiser. It’s about as cheap and basic a police expense as there is. . . . In 2014, when a police cruiser doesn’t have a camera, it’s a conscious choice. And it should be regarded as such.

And, if we have to have federal subsidy programs for municipal police departments, we should scrap the one that gives them the second-hand military hardware from Tikrit and Kandahar and replace it with one that ensures every patrol car has a camera.

It’s not just the lack of dashcams, which serve both to document potential police abuses as well as to protect police officers from false accusations.  It’s also how too many police forces relate to their communities, which can be a problem even in the absence of racial disparities.

when the police are dressed like combat troops, it’s not a fashion faux pas, it’s a fundamental misunderstanding of who they are. Forget the armored vehicles with the gun turrets, forget the faceless, helmeted, anonymous Robocops, and just listen to how these “policemen” talk. Look at the video as they’re arresting the New York Times [sic] and Huffington Post reporters. Watch the St Louis County deputy ordering everyone to leave, and then adding: “This is not up for discussion.”

Really? You’re a constable. You may be carrying on like the military commander of an occupying army faced with a rabble of revolting natives, but in the end you’re a constable. And the fact that you and your colleagues in that McDonald’s are comfortable speaking to your fellow citizens like this is part of the problem. The most important of the “nine principles of good policing” (formulated by the first two commissioners of the Metropolitan Police in 1829 and thereafter issued to every officer joining the force) is a very simple one: The police are the public and the public are the police. Not in Ferguson. Long before the teargassing begins and the bullets start flying, the way these guys talk is the first indication of how the remorseless militarization has corroded the soul of American policing.
Which brings us back to the death of Michael Brown. Let’s assume for the sake of argument that everything the police say about this incident is correct. In that case, whether or not the fatal shooting of Mr Brown is a crime, it’s certainly a mistake. When an unarmed shoplifter in T-shirt and shorts with a five-buck cigar box in one hand has to be shot dead, you’re doing it wrong.

And it’s not just in Ferguson. As Steyn noted in {another column}<hyperlink=""http://www.steynonline.com/6329/the-warning-shot-heard-round-the-world-but-not""> a few months back: “in America 120,000 or so full-time law enforcement officers rack up the same number of homicides as about 24 million Canadians.”",66,NA,NA,NA

“Two hands raised in the air is a classic gesture of surrender to authority,” Lauren Williams wrote on the {Vox}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/""> last week. But protesters “have turned it into a defiant symbol and a rallying cry,” she said.
No, it is what it is: a sign of surrender, another instance of using symbols instead of doing the substantive work required for African Americans to protect themselves — especially when living among hateful people.

In many predominantly black communities, of which {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/16/the-timeline-of-events-and-scenes-in-ferguson-mo-since-the-shooting-of-michael-brown/?tid=a_inl""> is typical, that work involves community organizing, voter education and creating schools that help students understand what it means to be black in a country founded on a belief in white supremacy.

“We think it’s about a system,” Kenny Wiley, organizer of a protest in Denver, told the city’s CBS affiliate last week. “We just feel like the system of racism and inequality is such a problem, pervasively, that black people and people of color are seen as criminal before they do anything.”

True, except that the “system” was not set up just to make whites view blacks as criminal; it was to make blacks see themselves as inferior. The problem may not be of black people’s making, but — unfairly or not — it is ours to solve.

And hand signs won’t be enough, unless you think that plaintive looks and chants will shame police into showing more respect.

{Nearly two-thirds}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl""> of Ferguson’s 21,100 residents are black. Black residents outvoted whites during the 2012 presidential election, when President Obama was on the ticket. But too many stayed home for municipal elections, and now they are stuck with a police force that is 94 percent white and hostile to them.

There is a way to fix that. But it’s not by holding hands up.
Look what happened to the hoodie, another “symbol of defiance” that emerged after the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012. Wearing hooded jackets turned out to be less a show of solidarity with Martin than a fashion show of selfies on social media.

In the two years since, there has been no justice for Martin, only additional tweets. And with the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson on Aug. 9, another Twitter campaign has begun.

A much “favorited” protest photograph, which can be {viewed on Vox ,}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/5998591/hands-up-dont-shoot-photos-ferguson-michael-brown""> shows two solemn if not bewildered-looking black toddlers holding cardboard placards that read “Don’t shoot.”

Why put such soul-scarring signage in a baby’s hands? The next thing you know, they’ll be running and hiding every time they see a police officer. That’s not the kind of thinking you want to instill in a black child.

Megan Sims, a junior at Howard University, took a striking photograph of her school mates, a large group of them tightly packed into an auditorium-size room, hands up. But the looks on many of their faces was more of despair than defiance. Some of the upperclassmen had been helping incoming freshmen get settled into their rooms before breaking for the photo op, and I hope they went back to performing those good deeds.

Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, has double-digit poverty and unemployment rates that mirror the rest of black America. The needs are essentially the same all over. Help from the Missouri ACLU was certainly welcomed in Ferguson, but other groups in the St. Louis area could also make a difference.

AmericaSCORES St. Louis, for instance, helps youngsters become more confident in their intellectual abilities and develop the character needed to make good choices, no matter how hard. And Keystone of St. Louis, an organization made up of “community-conscious young professionals” who raise money for worthy causes while hosting happy hours and other social events. Put your hands in the air and “party with a purpose,” they say.

Come to think of it, the Washington area could use more community-conscious young professionals, too.
As for the shooting death of Brown, justice delayed will certainly be justice denied. And so far, no amount of chanting has caused the FBI to be any more forthcoming than the Ferguson police.

Concern about injustice was poignantly conveyed in a photograph that showed five black men on their knees, backs turned and hands up. The hashtag was #DontShoot, followed by “because we have young life to support.”

Point taken.

They said they had empathy for the family of the teenager the officer killed. But they also said they feared that they might be attacked by rioters at their church, because Southminster Presbyterian sits right behind the suburban home of Wilson, the patrolman identified in the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael Brown, a black teenager who was unarmed.

The Rev. Kurt J. Calkins wanted to be a part of that conversation. He wanted to help people feel safe. He had even readied the church’s gym and multi-purpose room — the Christian Life Center — in case evacuations were needed.
“Everyone is worried. It’s best to be vigilant,” he said. “But we also have to have faith, we have to be good Christians and pray that things will be okay.”

Nearly 20 miles north in Ferguson, the site of the shooting and ensuing civil unrest, the congregation at Greater St. Mark Family Church didn’t speak of fear, but of mourning and their prayers for Brown’s family.

“I feel for the family,” said Linell Green, 44, a business analyst who lives in Bellefontaine. “It’s a shame they’ve not been able to funeralize their son. The family hasn’t had access to the body because of different autopsies.” The church had been the first to open its doors to the family.

Sunday in St. Louis can be a stark example of one of the oldest truths of faith and divided communities — that it is possible to send up the same prayers while seeking different answers.

The Rev. Al Sharpton arrived to cheering and told the congregation that the country, the state and the city were at a defining moment in terms of how policing is carried out.

Sharpton said he was appalled by the release of the videotape showing what police alleged to be Brown shoplifting at a local store.

“In all my years, never have I seen something as offensive and insulting as a police chief releasing a tape of a young man, trying to smear him before his own funeral,” Sharpton said. “If that is the young man? That is not robbery. It’s shoplifting. Call it what it is.”

Three gospel “praise dancers” in white danced as the church prayed fervently for Ferguson.

“God, we ask you to dispatch your prayer angels all over Ferguson,” said Topaz Bryant, 17, a volunteer with Sharpton’s National Action Network. She had traveled from Atlanta to join peaceful protests. “Even though we don’t understand, God, we thank you for dispatching peace right now.”

Green said she’s concerned about the future race relations in the country. “It’s not just black or white,” she said. “Will there ever come a day when we can really be united?”

Inside Southminster Presbyterian Church, there were voices of frustration over Sharpton coming to town.

“He is just going to make things worse, it’s lighting the place on fire,” said Lee Howard, 23, who came to church with her mother.

Outside, after a sermon about the power of faith and prayer, Howard and a few other friends said they also were angry.

“Why is race such an excuse to be mad about everything,” she said, adding, “People are complaining there is not enough diversity on the police force. But they don’t like the police anyway.

Many white congregants interviewed spoke of high crime in black communities and said they wished it were different.

Gail Lee, 51, said she wouldn’t be making any late-night trips.

“No white people want to drive north of [Highway] 40 or 70” because of black neighborhoods they would pass through. She added that there were a lot of wonderful black families and that no one wanted looters around.

Jacob Sampson, who came to church with his wife and two children, said he was also praying for Wilson.

“He’s just a regular guy who plays with his kids when I see him around,” he said. “I just wish the response had not been rioting.”

Their pastor said he was reaching out to other African American churches and expressing his sorrow.

“I tell everyone we just have to trust God and pray for peace,” he said, although he added, “These are tough times, and I worry what’s happened — the shooting and riots — will affect people here for a long time.”
At Greater St. Mark, state Attorney General Chris Koster had come to talk about the future, and to pray and grieve with the congregation.

“You have lost a member of your community, but it is much more than that,” Koster said from the pulpit. “I come not just as a member of the Caucasian community but as a member of the law enforcement community. What happened is painful for every goodhearted person in this city.”

Koster told the congregation that the community is not a stranger to violence.

“More than 100 African Americans lose their lives every year,” he said. “That is one every three days.”

He said he feared that the divide in Ferguson would only grow as a result of the shooting.

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. issued a terse statement ordering an independent autopsy of Michael Brown by a federal medical examiner — the third autopsy of the 18-year-old. The Justice Department took the action in response to what spokesman Brian Fallon called “the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case” and requests from Brown’s family. Brown was killed Aug. 9 by a white police officer, Darren Wilson.

On Sunday evening, crowds angered by the incident and its aftermath gathered again. Police said protesters fired at least 30 gunshots and threw Molotov cocktails at officers. Police blocked off Ferguson’s main avenue, and hundreds of officers in riot gear advanced on the crowd and began firing tear gas. Some of the demonstrators, covering their faces with scarves and napkins, tossed the tear gas canisters back at police, who included officers from the city of St. Louis, the county and the State Highway Patrol. Protesters began looting Papa John’s and Imo’s pizzerias.
The air was thick with smoke, and people could be heard shouting, “Hard to breathe!”

Natasha Cornell, 42, who lives two blocks from the scene, said she was furious.
“Half of these protesters are not even from this area,” she said. “We don’t have too many stores to go to anymore because they burned it all up. My 20-year-old son ran all the way home from work. He was terrified. It’s not a race issue at this point, people just want to vent and loot.”

By 10:30 p.m., about 20 ambulances were standing by and helicopters were circling overhead. Police were pointing guns at protesters, who were running and screaming, “Help! Help!” Police said that at least one person was injured.

A police officer said: “It’s so unsafe here. People are shooting at each other, bullets are flying, and police are on high alert.”
Richard Eckhard, a spokesman for the St. Louis County police, said: “It’s an active scene. A fluid scene. Obviously, from what you are seeing, we are on high alert and information is still coming.”

An employee at a McDonald’s restaurant near the scene said: “People went crazy. They were trying to get into the McDonald’s because they were tear-gassed. It was some crazy stuff at the restaurant.”

About 11:15 p.m., West Florissant Avenue, the street where Brown took some of his final steps, began to clear.

Sunday morning, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D), following a chaotic night marked by gun violence, stood behind his decision to order a ­midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew, saying on CNN’s “State of the Union”: “Last night’s curfew — I think everybody worked well. We’re always disappointed when things aren’t perfect. But thousands of people spoke last night, thousands of people marched, and [there was] not a single gunshot fired by a member of law enforcement last night.”
Capt. Ronald Johnson of the {Missouri Highway Patrol}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-speaks-about-shooting-of-michael-brown-in-ferguson-mo/2014/08/14/d49f63ac-23c7-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?tid=a_inl"">, who is overseeing security in Ferguson and had at one point mingled with protesters, took a new tack on Sunday afternoon, calling the police response “proper” and saying he was “disappointed” in the actions of the demonstrators.

At a rally Sunday at Greater Grace Church in Ferguson, Michael Brown Sr. wore a T-shirt that said “No Justice No Peace.” It had a photo of his son as a baby on the front. The church was packed to overflowing, and cars were lined up outside for more than a mile.

Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing the family, said that Michael Brown’s parents did not want to speak.

“It is just a heavy heart they’ve been dealing with,” he said. “Nobody volunteers this position. Nobody wakes up and says, ‘I want to be the mother of a child executed in broad daylight.’ No matter how they try to distract us, we know there was an execution.”

A man who identified himself as a family member said that Brown “was a son and uncle and nephew. He was not alone, but that is how he was killed. This was the last act our family member made before he was put to rest.
“This,” he added, putting his hands up in the air, “this will be stuck in our family’s memories for all our lives.”

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who attended the rally, said the family is calling for the federal government to take over the case, “because if you look at what the police chief did, how can you trust the local authorities?”

He told the crowd that the investigation will be a defining moment in the country’s justice system.

“In all my life, I’ve never seen anything more despicable than the police chief releasing a tape to disparage Michael Brown’s name while his mother is still weeping,” Sharpton said, referring to a convenience store security tape that police said showed Brown stealing cigars.

“This young man hadn’t even been buried. Then they come out and say [the incident] had nothing to do with the shooting. Then why did you put it out? I saw the tape of a young man who might be shoplifting. There’s a difference between robbing and shoplifting. This issue is not whether he shoplifted. The issue is about a young man with no due process who was shot multiple times.”

About 50 white demonstrators gathered Sunday night in downtown St. Louis near Busch Stadium wearing blue shirts, with police emblems, that said “I stand by you, Darren Wilson.”

Some said they were friends of the officer. They held signs that said, “Honk if you support Wilson.”

Some drivers, including some African Americans, honked. Others booed or raised a middle finger.

Todd Brayfield, who works in pipe repair, said he came out to support all police officers.

“We need to support police,” he said. “We don’t know the whole story, and we shouldn’t call [Wilson] a murderer.”
Brayfield said he is upset about the rioting. But he added: “I’m not on that side [of town], so I don’t know what it’s like. But I know we don’t have all the facts yet.”

Three female police officers on bicycles stood by during the gathering, which remained peaceful and lasted just over an hour.

In Washington, the White House said President Obama was briefed Sunday morning on the events in Ferguson and was scheduled to receive another briefing Monday morning from the attorney general.
The federal investigation of Brown’s death will take into account the autopsy performed by state medical examiners, in addition to the procedure ordered by Holder, Justice Department officials said. According to federal law enforcement officials, Brown’s family also paid for an autopsy by Michael Baden, a medical examiner who was featured in the HBO show “Autopsy.” Baden has consulted on investigations relating to the deaths of civil rights leader Medgar Evers and actor John Belushi.

Baden’s autopsy found that Brown was shot at least six times — twice in the head — and that all of the bullets struck him in the front, the New York Times reported late Sunday. The bullets did not appear to have been fired from close range because no gunpowder was found on Brown’s body, the newspaper reported. Dorian Johnson, a friend who was with Brown and ran from the scene during the shooting, has said through an attorney that Brown was shot in the back.

Holder’s autopsy announcement was the latest signal that the federal civil rights investigation of Brown’s death is escalating. Dozens of FBI agents are going door to door in Ferguson to interview anybody with information about the shooting.

The federal probe is running parallel to the state investigation, and federal officials said last week that they were deferring, for now, to state officials.

The new developments came after a Saturday night in Ferguson that ended with a shooting victim, seven arrests and a heavy early morning rain that finally helped clear the streets.

Johnson said early Sunday that a large force was deployed amid the curfew and protests after police received a report that an unknown assailant had shot a person.

Officers had learned through intelligence sources that a group of armed protesters was holed up in a barbecue restaurant. He said that by the time police arrived, the shooting victim, whom Johnson did not identify, had been taken to a hospital by protesters. The victim was in critical condition, he said.

Tear gas was fired, he said, after officers spotted a man with a handgun in the middle of the street. The man with the gun fled, and officers did not arrest any armed protesters. However, seven people were arrested and charged with “failure to disperse,” he said.

A shot was fired at a police car, Johnson said, though it was unclear whether the vehicle was hit.
When the five-hour curfew ended Sunday at 5 a.m., the streets were quiet. But less than an hour after the curfew had begun, police were battling protesters in the streets where Brown was killed.

Hundreds of protesters stood in the middle of Ferguson’s main avenue under heavy rain early Sunday, minutes after the curfew went into effect at midnight. The crowd chanted, “No justice, no curfew!” and “Hands up, don’t shoot!”

At 12:41 a.m., police shouted over a loudspeaker: “You are violating a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse or you will be subject to arrest or other actions.”

Some in the crowd left. Others shouted expletives at the police.

Then came disorder.

At 12:49 a.m., police fired tear gas canisters and devices that produced smoke. Protesters ran. Some were handcuffed. Shots were fired. Police sirens wailed. By 1:30 a.m., a plume of smoke rose over West Florissant Avenue. The smell of smoke was in the air. Explosions erupted every 10 minutes or so — more canisters that made loud bangs.

Police in riot gear blocked the entrance to the main road. They held shields, pointed rifles and shouted for people to clear the road. Many dispersed. By 2:45 a.m., the police had turned much of Ferguson into a ghost town. A heavy downpour puddled on streets emptied of inhabitants. Two officers ran down West Florissant, shedding gas masks without breaking stride. The flashing lights of dozens of police vehicles reflected off the rain-slicked pavement.

“This is not our community!” an onlooker said. She made a peace sign with her right hand, then talked of “revolution.” She wouldn’t give her name.

The confrontation early Sunday followed Nixon’s declaration on Saturday of a state of emergency and the overnight curfew. In a heated news conference, the governor told a group of shouting residents that order must be restored after days of protests.

Yet the renewed protests were apparently triggered by the actions of the authorities, who have been wrestling for days with how to balance public safety with the right of demonstrators to assemble. On Friday, Ferguson police had named Brown as the {prime suspect in the robbery of a convenience store}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-releasing-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown/?tid=a_inl""> that occurred just before the shooting, and they released a video of the robbery. The footage showed someone they identified as Brown towering over and menacing a store clerk. The images were circulated nationwide and drew a sharp rebuke from Brown’s family.",4410,NA,NA,NA

Moyer,08/18/2014,03/23/2016,"Michael Brown, the 18-year-old killed by police in Ferguson, Mo., on Aug. 9, was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, {the New York Times reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?_r=0"">.
The findings came Sunday after a preliminary private autopsy, the second performed on Brown, by Michael M. Baden, former chief medical officer for the state of New York, at the request of the Brown family. The first autopsy was performed by the St. Louis County Medical Examiner’s office.

“There were at least six entry wounds, there might have been seven, but we’ll have to correlate that with what was found in the first autopsy,” Baden, who retired from the New York state police in 2011, told {the Wall Street Journal}<hyperlink=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/crowds-thin-in-ferguson-as-midnight-curfew-starts-1408253833"">.
He cautioned against drawing conclusions from the autopsy. “Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting,” he told the Times, but added: “In my capacity as the forensic examiner for the New York State Police, I would say, ‘You’re not supposed to shoot so many times.'”

He also told the Times about Brown’s head wounds.

“This one here looks like his head was bent downward,” he said, indicating a wound at the top of Brown’s head. “It can be because he’s giving up, or because he’s charging forward at the officer.”

Baden, 80, a veteran medical examiner who has performed 20,000 autopsies, reviewed the autopsies of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. and hosted the HBO show “Autopsy,” said the bullets hit Brown in the front, but the absence of gunpowder showed they were not fired at close range. Baden also said nothing indicated Brown had been in an altercation. This seems to contradict the statements of Brown’s friend, {Dorian Johnson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-browns-friend-he-was-shot-animal-officer-n179501""> who said the officer now identified as Darren Wilson grabbed Brown’s neck with one hand and shot him with the other.

“It was definitely like being shot like an animal,” Johnson said, according to NBC.
A lawyer for the Brown family said the autopsy results support the claim that the killing was unjustified.

“The sheer number of bullets and the way they were scattered all over his body showed this police officer had a brazen disregard for the very people he was supposed to protect in that community,” Benjamin L. Crump, a lawyer for the Brown family who hired Baden, told the Times. “We want to make sure people understand what this case is about: This case is about a police officer executing a young unarmed man in broad daylight.”

Crump paid for Baden’s travel expenses, but Baden did not charge for the autopsy.

A police official identifying himself as Captain Todd approached Hussein after the confrontation, telling him to ""calm down"" and asking him to keep the light off. ""I promise you I will keep this light off, but I am a member of the media,"" Hussein responded.

Hussein requested the name of the officer who apparently threatened him, but did not seem to get it. Later in the livestream, he noted he did receive Todd's card and would be following up for the name of the officer in the morning.

“I’m going to obey the curfew,” Orie Hood of St. Louis {told NPR’s}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/17/341082635/more-violence-arrests-in-ferguson-but-most-respect-curfew""> Cheryl Corley. “I can’t fight them.

Ferguson isn’t the first — curfews have long been a tool used by authorities in times of racial tension. A few examples:

Thirty-four people died before order was restored on Aug. 17. “Throughout the crisis, public officials advanced the argument that the riot was the work outside agitators; however, an official investigation, prompted by Gov. Pat Brown, found that the riot was a result of the Watts community’s longstanding grievances and growing discontentment with high unemployment rates, substandard housing, and inadequate schools,” {according to the Civil Rights Digital Library.}<hyperlink=""http://crdl.usg.edu/events/watts_riots/?Welcome""> “Despite the reported findings of the gubernatorial commission, following the riot, city leaders and state officials failed to implement measures to improve the social and economic conditions of African Americans living in the Watts neighborhood.”

Perhaps one of the things Johnson might have insisted upon is the release of Ferguson Police Report #2014-12391 and St. Louis County Police Report #2014-43984. We know they exist because the officer who submitted the after-the-fact police report on the alleged convenience store theft by Brown ({pictured above}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/500279501369397248/photo/1"">) wrote, “It is worth mentioning that this incident is related to another incident detailed” by those Ferguson and St. Louis County police reports. “In that incident,” he writes, “Brown was fatally wounded involving an officer of this department.”

That those two documents have not been released more than a week after the shooting shows the level of contempt the Ferguson police department — and the St. Louis County police department for that matter — has for everyone demanding answers. Combine this with the refusal to release the results of the initial autopsy done by the state and you can understand why Attorney General Eric Holder announced on Sunday a second, independent examination of Brown’s body.

WashingtonPost,wapo174,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/18/is-segregation-the-problem-in-ferguson/,Is segregation the problem in Ferguson?,Jonathan Rodden,08/18/2014,03/24/2016,"Over the last few days, punditry about Ferguson, Mo., has converged on a common, well-rehearsed {narrative}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/11/why-riots-erupted-in-one-of-the-most-segregated-metro-regions-in-the-country/""> about segregation in St. Louis that goes back to the 19th century: whites will do {whatever it takes}<hyperlink=""http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/08/14/3471237/ferguson-housing-segregation/""> to prevent blacks from moving into their neighborhoods, including redlining, restrictive covenants, large-lot zoning, intimidation and violence. When these ultimately fail, whites build new interstates and move en masse to the next ring of undeveloped farmland, leaving behind destitute neighborhoods with no investment or opportunity.

According to this narrative, the shocking lack of diversity in the Ferguson city leadership and the violence and rage of recent days are merely the most recent crops harvested from the old seeds of segregation. This narrative is depressing in large part because it suggests no real reform agenda. It implies that African Americans of North St. Louis County can take over the local government and police force only when the last remaining whites die or move to St. Charles County and the cycle of disinvestment is complete. The rest of us can only shake our heads in righteous indignation.

This narrative is wrong in several crucial respects. For starters, while St. Louis is indeed among the {most segregated metropolitan regions}<hyperlink=""http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Data/Report/report2.pdf""> in the United States, Ferguson and some of its North County neighbors are among the most racially integrated municipalities in Missouri and well beyond.
The first map below uses data from the 2010 Census to place Ferguson in the larger context of the racial segregation of St. Louis. While most of the region is completely segregated, note that Ferguson is part of a patch of integrated inner suburbs in North St. Louis County.
The second map zooms in on this region, and the third map shows Ferguson in fine detail. In the southeastern appendage of Ferguson, there is a dense, overwhelmingly black apartment complex where Michael Brown was killed. However, the rest of the city is, by the standards of American suburbia, striking in its level of racial integration. Ferguson and the proximate sections of Florissant and Hazelwood are composed of modest single-family houses on streets where blacks and whites live side by side.
A graph of race and segregation in St. Louis County helps place Ferguson in context. The horizontal axis represents the African American population share, and the vertical axis captures the extent of residential segregation by plotting an {index of dissimilarity}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_dissimilarity""> calculated from block-level racial data. It can be understood as the percentage of a racial group that would have to move to a different block in order to achieve a distribution that matches the entire municipality. The size of each bubble corresponds to the size of the municipality’s population.

While most of St. Louis County’s residents live in municipalities that are either homogeneous or internally segregated or both, Ferguson and its North County neighbors stand out for their relative heterogeneity and internal desegregation. Moreover, the income gap between blacks and whites is smaller in these municipalities than elsewhere.
Lost in the tale of woe about Ferguson is that while the entry point was often cheap multi-family housing such as Canfield Green, many blacks came from North St. Louis City for single-family houses, better schools and lower crime. While there are pockets of poverty and Section 8 renters that dominate the media reports, there is also a resilient black middle class, though it has been hit hard by the great recession. While a large number of whites departed for homogeneous St. Charles County over the last 40 years, many have stayed.

Racial segregation is {declining rapidly}<hyperlink=""http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/end-segregated-century-racial-separation-americas-neighborhoods-1890-2010-5848.html""> in the United States, and North St. Louis County is ground zero. For those who see {value in the preservation of sustainable multiracial neighborhoods,}<hyperlink=""https://www.law.umn.edu/uploads/e0/65/e065d82a1c1da0bfef7d86172ec5391e/Diverse_Suburbs_FINAL.pdf""> the low-slung middle-class suburban houses of Ferguson and Florissant might be as good as it gets in the United States.

The immediate problem in Ferguson is neither residential segregation nor its demise. Rather, as many have pointed out, it is that the racial integration of the community has not been reflected in the municipal government and police force, whose racial composition still reflects the status quo of the 1980s.

In fact, the problem is even worse in some of the communities surrounding Ferguson. For instance, Black Jack and Jennings are over 80 percent African American, with white mayors and evenly divided city councils. Hazelwood and Florissant have all-white city councils in spite of black populations of around 30 percent. Six out of seven members of the board of the overwhelmingly black Ferguson-Florissant School district are white.

This problem of asymmetric representation can be fixed, but it will require mobilization around a specific reform agenda. As explored in an earlier {post}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/15/how-ferguson-exposes-the-racial-bias-in-local-elections/"">, this asymmetry in political power can be explained in part by low African American turnout associated with low-profile April elections in odd-numbered years.
{Recent research}<hyperlink=""http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo16956602.html""> by political scientists has shown that small but well-organized interest groups, such as unionized teachers and municipal workers, benefit handsomely from low-turnout off-cycle elections. Historically, {off-cycle elections}<hyperlink=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00327.x/abstract;jsessionid=64925AB95613B12769EFA5EE0AEC32C5.f04t04?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false""> have been a favored strategy of established ethnic groups in American cities who wished to keep immigrants and minorities out of power. In North St. Louis County, the most organized groups are white homeowners who have been in the same neighborhood since the 1970s, along with police officers and municipal employees who benefit from the status quo, and they have been able to dominate local elections.
Let us not learn the wrong lessons from recent events in Missouri. By no means does Ferguson prove the defeatist claim that blacks and whites cannot live together in peace as the {inner suburbs transform}<hyperlink=""https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/ferguson-segregation-suburbs-white-flight-mike-brown"">. Those of us who grew up in the integrated Ferguson-Florissant area in recent decades know otherwise. It is not a post-racial paradise, but it is a functioning multiracial community. What we are seeing in Ferguson is not merely the latest manifestation of the age-old problem of segregation and housing discrimination. Rather, it is evidence that the best hope for a solution – -the creation of integrated middle-class neighborhoods such as Ferguson — cannot work without political inclusion and accountability.

Hopefully, the legacy of August 2014 will be the genesis of mobilization among a new crop of community leaders and candidates for local office in conjunction with a movement aimed at consolidating elections in order to make governments and police squads more reflective of the increasingly diverse suburban communities they serve.",76,NA,NA,NA

Earlier Sunday evening, police said protesters fired at least 30 gunshots and threw molotov cocktails at officers. Police blocked off Ferguson’s main avenue, and hundreds of officers in riot gear advanced on the crowd and began firing tear gas. Some of the demonstrators, covering their faces with scarves and napkins, tossed the tear gas canisters back at police, who included officers from the city of St. Louis, the county and the State Highway Patrol. Protesters began looting Papa John’s and Imo’s pizzerias.

But what if the White House can build a coalition behind coming actions that would allow Dems to portray them as an effort to solve problems for multiple constituencies, including GOP-aligned ones?

The other day, I {reported}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/07/30/sticking-it-to-the-gop-on-deportations/?tid=a_inl"">  that Dems were eying the possibility of enlisting business, agricultural, and tech interests who might want changes to the visa system as part of whatever Obama proposes. These changes could be accomplished administratively, along with action on deportations.

Today Politico {reports that discussions are underway over broadening the executive actions to win over those interests}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/white-house-immigration-110092"">:
Earlier this month, senior aides from the White House counsel’s office, office of public engagement and the office of science and technology policy, among others, huddled with more than a dozen business groups and company officials to discuss potential immigration policy changes they could make. Smaller meetings with the White House and Department of Homeland Security aides have continued throughout the month. Administration officials are expected to present Obama with recommendations by the end of August.

Representatives from Oracle, Cisco, Fwd.US, Microsoft, Accenture, Compete America and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce were among those present at a wide-ranging Aug. 1 session that went through a list of asks for the tech sector that would involve rulemaking….

The ideas under discussion for executive action include allowing spouses of workers with high-tech visas to work, recapturing green cards that go unused and making technical changes for dual-purpose visa applications. Agriculture industry representatives have also been included in the meetings, discussing tweaks in the existing agriculture worker program. The administration is also considering provisions for low-skilled workers for industries, like construction, that would allow individuals with temporary work authorization to gain work permits.

These talks may merely represent “listening sessions,” as opposed to serious efforts to develop a real menu of changes and build a coalition behind them. The White House may very well decide such a move is impractical.

But it’s being discussed. And as people who hope for such an effort have told me, this could shift the political battle: Rather than making this only about helping illegal immigrants, it would become about fixing our broken immigration system for the good of business and the economy. Dems could argue Obama’s executive action is the result of a House GOP that is so in the grip of extreme elements within the party that it was unable to act on a problem even center-right constituencies want solved.

“The best case scenario would be to have Steve King and Louis Gohmert calling for impeachment, while voices on the constructive center right are saying this is the right thing to do for the economy,” one source tells me.

Of course, there’s also good reason for skepticism that this will come together. It would require GOP-aligned groups such as the business community and agricultural interests to align themselves with Obummer Lawlessness and against Republicans. And remember, groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have long talked a good game about immigration {but ultimately have backed Republican candidates who are hostile to reform}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/06/25/morning-plum-the-tea-party-is-winning/?tid=a_inl"">, presumably because the GOP is good on other priorities that are more important to them, such as low taxes and minimal regulations.

The patten is a familiar one: As the piece notes, a combination of municipal policy and white flight have left behind a largely black population governed by a “white power structure.”

Another one of the culprits has been horribly low turnout in recent elections. As one local official puts it, blacks have not been engaged enough in local politics: “I’m hoping that this is what it takes to get the pendulum to swing the other way.”

Hiring has picked up steam in areas such as construction, manufacturing and professional services in recent months — sectors with a median hourly wage of at least $20. Nearly 40 percent of the jobs created over the past six months have been in high-wage industries, compared with just a quarter during the last half of 2013, according to an analysis by the National Employment Law Project for The Washington Post. Meanwhile, growth in many low-paying jobs has leveled off or even declined.

It’s another sign the recovery could be poised to accelerate, though we’ve certainly heard that numerous times before.

1. Top story: Behind the Ferguson protests, the social and economic context, shaped by race

What happened overnight. ""Capt. Ronald Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol said the evening began with peaceful protests that 'took a very different turn after dark' as police deployed tear gas when protesters threw molotov cocktails and gunshots were fired at officers. Two people were injured in shootings, he said, but no officers were hurt. He said seven or eight people were arrested."" DeNeen L.

Preliminary autopsy: Brown hit six times, including twice in the head. ""The bullets did not appear to have been shot from very close range because no gunpowder was present on his body. However, that determination could change if it turns out that there is gunshot residue on Mr. Brown’s clothing, to which Dr. Baden did not have access. Attorney General Eric H.

Mounting racial and economic stress in areas near Ferguson. ""The police shooting of Michael Brown was the spark. But the tinder fueling the anger and resentment that has exploded in Ferguson has been building for decades. The town has seen many middle-class homeowners who eagerly moved to St. Louis' northern suburbs after World War II to buy brick ranch homes with nice yards leave in later years, replaced by poorer newcomers. Good blue-collar jobs have grown scarce; the factories that once sprouted here have closed shop. Schools have struggled. And local governments — slow to evolve — often now look little like the people they represent. For the African American community, it creates a sense of lost opportunity in a place much like other aging suburbs in the Rust Belt and across the country."" Tim Logan and Molly Hennessy-Fiske in the {Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-economy-20140817-story.html"">.

Economic and racial seeds sowed decades ago. ""The roots of the racial unrest that has racked Ferguson, Mo., this week go back more than a century in a region that has had one foot planted in the Midwest and another in the South, historians and sociologists say. 'The St. Louis metropolitan area has been an extreme example of racial segregation for 100 years'"" said Clarissa Hayward, an associate professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis. 'St. Louis is the beginning of the West, the nexus of the Midwest and at the border of the South.' The practices and politics of St. Louis created the problems that underlie the tension that boiled out in Ferguson this week, Hayward said."" Ralph Vartabedian in the {Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-racial-history-20140815-story.html"">.

Poverty is growing fastest in suburbs. ""Protests...have drawn international attention to the St. Louis suburb’s growing underclass. Such challenges aren’t unique to Ferguson, according to a Brookings Institution report July 31 that found the poor population growing twice as fast in U.S. suburbs as in city centers. From Miami to Denver, resurgent downtowns have blossomed even as their recession-weary outskirts struggle with soaring poverty in what amounts to a paradigm shift....The number of poor people living in impoverished U.S. suburbs has more than doubled since 2000, comparing to a 50 percent rise in cities. More than half of the 46 million Americans in poverty now live in suburbs, Kneebone said.""

More charts: Ferguson among nation's many racially shifting suburbs. ""On the whole, the increasing racial and ethnic diversity in these counties was due to a sharp rise in the Hispanic population. That’s been true across the country, of course, as the Hispanic population has grown nationally — from about 12.5% in 2000 to about 17.1% in 2012. But the Urban Suburbs didn’t just lose whites as a percentage of the whole; they lost them in real terms....That’s while the U.S. non-Hispanic white population grew by about nine million nationally. And in some places, like St. Louis County (west of the city of St. Louis), the shifts were more about growing African American populations than Hispanics."" Dante Chinni in {The Wall Street Journal}<hyperlink=""http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/08/15/politics-counts-ferguson-mo-among-shifting-suburbs/"">.
How Ferguson's population has changed. ""Ferguson since the 1970s has gone from being 85 percent white to about 70 percent black, thanks to waves of flight by both races from the City of St. Louis. Restrictive zoning rules, local real estate practices, housing prices, and transportation issues have concentrated many of those black migrants into older suburbs in adjoining north St. Louis County, like Ferguson. Meanwhile, whites continued to move even farther west into once-exurban St. Charles County — now Missouri’s most-affluent county, with a population nearly equal to that of the City of St. Louis. One result: a recreation of the segregated neighborhoods many former city-dwellers had sought to leave behind."" James E. Ellis in {Bloomberg Businessweek}<hyperlink=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-15/why-ferguson-missouri-looks-like-the-inner-city"">.
How St. Louis County's fragmentation contributed. ""The map of St. Louis County, the home of Ferguson, looks like a shattered pot. It’s broken into 91 municipalities that range from small to tiny, along with clots of population in unincorporated areas....The crazy quilt that is St. Louis County government helps explain why violence broke out in Ferguson, of all the places in the country for a riot. It’s not because Ferguson is desperately poor; it’s lower-middle-income, with a healthy business district and a range of big, close-by employers....The problem, rather, is that St. Louis is locked into a pattern of inequitable development....Gordon says that because of Missouri’s tax laws and political fragmentation, 'there is a huge incentive to build the next great mall in the cornfield because you all of a sudden capture the tax revenue from it.'""

Helping kids make sense of Ferguson in demographically changing classrooms. ""Part of knowing how to talk with students about killings like Brown's is a willingness on the part of educators to engage in a dialogue that might make them uncomfortable. 'It highlights one of the crises that schools are facing right now where we're seeing the changing demographics of students in the classroom, and the teaching population remains overwhelmingly white,' says Audrey Watters, a former college teacher who now writes about education. 'Many educators are unfortunately deeply uncomfortable, and perhaps even unwilling to address their white privilege, and have a hard time addressing the lived reality of their students.'""

GORDON-REED: U.S. has yet to overcome its tortured racial past. ""For a founding father who usually took a sunny view of his nation’s prospects, it was a darkly pessimistic prophesy. In his Notes on the State of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson argued that if — as he hoped — America’s black slaves were one day set free, the result would be conflict and an inevitable descent into racial war. And in the hours after Governor Jay Nixon imposed a night-time curfew on the Missouri town of Ferguson following the killing there of an unarmed teenager by a police officer earlier this month, it is indeed reasonable to wonder whether a form of war...has been waged against blacks in America from Jefferson’s time until our own.""

SMITH: Black town, white power. ""After decades of methodically building political power, blacks in St. Louis City elected a black mayor in 1993 and black aldermen or alderwomen in nearly half the city’s wards....Well-established churches, Democratic ward organizations and other civic institutions mobilize voters in black wards. But because blacks have reached the suburbs in significant numbers only over the past 15 years or so, fewer suburban black communities have deeply ingrained civic organizations. That helps explain why majority-black Ferguson has a virtually all-white power structure....But there’s a potential solution that could help Ferguson...consolidation with surrounding municipalities, many of which face similar challenges.""

SCHAFFNER, VAN ERVE AND LaRAJA: How Ferguson exposes the racial bias in local elections. ""While Ferguson is 67 percent black, five of the six council members and the mayor are all white. Why this disparity? There are two culprits....Ferguson holds municipal elections in April of odd-numbered years. In doing so, the town is hardly unique. Approximately three-fourths of American municipalities hold their elections in odd years, a Progressive-era reform intended to shield municipal elections from the partisan politics of national contests, but one that has been shown to have a dramatic effect on reducing turnout. Ferguson also holds nonpartisan elections.""

HANSON: Revolutionary justice. ""There is something disturbing about the demagogic efforts to rush to judgment in Ferguson, Mo. While it is understandable to deplore the militarization of the police that might accentuate rising tensions on the street, and to note that a mostly white police force might be less sensitive to a majority African-American populace, there is as yet not much evidence that the antithesis — a more relaxed approach to crowd control under the direction of a sensitive African-American law-enforcement official — has so far resulted in an end of the street violence or of the looting of stores. Too little police deterrence can be just as dangerous as too much.."" Victor Davis Hanson in {National Review}<hyperlink=""http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/385606/revolutionary-justice-victor-davis-hanson"">.
BEINART: This time it's different — the conservative response to Ferguson. ""In explaining Senator Rand Paul’s response to Ferguson — and the growing skepticism of tough-on-crime policies among leading Republican politicians today — commentators often cite the libertarian attitudes of younger voters and the GOP’s desperate need to change its image among African Americans and Latinos. But reaching out to these constituencies by shifting GOP policies on crime would be impossible if it produced the kind of furious backlash among conservative activists that Republican politicians have endured for trying to change their party’s policies on immigration. Why can Paul get away with it? Because of...the decline of crime.""

SULTAN: How the violence changes the children's futures. ""From their parents, they may be hearing about how their community is treated unfairly, targeted or hated.

What is the eventual impact of being exposed at a young age to violence and a feeling that the police can’t or won’t protect you? You build up a wall of mistrust. You are closed off to persons of authority. You find it hard to trust the guidance of school professionals or others who may want to help you.

Top opinion

KRUGMAN: Why we fight wars. ""Once upon a time wars were fought for fun and profit; when Rome overran Asia Minor or Spain conquered Peru, it was all about the gold and silver. And that kind of thing still happens. In influential research sponsored by the World Bank, the Oxford economist Paul Collier has shown that the best predictor of civil war, which is all too common in poor countries, is the availability of lootable resources like diamonds. Whatever other reasons rebels cite for their actions seem to be mainly after-the-fact rationalizations. War in the preindustrial world was and still is more like a contest among crime families over who gets to control the rackets than a fight over principles. If you’re a modern, wealthy nation, however, war — even easy, victorious war — doesn’t pay.""

People struggling and striving to get ahead—that's what our country is all about. On that journey, they're not 'takers'; they're trying to make something of themselves. We shouldn't disparage that.

3. From Obamacare to Ebola, hospitals' latest challenges 

Key Obamacare provisions for hospitals not working — at least so far. ""One provision in particular, called Hospital Value Based Purchasing, which rewards or penalizes hospitals depending on their performance — is not leading to any substantial improvements in care, a new study found. This year, under the program, Medicare gives either a 1.25 percent increase or decrease in payments to hospitals, depending on their performance measured by at least 20 metrics. But researchers led by Andrew Ryan at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, determined there was no difference in performance between hospitals performing in the program and those that were exempt from the program....Researchers cautioned that it might be too early to conclude much.""

Hospitals struggle in transition to digital capabilities. ""No more hassles in getting medical records from your elderly father’s hospital stay transferred to the nursing home where he’ll recuperate. No more waiting to find out the result of that Pap smear; just go online and avoid playing phone tag with your doctor’s office. But a new study in the journal Health Affairs found that some of the digital health capabilities that consumers are most likely to notice or find useful are among the biggest digital challenges for hospitals. One reason: Getting patients to interact with their online medical record isn’t entirely within a hospital’s control. Hospitals now not only must care for and educate patients but also confirm that they’re using their electronic medical record."" Ben Sutherly in {The Columbus Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/08/17/hospitals-must-help-patients-access-digital-records--or-else.html"">.
Blood test can cost from $10 to $10,000 in Calif. hospitals. ""Imagine walking into a hospital and being charged more than $10,000 for a blood test to check your cholesterol level. Imagine then going to another hospital in the same state and being charged $10 for the same test. That’s what a team led by a researcher at the University of California at San Francisco found when it looked at the prices California hospitals charge for 10 common blood tests. Researchers studied charges for a variety of tests at 160 to 180 California hospitals in 2011 and found a huge variation in prices. The median charge for a basic metabolic panel...was $214. But hospitals charged from $35 to $7,303, depending on the facility. None of the hospitals were identified."" Lena H.

Hospital emergency rooms are still packed, too. ""More people have health insurance. But they are still crowding into emergency departments across the nation. An online study by the American College of Emergency Room Physicians found that nearly half of its members have seen a rise in visits since Jan. 1 when ACA coverage began. A resounding 86 percent of the physicians said they expect that number to continue growing....The spike in emergency room visits isn't totally surprising. Rosenau said when Massachusetts enacted its own health care reform in 2006, everyone predicted the newly insured would find a private doctor. Instead, emergency departments saw a 3 to 7 percent increase in volume."" Robert Calandra in {Kaiser Health News and the Philadelphia Inquirer}<hyperlink=""http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/August/15/With-Health-Law-ER-Still-Packed.aspx"">.

Hospitals reconsider charity care for those who decline coverage. ""As more Americans gain insurance under the federal health law, hospitals are rethinking their charity programs, with some scaling back help for those who could have signed up for coverage but didn’t. The move is prompted by concerns that offering free or discounted care to low-income uninsured patients might dissuade them from getting government-subsidized coverage."" Julie Appleby in {Kaiser Health News and The Washington Post}<hyperlink=""http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/August/18/Hospitals-Reconsider-Charity-For-Patients-Who-Decline-Health-Coverage.aspx"">.

Meanwhile, U.S. hospitals are getting ready for Ebola. ""Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said such a case is inevitable in the United States, and the agency this month issued the first extensive guidelines for hospitals on how recognize and treat Ebola patients...from the safe handling of lab specimens to effective isolation of suspected Ebola patients. But one piece of advice in particular has roused opposition from worried hospital administrators. The C.D.C. says that health care workers treating Ebola patients need only wear gloves, a fluid-resistant gown, eye protection and a face mask to prevent becoming infected with the virus. That is a far cry from the head-to-toe 'moon suits' doctors, nurses and aides have been seeing on television reports about the outbreak."" Catherine Saint Louis in {The New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/health/hospitals-in-the-us-get-ready-for-ebola.html"">.

Treatment at U.S. hospital is rare chance to study Ebola. ""The care that Mrs. Writebol and Dr. Brantly are receiving at Emory is expected to greatly improve their odds of recovery. And they are providing a rare opportunity to study the disease with extensive testing not available in Africa. Their doctors are hoping the scrutiny will yield information that could be used to help patients in Africa and reduce the high death rates there. 'We hope to learn a great deal from them,' said Dr. Bruce S. Ribner, who is leading the team of infectious disease specialists treating the two at Emory. 'They may be asked, when they recover, to participate in additional testing. But the focus now is to help them survive.'"" Denise Grady in {The New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/health/treatment-in-us-is-rare-chance-to-study-ebola.html"">.
U.S. hospitals have enough struggles diagnosing Ebola. Imagine the problems African countries will have. ""Current systems of detection involve large, expensive machines that depend on water and electricity, and require skilled technicians to operate and maintain. It took so long to diagnose the man at Mount Sinai, because his blood sample had to be shipped to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which has one of the few labs in America that can diagnose Ebola. Such a process is totally impractical in low-income countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia, which lack basic infrastructure. Liberia, a nation of 3.5 million, reportedly has just 50 doctors.""

Tens of millions of Americans — and 620,000 military households — relied on food pantries last year.

And a surprisingly high number of those seeking help were households with military members, according to a new survey by Feeding America, which is a network of U.S. food banks. The survey — conducted in 2013 — found that almost 620,000 of the households using Feeding America services have at least one member currently in the military.

The official U.S. unemployment rate is 6.3 percent. But an alternative federal measure that includes people who want to work but are too discouraged to keep looking, and those working part-time though they would prefer to work full-time, is 12.6 percent.""

Lesley McSpadden declined to discus the results on ABC News’ “Good Morning America,” leaving her lawyer Benjamin Crump to address {the findings that her son had been shot at least six times,}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/18/autopsy-michael-brown-shot-six-times-twice-in-the-head/?hpid=z2""> including two times in the head.

With the erupting violence overnight in the wake of her son’s death, she was asked: How can peace be restored?

“With justice,” McSpadden replied.”Being fair; arresting this man and making him accountable for his actions,” she added later.
“It confirms our worst fears that the witnesses were telling the truth,” Crump said. “The most troubling was the head shot. It’s just not justified in any way fashion or form to execute this child.”

There were her first public comments since the results of the private autopsy, which was conducted on behalf of the family in addition to the autopsy conducted by St. Louis County Medical Examiner’s office and one that will be conducted by federal officials.

She also responded publicly for the first time to the release of surveillance video of Brown’s alleged involvement in a convenience store robbery just minutes before he was shot on a nearby street.

In a statement from the family and their lawyers on Friday, they called it a “character assassination” of Brown.

McSpadden said that she was not aware that police were going to release the video.

“I feel like it has nothing to do with what he did to my child,” McSpadden said.",112,NA,NA,NA

And we keep ignoring the lessons,Merlin Chowkwanyun,08/18/2014,03/24/2016,"The riots in Ferguson, Mo., over the shooting of Michael Brown, arrive at a particularly ironic moment—almost 50 years after the Watts riots in the summer of 1965, also spurred by one man’s encounter with law enforcement. That uprising, along with other mass urban insurrections in the 1960s, prompted a raft of riot commissions to examine why these outbreaks had occurred. What’s ironic is that they all came to the same conclusion: The riots were about far more than just the police.

Yet politicians ignored the important diagnoses and recommendations. If history is any guide, the Ferguson riots will teach us nothing. In urban affairs, it turns out, past is often just prologue.
Riot commissions followed unrest in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Detroit, Newark, and many others. In some ways, they were creatures of their time. Besides foregrounding police brutality, some alleged “cultural deficits” of the rioters and instigation by conspirators. (This was the Cold War, after all.) But they also hit on important, and obvious themes—the deep grievances afflicting African-Americans denied the fruits of the post-war economic boom and so-called “affluent society.”

Commissions meticulously identified many dimensions of racial exclusion.  One panel in Cleveland, where the Hough neighborhood had erupted a year after Watts, listed “inadequate and sub-standard housing,” “charging of exorbitant rents by absentee landlords,” “non-enforcement of the housing code,” “sub-standard educational facilities as a consequence of long neglect,” “excessive food prices,” and “denial of equal economicopportunities.”  The {report on Watts}<hyperlink=""www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/cityinstress/mccone/contents.html""> had similarly highlighted chronic unemployment, education, and health care resources.  It concluded with a searing call to action:

The road to the improvement of the condition of the disadvantaged Negro which lies through education and employment is hard and long, but there is no shorter route… Of what shall it avail our nation if we can place a man on the moon but cannot cure the sickness in our cities?

These regional reports culminated with the 1968 release of the {Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders}<hyperlink=""https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/8073NCJRS.pdf"">. Commissioned by President Lyndon Johnson a year earlier, the Kerner Report, as it was known, discussed the same underlying causes as the previous studies. It called for “new initiatives and experiments that can change the system of failure and frustration that now dominates the ghetto” and “unprecedented levels of funding” for them.  It made clear that police brutality was a final intolerable insult in a larger cycle of everyday deprivation and denial of basic needs and resources. 

Shortly after the Kerner Report, the New York Times warned that “sloganeering, political promises, buckpassing and the proliferation of groups to study and restudy explosive problems will breed more frustration, more rebellion, more civil strife.” Commissions around the nation (beyond just Watts) had now spewed thick, authoritative reports, and public officials pledged swift action. New York City Mayor John Lindsay, who served on the Kerner commission, remarked: “I hope that it won’t be just another study, that it will lead to performance — and the key is performance.” Civil rights activist Fred Shuttlesworth called the report “the first real hard-hitting statement by a body that will be listened to by the public.”
But many public projects hatched in response to the 1960s riots were hampered from the start.  One dramatic example was the Martin Luther King Jr. General Hospital, built in South Central Los Angeles as a response to lack of health care services in Watts.  Throughout its existence, the hospital fought budgetary shortfalls that hampered its operation until, in 2007, it finally closed due to mounting quality-of-care and mismanagement scandals. Meanwhile, the programs and “unprecedented levels of funding” counseled in the 1968 Kerner Report for increasing jobs, educational quality, and affordable housing, never quite came to full fruition.
Those failures of follow-through help explain why so little changed. In Los Angeles, the {brutal videotaped beating of Rodney King}<hyperlink=""http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lapd/kingvideo.html""> and the work of the {Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.parc.info/client_files/Special%20Reports/1%20-%20Chistopher%20Commision.pdf"">, chaired by Warren Christopher, showed how urban policing had resisted adaptation more than 25 years since Watts.

Like its antecedents, the 1992 riots in Los Angeles also grew out of frustration with broader material conditions. They occurred after two decades of slashed social spending, economic stagnation, and fiscal austerity. When Los Angeles burned again, it did so amidst high levels of black unemployment and an urban development regime that some observers—most famously Mike Davis in his classic {“City of Quartz”}<hyperlink=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/06/where-to-start-when-it-comes-to-city-of-quartz-mike-daviss-1990-polemic-against-the-rampant-privatization-and-gated-communi.html""> —argued had prioritized the needs of the city’s affluent at the expense of the most marginalized.

What then, nearly 50 years after Watts, are we supposed to learn from Ferguson? The choice is a clear one, between concrete action and public policy on one hand, and endless commissions and “conversations on race” on the other. It’s great that the Justice Department will investigate the Ferguson Police Department, an agency that is clearly out of control and incapable of policing itself. But if this results only in a document that sits on a shelf, its efforts will serve nobody but the politicians and civil servants who should really be held accountable for the Ferguson debacle. This was the fate of too many 1960s riot commission reports.  Indeed, the recent conduct of law enforcement in Ferguson, the {Bay Area}<hyperlink=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/BART-shooting-captured-on-video-3177850.php"">, and {New York City}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/01/justice/new-york-choke-hold-death/""> suggests that police departments are simply not learning from history.
Beyond renewing attention to the dangers of militarized and racist policing, Ferguson is a wake-up call for another reason. A majority-black suburb of St. Louis where nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, it reminds us of what happens when mounting racial inequality and economic deprivation are allowed to fester with few checks. The political debate today is far more constricted than it was in the era of Watts, when full employment and basic guaranteed income were still policy options in mainstream circles. It is time to widen those parameters of debate again.

If we instead choose to sit on our collective hands, we should not be surprised if Ferguson, like Watts, replays. Whatever one thinks of militant expressions of discontent, it is hard to deny just how predictable they are when they finally happen.",17,NA,NA,NA

It emerges instead from a series of frustrations that eventually reach a breaking point. As protests and clashes continue in Ferguson, Mo., there's been an increasingly close look at the underlying tensions in the city. The shooting death of Michael Brown was a catalyst. What follows are what those best familiar with the area consider the underlying elements.

Political power

Jeff Smith, a former Democratic state senator from Missouri, wrote {a piece for the Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/opinion/in-ferguson-black-town-white-power.html?_r=0""> outlining the recent electoral tension in St. Louis County, the area just northwest of the city of St. Louis that is home to Ferguson. As {we noted}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/14/visualizing-the-rapid-racial-change-in-ferguson-over-the-past-decade/""> last week, Smith argues that the rapid shift in Ferguson's demographics from majority white to majority black outpaced the ability of the political infrastructure to represent the community.
For the New Yorker, Jelani Cobb {looks at}<hyperlink=""http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/movement-grows-ferguson""> two recent political moves that he's heard people in Ferguson mention as symptoms of the overarching problem.

Late last year, the largely white school board (it has one Hispanic member) fired the district's black superintendent. Then, less than two weeks ago, Charlie Dooley, the incumbent county executive was {beaten handily}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/elections/counties/st-louis-county/""> by St. Louis city councilmember Steve Stenger. Stenger is white; Dooley black. According to Cobb, black residents of the county saw opposition to Dooley as racially tinged. The arguments against Dooley, {like this one}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maXoj4kkIwY"">, featuring county prosecutor Bob McCulloch, focused on accusations of corruption.
""McCulloch would also be responsible for determining whether to charge Darren Wilson,"" the officer who shot Michael Brown, Cobb notes.

Police activity

Frustrations around police activity pre-date the Brown shooting. There are numerous anecdotal examples of incidents in which Ferguson residents complained of being targeted by the police. But there's also direct evidence of it.

Smith, in the Times, explains why police stops are important to local law enforcement.

The region’s fragmentation isn’t limited to the odd case of a city shedding its county. St. Louis County contains 90 municipalities, most with their own city hall and police force. Many rely on revenue generated from traffic tickets and related fines. According to a study by the St. Louis nonprofit Better Together, Ferguson receives nearly one-quarter of its revenue from court fees; for some surrounding towns it approaches 50 percent.

In Ferguson, according to data from the Missouri state attorney general, traffic stops have been on an upward trend, though the number dropped last year.
Any perception that the application of the traffic stops is uneven is justified. Blacks are far more likely to get stopped, which makes sense in part since they are a larger percentage of the population. (Though, as {we noted}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/14/visualizing-the-rapid-racial-change-in-ferguson-over-the-past-decade/""> last week, they are overrepresented in those stops. Over 80 percent of stops in the past five years have been of black drivers, despite blacks only comprising about two-thirds of the population.) But once stopped, blacks are more likely to be searched -- and less likely to be found carrying anything illegal.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch columnist David Nicklaus {notes}<hyperlink=""http://m.stltoday.com/business/columns/david-nicklaus/nicklaus-frustration-in-north-county-has-deep-economic-roots/article_3e54262d-59b5-5e2a-beac-349d0f63a1e8.html?mobile_touch=true""> another point of tension.

The unemployment and poverty rates for blacks in St. Louis County are consistently higher than those rates for white residents. Only one time between 2007 and 2012 has the poverty rate for blacks been less than three times that of whites, according to Census data (which is only available through the latter year). The unemployment rate is two-to-three times higher, and, as of 2012, had grown worse while it grew better for whites.
What's more, those figures disproportionately affect younger residents. Nicklaus pulls out a subset of Census data: ""47 percent of the metro area’s African-American men between ages 16 and 24 are unemployed. The comparable figure for young white men is 16 percent.""

The strains of economic hardship don't need much further articulation. But it also means that the disruptions that are occurring due to the current state of emergency are likely to exacerbate problems. For example, there are {calls for increased donations to a local foodbank}<hyperlink=""https://fundly.com/feed-the-students-of-ferguson""> because the announced school closures, meant to keep people off the streets, will also mean that kids who rely on school meals aren't getting them.

There are many reasons to hope that Ferguson returns to normal -- or, perhaps, better-than-normal -- as soon as possible. But few are more pressing than the recognition that many local residents were struggling even before their town's disruptions became front-page news.",9,NA,NA,NA

Fear that troublemakers and outsiders are sabotaging otherwise peaceful protests seems to be shared by others in Ferguson.

Ronnie Natch, a leader of one of the factions of protesters, said he awoke in a panic Monday morning about the violence and the pending arrival of the National Guard, {which has been called in by Gov. Jay Nixon (D)}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/justice-department-orders-new-autopsy-of-michael-browns-body/2014/08/18/023a4d12-2694-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?hpid=z1"">.
Increasingly, said Natch, a 30-year-old music producer, young men from around the country — from Chicago to New York — have been coming to Ferguson. Often, they bring increased violence.

“They are showing up angry,” Natch said. “I get that, but the problem is they destroy stores, then they go home and we are left with what’s left.”

He organizes a section of the protest that is known to be peaceful and distributes water and fruit by the main police station.

“We don’t know what today and tonight will bring,” he added. “The thought is keeping me up. One idiot can ruin everything.”

Natch said he would be meeting with other protest groups — including one known as “the QuickTrip faction” — and talking to police about getting the gas lines turned off at what was a working gas station in the epicenter of the protest.

“This has become a very dangerous situation,” he said. “Hopefully the national guard is here to do good, so that’s what will come of it.”",1,NA,NA,NA

How can I “like” what happened to your grandma? Where’s the “Dave respectfully wishes to share his awareness of this news” button?

The trouble with the Internet is the fact that it lays your reading habits bare. Perhaps barer than you would like. If there were a hack that, every time I clicked a story about the Further Travails of Justin Bieber, would reroute the click to a Worthy Story About Actual Problems, foreign bureaus would not have suffered the cuts they have. But there isn’t. And the window moves accordingly.

Except you can’t tell that it’s moving. When you look out a window or into a newspaper, you feel confident that you will see everything that is there. This is not the case with the Internet. It’s a window onto the world — but it does not necessarily reveal all there is to see. Facebook and Twitter both have their blind spots. If you depend on one or the other, you’ll miss things, be it local news or national outrages.

You see only a fraction of what there is — in a day of frantic Facebooking, Trey Graham only saw {29 percent of his friends’ posts}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/08/18/what-facebook-doesnt-show-you/?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost&tid=a_inl"">  — and what that fraction is, is tailored in accordance to some fairly opaque algorithms. Facebook’s Greg Marra, a product manager of News Feed told him:

“News Feed is made by you. … It tries to show the most interesting things possible for you, it’s a very personalized system. … We try to let users take control.”

Really?

Marra said there are countless signals that tell Facebook what to pump into a person’s News Feed, including relationships with other users, the topic of content in a given link, how long a user spends reading a story he or she found though Facebook, if and how many times X user visits Y user’s profile, friends’ activity on a certain post, all of our previous activity and more.

But how much control do we have over an algorithm we can’t see?

There’s always a blind spot. The window moves, depending on where you look.

Over at Medium.com last week, Zeynep Tufekci {noticed this phenomenon}<hyperlink=""https://medium.com/message/ferguson-is-also-a-net-neutrality-issue-6d2f3db51eb0"">, warning “Algorithms have consequences.”

This isn’t about Facebook per se — maybe it will do a good job, maybe not — but the fact that algorithmic filtering, as a layer, controls what you see on the Internet. Net neutrality (or lack thereof) will be yet another layer determining this. This will come on top of existing inequalities in attention, coverage and control.

Twitter was also affected by algorithmic filtering. “Ferguson” did not trend in the US on Twitter but it did trend locally. [I’ve since learned from @gilgul that that it *briefly* trended but mostly trended at localities.] So, there were fewer chances for people not already following the news to see it on their “trending” bar. Why? Almost certainly because there was already national, simmering discussion for many days and Twitter’s trending algorithm (said to be based on a method called “{term frequency inverse document frequency}<hyperlink=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf"">”)  {rewards spikes}<hyperlink=""http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/10/why-hasnt-occupywallstreet-trended-in-new-york/"">… So, as people in localities who had not been talking a lot about Ferguson started to mention it, it trended there though the national build-up in the last five days penalized Ferguson.

Algorithms have consequences.

It’s perhaps ironic that Facebook, at the same time that Ferguson has been conspicuous by its absence from many News Feeds, has been instead rewarding another kind of awareness: the ice bucket challenge for ALS. I have nothing against awareness (well, except {the following}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2014/08/15/against-awareness-i-nominate-you-to-not-take-the-als-challenge/"">) and everything against ALS, but there’s more than one kind of awareness to raise and keep in mind.

Remember, this is one window that does not show everything.

WashingtonPost,wapo186,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/brown-family-attorneys-autopsy-showed-michael-brown-was-trying-to-surrender-when-he-was-killed/,Brown family attorneys: Autopsy showed Michael Brown was trying to surrender when he was killed,Mark Berman,08/18/2014,03/25/2016,"An autopsy of Michael Brown showed that one of the gunshots that struck the teenager in the head went from “back to front,” indicating that he was surrendering at the time of his death, attorneys for Brown’s family said Monday. But the experts who conducted the autopsy said it was unclear so far whether any of the gunshot wounds were incurred while Brown was raising his arms to surrender.

In addition, the results of this autopsy show that Brown was struck by six bullets, said Michael Baden, a medical examiner who carried out the autopsy, which was requested by the family.

The autopsy conducted by Baden — who reviewed the autopsies of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. — is one of three autopsies that will be carried out. But this is the first information from a medical examination of Brown’s body to be publicly released since Brown was fatally shot, providing details that residents in Ferguson and many in the public have asked for since he was killed.

One of the gunshots struck Brown at the apex of his head, while another struck just above his right eyebrow, according to Shawn Parcells, identified by the Brown family’s attorneys as a forensic pathologist assistant.
But multiple wounds on Brown’s body appeared to be reentry wounds. Parcells said that a shot that struck Brown in the forehead, above the right eyebrow, exited through the bottom right portion of Brown’s jawline and reentered his body.

Parcells said it is unclear yet whether the gunshots on Brown’s arms came from the teenager holding his arms up in a form of surrender, which is what a witness said Brown was doing when he died.

While they could not speculate on the order of the gunshot wounds, it appears that the two gunshots fired at Brown’s head were the last two shots, Parcells said.

State medical examiners conducted an autopsy the day after Brown was killed, St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar said last week. And a third autopsy will be performed by a federal medical examiner at the order of Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., owing to both a request from Brown’s family and “the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case,” spokesman Brian Fallon {said}<hyperlink=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-crt-868.html""> Sunday.

The FBI is conducting its own civil rights investigation as well as monitoring the investigation carried out by county authorities.
Crump stressed that this information is a preliminary report that answers questions including how many times Brown was shot, a key detail that remained unconfirmed for more than a week after Brown’s death.

“The Brown family wanted to have this autopsy performed on their behalf because they did not know whether the federal officials were going to conduct their own independent autopsy,” Crump said. “And they did not want to be left having to rely on the autopsy done by the St. Louis law enforcement agencies, the same individuals they feel are responsible for executing their son in broad daylight.”
However, it appears that different medical examinations had access to different information. For example, the autopsy conducted by Baden was first reported Sunday night by the New York Times. The Times reported that Baden did not have access to the clothes Brown was wearing at the time of his death.
[tweetbegin 501347563296280576 tweetend]
While this autopsy confirms some information that witnesses have given, it also appears to contradict other details. Baden told the Times that it appeared that all of the bullets hit the front part of Brown’s body, while Dorian Johnson — an eyewitness to the shooting — said through an attorney that Brown {was shot in the back}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/justice-department-orders-new-autopsy-of-michael-browns-body/2014/08/18/023a4d12-2694-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html"">.
On Monday, Parcells said that it while it appeared that one of the bullets could have Brown while the teenager was surrendering, it was not definitively clear.

Meanwhile, Baden said he could not say how different his results were from the autopsy conducted by the county, because the county had not released its results. However, he expected that the results would be similar.",418,NA,NA,NA

Alan Grayson (D-Fla.). In short, the amendment would have prevented the military from distributing to local police forces some of heavy weapons and vehicles that the country has seen deployed in response to unrest in Ferguson, Mo.

The amendment failed by a wide margin. But the next time such a vote occurs -- and its increasingly likely that it will -- the results might be very different.
The Grayson amendment didn't go as far as the bill proposed by Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) that {we looked at}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/15/how-two-changes-to-two-laws-could-make-future-fergusons-very-different/""> last week.

(Very few of whom have much need for nukes.)

The vote broke down like this.
A strong contingent of California Democrats voted for the amendment, as did Johnson. The 19 Republican votes included Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and several tea party stalwarts. But it wasn't really close. Among those voting no: {Rep. Lacy Clay}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/blog/2014/08/14/fergusons-rep-lacy-clay-voted-against-am""> (D-Mo.), whose district includes Ferguson.

Post-Ferguson, the tenor on Capitol Hill appears to have changed. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) {has called for reforms to the Defense Department program}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/15/what-politicians-should-be-saying-about-ferguson-hint-its-what-rand-paul-is-saying/"">.

""Congress established this program out of real concern that local law enforcement agencies were literally outgunned by drug criminals,"" he wrote in a statement. ""We intended this equipment to keep police officers and their communities safe from heavily armed drug gangs and terrorist incidents."" As many have noted -- none more thoroughly than {the Post's Radley Balko}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/08/13/tiny-georgia-police-department-posts-terrifying-swat-video/""> -- the armaments of many small police forces now far exceeds any drug- or terror-related need.
Adam Blickstein, a former Defense public affairs officer, {tweeted his support}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/AdamBlickstein/status/501354231090413568""> for reforms on Monday. ""Pentagon should announce halt to its 1033 program, suspend all transfer of military grade equipment to local police,"" he wrote, later adding that he assumes ""there'd be fans in Congress from both sides.""

There were in June -- just not nearly enough to have the bill pass.

But this would hardly be the first time that real-world events changed the tenor of and rekindled a previously settled debate. One recent example: the debate over reforming the National Security Agency. Before the leaks from Edward Snowden, there was little momentum towards curtailing the National Security Agency's ability to collect information on targets. After, there was. An amendment to an appropriations bill in 2013 sponsored by Amash that would have cut funding for a subset of the NSA's spying {nearly passed}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/25/nsa-surveillance-amash-amendment-narrow-defeat""> the House, losing by 12 votes.

Cruz has a loyal following on the right, the ability to bring a crowd to its feet and a solid grasp of foreign policy. Still, he will need to define conservative victories in a way that conceals his errors, indicts top rival {Sen. Rand Paul}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/08/13/rand-paul-the-oops-candidate-of-2016/""> (R-Ky.) and undermines Hillary Clinton. He also faces a challenge few expected — how to outshine a newly invigorated and adept Gov. Rick Perry, whom he defended against the spurious indictment. For Cruz that means:

1. Stressing his anti-Iran credentials on sanctions and human rights. Cruz can claim a true bipartisan achievement in passing legislation to bar terrorists from entering the United States to represent their country at the United Nations, which tells you a lot about the U.N.

2. Emphasizing Israel. He certainly can point to Hillary Clinton’s acrimonious relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Rand Paul’s plan to cut aid to Israel, as well as Paul’s comments on containment of Iran and opposition to Menendez-Kirk sanctions. Pro-Israel conservatives know President Obama also assured the country that he was pro-Israel but turned out to be instinctively hostile to the Jewish state. Cruz will no doubt make the case that Israel needs more than another fair-weather friend in the Oval Office. Cruz can tout his votes on Iran sanctions and loud objection to the Federal Aviation Administration flight ban to Ben Gurion airport.

3. Re-characterizing the shutdown as a positive step toward building Obamacare opposition. Fortunately for him, Rand Paul is locked at the hip with him on this. He will need to meet head-on the complaints that this was reckless and harmful to the GOP cause.

4. Bolstering his executive experience by referencing the 100-plus-person solicitor general office in Texas he ran. Again, he will contrast that with Hillary Clinton’s record of mismanagement at the State Department. And he will once again try to convince voters that executive experience is only part of the picture for a successful president.

5. Trying to associate Rand Paul’s support for comprehensive immigration reform with Democrats’ “amnesty plans,” as Cruz likes to call them. He may try to label him as unserious about preventing illegal immigrants from working. (Paul opposes measures such as e-Verify.)

6. Asserting his support for anti-terror measures. This allows him to attack Paul and Clinton for weakness on the war on terror and Obama for lack of transparency and executive overreach.

7. Making Rand Paul choose either his libertarian friends or his conservative supporters. We’ve looked at some either/or positions for Paul on gay marriage, aid to Israel and robust opposition to jihadism. Paul is already feeling heat for trying to be all things to all people, so prepare to hear Cruz talk a lot about “authenticity.” In their comments about the Michael Brown shooting we saw a clear divide. Cruz is the more traditional, law and order conservative; Rand Paul is playing the classic libertarian role. Given the continued violence in Ferguson, Mo., Cruz may have played this more adeptly, giving him the opportunity to paint Rand Paul as more akin to MSM commentators than the GOP base.

8. Arguing that both Hillary Clinton and Rand Paul are Johnny-come-lately hawks. Cruz will make the case that the country needs someone who once in office would not capitulate to his or her isolationist bases.

9. Styling himself as the tea party champion without the foreign policy flakiness of Rand Paul. On this, he’ll face stiff competition from his home-state governor. There will be lots of base-pleasing candidates, but Cruz will probably sell himself as the most hard-line of the hard-liners.

10. Posing as the victim of the liberal media. The mainstream media can be counted on to fawn over Hillary Clinton and swoon over Rand Paul’s foreign policy. There is affection on the right for those savaged by the mainstream media, and Cruz can play this to great effect.",75,NA,NA,NA

While Case declined to comment further, citing the ongoing investigation into Brown’s death, another person familiar with the county’s investigation told The Washington Post that Brown had between six and eight gunshot wounds and was shot from the front.

In addition, Brown had marijuana in his system when he was shot and killed by a police officer on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, according to this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.

The report from Case’s office was released to the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office on Friday night but has not been made public. This report is part of the county’s official investigation into the shooting, but it is one of three autopsies being conducted.
Brown’s family and attorneys also requested its own autopsy, {which was carried out by Michael Baden}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/brown-family-attorneys-autopsy-showed-michael-brown-was-trying-to-surrender-when-he-was-killed/"">, a medical examiner who released preliminary details from his review on Monday.

In anticipation that Brown could be vilified by the results of the drug test, conducted as a routine part of the autopsy, protesters have consistently insisted that Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, should be required to submit to one as well.

“What was in the system of that cop when he was pumping bullets into that boy’s body?” asked a protest leader, shouting into a megaphone, during a rally on Friday afternoon.

Residents and protesters have noted that allegations of marijuana use have been used in the past by some in an attempt to disparage the character of shooting victims, including in the Trayvon Martin case.

Baden said Monday he had great respect for Mary Case, the medical examiner in St. Louis County, and said he expected that her review would show similar results to his.
""It sounds consistent,” Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown’s family, told The Washington Post. Brown’s attorneys believe Darren Wilson may have fired more than six shots, but “we wanted to err on the side of caution.”

The family gave permission for a medical examiner with the U.S. military to conduct a third autopsy, which was requested Sunday by the Department of Justice.

Crump said he didn’t know anything about marijuana being found in Brown’s body.

Baden and Case often speak at the same conferences, and Baden has attended lectures she gives on autopsy reports. But a source familiar with the issue said that she was not aware he was conducting an autopsy.
Case said Monday that she was not bothered to hear that additional autopsies would be conducted.

“I’m not upset at all,” she said. “This is highly controversial case and it’s good that everyone interested in it can have a say.”",1726,NA,NA,NA

This case has been unusual in that a certain degree of left-right agreement has emerged, particularly between liberals and libertarians who both see the militarization of local police getting out of control. But there’s another lesson emerging, one that isn’t going to make those libertarians pleased: sometimes, big government isn’t the problem, it’s the solution — to the problem of small government.

What I mean by “big” and “small” in this case isn’t government that does many things versus government that does few things, it’s government at a higher level versus government at a lower level. When government at one level fails, oftentimes the only solution can be found up the ladder, from local to state to ultimately the federal government.

There’s a mythology in American politics — repeated most often by conservatives but occasionally by liberals as well — that the best government is the one that’s closest to the people. Those bureaucrats far away in Washington don’t have a clue what’s best for us, unlike the people who know our communities and see us every day. They’re the ones who understand our problems and can be held accountable when they screw up.

But the reality is often far different. The truth is that old-style corruption of the briefcase-full-of-cash variety has become extremely rare in Washington, because it’s hard to get away with. Members of Congress not only have all kinds of disclosure requirements, they also work in a place that’s teeming with reporters examining their activities, official and otherwise. That’s far less true on the state and local level, particularly since the declining fortunes of newspapers have meant fewer and fewer reporters in state legislatures and city halls.
And at the local level, problems like disenfranchisement are far less likely to be the subject of high-profile campaigns and lawsuits waged by well-funded interest groups. Consider the fact that though Ferguson is two-thirds black, not only is the police force nearly all-white, but so is the political leadership, with a white mayor and five of the six city council members being white. How did that happen? {Much of the answer}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/15/how-ferguson-exposes-the-racial-bias-in-local-elections/""> lies in the fact that municipal elections in Ferguson are held not just in off-years, but in April instead of November. While turnout among whites and blacks in the 2012 presidential election was identical, whites turned out for Ferguson’s April 2013 municipal election at a rate nearly three times that of blacks.

That disparity then has consequences that incorporate law enforcement, economics, and people’s daily interactions with authority. As political scientist Jeff Smith {puts it in a good piece}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/opinion/in-ferguson-black-town-white-power.html"">:
With primarily white police forces that rely disproportionately on traffic citation revenue, blacks are pulled over, cited and arrested in numbers far exceeding their population share, according to a recent {report from Missouri’s attorney general}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf"">. In Ferguson last year, 86 percent of stops, 92 percent of searches and 93 percent of arrests were of black people — despite the fact that police officers were far less likely to find contraband on black drivers (22 percent versus 34 percent of whites). This worsens inequality, as struggling blacks do more to fund local government than relatively affluent whites.

So the local government, the one that’s supposed to be in touch with the people, is not only out of touch, it’s making their lives miserable. The events in Ferguson have also shown us a case of inept local government that has made the situation worse at every turn. First the Ferguson police responded to protesting residents like they were retaking Fallujah. Then when state troopers succeeded in calming things down for a night — a higher level of government trying to correct the failures of a lower level — the Ferguson police released the surveillance video from that convenience store, as though trying to make the case that Michael Brown had it coming, which enraged local residents and started a new cycle of unrest.

It’ll be great if this situation leads to liberals and conservatives joining together to do something about the over-militarization of law enforcement. And yes, that over-militarization is something that the federal government and local governments cooperated to create. But the next time you hear someone say that power should be devolved as far as possible to the state and local level, remember that those lower levels of government are often where the worst problems are.",535,NA,NA,NA

Fast forward to today: a recent wedding {photo}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/07/23/brides-accidental-text-creates-best-wedding-photo-ever/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=NYPTwitter&utm_medium=SocialFlow""> that went viral had a seemingly incongruous image of a predominantly white wedding party with a bunch of young black men. The explanation for the photo went as follows: Thanks to what media reports described as an errant text message, the bride accidentally invited strangers to the party. The bride apologized for the mistake and texted the stranger that the party was private. But the unintended recipient replied by simply saying “we still coming.” When the story went viral, it spawned the hashtag {#westillcoming}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23westillcoming&src=typd"">.
As fascinating as the story sounds, it was completely made up — and it played to our racial misconceptions and discomfort. Here’s the real {story}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/25/westillcoming-the-real-story-behind-the-viral-wedding-photo-and-its-uninvited-guests/?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost"">:  the wedding party was going around Detroit taking photos and happened upon the rap group 7262 making a video. Not only did the wedding party chat with the rappers, but the wedding party ended up take pictures with the group and appeared in their video. I doubt if this story would have gone viral.

The question is (besides who created the erroneous text message exchange) why did this go viral and what does it say about our culture? The answer may be found in our preconceptions about race, and in the {stories}<hyperlink=""http://www.theroot.com/photos/2014/07/unarmed_black_men_killed_by_law_enforcement.html""> of unarmed African American men killed by cops. We all know the story of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and the protests that continue in its aftermath. But arguably a more disturbing story occurred just a few days earlier in Cleveland, where John Crawford, father of three, was {shot}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/cops-shoot-and-kill-man-holding-toy-gun-walmart""> by cops as he held a toy gun at a Wal-Mart store. In a country where 86 percent of the states have an “open carry” law, how is it possible that a black man with a toy gun is not safe in a store that allows people to carry real guns?

With all the discussion of racial progress and how raced-based {policies}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/Place-Not-Race-Opportunity-America/dp/0807086142""> are no longer needed, we have far too many reminders that race still matters.

WashingtonPost,wapo192,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/08/18/how-the-rest-of-the-world-sees-ferguson/,How the rest of the world sees Ferguson,Adam Taylor; Rick Noack,08/18/2014,03/25/2016,"In many ways, the chaotic situation in Ferguson, Mo., seems like something that shouldn't happen in America. As {WorldViews has noted}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/14/7-ways-ferguson-carries-echoes-of-foreign-conflicts/"">, many of the hallmarks of the conflict are reminiscent of scenes from the Arab Spring and the Ukraine crisis – {our former colleague Max Fisher}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6005587/ferguson-satire-another-country-russia-china"">  has even wondered how American journalists would cover Ferguson, if only it weren't happening ""here.""

There are plenty of foreign journalists reporting on Ferguson, however, and for them, Ferguson is international news. Their coverage of the shooting of Michael Brown and the subsequent unrest can offer a refreshing viewpoint on America's many problems. They can also reveal a lot about how such disturbances are viewed at home.

For most Americans, the most familiar foreign news outlets covering Ferguson will probably be the British ones: Not only is there a shared language, but some British outlets, most obviously the Guardian but also the BBC and the Daily Mail, have made big pushes into the U.S. news market. Notably, some publications are treating the conflict as they might a war zone — t{he Telegraph has sent its Afghanistan}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/robcrilly""> correspondent, Rob Crilly, to cover the protests, for example (he was arrested {while reporting this weekend}<hyperlink=""http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/263931/more-journalists-arrested-in-ferguson/"">).

British coverage of Ferguson has emphasized the racial drama that lies {behind the riots}<hyperlink=""http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100283343/a-black-president-couldnt-stop-the-ferguson-race-riots/""> and {the scale}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/18/ferguson-violence-martin-luther-king-michael-brown""> of the police response. And while Britain has had its own problems with race and riots (most notably the 2011 events in London and elsewhere, also caused by a police shooting involving a young black man), some journalists are struck more by the differences than the similarities. ""While the [London riots] were at their worst, people were calling for rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons to be used against the rioters,"" {Abigail Chandler of the free newspaper the Metro}<hyperlink=""http://metro.co.uk/2014/08/14/michael-brown-protests-in-ferguson-when-the-police-dehumanise-a-community-it-shames-all-of-us-4832742/""> writes. ""Ferguson is a living example of why we should be immensely grateful that those tactics were never used during the U.K. riots.""
The German media leveled harsher criticism. Zeit Online, a centrist news site, saw the death of Brown as testimony of deep-rooted racism in the United States and concluded that “the situation of {African-Americans has barely improved}<hyperlink=""http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2014-08/usa-rassismus-brown""> since Martin Luther King.” The publication went as far as to say that the “dream of a post-racist society, which flared up after the election of [President] Obama, seems further away than ever before.” Such criticism was echoed by its conservative competitor {Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung}<hyperlink=""http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/amerika/ausschreitungen-in-ferguson-obama-tut-nichts-fuer-die-schwarzen-13102127.html"">, one of  the biggest newspapers in Germany, which also specifically singled out the U.S. president for his failures: “It seems like mockery that [Obama] is still called the most powerful man on earth.”

Spiegel Online, a centrist, left-leaning publication, discussed Ferguson with {Marcel Kuhlmey}<hyperlink=""http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/proteste-in-ferguson-kritik-an-militaerischer-ausruestung-der-polizei-a-986337.html"">, an academic who studies police reactions. Kuhlmey told the site that in Germany, “weapons are the last resort, but in the U.S. police officers make use of them much faster” and went on to say that the “last time the German police owned assault rifles [which are being used in Ferguson] was during the Cold War.” The expert concluded that police officers “would never proceed like this in Germany.""

These criticisms echo those found in the media of other U.S. allies. Le Figaro – the main conservative voice of Germany’s neighbor France – focused less on the remaining racial tensions in the United States than on “the excessive militarization of the police forces."" Despite its right-leaning editorial stance, {Le Figaro predicts}<hyperlink=""http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2014/08/15/01003-20140815ARTFIG00151-l-amerique-en-proie-aux-tensions-raciales.php""> repercussions for the Republican Party “which may be felt for a long time and even cost the GOP the next presidential elections.” El Mundo, a right-wing Spanish newspaper, {writes that Obama's}<hyperlink=""http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2014/08/17/53f0fcf6ca47413c568b4583.html""> ""words of peace and reconciliation are perceived by many activists as inadequate and almost treason to a situation they see as a direct result of slavery and racial segregation laws that were in force until 1965.""

At the Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper with a conservative bent, it was time for some pride in how differently policing is done north of the border. ""The sad events in the St. Louis suburb give us the opportunity to ponder how we do things differently, and to realize how comparatively well things work here,"" David Butt, a lawyer writing for the paper, {explained}<hyperlink=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/why-the-chaos-of-ferguson-would-be-far-less-likely-in-canada/article20093650/#dashboard/follows/""> Monday.

In Turkey, a U.S. ally with a more complicated relationship with the United States, a number of outlets compared the situation to Turkey's own anti-government Gezi Park protests that began last year. One pro-government newspaper made the comparison on the front page, while arguing that U.S. news networks were ignoring their own crisis:
[tweetbegin 500363602943942657 tweetend]

Meanwhile in Russia, a country with a far more negative view of the United States, Ferguson has become a major news story. As our Moscow-based colleague {Karoun Demirjian writes}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-riots-play-big-in-russia/"">, the riots in Ferguson ""provide an opportunity, in this era of sanctions and new Cold War-style sentiments, to accuse America of being a giant hypocrite."" Russian state television has ominously warned Obama that {the problem may soon become national}<hyperlink=""http://www.vesti.ru/only_video.html?vid=614687"">. Russia Today, a state-funded English-language news network that portrays itself as showing views more mainstream Western outlets wouldn't publish, has {covered the riots extensively}<hyperlink=""http://rt.com/usa/"">. One popular Russian Web site has {labeled Ferguson's crisis as ""AfroMaidan""}<hyperlink=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119104/ferguson-russian-media-maidan-propaganda-racial-tensions""> and says that Americans have ""prejudice towards African-Americans … in their blood.”
Russia's reaction is complicated not only by distrust of the U.S.  government but also an official fear of protests themselves — while Russian President Vladimir Putin seems secure and well-supported now, in 2011 and 2012, his government was rocked by a series of protests in major cities. These conflicted emotions may also be at play in the Chinese media. On Monday, {state news agency Xinhua}<hyperlink=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2014-08/18/c_133564928.htm""> published an editorial that called America's racial problems a ""deeply-rooted chronic disease."" However, as Josh Chin at {the Wall Street Journal has noted}<hyperlink=""http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/08/18/why-china-hasnt-been-milking-ferguson-for-all-its-worth/"">, official coverage of the Ferguson riots has been muted, perhaps due to worrying parallels with situations closer to home. Chin points toward the situation in the far-western region of Xinjiang, where members of the Muslim Uighur minority group complain of suppression by the Han majority, as one possible example.

Notably, the Xinhua editorial, for all its hard tone, {ends with a passage criticizing}<hyperlink=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2014-08/18/c_133564928.htm""> the United States for its criticism of other countries. ""Each country has its own national conditions that might lead to different social problems,"" it reads. ""Obviously, what the United States needs to do is to concentrate on solving its own problems rather than always pointing fingers at others.""

Perhaps the most direct criticism has come from a country that makes no bones about its opposition to the United States. In Iran, {state media has}<hyperlink=""http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/08/18/375727/americans-in-la-protest-police-brutality/""> covered Ferguson riots prominently. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's supreme leader, even took to Twitter to voice his personal disapproval of America's race-relations situation:

“From it all initially happening, I knew this is not right,” witness Piaget Crenshaw told {CNN’s New Day}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2014/08/18/newday-intv-ferguson-shooting-crenshaw.cnn.html"">, which first aired the video. She added: “I knew the police shouldn’t have been chasing this young boy and firing at the same time. The fact that he got shot in his face, it was like something clicked in me … this isn’t right.

Crenshaw said on CNN that she held off releasing the video until Monday out of concern for her safety, based on advice from her lawyer.

The video does not show the actual shooting, although Crenshaw told CNN that she witnessed almost all of it.

Although Brown was running away from police, Crenshaw said that “when he turned towards the cop is when he let off the most shots.” The video shows a body lying in the street along with multiple officers and growing crowds.

Crenshaw is audible in the video, saying: “God bless his soul, the police shot this boy outside my apartment.”

WashingtonPost,wapo194,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/18/white-house-takes-stock-of-the-situation-in-ferguson/,Obama: Attorney General Holder to go to Ferguson Wednesday,Katie Zezima,08/18/2014,03/25/2016,"President Obama said Monday that Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Ferguson, Mo., Wednesday, to meet with federal officials investigating the death of an unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed by a police officer Aug. 9.
Holder will meet with members of the Department of Justice and FBI who are conducting a federal investigation into the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Brown's death has sparked days of protests that, after nightfall, have turned into violent clashes between demonstrators and police in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis.

""Let's seek to heal rather than wound each other,"" Obama said, in his second set of remarks on the situation in the past five days.

Obama said Holder will also meet ""with other leaders in the community who’s support is so critical to bringing about peace and calm in Ferguson.""

In carefully calibrated remarks that echoed comments and a written statement on the situation the president delivered last week, Obama called for people to seek out their ""shared humanity"" and to remain calm.

""While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police, only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos. It undermines rather than advancing justice,"" Obama said.

Obama said constitutional rights, including freedom of assembly and the press, must be ""vigilantly safeguarded"" and that there is ""no excuse for excessive force by police or any action that denies people the right to protest peacefully.""

And the president said he is personally committed to helping ensure that young people of color are not left behind.

""I’ve said this before: In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind, and seen only as objects of fear,"" Obama said.
Obama also said it is likely ""useful to review"" federal anti-terrorism grants that have led to local police departments around the country receiving military equipment like the material that has been deployed in Ferguson.
""There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions,"" Obama said. ""And I think that there will be some bipartisan interest in re-examining some of those programs.""

Obama flew back to Washington late Sunday night from Martha's Vineyard, where he is midway through a two-week vacation. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon deployed the national guard to Ferguson very early Monday after chaos erupted there Sunday night. A barrage of tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets were deployed on protesters and police said protesters threw Molotov cocktails at and fired on police. The administration learned later Monday morning that the National Guard had been called, according to an official.

Holder Sunday {ordered}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/justice-department-orders-new-autopsy-of-michael-browns-body/2014/08/18/023a4d12-2694-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?hpid=z1""> a federal autopsy of Brown's body.

The White House has said that Obama has received regular briefings on Ferguson while on Martha's Vineyard, including from Holder and special adviser Valerie Jarrett. It said the White House has coordinated with state and local officials and that Jarrett has been in touch with civil rights leaders, including Al Sharpton and NAACP President Cornell Brooks.

Obama has made two statements about Ferguson, one released on paper by the White House Tuesday and the other delivered in person by the president Thursday. Until Monday's remarks, he had not taken any questions from the press about the unrest.
Early last week, Obama issued a statement calling Brown's death ""heartbreaking.""

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" the statement said.

Last Wednesday night, the situation in Ferguson turned more violent. Obama was briefed late in the evening, after attending a friend's birthday party; as reports of the unrest were trickling in, the White House said Obama dined on surf and turf and pasta and danced ""to nearly every song.""

A senior White House official familiar with Wednesday's briefing said Obama was ""very concerned about the violence"" and thought his voice might ""help quell the violent reaction.""

The official said Obama spoke with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon Thursday around noon. Nixon told Obama then that he had wanted to give local law enforcement the opportunity to manage the situation, but it had become clear Wednesday night they no longer had the capacity to do so. About an hour later, Nixon's chief of staff called the White House and informed them them of the decision to have the Missouri Highway Patrol take over security under the command of Capt. Ron Johnson, a black man who grew up not far from Ferguson.

Obama then spoke publicly about the situation for the first time, saying Thursday that there is ""no excuse for police to use excessive force,"" and that the city should be ""open and transparent"" about its investigation and plan for protecting the community.",63,NA,NA,NA

On Sunday, {Michael Eric Dyson, a frequent MSNBC guest, articulated this view on Face the Nation}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/what-does-michael-browns-shooting-say-about-race-in-america/"">. First, a few words about Dyson: he's no Cornel West -- he's often been a defender of Obama, including on air.

Not this week. Here's what he had to say about Obama's statements so far (emphasis mine):
And finally I yearn for more response from the White House. This president knows better than most what happens in poor communities that have been antagonized historically by the hostile relationship between black people and the police department.
It is not enough for him to come on national television and pretend there is a false moral equivalency between police people who are armed and black people who are vulnerable constantly to this. He needs to use his bully pulpit to step up and articulate this as a vision, not necessarily in terms of public policy alone, because Eric Holder is doing a tremendous job in filling in those gaps, but we need presidential leadership. He needs to step up to the plate and be responsible.

Dyson's statements represent the most high profile criticism of Obama's handling of Ferguson to date by an African American -- and by someone who has a lot of credibility on these issues.  It's not a statement the White House can so easily dismiss as ""just hatin.""

What's unclear -- yet -- is whether Dyson's criticism represents a shift in sentiment among other rank and file African Americans in this very racially charged situation.  On the other side, voices like Al Sharpton have said that it's unreasonable to expect that Obama get more involved, even rhetorically,  in a state and local matter during an investigation.  Others have argued that Obama would get major blowback if he says too much -- though it's fair to say blowback's part of the picture either way.

Obama did speak out in the wake of the trial of Robert Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin, affirming the frustrations of many African Americans over what many perceived as a miscarriage of justice.  Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus, who joined Dyson on the panel, said that Obama has struck the right tone and he didn't want to go too far and get out ahead of an ongoing investigation.

A fair point.  But, argue some, what's the presidency for, if not to make some sort of order and to bring some sort of clarity to a situation that has left so many people wondering and worried about police brutality, the militarization of the police, race and racism.  Surely, they say, had this happened on George W. Bush's watch, calls for more leadership might have come from Democrats.

The Justice Department and the FBI have launched investigations into the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed teen who was shot six times by a police officer. The president is set to meet with Attorney General Eric Holder this afternoon at the White House, and the expectation is that he will at some point say something about the situation in Ferguson, which has deteriorated since he last spoke out.

Dyson offered a script for Obama, who he says has a unique responsibility and burden to speak out...""we need his leadership, his vision, his unique style.""

The president has a responsibility to say, look, this is one of the key points we expect of him because of his unique experience. ""As an African-American male I know what it means to not have an autopsy report released. I know what it means to have a young man besmirched posthumously with no relationship that we can tell between what that was about on that camera and how he died.

And I'm saying to you that if he could inform American society that, look, yes, we must keep them law, yes we must keep the peace, people must calm their passion, but let me explain to you why people might be hurt, why they might be angry and why they might be upset.

Again, the expectation is that Obama will speak today or at some point after his briefing with Holder.

Brown; Jerry Markon,08/18/2014,03/25/2016,"An unarmed black teenager had marijuana in his system when he was fatally shot six times by a white police officer, two people familiar with the official county autopsy of Michael Brown said Monday.

The autopsy by St. Louis County chief medical examiner Mary Case, released to state prosecutors late Friday, found that Brown, 18, had six gunshot wounds to the head and chest and was shot from the front, the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of Brown’s death, which has triggered violent protests in this St. Louis suburb that continued Sunday night.

In a brief interview with The Washington Post, Case declined to comment on specifics of her examination of Brown’s body but said she welcomes the two other autopsies being performed. One was done Sunday by forensic pathologists Michael Baden and Shawn Parcells, and Case said the second — ordered on Sunday by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. — will be done by Pentagon medical examiners.
""I welcome anyone who wants to do additional autopsies,’’ Case said. “Michael is someone I know and think highly of, and I think highly of the Armed Forces also. I’m not upset at all. This is highly controversial case, and it’s good that everyone interested in it can have a say.”

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown’s family, said Case’s results “sound consistent” with Baden’s highly publicized autopsy, but Crump said he was unaware of any marijuana in Brown’s system. Baden also concluded that Brown was shot at least six times, according to a preliminary report on an autopsy he and Parcells performed Sunday at a funeral home in Ferguson.
The multiple and competing autopsies point up the highly unusual nature of the investigation of the death of Brown, who was killed Aug. 9 by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. It will be up to local prosecutors, along with Justice Department officials conducting a separate civil rights probe of the shooting, to sift through the various findings and determine whether criminal charges will be filed. Federal investigators will take into account Case’s autopsy, along with the federal one, Justice officials have said.

Case’s finding of marijuana in Brown’s system is potentially sensitive but also had been anticipated by the protesters who have flocked into the streets of this community of 21,000 in recent days. Expecting that Brown would be potentially vilified by the results of a drug test, conducted as a routine part of the autopsy, protesters have insisted that Wilson should be required to submit one as well. It is unclear whether that has happened; authorities have released virtually no details about Wilson or his whereabouts.
""What was in the system of that cop when he was pumping bullets into that boy’s body?” asked a protest leader, shouting into a megaphone, during a rally on Friday afternoon.

Brown’s family requested Baden’s independent autopsy because “they did not want to rely on the same institution that executed their son in full daylight. They could not trust what would be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child,” Crump said at a news conference Monday announcing Baden’s results.

Baden, a medical examiner who was featured in the HBO show “Autopsy,’’ has consulted on investigations relating to the deaths of civil rights leader Medgar Evers and actor John Belushi.

During the news conference at Greater St. Marks Family Church in Ferguson, Baden said his preliminary autopsy revealed there were no signs of struggle between Brown and the officer and that all of Brown’s gunshot wounds were survivable except one from a bullet that entered at the top of Brown’s head and went downward through his brain.

Baden said there was no gunshot residue on Brown’s skin, which would determine how far away the shots were fired.

But Baden emphasized that he did not have enough information to make a final determination about what exactly happened in the confrontation.

“We need to look at the clothing. . . . We need to look at x-rays,” Baden said. “They should be available at some time, depending on what the prosecutors’ wishes are. . . . At some point, the decedent’s family should have access to the clothing. . . . The clothing is now in the St. Louis County police agency. It is up to them when the family will have access.”
""There are many witness accounts,” Baden said. “We need more forensic evidence. From a science point of view, we can’t determine which witnesses’ statements are consistent with the findings.”

Surrounded by the family’s lawyers, the medical examiner stood in the church pulpit, next to an anatomical diagram of the body, which showed six wounds.

The family autopsy found that Brown was shot once in the top of his head at the apex. One wound was on his right elbow, with another on his right arm. There was also a graze wound in the middle of his right arm, and a wound to his right hand.
Daryl D. Parks, another lawyer representing the family, said the results supported the contention of Brown’s family that he was killed as he was trying to surrender and that Wilson should face charges.

“The killer shot hit Mr. Brown at the apex of his head,’’ Parks said. “There was a second round near his hairline, which went in and came out. This supports what witnesses said: He tried to surrender. Why would he be shot in the top of his head? Those two things are ample evidence for this officer to be arrested.”",2386,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo198,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/governor-nixon-lifts-curfew-for-ferguson/,Gov. Nixon lifts curfew in Ferguson,Mark Berman,08/18/2014,03/25/2016,"There will be no curfew in Ferguson, Mo., on Monday night, Gov. Jay Nixon (D) announced Monday.

This news comes two days after {he first said a curfew}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/16/gov-nixon-declares-curfew-as-angry-ferguson-crowd-demands-answers/""> would be put in place between midnight and 5 a.m., which he described as an attempt to restore peace after two nights of intensifying clashes between residents and police in Ferguson.

The decision comes after Nixon had announced early Monday that the Missouri National Guard was being called in to help secure the city.

“With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard,” Nixon said in a statement.

The National Guard will operate in Ferguson under the command of the highway patrol. On Thursday, after days of standoffs that were becoming increasingly tense as tear gas and rubber bullets were fired at protesters, Nixon {had placed the highway patrol}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/missouri-highway-patrol-to-take-over-security-in-ferguson/""> in charge of security in Ferguson.

On Saturday, Nixon announced the curfew. But on Saturday night and again on Sunday night, there were standoffs between police and residents.

Al Sharpton told a packed church on Sunday (Aug. 17) that the Michael Brown case would mark a defining moment in civil rights history and fundamentally change the way police engage with the African-American community.

“Michael Brown is going to change this town,” Sharpton said to a massive, boisterous crowd that clapped and shouted in response.

Hundreds filled the pews of Greater Grace Church. More crowded into the foyer, and hundreds remained on the parking lot unable to enter, all in a show of support for the African-American teenager who was shot by a police officer on Aug. 9.

Sharpton announced a future march in Washington on policing. He criticized the militarization of police, saying they act as if they are “at war with ... citizens.” Sharpton urged the crowd to start showing up at the polls to vote and make a difference in the lives of African-Americans.

“Nobody can go to the White House unless they stop by our house,” Sharpton said. “We’ll be here until justice is achieved.”

In addition to Sharpton, Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who took over the police security patrol in Ferguson last week, was on hand to offer support to Brown’s family, as was U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis.

“I want you to know these parents are not going to cry alone, they’re not going to stand alone,” Sharpton said, referring to Brown’s parents, who were also at the church. “We’ve had enough.”

Benjamin Crump, the Brown family’s lawyer, also took the stage.

“We’re here to talk about justice,” said Crump. “We’re here to stand up for our children, because if we don’t stand up for our children, nobody will stand up for our children. They just want what anyone else would want if their child was shot in broad daylight,” he said.

When Johnson of the Highway Patrol spoke he compared Brown to his own son.

“When this is over I’m going to go into my son’s room, my black son, who wears his pants sagging, wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms. But that’s my baby,” Johnson said. “Michael is going to make it better for our sons, so they can be better men.”
Crump told supporters not to lose focus amid news that Brown is alleged to have robbed a convenience store just before the shooting. He called the allegations an attempt to assassinate Brown’s character.

Sharpton first took the stage with the Brown family receiving a standing ovation. Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, overwhelmed by the response, bowed her head, breaking down in tears.

As at previous forums, Sharpton urged demonstrators protesting Brown’s death to do so in a peaceful manner.

He also said Ferguson residents would take to the streets with bright yellow T-shirts, calling themselves “Disciples of Justice,” or DJs, to help contain any violence on the streets.

Sharpton announced a class-action lawsuit for demonstrators who had been victims of tear gas and other injuries at the hands of police, though he gave few specifics.

People turned out with families, babies in strollers and children on shoulders.

Laronda Hodges, 46, a counselor for St. Louis Public Schools, was outside the church with her husband and 13-year-old daughter. “I just want to be a part of making a difference,” Hodges said. Nothing seems to change, she added, pointing to discrepancies in pay, in positions, in elected offices.

One pocket of people huddled around a radio station van broadcasting what was being said inside the church.

But not everyone was happy with Sharpton’s speech.

“He always wants to hush us without handling the whole situation,” said Zsazzi Powell, 27, a stay-at-home mother in Ferguson. “We’re tired of all the pacifying.”

Alicia Berry, 38, a teacher, said Sharpton should pressure the media to not always emphasize the negative. She said the media had paid too much attention to the looting that happened last week, rather than shining a light on those who had worked hard to keep the rallies safe.

“Every race has its handful of fools,” she said.

Berry called Sharpton’s speech “powerful” but said she wanted to know — “What’s going to happen after this?”",0,NA,NA,NA

Whites are not.,Aaron Blake,08/18/2014,03/25/2016,"The situation in Ferguson, Mo., has led to vastly different reactions between black and white Americans.

A new {Pew Research Center poll}<hyperlink=""http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/""> shows many more African Americans than whites say:

The shooting of an unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer ""raises important issues about race"" (80 percent of blacks and 37 percent of whites)
The police response to the shooting has gone too far (65 percent black, 33 percent white)
They have no or not much confidence in the investigation into the shooting (76 percent black, 33 percent white)
As we wrote last week, these kinds of numbers were all too predictable, as they have been repeated over and over in high-profile situations like those involving O.J. Simpson, Rodney King and Trayvon Martin -- in large part because black and white Americans {have vastly different views of the biases of  the American criminal justice system}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/11/in-ferguson-an-all-to-familiar-recipe-for-racial-discord/"">.
The most interesting data point in the new Pew poll, though, is that even at this very early juncture, Americans as a whole see the shooting of Brown as more of a racial issue than the shooting of Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.
While similar proportions of blacks saw both situations as bringing racial issues to light (about eight in 10), whites are more likely to see race as a key subplot in Ferguson (37 percent) than in Martin's case (28 percent). While 60 percent of whites said race received more attention than it deserved after Zimmerman's not-guilty verdict in July 2013, just 47 percent say the same of what's happening in Ferguson.

And it's not just a racial split; it's also a partisan one. While the gap between black and white is 43 points, it's actually slightly larger -- 46 points -- between Republicans and Democrats. Just 22 percent of Republicans see racial issues being brought up, 68 percent of Democrats say the same.

While those numbers could change in the weeks and months ahead as more is known about the shooting, it's pretty clear that this issue is again causing plenty of racial unease nationwide.

And potentially even more so than Trayvon Martin.",488,NA,NA,NA

Jasmine Heiss, an Washington-based campaigner for Amnesty International, was part of the delegation that traveled to Ferguson. Her previous deployment? Palestine.

“What was unprecedented and is unprecedented,” Heiss said of Ferguson, “is the scope of [Amnesty’s] mission.” Amnesty’s response in Ferguson, she added, was more akin to the organization’s work during the {2013 protests in Turkey}<hyperlink=""https://d3d3lmftbmvzdhkub3jn.g00.www.washingtonpost.com/g00/TU9SRVBIRVVTMSRodHRwOi8vd3d3LmFtbmVzdHkub3JnL2VuL2xpYnJhcnkvaW5mby9FVVI0NC8wMjIvMjAxMy9lbg%3D%3D/$/$/$/$/$/$/$""> than it was to any previous action the group has taken in the United States.

Amnesty International routinely sends research teams to report on potential human rights abuses during and after crisis situations in the United States, such as the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. And the group provides ongoing organizational support to certain communities in the U.S. — Hess, for instance, has worked on prisoners’ rights issues in Louisiana.

But this is the first time the organization has sent delegates to support and observe a community in the middle of a crisis.

Heiss, who returned to Washington on Sunday, said the most striking thing she saw during her time in Ferguson was the “overall lack of transparency” from law enforcement.

“Reflecting on our time there, one of the most troubling things is what we didn’t see,” she said, referring to limits placed by law enforcement officials on access to the protests. “When you see this kind of restricting of people protesting … it seems clear that the authorities are using the ill will of some to undermine the rest.”

Some members of the Amnesty delegation, including Heiss, worked as observers during the protests. Others provided direct training and support to the community, including non-violent direct action and “street medic” training.

Heiss is planning to return to Ferguson soon. The Amnesty team, she said, would remain in place in the community until local organizers there determine they are no longer needed.",12,NA,NA,NA

Jay Nixon (D) responded Saturday by declaring a local state of emergency. A curfew was set but has since been lifted, although neither development seems likely to dampen the protests or the swell of interest in the shooting that set the nation on edge.

Some fear the state of emergency could backfire — as they often have for previous states of emergency prompted by unrest.

States of emergency on the state and local level happen all the time, but it's important to note how rarely politics are the immediate instigator for declaring them. For many local officials, nature and disease are the more likely causes of such a declaration.

Declaring emergencies after hurricanes, tornadoes and forest fires has become familiar, especially as the pace of  inclement weather seems to increase indefinitely. Before Hurricane Sandy, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) {declared}<hyperlink=""http://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/552012/approved/20121027a.html""> a statewide state of emergency. The forest fires in California this summer {prompted}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/03/california-wildfires-emergency_n_5645886.html""> Gov. Jerry Brown (D) to declare a state of emergency. After basically every large snowstorm or drought, you see the same. States of emergency of this type are so commonplace as to run together in a entirely unremarkable way, at least on the national level.

Other states of emergency trend toward the more unexpected. Days before Nixon declared a local state of emergency in Ferguson, New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan (D) declared one in her state after 41 people in Manchester {overdosed}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-new-hampshire-governor-state-of-emergency-20140814-story.html""> on ""Smacked!"" a synthetic marijuana known as ""spice"" that is typically found at gas stations and meant to be used as incense. Declaring a state of emergency means that New Hampshire can quarantine certain brands of spice.

Drug overdoses often prompt emergency declarations. In March, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D) declared a state of emergency in an effort to combat heroin overdoses. First responders were ordered to carry a drug that can {reverse}<hyperlink=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/03/27/with-heroin-overdoses-rise-gov-patrick-declares-public-health-emergency-mass/hOajTIJNKnSHKAnWjZ6wYL/story.html""> the opiate's effects immediately.

Fears of contagious illnesses can also prompt emergency declarations. In 2007, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) declared one because of fears concerning the spread of West Nile virus.
Then there are the states of emergency with obvious political underpinnings, whether caused by physical or fiscal discontent. These states of emergency — unsurprisingly, given their overt brush with politics — also face the most pushback. After last year's government shutdown, nine counties in Utah declared a state of emergency, claiming ""{economic disruption.}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksl.com/?sid=27158988"">"" In Western states, dominated by federal land and national parks, tourism revenue from federally funded parks is essential. So the counties wanted the state to do something about it, shutdown be damned. In Maine, Gov. Paul LePage (R) also declared a state of emergency due to the shutdown, so he could rearrange state {operations}<hyperlink=""http://bangordailynews.com/2013/10/09/politics/lepage-declares-civil-emergency-as-result-of-government-shutdown/""> while employees were being laid-off. Unions called the move a ""power grab.""

In 1979, Missouri Gov. Joseph Teasdale (D) declared a state of emergency during a firefighter strike in Kansas City. The National Guard began covering for the federal employees, who had been calling in sick by the hundreds.

And then there is Ferguson, and the similar states of emergency declared before it. Much of the dismay over Nixon's declaration could stem from the fact that similar states of emergency were declared during previous protests with racial underpinnings. In 1971, a black farm worker was killed by a white state trooper in Ayden, N.C. More than 800 protesters were arrested in the following days, charged with gathering en masse during a state of emergency. In 1972, Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards (D) declared a state of emergency after two black students were killed during protests at Southern University. The National Guard was called in, and journalists were barred from speaking with students. Dorm telephones were shut off. The shooters were never identified.

After Rodney King was beaten by police officers in 1991, Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley {declared a state of emergency}<hyperlink=""http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/la_riot/article/0,28804,1614117_1614084_1614519,00.html""> in response to the riots. The governor of California sent in the National Guard. In 2001, the mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio, {declared a state of emergency}<hyperlink=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001-04-12-cincy.htm""> and curfew after a 19-year-old unarmed black man was killed by a white police officer. Tear gas and rubber bullets were used against protesters.

Despite the many different immediate reasons for declaring a state of emergency, they are often only necessary because the communities involved had preexisting problems that had been ignored or put off. If a state's infrastructure bends to the will of the weather, there is no option but to expend massive resources to fix things up after disaster. If the state coffers aren't prepared for financial calamity, a back-up plan that perhaps fudges the rules might seem prudent. If federal employees aren't kept happy, services may fall by the wayside.
And if long-standing racial issues are left unaddressed, unrest will often erupt. These realities have prompted states of emergency for decades. Whether the short-term measure will lead to any big picture change-ups remains to be seen.",0,NA,NA,NA

Three teenagers in Georgia have a response: An app they developed called ""Five-O,"" which lets users report and rate individual interactions with police.

It's essentially a Yelp for police.

Ima Christina, 16, said she and her brother Caleb, 14, and sister Asha, 15, started work on the app at the beginning of the year. It grew from conversations initiated by their parents about police brutality and finding solutions.  The three are well-versed in computer science and design, having dabbled in side projects for some time. The two girls took a week-long course on app development at Georgia Tech, Ima said, while her brother Caleb has used MIT's Scratch programming.

“For us, we’re still trying to process it,"" Ima said of the Michael Brown shooting. ""It’s kind of alarming the rate that’s going on... We have friends and family who are with the police, so we try and sympathize with that side. But we have family members who have had incidents with law enforcement and the police that have been not so positive, so we want to make sure we find a way to balance the two.”

Five-O, which is in beta testing and set to be released Monday for Apple and Android devices, isn't the first app that's intended to hold police accountable. The American Civil Liberties Union chapter in New Jersey {released an app in 2012}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu-nj.org/news/2012/07/03/aclu-nj-releases-police-accountability-app"">, for instance, that let people record police interactions, and provided legal information. Five-O also provides a ""Know your rights"" primer, using information from the ACLU.

People can provide detailed information on Five-O about an interaction with a police officer, including where it took place, as well as their own race and gender. It lets people around the country rate their local law enforcement, and includes message boards as well.
An  app like Five-O underscores how trust of the police is not a given, particularly among African Americans; 70 percent of blacks said police treat them less fairly than whites, according to a {2013 Pew Research surve}<hyperlink=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/08/22/chapter-1-i-have-a-dream-50-years-later/#treatment-of-blacks-by-the-courts-police-seen-as-less-fair"">y.

The developers of Five-O (and their company, {Pinetart, Inc.}<hyperlink=""http://pinetartinc.com/"">), say they don't want to focus on just the bad. And Ima said she doesn't believe the crowdsourced nature of Five-O will encourage only negative reviews of the police. ""We generally think people will be motivated on both sides, whether they have a good interaction, to chart that and put it into the system, or if they have a bad one,"" she said.

The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Michael Brown’s death. Holder updated Obama on Monday about the status of the investigation, which is being carried out by officials “devoting substantial resources” to the task, Obama said during a news conference at the White House Monday.

When discussing the situation in Ferguson, Obama said that while the death of Michael Brown is tragic, he cautioned that he wanted to be careful about his comments.

“I have to be very careful about not pre-judging these events before investigations are completed because although these are issues of local jurisdiction, the DOJ works for me, and when they’re conducting an investigation, I’ve got to make sure I don’t look like I’m putting my thumb on the scale one way or the other,” he said.

But while he said he couldn’t comment on any specific case beyond calling for a transparent investigation, he described “the ongoing challenge” of dealing with communities that have been left behind or feel isolated in the country.

There are protesters in Ferguson who have “legitimate grievances,” but there are also those using the tragedy as an excuse for violence and looting, he said.

Obama, who also discussed the situation in Iraq during the same news conference, called for calm and peace rather than anger and violence.

“Let’s seek to heal rather than to wound each other,” he siad.

Obama again said that while most protesters are acting peacefully, he said that those who are looting or attacking police are only raising tensions. But there is “no excuse for excessive force by police,” Obama said,

“In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,” Obama said. “In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and only seen as objects of fear.”",3,NA,NA,NA

The same is true with Brown.

(This is in public, in the performance of their official duties.)

I’m in favor of such a right, so I’m happy to see this, but discussions with colleagues have caused me to wonder: Putting aside the constitutional questions, as a policy matter what are the best arguments against a right to record?

Here’s what I’ve come up with:

1, sometimes police officers are doing sensitive tasks that would be undermined by publicity, like meeting with confidential informants.

2, bystanders with cameras might try to get too close to a dangerous situation increasing the risk of accidental collateral injury.

3, being recorded might “overdeter” officers from acting quickly in emergencies, analogous to the overdeterrence arguments made in favor of qualified immunity.

4, immunity from being recorded is important to officers, which is why police unions lobby for it, and we would have to raise their salaries a lot if we got rid of it.

Frankly, all of these strike me as pretty weak. (3 is the best I can come up with, but I’m a qualified immunity skeptic, so the analogy actually cuts the other way for me.) But I wonder if I am not meeting the best arguments. Can others come up with better ones?",131,NA,NA,NA

Earlier today, I received an update from my team on two separate issues that I’ve been following closely: our ongoing operation in Iraq, and the situation in Ferguson, Missouri. With respect to Iraq, we continue to see important progress across different parts of our strategy to support the Iraqi government and combat the threat from the terrorist group, ISIL.

First, our military operations are effectively protecting our personnel and facilities in Iraq. Over the last 11 days, American air strikes have stopped the ISIL advance around the city of Erbil, and pushed back the terrorists.

Meanwhile, we have urgently provided additional arms and assistance to Iraqi forces, including Kurdish and Iraqi Security Forces, who are fighting on the front lines.

Today, with our support, Iraqi and Kurdish forces took a major step forward by recapturing the largest dam in Iraq, near the city of Mosul. The Mosul dam fell under terrorist control earlier this month, and is directly tied to our objective of protecting Americans in Iraq.

If that dam was breached, it could have proven catastrophic, with floods that would’ve threatened the lives of thousands of civilians and endanger our embassy compound in Baghdad.

Iraqi and Kurdish forces took the lead on the ground and performed with courage and determination. So this operation demonstrates that Iraqi and Kurdish forces are capable of working together and taking the fight to ISIL. If they continue to do so, they will have the strong support of the United States of America.

Second, we’re building an international coalition to address the humanitarian crisis in northern Iraq. Even as we’ve worked to help many thousands of Yazidis escape the siege of Mount Sinjar, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been displaced by ISIL’s violence, and many more are still at risk.

Going forward, the United States will work with the Iraqi government, as well as partners like the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy and Australia, to get food and water to people in need, and to bring long-term relief to people who have been driven from their homes.
Third, we will continue to pursue a long-term strategy to turn the tide against ISIL by supporting the new Iraqi government and working with key partners in the region and beyond. Over the last week, we saw historic progress as Iraqis named a new prime minister- designate, Haidar al-Abadi, and Iraq’s outgoing prime minister, Maliki, agreed to step down.

This peaceful transition of power will mark a major milestone in Iraq’s political development, but, as I think we’re all aware, the work is not yet done. Over the next few weeks, Dr. Abadi needs to complete the work of forming a new, broad-based, inclusive Iraqi government, one that develops a national program to address the interests of all Iraqis.

Without that progress, extremists like ISIL can continue to prey upon Iraq’s divisions. With that new government in place, Iraqis will be able to unite the country against the threat from ISIL, and they will be able to look forward to increased support, not just from the United States, but from other countries in the region and around the world.

Let’s remember, ISIL poses a threat to all Iraqis and to the entire region.

They claim to represent Sunni grievances but they slaughter Sunni men, women and children. They claim to oppose foreign forces but they actively recruit foreign fighters to advance their hateful ideology.

So the Iraqi people need to reject them and unite to begin to push them out of the land they have occupied, as we’re seeing at Mosul Dam. And this is going to take time. There’re going to be many challenges ahead.

But meanwhile, there should be no doubt that the United States military will continue to carry the limited missions that I’ve authorized, protecting our personnel and facilities in Iraq in both Irbil and Baghdad and providing humanitarian support as we did on Mount Sinjar.

My administration has consulted closely with Congress about our strategy in Iraq and we are going to continue to do so in the weeks to come. Because when it comes to the security of our people and our efforts against a terrorist group like ISIL, we need to be united in our resolve.

I also want to address the situation in Ferguson, Missouri.

Earlier this afternoon, I spoke with Governor Nixon as well as Senators Roy Blunt and Claire McCaskill. I also met with Attorney General Eric Holder.

The Justice Department has opened an independent federal civil rights investigation into the death of Michael Brown. They are on the ground and along with the FBI, they are devoting substantial resources to that investigation.

The attorney general himself will be travelling to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with the FBI agents and DOJ personnel conducting the federal criminal investigation and he will receive an update from them on their progress.

He will also be meeting with other leaders in the community who’s support is so critical to bringing about peace and calm in Ferguson.

Ronald Davis, the director of the DOJ’s Office of Community- oriented Policing Services, or COPS, is also traveling to Ferguson tomorrow to work with police officials on the ground. We’ve also had experts from the DOJ’s community relations service, working in Ferguson since the days after the shooting to foster conversations among the local stake holders and reduce tensions among the community.

So, let me close just saying a few words about the tensions there. We have all seen images of protesters and law enforcement in the streets. It’s clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting. What’s also clear is that a small minority of individuals are not.

While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos. It undermines rather than advancing justice.

Let me also be clear that our constitutional rights to speak freely, to assemble, and to report in the press must be vigilantly safeguarded: especially in moments like these. There’s no excuse for excessive force by police or any action that denies people the right to protest peacefully.
Ours is a nation of laws: of citizens who live under them and for the citizens who enforce them. So, to a community in Ferguson that is rightly hurting and looking for answers, let me call once again for us to seek some understanding rather than simply holler at each other. Let’s seek to heal rather than to wound each other.

As Americans, we’ve got to use this moment to seek out our shared humanity that’s been laid bare by this moment. The potential of a young man and the sorrows of parents, the frustrations of a community, the ideals that we hold as one united American family.

I’ve said this before. In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear. And through initiatives like My Brother’s Keeper, I’m personally committed to changing both perception and reality. And already, we’re making some significant progress, as people of good will of all races are ready to chip in. But that requires that we build, and not tear down. And that requires we listen, and not just shout. That’s how we’re going to move forward together -- by trying to unite each other and understand each other, and not simply divide ourselves from one another. We’re going to have to hold tight to those values in the days ahead. And that’s how we bring about justice, and that’s how we bring about peace.

So, with that, I’ve got a few questions I’m going to take. I’m going to start with Jim Ceune, (ph) from AP.

QUESTION: Right here, Mr. President.

OBAMA: Yeah.

QUESTION: The incident in Ferguson has led to a discussion about whether it’s proper to militarize the nation’s city police forces. And I’m wondering whether you wonder, or if you think that -- you see that as a factor regarding the police response in Ferguson. And also, do you agree with the decision by the governor to send in the National Guard?

Well, I think one of the great things about the United States has been our ability to maintain a distinction between our military and domestic law enforcement. That helps preserve our civil liberties. That helps ensure that the military is accountable to civilian direction. And that has to be preserved.
After 9/11, I think understandably a lot of folks saw local communities that were ill-equipped for a potential catastrophic terrorist attack. And I think people in Congress, people of good will, decided we gotta make sure they get proper equipment to deal with threats that historically wouldn’t arise in local communities.

And some of that’s been useful. I mean, some law enforcement didn’t have radios that they could operate effectively in the midst of a disaster. Some communities needed to prepared if in fact there was a chemical attack, and they didn’t have hazmat suits.

Having said that, I think it’s probably useful for us to review how the funding has gone, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars, to make sure that what they’re -- what they’re purchasing is stuff that they actually need. Because, you know, there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions.

And I think that there will be some bipartisan interest in reexamining some of those programs.

With respect to the National Guard, I think it’s important just to remember, this was a state-activated National Guard, so it’s under the charge of the governor. This is not something that we initiated at the federal level.

OBAMA: I spoke to Jay Nixon about this, expressed an interest in making sure that if in fact the National Guard is used, it is used in a limited and appropriate way. He described the support role that they’re gonna be providing to local law enforcement. And I’ll be watching over the next several days, to assess whether, in fact, it’s helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson.

Steve Holland (ph), Reuter?

QUESTION: Thank you. How do you avoid mission creep in Iraq? And how long do you think it’ll take to contain ISIL?

OBAMA: Well, I have been firm from the start that we are not reintroducing thousands of U.S. troops back on the ground to engage in combat. We’re not the Iraqi military, we’re not even the Iraqi air force. I am the commander in chief of the United States armed forces, and Iraq is gonna have to ultimately provide for its own security.

On the other hand, we’ve got a national security interest in making sure our people are protected and in making sure that a savage group that seems willing to slaughter people for no rhyme or reason other than they have not kowtowed to them, that a group like that is contained, because ultimately it can pose a threat to us.

So my goal is, number one, to make sure we’ve got a viable partner. And that’s why we have so consistently emphasized the need for a government formation process that is inclusive, that is credible, that it legitimate, and that can appeal to Sunnis as well as Shias and Kurds.

OBAMA: We’ve made significant progress on that front, but we’re not there yet, and I told my national security team today, and I will say publicly, that we want to continue to communicate to politicians of all stripes in Iraq, don’t think that because we have engaged in air strikes to protect our people that now’s the time to let the foot off the gas and return to the same kind of dysfunction that has so weakened the country generally.

Dr. Abadi has said the right things. I was impressed in my conversation with him about his vision for an inclusive government.

But they’ve got to get this done because the wolf’s at the door and in order for them to be credible with the Iraqi people, they’re going to have to put behind some of the old practices and actually create a credible united government.

When we see a credible Iraqi government, we are then in a position to engage the planning not just with the Iraqi government but also with regional actors and folks beyond the Middle East so that we can craft the kind of joint strategy, joint counterterrorism strategy that I discussed at West Point and I discussed several years ago at the National Defense College.

Our goal is to have effective partners on the ground and if we have effective partners on the ground, mission creep is much less likely.

Typically, what happens with mission creep is when we start deciding that we’re the ones who have to do it all ourselves. And you know, that -- because of the excellence of our military, that can work for a time. We learned that Iraq.

OBAMA: But it’s not sustainable. It’s not lasting. And so you know, I -- I’ve been very firm about this precisely because our goal here has to be to be able to build up a structure, not just in Iraq but regionally, that can be maintained and that is not involving us effectively trying to govern or impose our military will on a country that is hostile to us.

OK?

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) ISIL (OFF-MIKE)

OBAMA: I don’t think, Steve, at this point I’m prepared to provide a -- a blanket answer to that. A lot of that depends on how effectively the Iraqi government comes together.

I think that you will see, if in fact that government formation process moves rapidly and credibly, that there will be a lot of actors in the region and around the world that are prepared to help and to step up assistance: many of whom may have been reticent over the last several years because the perception was, at least, that Baghdad was not being inclusive and it was going to be self-defeating to put more resources into it.

I think you’ll see a lot of folks step up. Suddenly now, Iraq will have a variety of partners. And with more folks unified around the effort, I think it’s something that can be -- can be accomplished.

It also means that there’s the prospect of Sunni tribes who are the primary residents of areas that ISIL now controls, saying, “We’ve got a viable option and we would rather work with a central government that appears to understand our grievances and is prepared to meet them rather than to deal with you know, individuals who don’t seem to have any values beyond death and destruction.”

OBAMA: I’m going to -- I’m going to take the last question from somebody who, after 41 years, I understand has decided to retire. Ann Compton, everybody here knows, is not only the consummate professional, but is also just a pleasure to get to know. I was proud to be able to hug her grandbaby recently. And I suspect that may have something to do with her decision. But I just want to say publicly, Ann, we’re going to miss you. And we’re very, very proud of the extraordinary and work that you’ve done. And we hope you’re not a stranger around here. So...

QUESTION: Thank you very much.

(APPLAUSE)

OBAMA: Ann Compton.

I suspect you may get some cake at some point.

QUESTION: Yeah?

Let me ask you. This is an interesting time in your presidency.

OBAMA: Yeah.

QUESTION: And one of the things that you have so emphasized in the last few months, the last year or so, is this reach-out to Brothers -- My Brother’s Keeper and to a generation that doesn’t feel that it has much chance. Sending the attorney general to Ferguson is a step. Has anyone there asked you, or have you considered going yourself? Is there more that you personally can do, not just for Ferguson, but for communities that might also feel that kind of tension and see it erupt in the way it has in Ferguson?

OBAMA: Well, Ann, obviously, we’ve seen events in which there’s a big gulf between community perceptions and law enforcement perceptions around the country. This is not something new. It’s always tragic when it involves the death of someone so young. I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed. Because, although these are, you know, issues of local jurisdiction -- you know, the DOJ works for me. And then when they’re conducting an investigation, I’ve got to make sure that I don’t look like I’m putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other.

So, it’s hard for me to address a specific case, beyond making sure that it’s conducted in a way that isn’t (ph) transparent, where there’s accountability, where people can trust the process, hoping that, as a consequence of a fair and just process, you end up with a fair and just outcome.

But, as I think I’ve said in some past occasions, part of the ongoing challenge of perfecting our union has involved dealing with communities that feel left behind, who, as a consequence of tragic histories, often find themselves isolated, often find themselves without hope, without economic prospects.

You have young men of color in many communities who are more likely to end up in jail or in the criminal justice system than they are in a good job or in college.

And, you know, part of my job, that I can do, I think, without any potential conflicts, is to get at those root causes.

Now, that’s a big project. It’s one that we’ve been trying to carry out now for a couple of centuries. And we’ve made extraordinary progress, but we have not made enough progress.

And so, the idea behind something like My Brother’s Keeper is can we work with cities and communities and clergy and parents and young people themselves, all across the country, school superintendents, business, corporations, and can we find models that work, that move these young men on -- on a better track?

Now part of that process is also looking at our criminal justice system to make sure that it is upholding the basic principle of everybody’s equal before the law.

And -- and one of the things that we’ve looked at during the course of where we can make -- during the course of investigating where we can make a difference is that there’re patterns that start early.

Young African American and Hispanic boys tend to get suspended from school at much higher rates than other kids, even when they’re in elementary school. They tend to have much more frequent interactions with the criminal justice system at an earlier age.

Sentencing may be different. How trials are conducted may be different.

And so, you know, one of the things that we’ve done is to include Department of Justice in this conversation under the banner of my brother’s keeper to see where can we start working with local communities to inculcate more trust, more confidence in the criminal justice system.

And -- and I want to be -- I want to be clear about this because sometimes I think there’s confusion around these issues and this dates back for -- for decades.

There are young black men that commit crime. And -- and -- and we can argue about why that happens because of the poverty they were born into or the lack of opportunity or the school systems that failed them or what have you, but if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted because every community has an interest in public safety.

And if you go into the African American community or the Latino community, some of the folks who are most intent on making sure that criminals are dealt with are people that have been preyed upon by them.

So, this is not an argument that there isn’t real crime out there and that law enforcement doesn’t have a difficult job. And you know, that they -- you know, they have to be honored and respected for the danger and difficulty of law enforcement. But what is also true is that given the history of this country, where we can make progress in building up more confidence, more trust, making sure that our criminal justice system is acutely aware of the possibilities of disparities in treatment, there are safeguards in place to avoid those disparities where, you know, training and assistance is provided to local law enforcement who, you know, may just need more information in order to avoid potential disparity. All those things can make a difference.

One of the things I was most proud of when I was in the state legislature, way back when I had no grey hair and none of you could pronounce my name was, you know, I passed legislation requiring videotaping of interrogations and confessions. And I passed legislation dealing with racial profiling in Illinois.

And in both cases, we worked with local law enforcement. And the argument was that you can do a better job as a law enforcement official if you have built up credibility and trust. And there’s some basic things that can be done to promote that kind of trust, and you know, in some cases, it’s just a lack of information. And we want to make sure that we get that information to law enforcement.

So, there are things that can be done to improve the situation, but short term, obviously, right now what we have to do is make sure that the cause of justice and fair administration of the law is being brought to bear in Ferguson. In order to do that, we’ve got to make sure that we are able to distinguish between peaceful protesters who may have some legitimate grievances, and maybe longstanding grievances, and those who are using this tragic death as an excuse to engage in criminal behavior and tossing Molotov cocktails or looting stores. And that is a small minority of folks, and it may not even be residents of Ferguson, but they are damaging the cause. They are not advancing it.

All right? Thank you very much everybody.",11,NA,NA,NA

""I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed,"" he said. Because when the Department of Justice is investigating something, ""I’ve got to make sure that I don’t look like I'm putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other.""

Thanks largely to a question from ABC's Ann Compton, he said more on the topic Monday than he has at any other point since Michael Brown was shot and killed in Ferguson on Aug. 9, the same day Obama left Washington for his vacation on Martha's Vineyard.
Iraq has been a more pressing issue over that period than the events in Missouri, in part because the unrest that followed Brown's death didn't gain national attention until a few days later.

Nonetheless, the president's public comments on Iraq have been much lengthier. We pulled transcripts of his remarks from the {White House Web site}<hyperlink=""http://whitehouse.gov/"">, counting how many words he spent on Iraq, Brown, fundraising and everything else.
(The fundraising comments were from an Aug. 11 event for the Senate Democrats.)

Among the ""everything else"" were commemorations for the deaths of former Sen. Jim Jeffords, who died Monday, and actor Robin Williams. A brief statement on Brown's death was about the same length as the remembrances for the other two. (Excluded from the list are readouts of conversations with foreign leaders. Obama has had 12 such calls since Aug. 9, including talking to the prime minister of Ukraine twice.)

Obama's spent much more time speaking about Iraq than Brown — more than 45 minutes versus less than 20.
(The one minute spent on other topics during Monday's news conference was his tribute to Compton, who is retiring.)

The numbers don't fully convey Obama's clear preference for discussing Iraq over Ferguson. Both on Monday and during his comments last week, Obama led with Iraq. When asked questions after his comments Monday, he was clearly more energized when answering questions about Iraq.

As he said, he has to be careful in what he says about Ferguson, though he did manage about 15 minutes on the topic today. More importantly, one can assume, is that his efforts in Iraq — retaking a key dam from ISIS — are going significantly better than the situation in Missouri, which is largely out of his control.",23,NA,NA,NA

""Whether it was the Vietnam riots, the Civil Rights era, it made an impression when the National Guard showed up,"" says Michael D. Doubler, a historian and retired Army officer who has written a {definitive history of the National Guard}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/guard-National-1636-2000-Department-pamphlet/dp/0160664497"">. ""They were different. They had different capabilities. They looked different.""

Today, as the Missouri National Guard deploys to the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, where protesters and police have clashed nightly since the shooting last week of an unarmed black teen by a white officer, the distinctions are less apparent. This assignment, requested early Monday by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon (D), sits squarely within the traditional mission of the National Guard, even as the public has come to better recognize this part-time force for its full-time roles in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The domestic environment that the Guard enters in Ferguson, though, has changed. The local police now look an awful lot more like the military. And the situation on the ground already resembles a conflict in the late stages of law enforcement escalation. If the National Guard is supposed to bring the power, equipment and gravity of the military, it looks as if it's already there.

""When the National Guard shows up in this domestic role, it is a sign to people in the local community that a higher authority is exerting its power here, whether it be the governor or the president, and hopefully now we’re going to get all this sorted out. That’s a very important thing,"" Doubler says. ""I hope we haven't lost that.""

Ferguson, he says, will be a case study for how a community already confused about the power and intentions of local law enforcement -- {armed partly with military gear}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/militarized-police-in-ferguson-unsettles-some-pentagon-gives-cities-equipment/2014/08/14/4651f670-2401-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html""> -- will respond to an actual military presence meant to restore calm. ""I don’t think anybody knows how this is going to affect the view of the National Guard,"" he says, ""but we’re probably getting ready to find out.""

As early as last Monday, two days after the shooting, the streets in Ferguson were full of officers dressed in camouflage and armored vehicles with gun turrets on top. The city responded immediately to the first rounds of protest and looting after Michael Brown's death with what some critics have likened to the {municipal equivalent of shock and awe}<hyperlink=""http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/saw-ferguson"">. That tactic left little room for a ramped-up force in the face of further unrest.

""On one level, in the case of Ferguson, it’s a little bit backwards,"" says Michael Noonan, the director of research at the {Foreign Policy Research Institute}<hyperlink=""http://www.fpri.org/"">. ""You would think that escalation would [start with] the local policeman, then maybe state policemen, then the National Guard would come in, and they would have the bigger vehicles, they would be more heavily armed. You’d think there would be a natural progression there. In Ferguson, it’s almost opposite.""

Now it's unclear what kind of calming effect the Guard can have — Nixon said he was sending in the soldiers to help restore order — when tensions between law enforcement and local residents have already been so inflamed. It's possible the community at this points needs to subtract officers, not add them. The circumstances that could still restore order may also have little to do with the presence and tenor of law enforcement on Ferguson's streets, but with the community's confidence in an investigation that's still unfolding.
It's possible, in other words, that there's a disconnect in Ferguson between what’s needed and who’s available to provide it. From Nixon's perspective, though, there were few options still on the table this week.

""People forget that governors don’t actually hold a lot of public safety resources,"" says James Carafano, a retired Army officer and vice president of the Heritage Foundation. ""It's not too surprising that the governor would very quickly turn to deploying the Guard, because that’s all he’s got in the cupboard.""

The Guard, Doubler says, is required to undergo annual riot control training, a legacy of its sometimes ill-equipped response to unrest in the 1960s. But the Guard -- which reports both to the President and to governor -- has also been heavily preoccupied for the last decade with an outsized role in America's major wars overseas, even as the law enforcement environment has shifted back home.

""My only concern is that the level of training may not be what you’d want,"" Carafano says of the specific skills that Ferguson requires. ""This is a situation where it’s very sensitive, and you want to get it right the first time. You can’t really learn on the job.""",0,NA,NA,NA

Amid violent protests, U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. ordered a federal autopsy, which was completed Monday by U.S. military medical examiners. It was the third such examination of the same body in a week’s time.

Is there a value in conducting multiple, consecutive examinations on the same body?

Although some experts say that experienced forensic pathologists should have no trouble conducting an accurate second — or even third — autopsy, it’s unlikely that the subsequent examinations would uncover substantial differences in fact.

But the body being examined would be altered significantly: David Fowler, {chief medical examiner}<hyperlink=""http://dhmh.maryland.gov/ocme/SitePages/Home.aspx""> for the state of Maryland, told The Post that the process of conducting the first exam would dramatically alter the appearance of the body, including its organs. Still, Fowler said, those changes would present only minor challenges to experienced, qualified pathologists conducting the second or third autopsies.

To start with, a full autopsy involves the removal and scrutiny of the individual organs. The first pathologist would detach the organs from their places in the body cavity, and from each other. Each organ is dissected and sliced over the course of the examination. The pathologist takes samples as needed. The second pathologist would have to start with the organs already removed, dissected and examined.

By the third autopsy, the pathologist would start with a “a bag of finely-cut, possibly decomposing tissue,” University of Arizona forensic pathologist Veena Singh wrote in an e-mail. “Only the first pathologist is able to see everything as it was at the time of death,” added Singh, who works for the Pima County medical examiner’s office.
But it’s “usually not a big problem for a good pathologist” to complete an accurate autopsy under those more complicated circumstances, Fowler said.

That’s not the only difference in a body undergoing multiple examinations.

“Sometimes in between the first and second autopsy, the body may be embalmed,” Fowler said, adding that embalming “can sometimes alter some of the features externally to a minor degree.”

With each subsequent autopsy, the pathologist must sort through those artifacts of previous exams. Even then, “the external findings (number and location of bullet wounds, for example) should still be the same,” Singh explained.
The difficulty of conducting a second autopsy also depends on the specific case. Some tests and procedures, for practical reasons, only happen once.

In a case like Brown’s, the medical examiner would be concerned with gunshot wounds, along with any signs of a struggle. Fowler said that the evidence on and in the body usually remains intact between the first and the second autopsies.

The external gunshot wounds, for instance, would still be present, appearing “exactly the same” for the second and third examiners, he said. And signs of struggle are usually the same.  “With a one-off event, there aren’t normally substantial differences,” Fowler added. 

Other evaluations are more complicated. Lawrence Koblinsky, a John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor with expertise in forensic science, said that in some cases, the removal of organs might make it impossible to perform a second investigation of bullet trajectory, despite the clarity of the entrance and exit wounds.

However, there are several tools — X-rays, for example — available to experts, in addition to a second (or third) physical examination. The same goes for looking for signs of a physical altercation: Officials investigating a death like Brown’s would not rely entirely on the autopsy to piece together the moments before death, Koblinsky added. 

Singh gave a few other examples of procedures that might only happen once. Sometimes, a pathologist has to cut through a bone in order to remove a bullet or examine an injury. Other gunshot cases require the pathologist to retain a portion of bone in order to de-calcify the sample and retrieve a bullet.
The same goes for a toxicology; in general, Fowler said, samples are collected just once for routine tests. The first pathologist would remove and measure any body fluids as part of the examination. However, it’s likely that there would be preserved samples remaining after the first test, should a second be required.

There are some cases, though, where the second autopsy might be much more difficult. Pathologists would have a more complicated second examination with possible child abuse cases, Fowler said, because of the way pathologists examine bite marks and other signs of sustained abuse over time. 

Despite these challenges, the Brown autopsies should present three very similar — or even identical — sets of facts. But that expected uniformity wouldn’t extend to the conclusions drawn by the pathologists.

“If you’ve got decently qualified pathologists, all of the observations should be identical,” Fowler said, but he noted that, as in most cases involving experienced professionals, the exact same observations can lead to different opinions. 

“There are situations where there are differences of opinion. No doubt about that,” Koblinsky added. But, he said, he doubted there would be a significant difference between the autopsies in Brown’s case. 

“If you gave 10 pathologists the same material they’d come to slightly different conclusions,” Fowler said. And that’s normal, he said. He compared it to a routine check-up for a living human being: “The basic observations are rather like 10 doctors taking a blood pressure,” Fowler explained. “Some might say ‘your blood pressure is a little high, I think you need treatment,'” while another might say that the same patient’s blood pressure, measured at the same level, requires no treatment at all.

But dramatic differences in opinion among experienced pathologists is highly unusual.

So, too, are multiple, separate autopsies upon the same body. “In the six years I have been here in Pima County,” Singh wrote, “I can think of only a few cases where it has happened. And those have been a second autopsy only, not multiples.”
Fowler’s department examines 4,000 bodies a year. He remembers only one case in his time at the Maryland medical examiner’s office where a second autopsy was performed upon a body, sometime in the 1990s, he said.

In the past 10 years, he remembers a single case during which a victim’s family requested a separate medical examiner be present for the autopsy. In such cases, Fowler said, he is happy to honor that request:  “Quite frankly, I love doing it that way because it strengthens our credibility,” he said.  

But families seeking a second autopsy often face substantial bills for the procedure, sometimes including the disinterment of the body in an older case, Kobilinsky said. Still, “when there are criminal matters where families don’t trust the police,” Koblinsky said, some families think it’s worth the cost. 

That brings up another variable in the process of conducting an autopsy: who pays the salary of the pathologist doing the job, and whether that pathologist works independently.

Fowler, whose department is an independent operation within the state’s department of health and mental hygiene, noted that there’s a wide range of systems in place across the country.

Sometimes, an elected coroner’s office is in charge of hiring pathologists to perform a county’s autopsies. Sometimes, that’s the job of a law enforcement department, which can sometimes lead to the perception of bias. In St. Louis County, Michael Brown’s autopsy went to the county medical examiner’s office, which falls under the jurisdiction of the county’s health department.

“From an autopsy standpoint, I actually think the [county] exam was handled appropriately so far,” Singh wrote, “in the sense that the examination was done by an actual forensic pathologist in a medical examiner’s office.” A system like St. Louis County’s  is similar to the one Fowler works in — and it’s what he prefers. “If we can do our function independently,” Fowler said, “then the outcome is the truth.”",9,NA,NA,NA

The facts we now have include these: Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson killed the 18-year-old Mr. Brown when he was unarmed and more than 30 feet from the police car in which an initial confrontation between the two apparently occurred. On Monday, the public got some bits of new information, including {autopsy reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/official-autopsy-michael-brown-had-marijuana-in-his-system-was-shot-6-times/2014/08/18/8c016ef8-26f4-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html""> indicating that Mr. Brown was shot from the front and that the teenager had marijuana in his system. A {secondhand account of Officer Wilson’s side of the story}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/18/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html""> also emerged. But these bottom-line points stand: Police officers have a responsibility to use non-deadly means to defuse situations whenever possible, and nothing on the record indicates that Mr. Brown had to die.

Meanwhile, the Ferguson Police Department continues to fumble the vital job of providing information to the public about the shooting. When local officials have produced information, its release has often been self-servingly selective. Authorities waited days even to identify Officer Wilson. Crucial details of the shooting remain murky — including the officer’s full, on-the-record account of the story — yet Ferguson police released extensive documentation of a convenience store robbery in which Mr. Brown was allegedly involved. If the intent of the police is to avoid prejudicing eyewitness accounts still being collected, this is an awful way of doing so. Instead, this looks like contempt for the public’s right to know, incompetence or both.

There was a moment at which tensions seemed to be cooling. After days of clashes between protesters and police toting military-style weapons, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) relieved the St. Louis County Police Department of the job of securing Ferguson. The Missouri Highway Patrol commander the governor tapped to step in made a concerted effort to engage with the community. Nighttime unrest briefly abated. Then the robbery information and the contradictory explanations for its release helped bring the situation back to a boil.

Police misbehavior is no excuse for violence and looting. But in such a powder-keg situation, a key role for the government is to calm rather than to inflame. The Ferguson police failed that basic test.
It is good that federal authorities are conducting a thorough parallel investigation and that President Obama will dispatch Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to Ferguson this week. Federal officials should conduct their probe as quickly as possible and release as much information as they can, as soon as they can. Not only would that show more respect for the people of Ferguson than their own police have; it would apply pressure to local authorities to conduct themselves more responsibly.

Journalists who’ve been covering the {ongoing unrest in Ferguson, Mo.,}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/justice-department-orders-new-autopsy-of-michael-browns-body/2014/08/18/023a4d12-2694-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?hpid=z1""> for the past week describe being wary of both sides. If they aren’t being threatened by looters, they could be in the path of tear-gas showers and rubber-bullet volleys launched by police. Many journalists have been gassed, and a few have been hurt, although none seriously it seems.

The intensity of the situation is illustrated by the things reporters carry — not just notebooks and cameras, but flak jackets, helmets and gas masks. On Monday, The Washington Post, following the lead of other news organizations, began outfitting its employees with gas masks, purchased at a chain hardware store. Post photographers are among those equipped with an accessory familiar to war correspondents: a blue bulletproof vest emblazoned with the word “PRESS.”

As reporters have discovered over the past week, there’s no journalism textbook on how to cover a riot. There’s also little experience to fall back on: Most of the people covering Ferguson weren’t born yet when American cities were swept up in the urban riots of the 1960s.

Authorities have scrambled, too, to accommodate the invading media army, which now numbers several hundred. Officials established a media zone — an area designated by crime-scene tape — on West Florissant Avenue near the turmoil last week. The “pen” is designed to enable journalists to view officials’ response to the protesters and rioters, and to offer a central spot for news updates. Reporters were told they risked arrest if they left the designated area.

Two problems: There wasn’t much to see from the pen, and the official updates weren’t very helpful. The public information officers “were utterly useless,” said one reporter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his publication hadn’t approved an interview. They “could not answer basic questions [and] gave factually incorrect answers in a handful of cases,” he said.
This has forced reporters to wander farther afield in search of the story, often into dangerous territory.

“I’ve been through [Hurricane] Katrina, so I’ve been around the block, and this might rank right up there” in terms of uncertainty and risk, said {Trymaine Lee}<hyperlink=""http://trymaineleemsnbc.people.msnbc.com/"">, an MSNBC reporter who is covering events in the suburban St. Louis town. “There were a few moments when you felt that anything could happen.”

Ferguson has been wracked by looting and violent mobs on and off since an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, was gunned down by a white patrol officer, Darren Wilson, on Aug. 9. Early Monday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) {ordered National Guard troops}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/governor-nixon-lifts-curfew-for-ferguson/""> to quell the disturbances after a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew proved ineffective on Sunday.

Journalists such as writer-photographer {Amy K. Nelson}<hyperlink=""http://www.sbnation.com/authors/amy-k-nelson""> have defied official police lines to report from the center of the violence and confrontation (three reporters were detained by police early Monday but quickly released). Nelson has covered war zones before but has never been on the front lines. “This is by far the most violent place or assignment I’ve ever been involved with,” she said.

Nelson, a contributing editor to {Animal New York}<hyperlink=""http://animalnewyork.com/"">, an arts and culture Web site that also covers politics and police corruption, has been threatened by looters who objected to her taking their picture. She has dodged flying tear-gas canisters. Neither bothered her much, she said.

Gunshots are another story.

“You can see tear gas coming at you,” she said. “What’s least predictable are the bullets. There’s nothing to protect me when the bullets start flying, and they can start flying from anyone.”

But Nelson muses, “Maybe because I have deep psychological issues, but for me it’s a challenging environment but also an enjoyable one. I know that could be viewed as disturbing to a lot of people, but it’s a comfort zone for me. I kind of enjoy being in the chaos and weaving through it to bring some clarity to the story.”

The Post’s Wesley Lowery, {one of two reporters who were arrested}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html""> last week in Ferguson, said he felt little threat from those on the street until Friday night, when residents apparently were joined by outsiders.

“Ninety percent of the time I was there, the threat has been from the police,” he said. “Friday was the first time I felt afraid of” civilians.
One of the issues in live media coverage of any unrest is whether the coverage itself creates a self-perpetuating cycle, as people see the stories and join in.

St. Louis TV station {KMOV-TV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/""> has curtailed some of its live play-by-play of the disturbances to avoid inflaming the situation, said Brian Thouvenot, its news director.

“The debate here is what does the public need to know, and when that might be a threat to their safety,” he said. “Do we need to break into our [regular programming], or do we cover it on the [regularly scheduled] news? The last thing we want to do is come off inciting more violence or egging on a situation that is not in anyone’s best interest. This is our community, too.”

But sometimes the news media can’t avert its gaze. As the violence flared anew Sunday night, KMOV dropped its regular programming and resumed continuous coverage of the events in Ferguson.",6,NA,NA,NA

Two of those bullets struck him in the head.
There we have the familiar narrative: another unarmed black man unjustly killed. Brown thus joins a long, sad list — Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, etc. — that seems to have no end.

This story line is unassailable. Anyone who thinks race is not a factor in these fatal encounters should have to cite examples of unarmed, young, white men being killed by trigger-happy police or self-appointed vigilantes. Names and dates, please.

But the violence in Ferguson tells of a deeper, more fundamental narrative about what African Americans have done, and what has been done to them, in the decades since the urban riots of the 1960s — the fire last time.
Tempted to conclude that nothing has changed? Please note that the {Missouri Highway Patrol commander}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/state-trooper-tries-to-keep-peace-in-ferguson/2014/08/16/314f1f9a-2579-11e4-8b10-7db129976abb_story.html"">, {brought in to bring proportion and discipline}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/missouri-highway-patrol-to-take-over-security-in-ferguson/""> to what had been a provocative local police response, is black.

And, of course, the president and commander in chief — who also took time from a Vineyard holiday to address the crisis in Ferguson — is black.

Also note that this undeniable evidence of progress on the issue of race — which would have been unimaginable when Harlem exploded in 1964 over {the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy}<hyperlink=""http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/nycdata/disasters/riots-harlem_1964.html""> — makes no apparent difference to the young men who have been rampaging through the streets of Ferguson.

Why not? Because the tremendous gains achieved by some African Americans have not just left some others behind but made their situation more desperate and hopeless than it was 50 years ago.
When the unrest in Ferguson is over, I predict that there will be a flood of ambitious journalism seeking to assess the status of black America. Most of this analysis will be ignored because it will so contradict what many Americans see every day with their own eyes.

Millions of African Americans took advantage of the opportunities created by the civil rights movement to climb into the middle class — and in some cases far beyond, as exemplified by President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder.

Yet millions of other black Americans did not reach the middle class. This group, mired in poverty and dysfunction, finds the paths others took are blocked. They live in neighborhoods with failing schools that cannot prepare them for today’s economy. Secure, high-paying blue-collar jobs are a thing of the past. Racial bias in policing means African Americans are much more likely to be arrested and jailed for minor nonviolent offenses, such as drug possession, than whites who commit the same crimes.

Increasingly, these African Americans who were left behind are invisible. Their neighborhoods either get gentrified — which means they can no longer afford to stay there — or simply bypassed by development. What happens in poor black neighborhoods has less and less to do with the everyday lives of middle-class Americans, white or black.

Yet in Ferguson and other such pockets across the nation, millions of young black men and women grow up knowing that the deck is stacked against them. Did Michael Brown have a chip on his shoulder? Not according to his friends and family, although the convenience store video suggests otherwise. Would it be understandable if he did? Might he have wondered if white kids, living in more affluent parts of town, routinely got hassled by the police for jaywalking?

Brown had no police record. He had graduated from high school. He was about to enter a technical college. Given where he came from, it’s hard to do a whole lot better — and easy to do a whole lot worse.
Now that the streets are filled with incoherent rage — and the rioting must be strongly condemned — we can see Brown’s struggle. Momentarily, at least. After the smoke clears, we will be blind once again.",1821,NA,NA,NA

Even among some reform-oriented conservatives, what might be called the Kemp project — after the late congressman Jack Kemp, who spent a career engaged in minority outreach — is viewed as a secondary concern. They consistently pitch their approach toward the middle class — in part to distinguish it from previous iterations of compassionate or “{bleeding heart}<hyperlink=""http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/mary-kate-cary/2009/05/04/mourning-jack-kemp-a-big-tent-republican-and-bleeding-heart-conservative"">” (Kemp’s phrase) conservatism. The cover of the reform-conservative manifesto — “{Room to Grow: Conservative Reforms for a Limited Government and a Thriving Middle Class}<hyperlink=""http://ygnetwork.org/roomtogrow/"">” — features a lawn mower on fresh-cut grass. The conservative rebirth will evidently spring from suburban yards on a lazy Saturday morning.
Yes, Republicans desperately require policies responsive to the economic anxieties of middle-income voters. Democrats are significantly more trusted on a variety of middle-class issues. But the public critique of the GOP is not merely: “They don’t care enough about the middle class.” It is, rather: “They don’t care enough about the whole.” The Republican task is not merely to shift an impression of interest-group allegiance away from big business and toward suburban families (though this would be an improvement). It is to demonstrate that conservative ideology is applicable to the common good.

In this effort, outreach to African Americans is actually central. A party that does not forthrightly address the largest source of division in U.S. history and American life — now dramatized in the tear gas haze of {Ferguson, Mo.}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/official-autopsy-michael-brown-had-marijuana-in-his-system-was-shot-6-times/2014/08/18/8c016ef8-26f4-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html""> — is not morally or intellectually serious. And even as a political matter, women voters, Catholic voters and younger voters would prefer a chief executive who seeks the interests of all Americans, including those unlikely to vote for him or her. A commitment to national unity is an indicator of public character. The Kemp project has never been more urgent for Republicans.

So it is notable when a Republican presidential prospect such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky attempts to address issues of concern to African Americans. In the context of Ferguson, Paul has emphasized his opposition to the overuse of prisons and the militarization of policing as expressions of “big government.” One result has been a serious media crush. “He continues,” {by one account}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/libertarians-make-their-voices-heard-on-police-in-ferguson-mo/2014/08/14/e780217c-23e6-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html"">, “to set himself apart from others in the Republican Party with the hope of expanding the party’s coalition.”
Precisely because this effort is so important, it is also important to point out: The Kemp project, placed in Paul’s hands, would be an utter, counterproductive failure.

Kemp, you might remember, had both a personal history — as a {pro-civil rights union representative in the American Football League}<hyperlink=""http://www.jackkempfoundation.org/about-us/who-was-jack-kemp/""> and a political ideology suited to outreach. He conceived an active role for government in empowering individuals and reclaiming urban communities.

Paul has his own history. He employed, as a close Senate aide, a writer who styled himself the “{Southern Avenger}<hyperlink=""http://www.mediaite.com/online/southern-avenger-comes-clean-former-rand-paul-aide-warns-gop-away-from-racist-rhetoric/"">” and who authored a column titled “{John Wilkes Booth Was Right}<hyperlink=""http://dailycaller.com/2013/07/09/rand-paul-aide-and-co-author-john-wilkes-booth-was-right/"">.” This personnel decision would have been impossible to imagine from Kemp. But it points out the deep affinity between certain strains of libertarianism and the Lost Cause. While running for the Senate, Paul {criticized the centerpiece of the Civil Rights Act of 1964}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/rand-pauls-rewriting-of-his-own-remarks-on-the-civil-rights-act/2013/04/10/5b8d91c4-a235-11e2-82bc-511538ae90a4_blog.html""> — the part desegregating public accommodations — because it conflicted with his libertarian conception of property rights. And Rand Paul, of course, worked for a presidential candidate in 2012 (his father, Ron Paul) who {claimed}<hyperlink=""http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/05/14/166276/ron-paul-civil-rights-act/""> that the Civil Rights Act “violated the Constitution and reduced individual liberty” and argued that the Civil War was a senseless mistake.

Meanwhile, {Rand Paul’s 2013 proposal}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/22/rand-paul-maps-quick-path-balanced-budget/""> for a balanced budget in five years — which would have eviscerated large portions of the federal government and weakened the social safety net — was less of a blueprint for reform than a demolition order.

Paul has risen to prominence by employing a political trick, which is already growing old. He emphasizes the sliver of his libertarianism that gets nods of agreement (say, rolling back police excesses) while ignoring the immense, discrediting baggage of his ideology (say, discomfort with federal civil rights law or belief in a minimal state incapable of addressing poverty and stalled mobility).

As a senator, this tactic has worked.

The rose petals were crushed. The candles were knocked over. And soon police were standing atop a firetruck, assault rifles in hand, while other officers arrived with dogs.

“That night set the tone. They trampled the memorial. They came with attack dogs. The entire scene was culturally insensitive,” said Antonio French, a Democratic alderman in St. Louis.
What followed, leaders of the African American community said, was a series of missteps that have caused them to lose faith in Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson. Some have called for his resignation.

This is why they have been pushing so hard for federal involvement in the investigation, they said.

“There is no faith in his leadership,” said Jamala Rogers, founder of Organization for Black Struggle, who lives five miles north of Ferguson. “There are people who believe he should step down. I believe there will be a more unified voice on this soon.”

The most notable misstep, leaders said, was Jackson’s decision to release video of Brown that appears to show the 18-year-old stealing cigars from a convenience store at the same time Jackson released the name of Darren Wilson, the officer who killed Brown. Concerns intensified after the community learned that Wilson had no knowledge of the alleged crime when he encountered Brown. They also soon learned that Jackson had released the video despite a Justice Department request to withhold it.

“That was one of the most bizarre press conferences I’ve ever seen,” said Patricia Bynes, Democratic committeewoman of Ferguson Township. “It appeared to be an attempt for character assassination. It could dirty the jury pool. It was just ugly.”

French and other leaders said that Jackson’s failure to apologize, and his decision to ignore the Justice Department’s advice, call some of his actions after Brown’s death into question.
Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III said the friction between the community and the police force has been exaggerated and fueled by agitators in surrounding communities.

“Everyone is screaming at the police chief, but those are outsiders. I have hundreds of e-mails from outsiders calling for him to resign,” said Knowles, who is white and ran unopposed in April when he was reelected. “Not any of them are from the people who show up at neighborhood watch meetings or other meetings that take place every week with this community.”

Jackson quickly recused himself and his department from the investigation, then handed it over to the St. Louis County Police Department, where he has close friends and allies.

He has worked for the department for two decades, and retired from there before becoming Ferguson’s police chief four years ago.A family newsletter from the time included a picture of a cake from his retirement party that illustrated how seamless the transition was. It read: “Happy Retirement/Rehirement Tom!”

“He came from there. I don’t think it surprised anybody when he did that,” Bynes said of the handoff to St. Louis County.

Requests for an interview with Jackson were submitted to a public relations firm that has been hired to represent the department. Representatives from the firm did not respond to multiple requests.

Although Jackson’s actions and the police department’s aggressive response to the protests have inflamed racial tensions, distrust of the department has been a problem for years.

The Ferguson Police Department has 53 officers, three of whom are black. They patrol a community that is 67 percent black and 29 percent white.

In a recent interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jackson said he has struggled to develop a more diverse department.

“It’s been issues like pay and just the job pool,” he said. “Everybody is competing for good quality police officers of all races.”

Officers are required to go through diversity training every year, he added.

But it’s more than the racial disparity, African American community leaders said. Many of the officers live elsewhere, in largely white suburbs. Jackson lives in Florissant, which is 86 percent white, 10 percent black, with less than 1 percent of residents Native American, Asian or other races. Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, lives in Crestwood, which is 91 percent white, 4 percent Hispanic, 2 percent Asian and 1 percent black.
The way the department polices the area is another problem.

Attorney Pamela J. Meanes, past president of the Mound City Bar Association, said the city budget shows that one of the greatest revenue streams is from fines imposed on residents for minor infractions such as jaywalking.

“There were more than 5,000 traffic stops last year — 68 percent were black and only 12 percent were white drivers,” Meanes said. “They have created a system where revenue relies on harassing the community.”

Meanes said this has created a toxic relationship between the community and the police and it is one of the reasons she and other leaders are welcoming the federal probe.

“The citizens of Ferguson have lost faith in the people who are entrusted with protecting them,” she said. “We need the federal government here to take over. It will restore faith and help heal the community.”",46,NA,NA,NA

Brown,08/18/2014,03/30/2016,"On one corner of a battered stretch of West Florissant Avenue, the epicenter of ongoing protests, young men pull dark scarves up over their mouths and lob molotov cocktails at police from behind makeshift barricades built of bricks and wood planks. They call the gasoline-filled bottles “poor man’s bombs.”

The young men yell expletives and, with a rebel’s bravado, speak about securing justice for Michael Brown, {the black teen fatally shot Aug. 9 by a white police officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-three-minutes--and-two-lives-forever-changed/2014/08/16/f28f5bc0-2588-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html"">, “by any means necessary.”

They are known here as “the militants” — a faction inhabiting the hard-core end of a spectrum that includes online organizers and opportunistic looters — and their numbers have been growing with the severity of their tactics since the shooting.
Each evening, hundreds gather along West Florissant in what has become the most visible and perilous ritual of this St. Louis suburb’s days of frustration following Brown’s death. Dozens have been arrested, many injured by tear-gas canisters and rubber bullets fired by a {police force dressed in riot gear}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/14/military-veterans-see-deeply-flawed-police-response-in-ferguson/""> and armed with assault rifles.

But the demonstrators are as diverse as their grievances — and in their methods of addressing them.
Some of the men are from the area — Ferguson or surrounding towns also defined in part by the gulf separating the mostly white law enforcement agencies from a mistrusting African American public. Many others — it is hard to quantify the percentage — have arrived by bus and by car from Chicago, Detroit, Brooklyn and elsewhere.

They will not give their names. But their leaders say they are ready to fight, some with guns in their hands. “This is not the time for no peace,” said one man, a 27-year-old who made the trip here from Chicago.

He spoke after a small group of fellow militants held a meeting behind a looted store, sketching out ambitions for the days ahead.

“We are jobless men, and this is our job now — getting justice,” he said. “If that means violence, that’s okay by me. They’ve been doing this to us for years.”
Police on the streets Monday night said some of those wearing red bandannas are members of the Bloods gang.

The militants are one faction of many that have filled Ferguson’s streets each evening since Brown, walking unarmed between a convenience store and his grandmother’s apartment at midday on a Saturday, was shot at least six times and died.

There is a group of “peaceful protesters” that congregates around the QuikTrip, which was looted and burned during the first night of protest. Another gathers near the Ferguson police station. A third, more scattered faction uses Twitter to organize demonstrators.
“People have been tweeting, ‘We are ready to die tonight,’ ” said Mary Pat Hector, a national youth organizer with {the Rev. Al Sharpton’s}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/sharpton-ferguson-shooting-is-defining-moment/2014/08/17/3bb93c70-265c-11e4-8b10-7db129976abb_story.html""> national action network. “It is a trending topic.”

Hector traveled from Atlanta, hoping her presence as a non­violent protester would help counter what she described as “so much negative energy.”

Then there are the looters, leaderless men who under cover of nightly political protest target liquor stores, beauty-supply shops and other businesses with inventories easy to sell and in high demand.

Ferguson police officials would not quantify how many looters have been arrested since the Brown shooting but presented a Washington Post reporter with a stack of roughly 50 arrest reports. While some of those arrested for stealing are from Ferguson, a large number have addresses listed in Illinois or in Texas.

“It’s like looting tourism,” an officer commented as he showed the reports. He asked not to be named. “It’s like they are spending their gas money to come down here and steal.”
DeAndre Smith, fresh from looting the QuikTrip on a recent night, told reporters: “I’m proud of us. We deserve this, and this is what’s supposed to happen when there’s injustice in your community. St. Louis — not going to take this anymore.”

Many on the streets share that sentiment and feel, in terms of race relations, this city and its surrounding communities never emerged from the civil rights era. Two-thirds of Ferguson’s 21,000 residents are black, but only three of the police force’s 53 officers are.
“This was a chance to vent about the national treatment of black men across the country,” said Ronnie Natch, a music producer and leader of the “peaceful protesters.”

Natch is 30 years old and has a 10-month-old baby. His wife gives out water and fruit to protesters from their base at the burned-out QuikTrip. “We want to show up at the front door every day and say, through words, that this shooting is not going to be swept under the rug,” Natch said. “There have just been too many deaths.”

Missouri had the nation’s highest black homicide rate in 2010 and the second-highest in 2011, according to the {Violence Policy Center}<hyperlink=""https://www.vpc.org/"">, a nonprofit group based in Washington. The city’s school system is crumbling, and Brown’s high school is in one of the nation’s most troubled districts.

“After all the cameras are gone, we have to live here,” Natch said.

Every morning, his group dispatches people to pick up trash and sweep broken glass.

“We can get the same message out without the violence,” he said.

Among those who have arrived are self-described young activists, some of whom participated in the Occupy movement. Many of them are white and have been showing protesters how to assemble homemade gas masks — essentially surgical masks fortified with duct tape. But the peaceful protesters acknowledge they are probably in the minority as the crowd begins to swell on Ferguson’s streets after nightfall.

Dennis Brown, a community activist, described St. Louis and suburbs such as this one as a pot ready to boil over. He said social media has become, in ways similar to its use in recent popular uprisings in the Arab world, an essential organizing tool.

Brown said young people, including many of the “militants,” are organized on social media.

“These young people aren’t dumb,” said Brown, 46. “They are organized. They are smart. They are like computer kings.”

He said that not all are from outside communities. Some are from Ferguson and have been informed by media, cinema and real-life events that to many of them resemble their own lives.
“They are not gang leaders. They are normal people. They are people showing their anger,” Brown said. “They see Trayvon Martin. They saw ‘Fruitvale Station.’ And before that, there was Rodney King. And those cops walk.”

“There’s always a time in history when great things happen to strike at the core of people,” he continued. “These young people are saying enough is enough.”

There is also another group: the elders.

Malik Shabazz, national president of Black Lawyers for Justice, said he has been patrolling West Florissant Avenue each night, trying to keep the peace. On Friday night, he used a megaphone, telling young people to go home.

“The big mission was to make sure there was peace tonight, and we accomplished that,” Shabazz said as dawn approached. “Now it’s time to go home and get some rest. You do this with love and no fear.”

But Kareem Jackson, a St. Louis rapper known by the stage name Tef Poe, said controlling the militants and looters has not always been easy. He recently complained on Twitter about how the “mugs” go to hear Sharpton during the day but fail to show up at night to help keep the young demonstrators peaceful. “All these rappers that rap about changing the world and saving the ppl I didn’t see any of y’all shielding kids from tear gas,” he wrote on the social-media site, “come on fam.”

At least two appeared to hear his call. Rappers Nelly and Ali, both from the St. Louis area, led crowds Monday night in a chant of “Hey-hey, ho-ho, these killer cops have got to go.” But they also urged words over violence. “Songs are more powerful,” Ali said. “Keep it peaceful, St. Louis.”",911,NA,NA,NA

Fahrenthold ,08/18/2014,03/30/2016,"Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. will travel to this battle-scarred St. Louis suburb to oversee the investigation of the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager at the hands of a white police officer, the White House said Monday.

Holder’s visit was announced as National Guard troops arrived to back up local and state police. On Monday night in Ferguson, an early evening calm gave way to new confrontations as some demonstrators threw bottles at heavily armed police and officers threw stun grenades and tear gas towards them.

The day was expected to be a crucial test for everybody in charge here, from local police commanders to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) — who had called out the National Guard after chaotic protests Sunday — to President Obama himself. Obama’s decision to dispatch his attorney general was an admission that the teenager’s killing had become a symbol of something enormous: a test of the American justice system and the government’s ability to police the officers who police everyone else.

Monday was a test, too, for community leaders — including ministers — who had hoped to keep the protests peaceful and focused on the death of Michael Brown, 18.

“We’re helping the police. Please move out the street,” they said over bullhorns, urging the crowds to move back from police lines.
But despite all their good intentions, darkness fell and Ferguson slipped back toward chaos.

“We feel boxed in,” said Kerry Green, 35, a St. Louis native who has been at the protests every night. As he spoke, he was looking at police lined up at an intersection in front of him, a few minutes before the tear gas began to fly.

Green said the events in Ferguson were about much more than one killing, mentioning other cases, including that of Eric Garner, a New York man who died after police put him in a chokehold last month.

“It’s more than Mike Brown,” Green said. “It’s for the man who got choked out in New York. It’s for Trayvon Martin. It’s for us riding down the street with three friends in the car and we get pulled over.”
Earlier in the day, in Washington, authorities said Holder would arrive in Ferguson on Wednesday and meet with some of the FBI agents and prosecutors investigating the case. They have interviewed more than 200 people, scouring the area where Brown was shot by {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/at-darren-wilsons-house-neighbors-say-he-and-his-family-took-off/"">, an officer with Ferguson’s police department.

Also Monday, a St. Louis radio station reported that a woman had called to tell the officer’s side of the story. The station, KFTK, said the woman called herself Josie and said that the confrontation began when Wilson told Brown and a friend to stop walking in the street. The caller said Wilson then decided that the two fit the description of robbery suspects and sought to stop them.

The caller said the men fought near the car, then Brown went a distance away, turned and charged the officer. “He just started to come at him full speed,” the caller said. “And so he just started shooting, and he just kept coming. . . . The final shot was in the forehead, and he fell about two, three feet in front of the officer.”
CNN reported that this account seemed to match a version of events the officer gave to investigators.

Earlier Monday, Obama {addressed the unrest in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/running-transcript-obamas-remarks-on-ferguson-mo-and-iraq/2014/08/18/ed29d07a-2713-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html"">  in starkly emotional terms at the White House. “As Americans, we’ve got to use this moment to seek out our shared humanity that’s been laid bare by this moment,’’ he said. “The potential of a young man and the sorrows of parents, the frustrations of a community, the ideals that we hold as one united American family.’’

As he has before, Obama said that while most demonstrators are acting peacefully, “a small minority of individuals are not. While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions.”

One stark illustration that the Brown case has revealed doubts about the government’s ability to police the police: Three separate autopsies have now been conducted on the teenager’s body. One was done at the behest of St. Louis County, another by private pathologists at the behest of Brown’s family and a third by the U.S. military at the behest of Holder.
On Monday, the results of the county autopsy and the family autopsy were revealed.

The county’s review, released to state prosecutors late Friday, found that Brown had {six gunshot wounds}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/official-autopsy-michael-brown-had-marijuana-in-his-system-was-shot-6-times/2014/08/18/8c016ef8-26f4-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html""> to the head and chest and was shot from the front, people familiar with the autopsy said. It also showed that Brown had marijuana in his system, they said.

Also Monday, two forensic pathologists hired by Brown’s family said their autopsy showed he was hit by at least six shots, one of which struck him at the top of the head and traveled downward through the brain. They said two wounds appeared to be “reentry” wounds. They said that there were no signs on Brown’s body of a struggle and that he did not appear to have been shot at close range because no gunshot residue was found on his body.

An attorney for the Brown family said the autopsy showed that the teenager was “trying to surrender” when he was shot, but the forensic pathologists — Michael Baden and Shawn Parcells — said they could not determine whether that was the case.

Baden, a former longtime medical examiner in New York City, said Brown could have survived all of his gunshot wounds except the one to the top of his head.

The federal government’s autopsy was conducted Monday. Its results have not yet been released.

In Ferguson, the governor canceled the city’s midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew after one chaotic day. The worst night yet had been Sunday, when protesters threw debris at police and officers fired tear gas at the crowd before the curfew even took effect. In Ferguson, Monday night began with a false calm. The side streets off West Florissant had been blocked with fencing, making it harder to reach the scene of earlier confrontations — and harder to leave.
As of 9 p.m. local time, police were standing back, letting protesters move. Some officers, borrowed from the city of St. Louis, handed out water. Somebody in the crowd gave out red roses in Brown’s honor. The crowd was full of white-collared clergy members.

But Ron Robinson, a major with the St. Louis city police, said he could not relax. “It’s not over,” he said before 8 p.m. local time. “It’s gonna get worse before it gets better.”
And it did, again.

A few hours later, a line of police had formed in front of a Family Dollar on West Florissant Avenue, using sirens to try to drive back the crowd. TV cameras showed officers standing up through the roof hatches of armored vehicles, carrying rifles. “If you are standing in the street you are unlawfully assembled and you are subject to arrest,” an officer yelled toward a boarded-up barbecue restaurant.

Members of the crowd pulled a “yield” sign out of the ground and stood in the middle of the street defying the law enforcement officer’s instructions.

Later, just before 11 p.m. local time, a confrontation broke out near the burned-out remains of a Quik Trip convenience store — destroyed in the aftermath of Brown’s death. Dozens of men and women stood at the darkened Quik Trip parking lot. Some held their hands up. A police helicopter flew low overhead.
“If you are on the Quik Trip parking lot, you are unlawfully assembled. You need to continue to move,” an officer said .

The protesters stayed, and set up orange cones. Police responded by throwing out smoke bombs and flares, which engulfed TV reporters in the middle of their liveshots. West Florissant filled with smoke. Demonstrators pulled porta-potties into the middle of the roadways. Around midnight local time, the crowd had thinned down to a few clusters of people — including many members of the media. TV cameras showed a few protesters being arrested after refusing police commands to clear the road.

“Some of the media be like we provoking this. We standing on the sidewalk. They trained automatic weapons on us. [Protesters] threw a water bottle. That’s it,” said Carl Brown, a 26-year-old demonstrator.",4448,NA,NA,NA

Either way, it’s hard to argue Ferguson’s recent riots aren’t heavy. Unrest in Ferguson is about some of the most fraught issues facing the United States. Among them: police brutality, racial profiling and systemic inequality.

Yet in the past five years, this country has seen riots about decidedly less important issues. Among them: who won a game or who the next football coach will be.

“Fans become passionate about their team and try to find personal satisfaction in their team’s wins,” Allyce Najimy, then senior associate director at the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University, told {National Geographic in 2005}<hyperlink=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0620_050620_sportsriots.html"">. “You add the adrenaline, the alcohol that’s often being consumed and in a highly charged atmosphere things tend to set people off more than they would in a calmer environment.”

If you don’t want to get hurt, don’t challenge me.",Sunil Dutta,08/19/2014,03/30/2016,"A teenager is fatally shot by a police officer; the police are accused of being bloodthirsty, trigger-happy murderers; riots erupt. This, we are led to believe, is the way of things in America.

It is also a terrible calumny; cops are not murderers. No officer goes out in the field wishing to shoot anyone, armed or unarmed. And while they’re unlikely to defend it quite as loudly during a time of national angst like this one, people who work in law enforcement know they are legally vested with the authority to detain suspects — an authority that must sometimes be enforced. Regardless of what happened with Mike Brown, in the overwhelming majority of cases it is not the cops, but the people they stop, who can prevent detentions from turning into tragedies.

Working the street, I can’t even count how many times I withstood curses, screaming tantrums, aggressive and menacing encroachments on my safety zone, and outright challenges to my authority. In the vast majority of such encounters, I was able to peacefully resolve the situation without using force. Cops deploy their training and their intuition creatively, and I wielded every trick in my arsenal, including verbal judo, humor, warnings and ostentatious displays of the lethal (and nonlethal) hardware resting in my duty belt. One time, for instance, my partner and I faced a belligerent man who had doused his car with gallons of gas and was about to create a firebomb at a busy mall filled with holiday shoppers. The potential for serious harm to the bystanders would have justified deadly force. Instead, I distracted him with a hook about his family and loved ones, and he disengaged without hurting anyone. Every day cops show similar restraint and resolve incidents that could easily end up in serious injuries or worse.

Sometimes, though, no amount of persuasion or warnings work on a belligerent person; that’s when cops have to use force, and the results can be tragic. We are still learning what transpired between Officer Darren Wilson and Brown, but in most cases it’s less ambiguous — and officers are rarely at fault. When they use force, they are defending their, or the public’s, safety.

Even though it might sound harsh and impolitic, here is the bottom line: if you don’t want to get shot, tased, pepper-sprayed, struck with a baton or thrown to the ground, just do what I tell you. Don’t argue with me, don’t call me names, don’t tell me that I can’t stop you, don’t say I’m a racist pig, don’t threaten that you’ll sue me and take away my badge. Don’t scream at me that you pay my salary, and don’t even think of aggressively walking towards me. Most field stops are complete in minutes. How difficult is it to cooperate for that long?
I know it is scary for people to be stopped by cops. I also understand the anger and frustration if people believe they have been stopped unjustly or without a reason. I am aware that corrupt and bully cops exist. When it comes to police misconduct, I side with the ACLU: Having worked as an internal affairs investigator, I know that some officers engage in unprofessional and arrogant behavior; sometimes they behave like criminals themselves. I also believe every cop should use a body camera to record interactions with the community at all times. Every police car should have a video recorder. (This will prevent a situation like Mike Brown’s shooting, about which conflicting and self-serving statements allow people to believe what they want.) And you don’t have to submit to an illegal stop or search. You can refuse consent to search your car or home if there’s no warrant (though a pat-down is still allowed if there is cause for suspicion). Always ask the officer whether you are under detention or are free to leave. Unless the officer has a legal basis to stop and search you, he or she must let you go. Finally, cops are legally prohibited from using excessive force: The moment a suspect submits and stops resisting, the officers must cease use of force.

But if you believe (or know) that the cop stopping you is violating your rights or is acting like a bully, I guarantee that the situation will not become easier if you show your anger and resentment. Worse, initiating a physical confrontation is a sure recipe for getting hurt. Police are legally permitted to use deadly force when they assess a serious threat to their or someone else’s life. Save your anger for later, and channel it appropriately. Do what the officer tells you to and it will end safely for both of you. We have a justice system in which you are presumed innocent; if a cop can do his or her job unmolested, that system can run its course. Later, you can ask for a supervisor, lodge a complaint or contact civil rights organizations if you believe your rights were violated. Feel free to sue the police! Just don’t challenge a cop during a stop.
An average person cannot comprehend the risks and has no true understanding of a cop’s job. Hollywood and television stereotypes of the police are cartoons in which fearless super cops singlehandedly defeat dozens of thugs, shooting guns out of their hands. Real life is different. An average cop is always concerned with his or her safety and tries to control every encounter. That is how we are trained. While most citizens are courteous and law abiding, the subset of people we generally interact with everyday are not the genteel types. You don’t know what is in my mind when I stop you. Did I just get a radio call of a shooting moments ago? Am I looking for a murderer or an armed fugitive? For you, this might be a “simple” traffic stop, for me each traffic stop is a potentially dangerous encounter. Show some empathy for an officer’s safety concerns. Don’t make our job more difficult than it already is.

Community members deserve courtesy, respect and professionalism from their officers. Every person stopped by a cop should feel safe instead of feeling that their wellbeing is in jeopardy. Shouldn’t the community members extend the same courtesy to their officers and project that the officer’s safety is not threatened by their actions?",8206,NA,"It’s not the police, but the people they stop, who can prevent a detention from turning into a tragedy.",NA

Social media is controlled by algorithms – a mathematical formula that dictates what you see and when. In the past week, people have noticed something curious about the way these algorithms have filtered news about protests in Ferguson, Mo., over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

This is so true and troubling “{@monteiro}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/monteiro"">: If you want to pretend Ferguson isn’t happening just go to Facebook.”

— Tim Dickinson (@7im) {August 19, 2014}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/7im/statuses/501637376867700736"">
The fundamental differences between the two platforms help explain the disparity.

“Because of its brevity, and the ease with which updates can be shared, Twitter is a much more rapid-fire experience than Facebook, and that makes it well suited for quick blasts of information during a breaking-news event like Ferguson,” Mathew Ingram of Gigaom {pointed out}<hyperlink=""http://gigaom.com/2014/08/18/twitter-vs-facebook-as-a-news-source-ferguson-shows-the-downsides-of-an-algorithmic-filter/"">. The non-newsy content that clutters the platform also makes it ill-suited for following breaking news, he added.

Another huge difference? Algorithms. Your Twitter feed isn’t controlled by an algorithm. You see the tweets of people you follow in real time. But Facebook uses a complicated algorithm to determine what ends up in your news feed. They won’t reveal exactly how it works, but the company has said it ranks the content {based in part}<hyperlink=""http://www.wired.com/2014/04/perfect-facebook-feed/""> on what you’ve liked, clicked or shared in the past.
Ars Technica’s Casey Johnson {suggested}<hyperlink=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/08/how-facebook-might-fix-its-trivial-viral-content-glut/""> Facebook’s algorithm also weeds out controversial content — racially charged protests, perhaps? — from users’ news feeds: “There is a reason that the content users see tends to be agreeable to a general audience: sites like [BuzzFeed, Elite Daily, Upworthy, and their ilk] are {constantly honing their ability}<hyperlink=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/03/upworthy-team-explains-its-success.html""> to {surface stuff with universal appeal}<hyperlink=""http://www.wired.com/2014/08/i-liked-everything-i-saw-on-facebook-for-two-days-heres-what-it-did-to-me/"">. Content that causes dissension and tension can provide short-term rewards to Facebook in the form of heated debates, but content that creates accord and harmony is what keeps people coming back.”

Johnson backed up her theory with a Georgia Institute of Technology {study}<hyperlink=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-01/giot-hpd012814.php""> of how political content affects users’ perceptions of Facebook. She summed up the findings: “The study found that, because Facebook friend networks are often composed of ‘weak ties’ where the threshold for friending someone is low, users were often negatively surprised to see their acquaintances express political opinions different from their own. This felt alienating and, overall, made everyone less likely to speak up on political matters (and therefore, create content for Facebook).”

For University of North Carolina sociologist Zeynep Tufekci, this sort of “algorithmic filtering” is more than a matter of technical differences. Last Wednesday, when there was rioting in Ferguson and journalists were being arrested, the events in Ferguson unfolded in real time on her Twitter feed. But on Facebook, where she follows a similar composition of friends, posts about Ferguson didn’t appear in her feed until the next morning. “Would Ferguson be buried in algorithmic censorship?” she wrote {on Medium}<hyperlink=""https://medium.com/message/ferguson-is-also-a-net-neutrality-issue-6d2f3db51eb0"">.
If so, that’s bad. “How the internet is run, governed and filtered is a human rights issue,” she wrote.",25,NA,NA,NA

He is expected to survive the injury.
News reports of officer-involved shootings are fairly regular across the country, but there are no national, comprehensive statistics on these incidents, so it is impossible to say how frequently they happen. Information about those struck by police bullets is also unavailable -- whether they are unarmed or carrying a weapon, criminals or innocent bystanders, black or white. Reliable data would make it easier for citizens to know when officers are acting recklessly, and for police departments to develop methods of avoiding the use of lethal force.

The FBI collects data from police departments on all kinds of crimes, including hate crimes violence against police officers, but the bureau is not required to compile statistics on officer-involved shootings. Data from the state of New York shows that the targets of police gunfire are {disproportionately black}<hyperlink=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/police-shootings-michael-brown-ferguson-black-men?tid=a_inl"">, which would be consistent with {psychological experiments}<hyperlink=""https://d3d3lxbzewnolnn0yw5mb3jklmvkdq00.g00.www.washingtonpost.com/g00/TU9SRVBIRVVTMSRodHRwOi8vd3d3LXBzeWNoLnN0YW5mb3JkLmVkdS9%2BbWNzbGFiL1B1YmxpY2F0aW9uUERGcy9TZWVpbmclMjBibGFjay5wZGY%3D/$/$/$?tid=a_inl""> suggesting that in dangerous situations, people are more likely to shoot at black people than at white people.

The {Center for Policy Equity}<hyperlink=""http://policingequity.org/staff/?tid=a_inl""> at the University of California, Los Angeles has received a grant to compile a national database on profiling by police, which would include data on officer-involved shootings. The researchers at the center hope that their project will help police departments maintain the confidence of the communities they're tasked with protecting.

""There are some tough questions that need to be answered, and as of today, they have not been answered,"" said Denver Police Capt. Tracie Keesee, one of the center's founders. ""For us, the database is certainly the beginning of that.""
Keesee and her colleagues are asking police departments around the country to volunteer information for the project, so the data won't be exhaustive. Still, she thinks many chiefs of police will be eager to participate, especially as they look to prevent the kind of animosity that has thrown Ferguson into chaos in recent days.
""There isn't a chief that isn't watching this and saying, 'It could have been us,' "" Keesee said.

Questions for police include basic ones, such as whether officers shoot more often during summer. The data could also help police recruiters who are wondering what traits they should be looking for when they hire. Senior officers also often want to know whether the training that cops get is helping them deal safely with people with {mental or physical handicaps}<hyperlink=""https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2014%2F04%2F02%2Fus%2Fpolice-shootings-of-mentally-ill-suspects-are-on-the-upswing.html%3Ftid%3Da_inl%26_r%3D5&REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR""> -- which has become a major part of every officer's job.

""The issue lies in how officers are being trained and what they’re being told about their obligations to protect their lives of civilians when they’re on the street,"" said Delores Jones-Brown, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of New York, who has studied shootings by police.

She also noted that many departments have instituted systems to monitor officers' behavior for signs of stress, frustration and violence.

Ferguson police say that Darren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed Brown, had no history of disciplinary action, and it is not clear what Ferguson police could have done, if anything, to save Brown's life. Still, a national database would allow researchers to compare department policies on all of these issues over time and from one jurisdiction to another, so that law enforcement can do everything possible to prevent similar deaths in the future.",0,NA,NA,NA

Reid's Take: The frustration with the White House extends beyond Congress to Democratic interest groups around town. And 18 meetings in 8 months, well, that says a lot on its own.

Cobb Jr., on ‘the challenge of Ferguson’",Eugene Volokh,08/19/2014,03/31/2016,"I’ve generally left the Ferguson matter to my co-bloggers, because I generally haven’t followed the facts closely myself. But Charles E. Cobb Jr., who guest-blogged a few weeks ago on his {“This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed: How Guns Made the Civil Rights Movement Possible”}<hyperlink-""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/07/27/charles-e-cobb-jr-guest-blogging-about-this-nonviolent-stuffll-get-you-killed/""> was kind enough to pass along something on the subject, and I wanted to pass it along in turn.

Charles Cobb is Visiting Professor of Africana Studies at Brown University, a distinguished journalist (with National Public Radio and other outlets), a former member of National Geographic Magazine’s editorial staff, and currently Senior Writer and Diplomatic Correspondent for AllAfrica.com, the leading online provider of news from and about Africa. From 1962-1967 he served as a field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Mississippi; he is also the author of “On the Road to Freedom, a Guided Tour of the Civil Rights Trail” (2008). Here are his thoughts:

I understand racist cops; have encountered a few myself over the years — and I have 71 years. The mostly white Ferguson police force may be racist; in the final analysis, I do not know because in this era of ever-intensifying “national security” in the name of fighting terrorism, local police forces have been armed and empowered in unprecedented ways. One result has been what I simply call swagger; a growing inclination to bully and even brutalize whenever they detect defiance. It is nonracial. We also see this with many TSA personnel in airports.

That discussion is a large one and I do not intend to pursue it here although it provides some context for what I do want to pursue. Reports have suggested a history of anti-black behavior from at least some of Ferguson’s police, and a history of tolerance of it from higher-ups in the police department and city government.

The question is why. And I raise that question in a narrow political sense as distinct from the usual accusation of racism. Let’s be blunt and basic. Ferguson is two-thirds black. Given that percentage, how is it that the 6-member city council has only one black member and the 53-member police force only has three blacks in its ranks? Who and what is at fault here?

The numbers exist to clean house; to get rid of the mayor or police commissioner or whoever the community concludes is working against its best interests. Why hasn’t that happened? If Mississippi towns and counties can now have black mayors and sheriffs, what in the world is wrong with Ferguson?

[UPDATE: Here’s an answer: Only six percent of eligible black voters voted in the last municipal election.] Rev. Al Sharpton says “America is on trial” in Ferguson. Isn’t black leadership also? What kind of black leadership exists in Ferguson that it has not managed to organize the ouster of those in local government? This is not to excuse what I consider the unjustified August 9 shooting of Michael Brown. The investigative process will perhaps provide some answers to whatever questions remain although even with the Justice Department stepping in we cannot be certain.

In any case, the leadership question will not be answered by whatever this investigation turns up. Black leadership seems to have failed. We see this kind of failure right across black communities in the United States, although the black organizing effort to defeat the challenge of tea party-backed Chris McDaniel to Thad Cochran in the Mississippi Republican Party senate primary runoff seems a notable exception.

Admittedly, this is more complicated than usually realized. In North Carolina, for example, the statewide totals show that more blacks turned out for this year’s mid-term primary than the last one. But looking at this primary county by county, according to the nonpartisan watchdog group Democracy North Carolina, black turnout decreased in 8 of the 15 counties where African Americans are over 39% of the registered voters. There is an organizing mission suggested by these numbers that black leaders need to take on that ranges from fighting voter suppression to maximizing the turnout of registered black voters.

Local leadership as we saw in the Mississippi primary is taking on this task. It is often young leadership as with Florida’s Dream Defenders or North Carolina’s Moral Mondays.

National black leadership, however, seems lax. Oh, they will show up to protest incidents of murderous horror. With militant speeches they sometimes generate momentary mobilizations. But when it comes to being insistent and consistent with their time, energy and resources on the day-to-day organizing tasks that could empower black communities, I for one, do not see them. And nowhere is this truer than in black inner city communities besieged by violence — not white police violence, not Ku Klux Klan violence, but by people of color killing people of color.

While it is true that the huge issues of economic disparity, the collapse of public education, and the congressional gridlock that has brought to a halt any meaningful effort to tackle national needs can account for some of the inattention by leaders used to asking the federal government for everything they need, Ferguson teaches a more fundamental lesson that should be paid attention to: There is power to make change if we organize to seize it.",163,NA,NA,NA

He was hammered right and left. General consensus: He seemed tired, passionless, overly measured and vague. He obviously wanted to talk about Iraq more than Ferguson — because there was good news on the one front (retaking the Mosul dam) and nothing good to report on the other.

Those with a temperate mindset will be sympathetic to the president’s dilemma in talking about the Ferguson situation, since, as he noted, his people at the Justice Department are actively investigating the shooting and could potentially bring federal charges against the police officer for violating Michael Brown’s civil rights. But there’s no question that Obama didn’t sound much like the guy who, in the past, has spoken so eloquently about these highly charged and sensitive cultural moments. He did little to address the profound anger of people who feel that Michael Brown was shot for “walking while black.”

Remember the Philadelphia speech? Obama’s eulogy in Tucson? Obama should consider another such national address. Obviously there’s no magic verbal balm that can heal all the hurt and quell all the rage that has been generated in that St. Louis suburb. But I’d hate to see the president race back to the golf course. Obama runs the risk of furthering the narrative that his heart is not in the job anymore — that he’s already thinking ahead to retirement. He’s the president and this is happening on his watch. No one scheduled this crisis — that’s how crises are.

Jay Nixon, with his hulking frame and upswept gray hair, has long been regarded in Jefferson City as a vigorous political talent who used his outgoing personality and love of retail politics to defy the odds and succeed in a state that often can be hostile to Democrats.

His two terms as governor have led to whispers that he might one day be a helpful addition to a national Democratic ticket.

But as rioting enters a second week in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Nixon finds his leadership skills called into question, his uneasy relationship with black voters — a key Democratic constituency — more tenuous than ever and his political future very much in doubt.
Despite a record and a reputation that some regard as too moderate for the Democratic Party’s base, Nixon has occasionally been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate. Several Democratic operatives have described him as an appealing if staid Midwestern figure in a party full of telegenic upstarts from the coasts.

The sudden attention brought on by Ferguson comes just weeks after Nixon, 58, stoked rumors that he was interested in a place on the 2016 national ticket with a visit to Iowa and a trip to Colorado to huddle with major Democratic donors. But instead of ending the summer with more meetings and out-of-state travel, Nixon is hunkered down in Missouri and struggling to avert disaster for his constituents and his political career.
“I don’t think anyone involved gets a passing grade,” said longtime Democratic strategist Donna Brazile. “As it relates to the governor, I think it’s too early to say what will have a lasting impact. He has had to make some tough calls.”

Critics have cited Nixon’s delayed response to the Ferguson crisis as evidence of a lack of leadership and urgency on his part.

He made a stop in St. Louis County on Tuesday of last week, and the protests grew more violent the next day. Nixon then canceled plans to attend the State Fair on Wednesday night and arrived in Ferguson on Thursday to conduct his first news conference, almost five full days after the shooting.

Before his arrival, Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal (D) sharply criticized the governor, accusing him of being out of touch with black voters. “He’s never been to Ground Zero,” she wrote in a sometimes profane Twitter outburst.

While serving as state attorney general, Nixon sought to end St. Louis’s school desegregation program, a move that riled many black leaders and voters.

Over the weekend, Nixon issued an executive order to establish a five-hour curfew beginning at midnight for an undetermined number of nights. On Sunday night, as protesters were pushed out by police tear gas, Nixon ordered the Missouri National Guard onto the streets of Ferguson.

Nixon’s defenders, a small but loyal band that has supported him for decades, say he is making the best of a bad situation, coordinating with officials on what needs to be done. Critics in the governor’s party are “crying now, and they were crying before it happened,” state Rep. Tommie Pierson (D), chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus, said Monday. “There is a lot of politics going on, a lot of people trying to take advantage. But I don’t think his career is damaged, at least not right now. He has handled this as well as he could.”
Oren Shur, who managed Nixon’s 2012 reelection campaign, said the governor wasn’t motivated by political considerations. “It’s premature, and frankly inappropriate, to speculate about politics right now,” Shur said. “Those types of conversations are simply not happening. The governor and everyone around him are squarely focused on addressing the security situation in Ferguson.”

Whether natural disaster or man-made calamity, crisis has often served as a backdrop for career-defining moments in political life, particularly for governors and mayors. Rudolph W. Giuliani’s response as mayor to the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York was the foundation of a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. Long before New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) was praised for his response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012, his {image was seriously damaged}<hyperlink=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/12/chris-christie-criticized-for.html""> in late December 2010 by his decision to remain at Disney World as a blizzard blanketed his state.

This is not Nixon’s first major crisis. That came in May 2011, just 21 / 2 years into his first term, when a tornado ripped through the small town of Joplin in southwest Missouri, killing 161 and leaving more than 1,000 injured. Nixon won praise for his handling of the cleanup and {rehabilitation of the town, including its schools}<hyperlink=""http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/40726c39f1b641ff8601ab8614c435f5/MO--Joplin-High-School""> and other infrastructure.
But managing the cleanup of a natural disaster that came and went in a matter of minutes is far different from trying to calm an angry, economically troubled, predominantly black city with a historic grudge against its mostly white police force. With the Ferguson standoff entering its 11th day, Nixon found himself criticizing the local police force and its militarized appearance in the streets while he was bringing in the National Guard for reinforcements.

“All of us were thunderstruck by the pictures we saw, I mean, the over-militarization, the [military vehicles] rolling in, the guns pointed at kids in the street,” Nixon {said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”}<hyperlink=""http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/mo_gov_jay_nixon_releasing_video_an_attempt_to_besmirch_victim.html""> “All of that, I think, instead of ratcheting down, brought emotion up.”

2016 ambitions
Nixon has been predictably circumspect about his national ambitions, but at a recent Democratic Governors Association gathering in Nashville he said that what the party needed was a “voice from the heartland,” and then he included himself as one of those voices.

“We feed, fuel and clothe the world. We’re the center of the rebirth of the auto industry,” Nixon said in an interview with Politico. “That heartland voice of people that get up early, work hard, have solid values needs to be heard in Washington, D.C.”

In July, he traveled to Iowa, home to the first presidential caucuses, and toured an ethanol plant. This month, he attended a retreat for powerful Democratic financiers in Aspen, Colo. He also said recently that the 2016 field could use a candidate from the heartland who can speak to the concerns of blue-collar voters.

In his 2008 gubernatorial campaign, Nixon played up his ­middle-of-the-road values and roots more than any other part of his political persona. His mother was a schoolteacher; his father was a mayor.

“My parents taught me that you’ve got to fight for people that needed your help,” Nixon said in one ad, in which he drove around his home town of DeSoto, Mo. “I want to make it so our kids and grandkids can come home, back here to small towns in Missouri, and have the same kind of life that we did.”
His reelection victory in 2012 is often presented as evidence that he can perform well among white working-class voters who have been abandoning the party in large numbers. In 2012, Nixon ran up large margins in the suburbs of Kansas City and St. Louis and in Springfield, winning a second term in a rout even as the Democrat at the top of ticket, President Obama, could barely compete in the increasingly conservative state.

Nixon has said he would back a run for president by former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, and he has been described as a potential vice-­presidential contender who could balance the ticket should she win the Democratic nomination. Some think he would enjoy being a Cabinet secretary, possibly leading the Agriculture Department.

Nixon’s inner circle hints at his national ambitions. His media strategist, Doc Sweitzer, is a longtime consultant who has worked for Democrats such as former Pennsylvania governor Edward G. Rendell and former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson. Shur manages independent expenditures for the Democratic Governors Association.

Pierson said Nixon has stayed in close touch with him in recent days and visited the church where Pierson serves as pastor, Greater St. Mark Family Church in Ferguson.

Another key backer is Rep. William “Lacy” Clay (D-Mo.), whose district includes Ferguson; the two have been allies since serving in the state Senate together in the 1980s.

When Nixon arrived in Ferguson, {Clay was at his side}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/LacyClayMO1/status/500743526296977410/photo/1""> during the governor’s first extended news conference, later using Twitter to push the message that Nixon was trying “to protect civil rights, public safety in Ferguson.”

Obama's race speech from the 2008 campaign was a remarkable rhetorical moment -- and one that is impossible in 2014.

But Clinton is a (pseudo-)candidate! Why can't she speak out? One possibility: She's already running as a general election candidate. When we mentioned Martin O'Malley above, you recognized the name because you read lengthy political blog posts about upcoming presidential elections. Most Americans don't, and have no idea who O'Malley is. Hillary Clinton doesn't yet face any real challenge from within the Democratic Party, meaning that there's little political need to stake out progressive positions, like analyzing the racial tensions that underlie what happened in Ferguson. Obama's 2008 race speech, remember, came because he was trying to put the Jeremiah Wright controversy to rest. It arose from that tension. Clinton's campaign is anything but tense at the moment.

The unrest in Ferguson is ten days old, but it still feels new.

With that visit in mind, it may be useful to consider what federal prosecutors would have to prove to obtain a federal civil rights conviction. It wouldn’t be easy.

The elements required to prove a federal criminal civil rights violation are quite demanding.  Here are jury instructions describing the elements of a federal civil right offense, taken from the leading federal jury instruction form book:

First: That the defendant deprived the victim of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States by committing one or more of the acts charged in the indictment;
Second: That the defendant acted willfully, that is, that the defendant committed such act or acts with a bad purpose or evil motive, intending to deprive the victim of that right; and
Third: That the defendant acted under color of law.
Fourth: That died as a result of defendant’s conduct.

The indictment charges that the defendant deprived the victim of the right to be free from unlawful deadly force by law enforcement officers when lawfully being seized [arrested], in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. You are instructed that this right is one secured by the Constitution of the United States. A defendant’s use of deadly force against a fleeing felony suspect is constitutional only if the officer had probable cause to believe that the suspect posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.

2 Fed. Jury Prac. & Instr. § 29:03 (6th ed.).

The tricky thing in a federal civil rights prosecution is proving mens rea — that is, the defendant’s state of mind.  As the jury instructions above make clear, federal prosecutors would have to establish that the police officer acted “willfully” — i.e., with a “bad purpose or evil motive.”  And because mens rea is an element of the offense, prosecutors would have to prove that state of mind beyond a reasonable doubt.

In some of the discussions of the case that I have seen, this critical point has been overlooked.  Some commentators have assumed that the officer could be charged federally if he was negligent or reckless in assessing the need to use deadly force.  For a federal civil rights prosecution, that is untrue.  A federal civil rights prosecution in the Brown shooting will only be successful if the defendant acted with specific intent to deprive Brown of his rights.

Of course, we do not yet know all the facts surrounding the shooting.  According to some media reports, there is evidence (including a recent pathology report) that suggested Brown {had his hands up}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/federal-autopsy-ordered-in-missouri-teens-death/2014/08/17/04fc682a-2679-11e4-8b10-7db129976abb_story.html""> at the time of the shooting.   If he was clearly in the act of surrendering, deadly force would be improper and, indeed, so improper that a federal civil rights prosecution would be possible.  But according to other reports, Brown {doubled back towards the officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2727321/Conversation-recorded-bystander-just-moments-Michael-Brown-shooting-casts-doubt-claims-teen-surrendered-Officer-Darren-Wilson.html"">, apparently charging him at the time of the shooting.  If this is what really happened (or if there is a reasonable doubt about whether this is what happened), the case is not really appropriate for a federal civil rights prosecution.  Instead, the issue would be one to handled under state law, which allows a more fine-grained assessment of whether the officer’s assessment of the need to use deadly force was reckless, negligent, a reasonable mistake, or entirely correct.
Put another way, a federal civil rights prosecution would be a high stakes, all-or-nothing affair.  If prosecutors could show (beyond a reasonable doubt) a deliberate violation of Brown’s rights, then they could secure a conviction. But if the prosecutors only persuaded the jury that the officer was criminally reckless or negligent, the case would end in an acquittal — a result that might well seem unfair to Ferguson residents who would wonder, quite plausibly, why an officer who had been proven to act improperly was allowed to walk.

In light of all this, if the evidence suggests a crime (a big “if” yet to be determined), then the prosecution may well be one better handled under the state criminal justice system, where the appropriate finder of fact will have the full range of possible findings to make: murder, manslaughter, negligent homicide, or no crime at all.

The new date for the opening of the 2014-15 school year was supposed to be Monday, Aug. 18, but authorities decided to keep the schools closed as disturbances continued. Now school is planned to begin next Monday, on Aug. 25. Here’s the note posted on the school district’s Web site, and following that is a letter to the community from the district’s acting superintendent:

All schools in the Ferguson-Florissant School District will be closed Tuesday, August 19 through Friday, August 22 due to continued unrest in and around Ferguson, Mo. This decision was made after much careful deliberation and consideration of input received from local law enforcement officials and District security staff.

We believe that closing schools for the rest of this week will allow needed time for peace and stability to be restored to our community and allow families to plan ahead for the additional days that children will be out of school.

While we deeply regret this delay to the start of the 2014-2015 school year, our first priority is the safety of our students.

Due to this change, the first day of school in the Ferguson-Florissant School District will be on Monday, August 25.

August 11, 2014

Dear Ferguson-Florissant School District Families,

The tragic events of recent days in the City of Ferguson and the surrounding areas are a concern to us as we are sure they are to all of you. To see our community suffering in this way is heartbreaking to all of us.

The safety of our students and staff, as always, is our top priority. As emotions remain high throughout the North County area, and access to some roads in Ferguson remains uncertain, we have rescheduled events scheduled for this week. All FFSD elementary schools’ Meet the Teacher events will be held tomorrow – Tuesday, August 12 – from 3:30 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. McCluer High School’s New Student/9th Grade Back To School Night will now be held Tuesday from 2:30 p.m. to 4 p.m.

We are also reviewing security at each of our schools to ensure safety as preparations are made by staff over the next three days to welcome students back to school, and as students and families return to our schools on Thursday morning.

We believe as educators that restoring normalcy and welcoming our students back to school is one of the most effective things that we can do to advance the healing and rebuilding process. We are coordinating grief counseling and other resources to help us support our students as they return to our classrooms this Thursday, and reviewing first-day-of-school plans to provide guidance for constructive, age-appropriate discussions.

As always, please contact us with any questions or concerns you may have. We look forward to the opportunity serve you and your child during the 2014-2015 school year.

Sincerely,

Lawrence W. Larrew

A new argument is emerging on the right, one articulated by Paul Ryan when he {addressed the issue}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/paul-ryan-lawmakers-shouldnt-exploit-ferguson""> this morning:

“The first thing I do is don’t try to capitalize on this tragedy with your own policy initiatives,” Ryan said in an appearance on “Fox & Friends.” “Don’t try to link some prejudged conclusion on what’s happening on the ground right now.”

“What I don’t want to do, as a political leader, is try to graft my policy initiatives or my preferences onto this tragedy,” he added. “I think that would just be disrespectful.”

Today on Brietbart.com, there’s {an article}<hyperlink=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/08/18/Missouri-GOP-Michael-Brown-Voting-Registration-Booths-Disgusting""> about how appalling it is that some people set up a table in Ferguson to register voters. The executive director of the Missouri GOP says:

“If that’s not fanning the political flames, I don’t know what is,” they quote the executive director of the Missouri GOP saying. “I think it’s not only disgusting but completely inappropriate.”

Imagine — registering people to vote! Disgusting.

This argument isn’t just wrong, it’s precisely backward. “Politicizing” this crisis is exactly what we should be doing.

“Let’s not politicize this” is something we hear whenever a dramatic (and especially tragic) event occurs, and talk inevitably turns to the larger issues and policy implications raised by the event in question. The guardians of the status quo always say that this isn’t the time to talk about those implications (this is particularly true of gun advocates, who inevitably argue that the latest mass shooting isn’t the time to talk about the fact that our nation is drowning in firearms).

But what’s a better time to talk about those larger issues than when the nation’s attention is focused on a particular crisis or tragedy? The events in Ferguson have highlighted a number of critical issues — the treatment of black people by police, the unequal distribution of power in so many communities, the militarization of law enforcement, and many others. Does anyone think that if we all agreed not to propose any steps to address any of those problems for a few months, that we’d actually restart the debate over these issues unless there was another tragedy that forced it into the news?

The emerging conservative “move along, nothing to see here” caucus can call it “exploiting” the crisis if they want, but you can put that label on anyone who talks about it. Are the libertarians and liberals who want to talk about the long-developing issue of the militarization of law enforcement “exploiting” Ferguson for their own purposes? If you mean that they’re hoping that the crisis will lead to change, and making a case for why it should, then I suppose so.
But that’s how change happens. When events draw public attention, they spur people to think about things they might have been unaware of or just been ignoring. Politicians feel increased pressure to come up with ways they can address the problem, which will vary depending on where they’re situated. So members of Congress want to reexamine the {1033 program}<hyperlink=""http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2014/0816/Ferguson-How-Pentagon-s-1033-program-helped-militarize-small-town-police-video"">  that has transferred billions of dollars of military equipment to local police forces, because that’s an area where the federal government’s actions have played a part in what we’re seeing in Ferguson.

Meanwhile, people in that community may be thinking more about their lack of political power, which might lead them to do things like register voters. I’m sure that all over the country, local activists are starting to ask questions about their own police departments and whether they suffer from some of the pathologies we’ve seen in Ferguson. That’s not exploitation, it’s the political process in action.

Since I’m generally cynical, I’m not particularly optimistic that creative and far-reaching solutions are going to come out of this crisis. The deepest problems it has revealed, like the general hostility with which police so often view black people, are the ones that can’t be fixed with a bill in Congress. The militarization of law enforcement is about the equipment they’ve been given, but it’s even more about a mentality that has spread through departments all over the country.

But change certainly isn’t going to happen if we all agree to defer talk about the policy steps we can take to solve those problems until the media leaves Ferguson, everybody’s memory fades, and the urgency disappears. If we want to make crises like this less likely in the future, this is the best opportunity we have.",433,NA,NA,NA

Obama didn't give a firm answer, but he did suggest it's probably not a good idea.

""When they’re conducting an investigation, I've got to make sure that I don’t look like I’m putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other,"" he said.

And for now, that's probably the right call.

As with everything Ferguson, there are no easy answers. But at this juncture, it's pretty clear Obama's presence would be a very risky political move.

Obama has studiously avoided taking sides in the matter, offering little more than general comments and urging peaceful demonstrations. He did announce Monday that Attorney General Eric Holder would visit the area Wednesday as the Justice Department investigates the killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a police officer 10 days ago. But the White House has made clear that state and local officials are in charge.
For Obama, visiting Ferguson would seem, on its surface, to be a good way to calm tensions. But as Obama himself suggested Monday, he can't really do that without looking like he's taking sides. And that's about the worst thing he could do for the situation in Ferguson -- and nationwide.

{As we wrote Monday}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/18/racial-reactions-to-ferguson-even-stronger-than-to-trayvon-martin/""> the issue is already proving to be racially and politically polarizing -- much like the Trayvon Martin case -- with African Americans and Democrats much more skeptical of the police and the investigation and much more likely to believe race was a factor in what happened. Whites and Republicans see the situation in a far, far different light.
So when a polarizing African American Democratic president shows up, it's pretty much unavoidable that it would be seen as a nod to the protesters and their cause.

The White House has been very careful to avoid such a nod. Obama said Monday that they ""may have some legitimate grievances,"" but that's about as far as he's gone. This is because they know even one wayward comment could confirm most people's natural suspicions about which side he agrees with.

Obama found that out the hard way when he made {some off-hand comments}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obamas-vision-of-a-post-racial-america-looks-even-more-distant-than-before/2014/08/17/cdcd0fbe-261c-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html""> critical of the arrest of black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates in 2009 and -- to a lesser extent -- when he suggested his son would look like Martin.

We've already seen a lot of nastiness on both sides of the debate over Ferguson. Obama visiting the city might defuse some of the local tensions, but it would probably only exacerbate what is already a very heated national debate.

Things are serious in Ferguson -- as the arrests ({including journalists}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-journalists-arrested/"">), the tear gas, the violence and the rhetoric demonstrate -- but the temptation to believe an American president can simply show up and put a stop to all of it is far too simple.",43,NA,NA,NA

The tag is still a “small test,” Facebook told The Post, and isn’t terribly visible on the site. You’ll see it only in Facebook’s related-links box, which appears once you’ve clicked a shared link, gone off-site and then returned to Facebook.

Whenever that related-links box turns up a story from, say, the Onion, it will automatically mark that story with a [Satire] tag in the story’s headline. It’s unclear exactly how many sites are affected or how many users are seeing the tag now —Facebook declined to elaborate — but a test Tuesday morning showed [Satire] tags on articles from not only the Onion and its little brother, Clickhole, but also Empire News, National Report, the News Nerd and the Daily Currant.

(“The money is right,” Robert Winland, a writer for Empire Sports, told {The Post in April}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/04/22/i-will-get-the-people-to-buy-into-my-works-just-to-rip-their-hearts-out-a-qa-with-a-professional-internet-troll/"">.) And as fake-news sites proliferate, it’s become more difficult for users to weed them out. A top post on Empire News will frequently boast more than a quarter of a million Facebook shares, far more than on any other social platform. As that information spreads and mutates, it gradually takes on the pall of truth.

In March, a group of researchers at Northeastern University dug into how conspiracy theories proliferate on Facebook, ultimately finding — to quote {MIT’s Technology Review}<hyperlink=""http://www.technologyreview.com/view/525616/data-mining-reveals-how-conspiracy-theories-emerge-on-facebook/""> — that misinformation becomes entrenched when “ordinary satirical commentary or obviously false content somehow jumps the credulity barrier.” Moreover, as the researchers (and Empire News’ share count!) suggest, that kind of credulity-jumping happens … all the time.

What’s to be done? The media has proposed one solution: {regular fact-checks}<hyperlink=""http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/regret-the-error/245622/publications-aim-to-make-debunking-as-popular-as-fake-images/""> of Internet shenanigans. Organizations such as Canada’s {Media Smarts}<hyperlink=""http://mediasmarts.ca/internet-mobile/authenticating-information""> have proposed another: better media literacy education, to ensure people have the critical thinking skills to understand, and question, what they read online.
Facebook, then, has essentially just proffered its own quick fix: If you don’t want people to fall for fake news, clearly mark it — and on the platform where people encounter fake news most.

“We received feedback that people wanted a clearer way to distinguish satirical articles from others [i.e., real articles] in these [related news] units,” a Facebook spokesperson said.

This isn’t a panacea either, of course. For one thing, Facebook’s auto-tag feature predictably miscategorizes a number of fake-news site, potentially lending them credibility they do not in any way deserve. (As of Monday morning, neither Cream BMP nor Witscience.org were marked as satire; after repeat testing, The Post was unable to verify whether Civic Tribune, Huzlers or World News Daily Report got the tag.) It also doesn’t help that the satire markers are confined to the related-links box, which isn’t particularly visible. It’s certainly less obvious than, say, an Empire News post on your wall or in your News feed.

To further complicate the issue, Facebook makes a peculiar advocate for media transparency: The algorithms behind its News feed, which {62.5 percent}<hyperlink=""https://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/uncovering-algorithms-looking-inside-the-facebook-news-feed""> of users are not even aware of, hide 70 to 80 percent of the content your friends and pages post — and do so according to calculations we can neither know nor scrutinize. That situation is becoming increasingly worrisome to news organizations, sociologists, Internet activists and other people who think about the intersection of information, media and democracy; it was, in fact, just {in the news last week}<hyperlink=""https://medium.com/message/ferguson-is-also-a-net-neutrality-issue-6d2f3db51eb0"">, when Ferguson trended on the (unfiltered) Twitter, long before it appeared on many users’ (algorithmically filtered) Facebook.

But regardless of Facebook’s other problems, of which there are decidedly many, it’s nice to see someone push back against the budding fake-news industry — which was otherwise growing unchecked. There’s also reason to hope that Facebook will expand the program in the future: After all, a number of Facebook features, including Graph Search, started out as “small tests.”
Until then, we’re forced to agree with the A.V. Club’s {(satirical) solution}<hyperlink=""http://www.avclub.com/article/facebook-add-satire-tag-automatically-renders-arti-208279?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=feeds"">: Just plaster everything on the site with a “[Stop Reading The Internet]” tag.

The 11,000-student Ferguson-Florissant School District was supposed to start classes Aug. 14 but now is scheduled to open Aug. 25, assuming that the unrest that resulted from the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of a black teenager by a police officer has stopped. This year, the high-poverty district was planning to start a federal program that allows all students to receive free lunches, not only those whose family incomes qualify them for free and reduced-price lunches, {according to this report}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/ferguson-florissant-riverview-gardens-among-schools-offering-free-lunches-to/article_c92d264b-4c18-5e8a-9ab7-1564e77c21f2.html""> in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Ferguson-Florissant is considered a high-poverty school district because many of its students qualify for free and reduced-price lunches — 68 percent of them last year, though it is likely that the real percentage is higher but some families never filled out the paperwork, the newspaper said.

Wishing to help the students in Ferguson, Julianna Mendelsohn, a fifth-grade teacher in Bahama, N.C., came up with the idea of starting a fund on the Internet to raise money so that the St. Louis Area Foodbank could feed students and their families, {according to takepart.com}<hyperlink=""http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/08/18/kids-ferguson-arent-alright-so-inspiring-teacher-set-campaign-feed-them?cmpid=organic-share-twitter"">. She {started a fundraising campaign on Fundly.com}<hyperlink=""https://fundly.com/feed-the-students-of-ferguson"">  that has raised nearly $80,000, which had been her goal.

On the fund-raising {campaign page, Mendelsohn wrote}<hyperlink=""https://fundly.com/feed-the-students-of-ferguson"">:
As the world watches the events unfolding in Ferguson, many people have thought “how can I help?”. As a public school teacher, my first thought is always about the children involved in any tragic situation like this. When I found out school had been canceled for several days as a result of the civil unrest, I immediately became worried for the students in households with food instability. Many children in the US eat their only meals of the day, breakfast and lunch, at school. With school out, kids are undoubtedly going hungry.

ALL OF THIS MONEY WILL GO TO FEED KIDS IN FERGUSON. A dollar or a hundred dollars, it doesn’t matter. You will be helping to put food in the mouth of a child who needs it. Regardless of your opinion on the civil unrest in Ferguson, there is no need for innocent children to go hungry because of it.",11,NA,NA,NA

(COMMENTARY)",Tom Ehrich; Religious News Service,08/19/2014,03/31/2016,"Left to their own devices, residents and officials of Ferguson, Mo., probably could have sorted out the shooting of an unarmed teenager for the apparent crime of “walking while black” on their own.

I know from my years there as a pastor that Ferguson is a strong community — racially divided, yes, and angry at changes in American life that have left them behind. But the town has rootedness, civic pride, strong churches, and a fervent desire to make an integrated community work.

Of course, Ferguson wasn’t left alone. The town’s nearly all-white police force was clearly over its head. The county police, when invited in, stormed the town in military gear and shock-and-awe tactics and made matters worse. Now Missouri National Guard troops are coming.

Media descended on the small city, as well, and the story grew because it reveals so much about who we are as a nation.

That emerging narrative makes grim copy. Young black men across the country tell us the police hound them. Citizens talk about local police forces that seem grounded in white rage. Now, thanks to ill-considered investments in military equipment, those police bring assault rifles, military gear and armored vehicles to police work that can only be done by nurturing trust and mutual respect.

We see also the impact of income inequality, which has drained employment opportunities from former industrial communities and left large groups of young men and women, of all races, but especially black, who have no hope for the future and, thus, no stake in it.

Conservatives cry, “class warfare!” whenever anyone questions income inequality. They suggest ragged mobs rising up against the elegant 1 percent. What would “class warfare” actually look like? It would look like Ferguson: Frustrated citizens wanting respect and a place at the table but being shown instead the business end of an assault rifle.

It is a story seen time and again: Have-nots fighting each other for scraps, while the moneyed set vacations in expensive places.
Ferguson captures our attention because this is the nation we have become: Divided by race; denying opportunity to the many so that the few can live large; politicians spouting ideology and not knowing how to govern; police forces behaving like an occupation army; extremists exploiting a community’s suffering for their political gain.

There is another narrative, however, and it is more hopeful. The Ferguson community has drawn together. Blacks and whites march side by side. Church members put aside their bickering to stand for justice. Town leaders look earnestly for a solution other than brute force. A state highway patrol captain defuses the situation by walking with the protesters.

Local leaders are starting to look forward. A majority black town has white officials and a white police force because blacks haven’t been voting. OK, get out the vote.

An overbearing police presence undoes decades of effort to integrate. OK, change the racial profile of local police and do a better job of training them.

Don’t get lost in nostalgia for what Ferguson was a half-century ago; celebrate the majority’s yearning to integrate successfully.

When the national spotlight goes away, Ferguson will be left to its own devices. Friends there tell me the community is strong enough to move forward and, thanks to this unfortunate wake-up call, more keenly aware of what moving forward will entail.",0,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo247,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/19/ferguson-asks-people-to-stay-home-at-night/,Ferguson asks people to stay home at night,Mark Berman,08/19/2014,03/31/2016,"As turmoil continues to engulf Ferguson, Mo., the city issued a statement Tuesday again asking residents to remain home at night.

“It is our hope that as we continue to work for the wellbeing of Ferguson, residents will stay home at night, allow peace to settle in, and allow for the justice process to take its course,” said the statement, which was unsigned but attributed to city leadership.

This statement, which called for “nighttime quiet and reconciliation,” is not the first time since Michael Brown was killed that city leaders have asked citizens to head home when the sun goes down.

Last week, as the protests in Ferguson spread into a fifth day, {the police department asked people}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/frustration-mounts-in-ferguson-as-little-new-information-is-available/""> to only gather during the day and cited the “violent outbursts” that had occurred at night.

Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, denied that this was a curfew, insisting that if protesters remained out after dark, there would be no action if these protesters were peaceful. Later that night, police again fired tear gas at protesters and two journalists were arrested for failing to leave a McDonald’s quickly enough.

A curfew was imposed over the weekend, with Gov. Jay Nixon (D) {announcing the curfew on Saturday}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/16/gov-nixon-declares-curfew-as-angry-ferguson-crowd-demands-answers/""> as the standoffs between the police and residents again turned violent. Nixon {lifted the curfew after two nights}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/governor-nixon-lifts-curfew-for-ferguson/""> because he had called in the National Guard to arrive in Ferguson on Monday.

In addition to asking people to stay home at night, Ferguson’s statement Tuesday also promised that city officials were meeting with residents and community leaders to address “the concerns raised as a result of this devastating series of events.”

One of the concerns that has been raised is the fact that as Ferguson’s demographic makeup has changed in recent years, {the police force and city leadership have not followed suit}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html"">. Two-thirds of Ferguson’s residents are black, while 50 of the 53 police officers are white. (The mayor and police chief are also white, as are most members of the city council.) Meanwhile, Darren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, lives in Crestwood, {a more affluent and predominantly white city}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/at-darren-wilsons-house-neighbors-say-he-and-his-family-took-off/""> in the region.
Now that these issues have been brought to the fore and these statistics have become part of the public discussion surrounding Ferguson, the city said it is considering actions to address the problem. City leaders are looking at programs that could increase the number of black applicants to the police force in Ferguson (and in neighboring cities) as well as trying to encourage residents to live in the city they are policing. The city also said it will raise funds to outfit its officers with cameras.",2,NA,NA,NA

Curtis,08/19/2014,03/31/2016,"While playing with my 2½ -year-old great-nephew was a joyous distraction from the events of Ferguson, Mo., this past week, it was also a reminder that the shelf life for innocence is short when you are a black male — and there is no room for error.

Everywhere the family went with my adorable toddling guest — touring a transportation museum and riding the train there, playing in the kiddie pool at the Y, taking a walk down the street — we were greeted with smiles. Even when he tried to plunge into the fountain reserved for pennies and wishes, his indiscretion elicited smiles, not stern glances.
I wondered how long he would get the benefit of the doubt and not the side eye. It was a question on my mind when I raised my now-grown son – a good man but no saint. He played by the rules and still had his unwarranted traffic stop that resulted in a ticket he fought because he was just that angry. He thankfully controlled his frustration in his interaction with official authority, a lesson I taught reluctantly, figuring a bit of damage to his spirit was preferable to any other sort.

In the case of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/holder-headed-to-ferguson-on-wednesday-will-oversee-federal-response-to-shooting/2014/08/19/d60e203c-2757-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?wpisrc=nl_hdtop"">, unarmed when he was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, the vilification of character — his and that of the protesters seeking justice — quickly followed his confrontation with Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. It was a familiar scene.

Ferguson’s police chief, {Thomas Jackson}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-releasing-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown/"">, whose authority was usurped, might have been calculating and cynical when he released a video allegedly showing Brown in an altercation and robbery at a convenience store on the day he was killed. The release of the tape was an attempt to shift the narrative into the “blame the victim” strategy, and it almost certainly triggered an escalation of unrest that had died down. It might have endangered the community and citizens that Jackson is supposed to protect, but the St. Louis suburb’s top cop certainly knew what he was doing.

It was a contrast to Charlotte’s own case of an unarmed black man shot by a police officer, when the chief of police, Rodney Monroe, who happens to be African American, conducted an investigation quickly. Randall Kerrick of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department is out on bond as he awaits trial on a charge of voluntary manslaughter in the shooting last year of {Jonathan Ferrell}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2013/09/17/after-jonathan-ferrell-shooting-a-plea-for-the-benefit-of-the-doubt-for-young-black-men/"">, who sought help after a car accident. (Charlotte should not, however, get too complacent, as underlying issues of economic inequality, poverty, lack of job opportunities and challenges in public education – at the core of discontent in Ferguson – haunt the New South poster child, as well.)

In Ferguson, the public still has not seen an incident report of the events of that day — any information would be welcomed. But many observers who were cautioning patience before a rush to judgment wasted no time in judging the whole of Michael Brown from a few glimpses.
Who knows what multiple investigations will eventually reveal about just what happened in those few minutes, fatal for Brown and life changing for Wilson? But it is possible to be both the loving son and grandson that Brown’s family remembers and someone who stole a box of cigarillos, as much as it is to be a police officer who was in fear and also may have misjudged the moment.

Based on hardened and preconceived notions of what it means to be a large black teen, some have filled in the blanks and closed the case after predicting the 18-year-old would have come to an inevitable bad end.

They are making him less than human in the same way some supporters were building him up as something more.

This is happening in a time when schoolyard fights or cursing at a teacher, offenses that in the past merited a trip to the principal’s office, can now land students — disproportionately African American and Latino ones — in court and with a record that follows them forever. {Suspensions}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/dc-bill-would-ban-school-suspensions-for-citys-pre-k-students/2014/07/13/3af8270c-07b6-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a_story.html""> start in pre-K, a trend that local school systems and federal officials are trying to reverse.

When I was a teenager, attending a predominantly white high school and college, the fact that both were Catholic institutions did not make every classmate an altar boy or girl. Random {drug test}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/08/18/probe-into-michael-brown-shooting-goes-to-pot/""> results might have reported the marijuana levels reportedly found in Brown’s, which have added “drug crazed” to his profile. That didn’t stop these good students and mostly good people, after occasional steps off the straight and narrow, from eventually figuring out how to navigate life.

As an adult, I have friends and acquaintances of every race and economic situation whose children have been involved in scrapes that crossed a line. Some have struggled with addiction and other demons; most, with love and support, have made it to the other side and are happy, healthy and successful. Many were given second, third and more chances, which Brown will never get.

His parents, in their mourning, have asked for peace, and the crowds at the town meetings, though angry, have heeded their plea. Most street protesters, diverse in the photos I’ve seen, have done the same, marching with purpose but not violence. They have tried to protect stores from the looting by those who have swept in to take advantage of the chaos. A report in The {Washington Post}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ferguson-protesters-the-peaceful-the-elders-the-looters-and-the-militants/2014/08/18/d6be1262-26f3-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html?wpisrc=nl_hdtop""> explained how crowd members, young and old, are far from monolithic.

Yet in much of the public comment and the immediate police response, no such distinction was made, with reports of citizens tear-gassed in their yards and scenes of snipers with guns aimed at unarmed men, women and children.

It breaks my heart that he’s learned his early lesson only too well, and that I still worry. I hate that the little boy who knocked down blocks as quickly as we could stack them this past week will have to always be as perfect as I already think he is.

Amnesty International {sent a delegation to the Missouri city}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/amnesty-international-has-come-to-ferguson/""> last week to offer community support and to monitor the police response to the protests.

The CSIS tweet has since been deleted -- but not before people grabbed screen captures of the exchange over police treatment of protesters in Ferguson between the human rights organization and the foreign policy-focused  think tank.
[tweetbegin 501607680159789056 tweetend]
CSIS appears to have acknowledged the tweet -- sending out an apology to Amnesty and its followers:
[tweetbegin 501625488423796736 tweetend]
Andrew Schwartz, senior vice president of external relations at CSIS, said that he's personally embarrassed by the incident and that his colleagues are ""equally distressed."" The tweet, he said, ""was sent by a CSIS intern who had access to our account for monitoring purposes.""

The intern made a classic social media faux pas, Schwartz said: ""He meant to send something reflecting his personal views from his personal Twitter account,"" but instead sent it from the think tank's account. While Schwartz did not comment specifically on repercussions the intern might face, it didn't sound good: ""I find his views and the way he expressed them to be abhorrent and will take appropriate action at CSIS to address the matter internally,"" he told The Post, adding that CSIS has also reached out to Amnesty outside of Twitter to offer an apology. Schwartz also noted that the organization is working on alternative social media management protocols.

Social media managers will no doubt feel some sympathy for the intern, who's not the first person to mix up personal and professional accounts to cringeworthy results. In a similar account mix-up back in 2011, the person managing the America Red Cross Twitter account {tweeted}<hyperlink=""http://redcrosschat.org/2011/02/16/twitter-faux-pas/#sthash.0EsvuMk7.dpbs""> about a plan to get ""slizzerd"" -- or drunk -- on a recently discovered cache of Dogfish head beer. The Red Cross deleted the ""rogue tweet"" -- but took a humorous approach, noting that they were tweeting sober and had ""confiscated the keys"" to the account. It worked: Many took pity on the group, and Dogfish Head started encouraging blood donations from its fans.

Obviously, there are some limits to the parallels: The Red Cross accidentally tweeted about some off-hour fun. CSIS, on the other hand, accidentally insulted a well respected human rights organization while endorsing a specific (and sometimes controversial) foreign policy tactic as protesters were literally running from tear gas on the streets of Ferguson. So a somber apology probably was the best way for CSIS to handle the situation.
But perhaps what's most damning about the think tank's slip-up is that readers might believe there was a grain of truth in the rogue tweet as far as policy strategy, if not the profane suggestion: While not the most hawkish of think tanks, some CSIS experts do seem to be in favor of an interventionist approach to foreign policy. In fact, the group's Internet home page is currently promoting commentary from Anthony Cordesman, the Burke Chair in Strategy at the institution and a former director of intelligence assessment in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, titled ""{Iraq: A Time to Act.}<hyperlink=""https://csis.org/publication/iraq-time-act"">""
So, members of the public might be forgiven for thinking that the intern who was said to be behind the problem had simply made the mistake of expressing what those on the inside actually think -- in fact, some Twitter users have suggested {just that}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/Figmentosity/status/501632490243907584"">.
Schwartz, however, noted that CSIS is a nonpartisan, independent research institution that ""does not take positions as a whole"" and that the group's scholars have a ""have a wide range of positions regarding intervention, and their opinions are their own.""",4,NA,NA,NA

Reviewing two books — a 1972 study of organized crime and {“On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City,”}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/022613671X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=022613671X&linkCode=as2&tag=thewaspos09-20&linkId=BUBJBX3DZ2WY3WFN""> Alice Goffman’s new book about policing in Philadelphia — Gladwell argues that certain policing strategies have fractured American society rather than bringing us together in a more robust community.
“Irish gangsters dominated organized crime in the urban Northeast in the mid to late nineteenth century, followed by the Jewish gangsters—Meyer Lansky, Arnold Rothstein, and Dutch Schultz, among others. Then it was the Italians’ turn,” Gladwell wrote. “The point of the crooked-ladder argument and ‘A Family Business’ was that criminal activity, under those circumstances, was not rebellion; it wasn’t a rejection of legitimate society. It was an attempt to join in.”
But, as Gladwell explains, once European immigrant groups were assimilated into both whiteness and the legitimate economy, the ladder got kicked over or pulled up.

Where law enforcement once showed tolerance for earlier criminal enterprises that could be parlayed into legitimate businesses, “The police buried the local male population under a blizzard of arrest warrants: some were ‘body’ warrants for suspected crimes, but most were bench and technical warrants for failure to appear in court or to pay court fees, or for violations of probation or parole.”

These policing policies do not simply deny young men of color the time to transition into the licit economy as entrepreneurs or business owners. They make it exceptionally difficult for them to enter it at any level. These policies interacted with cultural narratives that suggested people of color were uninterested in the path trod by others before them, preferring criminal activity or welfare to work.
But just because the route is narrowed or closed entirely, dreams of following the route suggested by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola in “The Godfather” persist in culture created by and about black men, even when there is a melancholic note to them.

In a remix of Kanye West’s “Diamonds From Sierra Leone,” Jay Z famously boasted that he had made the rare transition from the illicit economy to the legal one and not just survived, but thrived: “I sold kilos of coke, I’m guessin’ I can sell CDs / I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man!” West, who set himself to conquering the fashion industry after making his mark in rap, rechristened himself the “Louis Vuitton Don.”

These men are the exceptions. “American Gangster,” Ridley Scott’s 2007 biopic of drug dealer Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), traces the contraction of this trajectory from one generation to the next. After inheriting a crime operation from an older gangster (Clarence Williams III) who retains a respectable role in his Harlem community, Lucas dramatically expands the scope of his dealing and the range of his lines of business.

Those ambitions make him a target for prosecution, rather than for transition into legitimate businesses. His predecessor’s limited scope could be tolerated. Lucas’s good seats at the Frazier-Ali fight in 1971 and the fur coat and hat he wears to it cannot. If Lucas were white, he might have become Michael Corleone, unhappy but solidly entrenched in both the U.S.  economy and the hierarchy of the Catholic church. But because Lucas is black, he redeems himself in prison, collaborating with the police to dismantle his own operation.

“Power,” a recent Starz drama about a drug dealer name James St. Patrick (Omari Hardwick) who owns a nightclub as cover for the more substantial part of his business, has a similar elegiac tone in its best moments.

James wants to shift over into legal businesses entirely, even if it means cutting his profits substantially. But his best friend Tommy (Joseph Sikora) is skeptical that they can make the shift, and perhaps concerned that there would be a place for him in Ghost’s new business, and his wife (Naturi Naughton) does not understand why things have to change. James’s nickname is “Ghost.” While it is an accurate description of his ability to evade detection, the moniker also suggests how hard it would be for him to transition from one life to another.
In this context, Michael Corleone’s {complaints about the life he might have had}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPw-3e_pzqU""> look a little spoiled. If he rues the choice he made to take over his family’s crime operation, rather than to continue the path his father intended for him into politics or business, at least Michael had a choice to make. He stood at the pinnacle of the crooked ladder and stepped off of it, rather than being shoved or shot.

When we talk about the expansiveness of the American dream, what we normally mean is that everyone should have an opportunity to participate in the pursuit of it. But Gladwell’s description of the crooked ladder and Michael Brown’s death offer important amendments to our thinking.

We cannot exist as a community if we believe that people climb the crooked ladder because they are different from the rest of us, more depraved, less interested in the same ultimate achievements. And we ought to think very, very seriously before we deny anyone an opportunity to rise in a way that is more acceptable.

Law enforcement officials in Missouri {have suggested that Michael Brown stole some cigars shortly before his death}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/holder-selective-release-of-michael-brown-information-is-troubling/"">, as if that allegation renders logical the events that led to his killing. Even if he did steal those cigars, what have we become that a petty theft should mark someone forever, derailing him from a path that {was headed toward college,}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/16/the-timeline-of-events-and-scenes-in-ferguson-mo-since-the-shooting-of-michael-brown/""> much less justifying his death? It is foolish, grossly punitive and wholly un-American to declare that our worst moments ought to exclude us from citizenship and the continued pursuit of the American dream. Even when our fellow citizens commit grievous sins against us, such as the crime of murder, there is something powerful about the idea that we should hold ourselves and our representatives in law enforcement to higher standards than the ones to which criminals hold themselves.

When we have made it so easy to exile people from the American dream, whether because their criminal records make it impossible for them to work or vote, or because people like Michael Brown are killed before they even have a chance to pursue it, no wonder the fantasy of the crooked ladder persists in culture. The off-screen reality, in which fewer and fewer ladders of any kind are available to people of color, is a gross diminution of American ambition. And it is only one of the things we should have found intolerable long before Michael Brown’s death.",51,NA,NA,NA

In a {more recent post}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/18/what-libertarians-and-conservatives-get-wrong-about-ferguson/"">, Waldman acknowledges that “a certain degree of left-right agreement has emerged, particularly between liberals and libertarians who both see the militarization of local police getting out of control” (though without admitting that his earlier post was wrong), but claims that libertarians and conservatives have misinterpreted the lessons of Ferguson in a different way:
[T]here’s another lesson emerging, one that isn’t going to make those libertarians pleased: sometimes, big government isn’t the problem, it’s the solution — to the problem of small government.

What I mean by “big” and “small” in this case isn’t government that does many things versus government that does few things, it’s government at a higher level versus government at a lower level. When government at one level fails, oftentimes the only solution can be found up the ladder, from local to state to ultimately the federal government….

the local government, the one that’s supposed to be in touch with the people, is not only out of touch, it’s making their lives miserable. The events in Ferguson have also shown us a case of inept local government that has made the situation worse at every turn. First the Ferguson police responded to protesting residents like they were retaking Fallujah. Then when state troopers succeeded in calming things down for a night — a higher level of government trying to correct the failures of a lower level — the Ferguson police released the surveillance video from that convenience store, as though trying to make the case that Michael Brown had it coming, which enraged local residents and started a new cycle of unrest.

Almost no one denies that local government performed poorly in Ferguson. And few libertarians disagree with the general proposition that there are cases where higher-level governments can and should intervene to curb the abuses of lower-level ones. I myself recently wrote {a paper on “Libertarianism and Federalism”}<hyperlink=""http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/libertarianism-federalism""> for the Cato Institute (the nation’s most prominent libertarian think tank) where, among other things, I discussed this very issue at some length.

But Waldman errs both in largely overlooking the federal role in creating the problem exemplified by events in Ferguson and in advocating increased federal and state power as a general cure for local misgovernment. Waldman does recognize that “over-militarization [of police] is something that the federal government and local governments cooperated to create.” But this greatly understates the the crucial federal role in the process. Without {massive federal grants}<hyperlink=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/america-police-military-swat-ferguson-westcott-tampa"">, far fewer local police forces would ever have adopted military-style equipment and tactics in the first place. The Ferguson and St. Louis County police are {among the many recipients of such federal largesse}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/ferguson-missouri-militarized-police-1033-program"">. The federal government has also massively subsidized and promoted the War on Drugs, which is {a major cause of violent interactions between the police and minority communities}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/13/the-true-stereotypes-behind-michael-brown-s-death.html"">. Given this history, increased federal control over local law enforcement could well lead to more militarization and police abuses rather than less.
On the more general issue of local vs. federal and state control, Waldman is certainly right to point out that some local governments are corrupt and abusive. It is also true that the worst local governments are probably more corrupt, abusive, and incompetent than the federal government is. But increased federal and state control over localities carries important risks of its own. When a local government performs badly, residents can and often do “{vote with their feet” against it by moving to a different jurisdiction}<hyperlink=""http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160388"">. By contrast, this is usually more difficult to do in response to state government policies, and more difficult still in response to federal ones.

Moreover, harmful federal or state policies are often more dangerous than harmful local ones because the former affect far more people. For example, Waldman correctly points out that outright corruption is more common in many local governments than in the federal government. But the fiscal crises and economic distortions created by {the federal government’s mismanaged entitlement programs}<hyperlink=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/08/the_fiscal_prog.html""> and {interest-group giveaways}<hyperlink=""http://freakonomics.com/2008/07/24/the-illogic-of-farm-subsidies-and-other-agricultural-truths/""> are far more dangerous than any local waste and corruption because of their sheer scale.

Regarding the specific problem of local government policies that abuse minorities, it is worth noting that {today racial and ethnic minorities often have more leverage over local and state governments than over Washington}<hyperlink=""http://www.volokh.com/2012/03/13/heather-gerkens-progressive-defense-of-federalism/"">. They also often have more influence at the local than at the state level. This was not the case in the Jim Crow-era South (though the history of the relationship between federalism and minority rights is {more complicated than often supposed}<hyperlink=""http://ssrn.com/abstract=2277198"">); but it is increasingly true today. Despite the abuses in Ferguson, more centralized control over law enforcement is unlikely to serve the interests of racial and ethnic minorities more generally. Today, as {Charles Cobb}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/08/19/from-charles-e-cobb-jr-on-the-challenge-of-ferguson/""> notes, Ferguson is fairly unusual in being a majority-minority locality where minorities seem to have little political power.

Ideally, higher-level governments should intervene to curb abusive behavior by lower-level ones, but not impose one-size-fits-all policies that override good local decisions as well as bad ones. In practice, however, it is very difficult to empower the feds to curb bad local governments without empowering them to preempt local control more generally. This is a risk worth taking in a situation where state and local governments are engaging in truly massive oppression that the feds are eager to curb, as was the case with slavery in the 1860s or segregation in the 1960s. It may also be worth taking in situations where local authorities have systematic perverse incentives, as {when they exploit owners of immobile assets who cannot vote with their feet}<hyperlink=""http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/libertarianism-federalism"">.
But the modern problem of law enforcement abuses of the type we see in Ferguson is different. Local governments have often performed poorly. But state and federal governments have done much to make the situation worse, and it is unlikely that a general increase in state and federal control over law enforcement will make it better. In some extreme cases, state or federal intervention might be the only way to address an emergency situation, as perhaps with the {recent deployment of the National Guard to Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/key-questions-about-the-national-guard-in-ferguson/"">. But when it comes to the problem of law enforcement abuses more generally, federal and state governments can do the most good by cutting back on their own harmful policies, such as the War on Drugs and federal promotion of police militarization.",24,NA,NA,NA

Leonnig,08/19/2014,03/31/2016,"Prosecutors plan to begin presenting evidence in the shooting death of Michael Brown to a grand jury  Wednesday morning, the county prosecutor’s office said Tuesday.

“We know this is of interest to a lot of people around the country,” Edward Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor {Robert McCulloch}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/objectivity-of-prosecutor-in-missouri-shooting-of-michael-brown-is-questioned/2014/08/15/1fe20690-24bc-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html"">, told The Washington Post. “We’re going to do this fairly and also attempt to do it in a timely manner.”

It is unclear what charges prosecutors might seek or whether Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, will ultimately be charged.

The 12 members of a St. Louis County grand jury will meet in secret to determine whether the evidence presented by prosecutors is sufficient to charge someone with a crime.

McCulloch met with his lead prosecutors  Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. to review the status of the investigation and the evidence that has been gathered so far. Meanwhile, in Ferguson, protesters and some elected officials have been {calling on McCulloch to step aside as the prosecutor}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/objectivity-of-prosecutor-in-missouri-shooting-of-michael-brown-is-questioned/2014/08/15/1fe20690-24bc-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html""> and have an independent special prosecutor handle the case involving Wilson.

In a grand jury investigation, a prosecutor alone determines whether to recommend specific criminal charges be brought. The jury can ask questions to determine whether the evidence warrants the charges, while no outside lawyers for the victim or the defendant can be present or ask questions.

McCulloch’s office confirmed that they have been in contact with an attorney for Wilson and received a full statement of Wilson’s version of events on the day that Brown died.

The FBI and St. Louis County police have conducted some joint interviews with witnesses who were uncomfortable talking to police alone, officials said. The FBI has also canvassed for witnesses in the Ferguson neighborhood  Saturday and Sunday, which resulted in several new interviews  Monday, and McCulloch has copies of those statements.

Magee said that while the investigation is not complete, it has reached a critical mass of information. McCulloch’s office is not yet in possession of ballistics tests, he said. Magee declined to comment on the results of any drug testing that was conducted on Michael Brown’s body.",12,NA,NA,NA

Perhaps things weren’t as bad for the Democrats as they seemed. Perhaps things were about to turn around for President Obama and his allies. Well, with 11 weeks to go until the 2014 midterm elections, nothing suggests that the Democrats have reached the bottom of the political trough they are in.
The calamities, distractions and scandals we’ve seen during the Obama administration all come in such rapid succession that the half-life of any one is relatively short. But still, Obama and the Democrats cannot seem to get in front of any current events. They are in a permanent state of crisis, being tossed around on the waves of the daily news cycle. Any day with no new bad news is considered a good day for the White House and the Democrats generally.

The Democrats are on their back foot on every front — from the violence in Ferguson, Mo., to developments in Iraq and Afghanistan to uneven economic data to the now-ancient IRS scandal. Politically, the Democratic Party seems to be in more turmoil than President George W. Bush and the Republicans were before the debacle of the {2006 midterm elections}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/midterm-elections-republicans-really-could-win-2014-101802.html"">.
Now we are in the throes of the August doldrums, and there is always one event or scandal that will occupy the headlines while Congress is in recess. This August, the blaring news out of Ferguson is more than just a summer thunderstorm. It’s not likely to dissipate anytime soon, and it could have a lasting impact on the American psyche and U.S. politics. Some commentators have asserted that the turmoil in Ferguson will somehow motivate African American voters in the midterm elections, but I don’t see any indication that any part of the Democratic coalition is enthusiastic to get out and vote because of what is unfolding in Missouri.

And of course, the president, who disingenuously asserted that {he didn’t care about optics}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/07/09/obama-wont-visit-border-but-criticism-of-texas-trip-has-gotten-to-the-white-house/""> as an explanation for his refusal to visit the Texas border, now has to deal with the clumsy optics of leaving his vacation and returning to Washington for a few days with nothing much to do or say.

Last week, the Ward 8 blogger Nikki Peele, had an encounter with the U.S. Capitol Police that is still bothering her. She writes the blog Congress Heights on the Rise, and she told me that the only reason she hasn’t written about the encounter herself is that what happened is still upsetting and she’s planning to file a complaint with the U.S. Capitol Police this week.

The audio she recorded from the back seat of the car is above. As she describes it, she and her four colleagues were on the way to lunch, when they were pulled over at 2nd at C Streets SE.  During the incident, which USCP confirmed did occur, we hear the driver interacting with an officer on the recording.

According to Peele, the driver was never told why. It was after a couple minutes of what the blogger described as intimidating and humiliating behavior, she decided to start recording. What you hear is the end of the exchange, which Peele captured with her iPhone.

Officer: “You seem pretty intelligent okay. You wouldn’t like it if people played games on you. That’s expired.”

Driver: “Oh, I’m sorry, I don’t have the new one on me, I’ve got it though…”

Officer: “I understand…that’s a violation also too, so I got two violations on you right now. See what happens when you get in a conversation with your buddies, and not paying attention to what you’re doing?”

Driver: “I must not have been paying attention. I’m sorry.”

Officer: “Okay, it didn’t hurt to be honest, did it? Okay, we don’t play games with that. I figure you’re pretty smart. It’s a $50 fine and two points on your license. How would you like that?”

Driver: “Not very much.”

Officer: “Now, you’re talking to me, now. Now you’re talking to me, okay? See how easy things pile up? Pay attention. [Inaudible] They’re in there laughing,” he says, referring to the other passengers. At which, point they speak up, pointing out that’s not the case, as evidence by the audio.

After more voices get in on the conversation, the driver simply says, “Thank you, officer.” Nobody walked away with any infractions. And while many people might consider this a blessing in disguise, the tone of the officer’s voice makes it clear that his goal was to intimidate and wield his perceived power in as condescending a manner as possible.
Why is this important? Because as we watch Ferguson, MO, turn into a warzone, the reality of what life as an ordinary citizen dealing with a police officer in ordinary circumstances is often overlooked. I talked about this last week regarding Michael Brown’s death outside of St. Louis on {WTOP 103.5 FM}<hyperlink=""http://www.wtop.com/791/3680330/St-Louis-shooting-This-is-flat-out-brutality"">. Almost immediately, I got a letter from a man claiming to be a law enforcement official.

His words made it clear that he believed his status as an officer made his life more valuable than that of a perceived criminal. “When we are out here, Clinton, we deal with the unknown and when we fight it could be for our lives,” he wrote, implying that it’s not the exact same deal for regular citizens as well. And while this particular conversation that Peele captured partially didn’t escalate to anything close to that of Michael Brown’s situation, the level of respect in that conversation is clear. According to spokesperson Lt. Kimberly Schneider, the U.S. Capitol Police is currently investigating the matter.

What’s occurred to me while watching the events in Missouri is that many people who tacitly trust law enforcement are  buying into a different social contract than the rest of us. It’s a view illustrated in a recent op-ed in The Washington Post’s {PostEverything blog}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/08/19/im-a-cop-if-you-dont-want-to-get-hurt-dont-challenge-me/"">. There, Sunil Dutta, described as “a professor of homeland security at Colorado Tech University, has been an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department for 17 years,” makes it clear.  Just look at the headline.

“I’m a cop. If you don’t want to get hurt, don’t challenge me,”  he wrote. He goes on saying that cops deserve absolute power, something that both law enforcement officials and some citizens both have been socialized to believe. “Regardless of what happened with Mike Brown, in the overwhelming majority of cases it is not the cops, but the people they stop, who can prevent detentions from turning into tragedies,” he writes. “Working the street, I can’t even count how many times I withstood curses, screaming tantrums, aggressive and menacing encroachments on my safety zone, and outright challenges to my authority.”

Victim blaming and authoritarian pedagogy, all in one package.
Sometimes I wonder what the law enforcement world would be like if everyone were required to do it for some period of time, sort of like countries with mandatory military service. Because at the end of the day, the definition of  brutality should come from the victim, not the aggressor.",5,NA,NA,NA

The department apparently had these cameras; it just hadn’t gotten around to using them.

But simply mandating that the cameras be used isn’t enough, as {City Lab reports from San Diego}<hyperlink=""http://www.citylab.com/crime/2014/08/even-when-police-do-wear-cameras-you-cant-count-on-ever-seeing-the-footage/378690/"">:
Here in San Diego, our {scandal-plagued police department}<hyperlink=""http://voiceofsandiego.org/2014/05/14/9-cases-still-haunting-sdpd/""> has begun outfitting some officers with body cameras, and the City Council has approved a plan to roll out hundreds more.

Officers wearing the cameras were present during at least two shootings earlier this year. Yet we’re still not any closer to knowing what happened in those chaotic moments — whether the perpetrators can be easily identified, what kind of interactions the officers had with those present, nothing.

That’s because the department claims the footage, which is captured by devices financed by city taxpayers and worn by officers on the public payroll, aren’t public records. Our newsroom’s request for footage from the shootings under the California Public Records Act was denied.

Once footage becomes part of an investigation, the department says it doesn’t have to release them. SDPD also said during the pilot phase of the camera program that {it doesn’t even have to release footage}<hyperlink=""http://voiceofsandiego.org/2014/03/19/police-body-camera-videos-will-stay-private-at-least-for-now/?action=rpx_token""> from the cameras after an investigation wraps.

I called the department Friday to see whether it’s updated any policies surrounding the cameras now that more are being doled out and the program is kicking into full swing.

“We have had very positive feedback from the officers who are using them in the field” but “there are no policy changes to the releasing of evidence from body cameras,” SDPD spokesman Kevin Mayer tells me in an email.

This is absurd. The police work for the public. The cameras were purchased with public funds. Government employees are answerable to the public, especially those who have the power to detail, arrest and kill. A police department that refuses to release dash-camera or lapel-camera footage to the public after a controversial incident is basically saying just trust us. But if the optimal goal is for the public to unquestioningly trust the police, there’s no reason to outfit cops with cameras in the first place. (It will be interesting to see if SDPD adopts the same policy when a video clearly exonerates a police officer of false allegations.)

But even when the video is considered public record — or at least is at least released to a criminal defense and attorneys filing civil rights claims during discovery — there is another problem. There have been too many examples in which an officer has “forgotten” to turn on a camera, a camera has coincidentally malfunctioned at a critical tim, or video has gone missing. I wrote about this problem {in March}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/03/26/police-cameras-are-great-except-when-the-video-goes-missing/"">.
In the College Park case, a campus police surveillance camera was pointed at the area where Jack McKenna was beaten. But there’s no security video of the incident. Campus police say the camera coincidentally malfunctioned at the time of the beating. A local news station reported that the officer in charge of the campus surveillance video system is married to one of the officers later disciplined for McKenna’s beating.
This is not the first time a police camera in Prince George’s County has malfunctioned at a critical time. In 2007 Andrea McCarren, an investigative reporter for the D.C. TV station WJLA, was pulled over by seven Prince George’s County police cars as she and a cameraman followed a county official in pursuit of a story about misuse of public funds. In a subsequent lawsuit, McCarren claimed police roughed her up during the stop, causing a dislocated shoulder and torn rotator cuff. McCarren won a settlement, but she was never able to obtain video of the incident. Prince George’s County officials say all seven dashboard cameras in the police cruisers coincidentally malfunctioned.

Last March, Justice Lee Ann Dauphinot of the Second Court of Appeals in Texas complained in a dissent that when defendants accused of driving while intoxicated in Fort Worth challenge the charges in court, dash-camera video of their arrests is often missing or damaged. “At some point,” Dauphinot wrote, “courts must address the repeated failure of officers to use the recording equipment and their repeated inability to remember whether the car they were driving on patrol or to a DWI stop contained the video equipment the City of Fort Worth has been paying for.”
These aren’t the only examples. In fact, it has previously happened in Ferguson, Mo. {Michael Daly reported in the Daily Beast last week}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html""> that, when Ferguson cops beat Henry Davis after mistakenly arresting him in 2009, a jailhouse camera was supposed to be recording the area where he was beaten. Somehow, the footage of the incident was destroyed.

{More recently}<hyperlink=""http://www.louisianaweekly.com/nopd-fails-to-report-shooting-by-officer/"">, on Aug. 11, New Orleans police officer Lisa Lewis claims she was engaged in a struggle with motorist Armond Bennett just before she shot him in the head. New Orleans officers are outfitted with cameras, but there’s no video to verify Lewis’s version of events because she says turned her camera off just before the incident. NOPD Superintendent Ronal Serpas called this a “snafu.” One could understand if a critic were to opt for another word, like coverup. 
So in addition to making these videos public record, accessible through public records requests, we also need to ensure that police agencies implement rules requiring officers to actually use the cameras, enforce those rules by disciplining officers when they don’t and ensure that the officers, the agencies that employ them, and prosecutors all take care to preserve footage, even if the footage reflects poorly on officers.

One policy that would go a long way toward achieving those three objectives is what defense attorney Scott Greenfield calls {the missing video presumption}<hyperlink=""http://blog.simplejustice.us/2014/03/30/the-missing-video-presumption/"">. Currently, the courts generally treat important video that goes missing as a harmless mistake. They assume no ill will on the part of police. If you discover that the police were or should have been recording an encounter that would vindicate you of criminal charges or prove that the police violated your rights, and that video goes missing, you’re simply out of luck.

Under the missing video presumption, if under the policy agency’s police there should have been video and there isn’t, then the courts will assume that the video corroborates the party opposing the police, be it a criminal defendant or the plaintiff in a civil rights lawsuit. The state could still get over the presumption by presenting other evidence, such as witnesses, medical reports, and so on. But if it’s the police officer’s word against his antagonist’s, there should be video to validate one side or the other, and that video mysteriously goes missing while in police custody, the police should have to pay a penalty in court. Otherwise, there’s just too strong an incentive for vindicating video to be leaked and for incriminating video to disappear.",152,NA,NA,NA
WashingtonPost,wapo257,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/19/pentagon-defends-program-supplying-military-gear-to-ferguson-police/,Pentagon defends program supplying military gear to Ferguson police,Dan Lamothe,08/19/2014,03/31/2016,"The Pentagon’s top spokesman on Tuesday defended the program under which the Defense Department has sent military equipment to police departments across the country, including Ferguson, Mo., where clashes between police and civilians have continued 10 days after a white police officer shot and killed an unarmed black man.

The Pentagon’s Excess Property Program, sometimes known as the 1033 Program, has supplied police departments across the country with more than $4.3 billion in gear since 1997, including $449 million in 2013. Its use in Ferguson has come under scrutiny by civil rights advocates, but Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said the program also has assisted police across the United States in counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism operations that “get right to the protection of the homeland.”

“I want to make sure that it’s clear that this isn’t some program run amok here, or that there isn’t proper accountability,” Kirby said. “There is. And it’s well thought-out.”
The program has been under scrutiny since heavily armed — and armored — police in Ferguson began using military-grade equipment to subdue crowds following the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9. Their tactics have been criticized as heavy-handed by civil rights advocates and some military veterans who {say they weren’t able to respond as aggressively}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/14/military-veterans-see-deeply-flawed-police-response-in-ferguson/""> as police in Ferguson while deployed to war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan.

{President Obama left the door open}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/running-transcript-obamas-remarks-on-ferguson-mo-and-iraq/2014/08/18/ed29d07a-2713-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html""> on Monday to reexamining federal programs that fund and equip local police departments, raising questions whether the 1033 Program could eventually be altered. But Kirby said Tuesday that while Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has asked his staff for more information on it, he has not ordered a review of it.

Kirby said Tuesday that “there’s a lot of due diligence” that goes into deciding which police forces get which equipment. The Pentagon doesn’t push its excess equipment on police either, he said.

“I won’t speak for law enforcement. But my hunch is that many of these agencies out there would tell you that some of this equipment saves lives and protects citizens,” Kirby said. “And so while we’re all focused on what’s going on in Ferguson — as we should be, and I understand that — let’s be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater here. And it’s a congressionally-mandated program, a program that has provided a good measure of support to not just law enforcement, but to citizens all over the country.”
The Pentagon has the right to stop deliveries of military equipment to local police or to take back what it is has provided if it finds that departments do not keep proper inventory, Kirby said. But he said he wasn’t sure if the federal government could take it back materiel if it wasn’t happy with the way it was being used.

“We do not legislate, we don’t dictate, we don’t — we don’t mandate any kind of certain use,” Kirby said. “That is up to local law enforcement.”

Since 2007, the Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency has transferred two Humvees, one generator and one cargo trailer to the Ferguson Police Department, Kirby said. The larger St. Louis County Police Department, which also provides police in Ferguson, has received six pistols, 12 rifles, 15 weapon sights, three helicopters, seven Humvees, two night-vision devices and a bomb disposal robot, Kirby said.

Nationally, the Pentagon has sent weapons and equipment {ranging from armored personnel carriers to helicopters}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/15/military-gear-beyond-ferguson-a-look-at-how-the-pentagons-equipment-has-spread/"">

FERGUSON FEDERAL INVESTIGATION: Emily Wax-Thibodeaux and DeNeen L. Brown capture how the demonstrators are as diverse as their grievances–from the ‘militants’ to the peaceful, the elders, and the looters. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. will travel to the St. Louis suburb Wednesday to meet with some of the FBI agents and prosecutors investigating the case. Abby Phillip reports on how Ferguson by day is a starkly different place than the nights marked by gas masks, riot gear and floodlights. Gene Robinson writes of how the violence in Ferguson tells of a deeper, more fundamental narrative about what African Americans have done, and what has been done to them, in the decades since the urban riots of the 1960s.
PRIMARY PREVIEW: Senate Republicans face last big primary test in Alaska where former attorney general Dan Sullivan is the choice of both tea party and establishment groups, giving the GOP its best hopes of defeating Sen. Mark Begich (D) in one of the most important races in the battle for the Senate, reports Sean Sullivan. Voters are also casting ballots in Wyoming Tuesday, where Mike Enzi (R) is set to cruise to victory. Philip Bump provides a summary of what the likely 2016 candidates have said in response to the unrest in Ferguson there’s not a lot of value in addressing it for the Republicans.
MCDONNELL TRIAL: Rosalind Helderman is in Richmond and reports Kathleen Scott, who served as a special assistant to first lady Maureen McDonnell, has just finished providing an especially vivid account of the difficulties of working for McDonnell while her husband was in office.
GAZA CEASE-FIRE: Militants in Gaza broke a temporary cease-fire by launching rockets at Israel on Tuesday, and Israel responded with airstrikes.

So-called militarization has been going on for more than a dozen years. There are two reasons this has happened, and both the public and politicians were responsible.

The first was Sept. 11, 2001. The Patriot Act and other federal requirements mandated that local police forces be prepared to deal with serious terrorist threats. Hence, SWAT teams from Maine to Washington state seem indistinguishable in combat kit from the best U.S. Special Forces in preparing for terrorist contingencies.

Second, police forces said they were being {outgunned by criminals, especially the drug cartels}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/congressman-curb-military-surplus-program-24991938"">.

Police had to overcome this huge firepower disadvantage.

Americans cannot have it both ways. If police are to be able to deal with terrorists and well-armed and dangerous criminals, sadly, what is the alternative to the situation we have now? The sensible solution is serious and effective gun and ammunition control. But this is often not a serious nation.",1,NA,NA,NA

In {an editorial for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/a-message-to-the-people-of-ferguson/article_ea8b7358-67a3-5187-af8c-169567f27a0d.html""> that was published online on Tuesday, Holder said that the Justice Department would defend the rights of protesters as well as the media. He also wrote that “violence cannot be condoned,” asking for those peacefully protesting to condemn looters or vandals in Ferguson.

Holder is {scheduled to visit Ferguson on Wednesday}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/eric-holder-going-to-ferguson-on-wednesday/""> for an update on the federal civil rights investigation into Michael Brown’s death. He plans to meet with FBI investigators as well as community leaders and prosecutors.

“We understand the need for an independent investigation, and we hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in Ferguson,” Holder wrote. “In order to begin the healing process, however, we must first see an end to the acts of violence in the streets of Ferguson.”
He said that investigators looking into Michael Brown’s death have interviewed hundreds of people, while federal medical examiners carried out an autopsy on Monday (the third that has been carried out, following a county examination of Brown’s body and another autopsy commissioned by Brown’s family).

While Holder criticized the actions of looters and others committing acts of violence, he noted that “good law enforcement requires forging bonds of trust” between residents and those who police them.

“This trust is all-important, but it is also fragile,” he wrote. “It requires that force be used in appropriate ways.”

Holder has previously {criticized the police response in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/holder-criticizes-police-response-in-ferguson-says-he-is-deeply-concerned-about-use-of-military-equipment/"">, saying that he was “deeply concerned” about the use of military equipment in responding to protesters.

Meanwhile, after news of his visit was announced by President Obama on Monday, Holder issued a statement saying {he was troubled by “the selective release of information”}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/holder-selective-release-of-michael-brown-information-is-troubling/?tid=a_inl""> related to Brown.",1,NA,NA,NA

If Obama’s speeches aren’t as dramatic as they used to be, this is why: the White House believes a presidential speech on a politically charged topic is as likely to make things worse as to make things better. It is as likely to infuriate conservatives as it is to inspire liberals. And in a country riven by political polarization, widening that divide can take hard problems and make them impossible problems.

President Obama might still decide to give a speech about events in Ferguson. But it probably won’t be the speech many of his supporters want. When Obama gave the first Race Speech he was a unifying figure trying to win the Democratic nomination. Today he’s a divisive figure who needs to govern the whole country. The White House never forgets that.

This is why Obama almost never talks about race. But ironically, many of his critics are consumed with the idea that he makes everything about race.

Members of Congress say it’s hard to say No when police departments say they need the equipment. Really? Try this: “No, Chief, you don’t need an MRAP.” Doesn’t seem all that hard.

All the while completely ignoring what he’s actually doing, what he actually can do and what he is actually capable of doing.

Yes, it is serious.

White House officials tell me that personnel from the Department of Justice’s community relations service arrived in Ferguson on Aug. 10, the day after Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Brown. The level of attention has only ratcheted up from there. DOJ is conducting its own parallel federal investigation. FBI agents swarmed Ferguson over the weekend.

In an {op-ed}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/a-message-to-the-people-of-ferguson/article_ea8b7358-67a3-5187-af8c-169567f27a0d.html""> in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch released late Tuesday afternoon, Holder writes, “At a time when so much may seem uncertain, the people of Ferguson can have confidence that the Justice Department intends to learn — in a fair and thorough manner — exactly what happened.” The attorney general is appointed by the president. Holder’s travel to Missouri, the op-ed and everything DOJ is doing no doubt has the blessing of Obama.

Because of the ongoing investigation the last thing anyone should want is for the president to be rhetorically reckless in talking about the police killing of Michael Brown. Remember what happened the last time he talked about police action involving an African American man? Some said he was the one who {“acted stupidly”}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-doesn-regret-acted-stupidly-remark-henry-gates-jr-arrest-article-1.394423""> in commenting at all on the arrest of Harvard law professor Henry Louis Gates at his own home in 2009.

This is in addition to the near-constant briefings from Holder and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and his calls with Gov. Jay Nixon (D).

But folks want more.

After six years in office, we know the president is incapable of {delivering the rage}<hyperlink=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2010/06/rage_why_obama_wont_and_cant_g.html""> so many people seem desperate to see from him. It’s just not who he is. To continue to demand it of him is a useless exercise. And deep in his second term, we know the president is no fan of the theater of politics, especially needless theatrics that might make people feel good in the short-term, but do nothing to advance a greater cause or achieve a worthwhile mission in the long run.

For instance, Johnson at Hiram College suggested that Obama should have come to the podium with proposed restrictions on the Pentagon’s 1033 program that has flooded local law enforcement with war gear. Asking for such is not unreasonable. Even the president said yesterday that the funding should be reviewed and believes there will be “bipartisan interest in reexamining some of those programs.” But demanding revisions and proposals right this very minute when Congress isn’t back in session until next month — and only for 10 days — is needless theatrics that will do nothing to demilitarize local police right this very minute.
Throughout his presidency, some African Americans have called on Obama to do more to show he cares about the black community. Or as one headline put it, {“Still waiting for our first black president.”}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/still-waiting-for-our-first-black-president/2012/06/01/gJQARsT16U_story.html""> My response then is the same now: {stop waiting for and start paying attention to our first black president.}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/stop-waiting-for-and-start-paying-attention-to-our-first-black-president/2012/06/03/gJQAxQGCCV_blog.html"">  As I wrote then, some folks won’t be satisfied, it seems, until he bursts into the East Room clad in Kente cloth and brandishing a definable “black agenda”or whatever else so many blacks seem to want from him to prove that he cares.

Obama cares. Deeply. But if you’re expecting him to do seemingly heroic and showy things that make you feel good but do nothing to actually fix big, systemic problems in the long-term you will never be satisfied. And to demand that he do so in light of the information void out of Ferguson is foolish. All the energy being used to harangue the president should be directed at officials in Ferguson and St. Louis County who have refused to release key documents in the case. Why haven’t they released the first autopsy of Michael Brown? Or Ferguson Police Report #2014-12391? Or St. Louis County Police Report #2014-43984?

Once those are released then we can talk seriously about what Obama can and should do.",223,NA,NA,NA

In a statement Tuesday, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., the district attorney, cited the medical examiner’s findings in saying that he had asked that a grand jury be impaneled in Richmond County to hear “evidence regarding the circumstances” of how Garner died.
Donvoan said he would not comment on what criminal charges could be considered by the grand jury, nor would he say when the grand jury would conclude its investigation.

Garner’s death has also been cited repeatedly by many discussing a larger problem in the wake of {Michael Brown’s death}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-of-an-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri/""> in Ferguson, Mo. Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was shot and killed by a police officer on Aug. 9.

After Brown was killed, the National Bar Association, which represents African American lawyers and judges, {called for a Justice Department investigation}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-will-investigate-death-of-black-teenager-in-missouri/2014/08/11/991b3dce-2165-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html""> into both deaths. Garner and Brown were both black men who died after being confronted by police, and a thorough investigation would be the only way that “the African American community’s faith in law enforcement can be strengthened,” Pamela Meanes, president of the association, said in a statement.

The Justice Department will defend the right of protesters to peacefully demonstrate and for the media to cover a story that must be told. But violence cannot be condoned. I urge the citizens of Ferguson who have been peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights to join with law enforcement in condemning the actions of looters, vandals and others seeking to inflame tensions and sow discord.

Law enforcement has a role to play in reducing tensions, as well. As the brother of a retired law enforcement officer, I know firsthand that our men and women in uniform perform their duties in the face of tremendous threats and significant personal risk. They put their lives on the line every day, and they often have to make split-second decisions.

Holder has emerged as the face of the administration's approach to the protests and shooting in Ferguson, with civil rights groups lauding his hands on approach.  On Monday, shortly before Obama addressed Ferguson, Holder held a conference call with leaders of the nation's civil rights groups and others, and stressed that the Justice Department's investigation is broad in scope -- and will take some time. About 40 FBI agents and some of the most experienced federal prosecutors are on the ground in Ferguson.

To Ferguson residents, who have marched in their suburban community for the past week demanding transparency from the police department, Holder said that he understands the ""need for an independent investigation, and we hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in Ferguson.""

This is my pledge to the people of Ferguson: Our investigation into this matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will be independent. And beyond the investigation itself, we will work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public to ensure that this tragedy can give rise to new understanding — and robust action — aimed at bridging persistent gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve. Long after the events of Aug. 9 have receded from the headlines, the Justice Department will continue to stand with this community.

On Wednesday, Holder will meet with community leaders and be briefed on the federal investigation, by FBI officials and prosecutors from the  Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.",3,NA,NA,NA

“The striations on the sides of the monument are meant to show that the Stone of Hope is coming forward,” Miller said, his hands seeming to beckon the 30-foot-tall monument to move even more.
On this day, however, the mountain was also on the move — a volcano of anger and despair {erupting in Ferguson, Mo.}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/liveblog-live/liveblog/live-updates-tension-in-ferguson/"">

Ida Short, who was visiting with her mother from Iowa City, had seen the televised images of residents {protesting the shooting death}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/official-autopsy-michael-brown-had-marijuana-in-his-system-was-shot-6-times/2014/08/18/8c016ef8-26f4-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html""> of an unarmed black 18-year-old, Michael Brown, by Ferguson police.

Asked what she thought of the King Memorial when viewed against a backdrop of the protests, Ida replied, “I like King’s quote about the moral arc.” Taken from a speech King gave in the District in 1968, it reads in part, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.”
Brown had been killed Aug. 9, and doubts that justice would be done had become so strong that {Attorney General Eric Holder}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/justice-department-orders-new-autopsy-of-michael-browns-body/2014/08/18/023a4d12-2694-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html""> has scheduled a fact-finding visit to Ferguson on Wednesday.

Jane Yoder-Short was not quite as optimistic as her daughter. “Sometimes it’s hard to see where that arc bends,” she said. “How do we see the bend?”

A visitor traversing the curvature of the Tidal Basin would see memorials to King, {Franklin D. Roosevelt}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/museums/franklin-delano-roosevelt-memorial,797891.html""> and {Thomas Jefferson}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/museums/jefferson-memorial,798083.html""> and also come to a sightline that offered views of the {Lincoln Memorial}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/museums/lincoln-memorial,792650.html"">, which is located on the Mall nearby.

Each of those leaders issued urgent calls for an end to racial injustice in America, repeated through the centuries as words now engraved in stone fell on deaf ears.

“You can see King is facing Jefferson,” Miller pointed out. “Jefferson had slaves, but he also wrote that all men are created equal.”

The U.S. Constitution, with its Bill of Rights, was ratified in 1788 and counted black slaves as “three-fifths” human. It would take another 80 years, a {Civil War}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/2010/07/08/AFSEHBIC_page.html"">, a 13th and a 14th Amendment to free the slaves and get those other two-fifths added on.

An inscription on the Lincoln Memorial says: “One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war.”

Back then, Confederates were willing to destroy the Union to keep black people in chains. Today, sympathizers still proudly fly the rebel flag.

Of course, more than the flag has endured.

Standing in the King memorial plaza, two classmates from the Hult International Business School in Massachusetts began debating the meaning of the word “racism.”

“I think it is racial prejudice and discrimination, all rolled together,” said Jada Tally, who grew up in Lafayette, La.

Joseph Rasich, who grew up in Geneva, Ill., a wealthy Chicago suburb, called it “a system that serves to advantage one racial group over another.” Prejudice, by comparison, he said, “is just a form of ill feelings towards people with different physical characteristics.”

Asked how Ferguson looked from his point of view, Rasich said that conditions in the predominately black, low-income town made the advantages he enjoyed as a white man all the more stark.

“My parents don’t agree, but I know that being white in this society gives me privileges that other races of people do not enjoy,” he said. “Add to that my social and economic assets, and you can’t imagine the opportunities I have to expand those privileges and pass along the advantages to the next generation.”

The contrast was chilling. Many black residents in Ferguson could hardly imagine any opportunities. Now they were being cordoned off by a militarized police force and tear-gassed for protesting against injustice.

There was a quote from King on the inscription wall that seemed appropriate.

“True peace is not merely the absence of tension: it is the presence of justice.”
But the moral arc of justice did not appear to be bending toward Ferguson. Not yet anyway.

The clashes between protesters and police were getting worse, the mountain roiling with despair.

Here’s how it will work,Kimberly Kindy; Carol D. Leonnig,08/19/2014,04/05/2016,"A St. Louis County grand jury is expected to review evidence related to the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, by Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson. Here are some questions and answers about the process.

Q. What typically happens to Ferguson police officers when they are involved in a shooting that results in death of a civilian or fellow officer?

A. Officers in the department, and in departments throughout St. Louis County, are placed on paid administrative leave. They must also go to counseling before they can return to work. Authorities have said that Wilson is on paid administrative leave, but they have provided no additional information about him since the shooting.

Is a grand jury always consulted in the aftermath of such shootings?
No. The St. Louis County prosecuting attorney reviews these cases, and if he believes the officer clearly acted in self-defense or did not violate any laws, the prosecutor may decide on his own to not file charges. But if there is any ambiguity about the circumstances of the shooting, the case must go to the grand jury.

Has a grand jury been empaneled for this case?

No. This is a standing grand jury, which serves a three-to four-month term and meets every Wednesday. The county prosecutor hopes to begin presenting evidence this Wednesday.

What will the grand jury assess in this case?

The county prosecutor will present evidence from the investigation of the shooting to the jury, which will determine whether Wilson should be indicted on any criminal charges, including homicide.

Will they be hearing from witnesses?

The county prosecutor has not said whether he will call witnesses. But legal experts say that it is likely and that the jury may eventually hear from Wilson. He may be considered a powerful witness — juries have a track record of wanting to believe police.

Will anyone represent Wilson?

Wilson is being represented by Gregory Kloeppel, a lawyer with the local Fraternal Order of Police, but grand juries do not normally hear directly from counsel for those whose actions are under review.
Will anyone represent the Brown’s family?

Brown’s family is represented by Benjamin Crump and Daryl Parks. The jury is exclusively looking at Wilson’s conduct to determine whether a criminal indictment is warranted, so they are unlikely to hear from those representing Brown’s family.

How long will the jury take?

The county prosecutor has not estimated the time it will take.

Why hasn’t Wilson been arrested?
The decision to arrest or not arrest Wilson now resides with the grand jury. If the jury decides to indict him, he will be arrested. Arrests typically occur at the time charges are filed or an indictment is issued, not during an investigation. A separate federal investigation, now underway, could also result in charges.

According to news reports, Wilson appears to not be at his home. Where is he?

Wilson’s location has not been disclosed by authorities. Authorities have said they are in touch with Wilson through his attorney and have no concerns about the officer fleeing.",14,NA,NA,NA

On Sunday, there was a false report that employees of the gas station had called 911 to report that Michael Brown, whose fatal shooting by police 11 days ago precipitated the crisis in the city, had robbed the place. Enraged protesters burned the gas station to the ground.

Destroyed, it sat unattended for days, emerging as the depressing backdrop for cable news live reports — a sign of the chaos and destruction that engulfs the streets of Ferguson after each nightfall.

There has not been any single location more central to the unrest in Ferguson as the looted service station.

But then, on Thursday afternoon, it was transformed as a group of hundreds of protesters decided it would be their staging ground.
""This is our place. This is what we’ve got,” Maria Chappelle-Nadal, a state senator who has been central in staging many of the daytime protests, said during an interview outside of the QuikTrip this week. This was their Tahrir Square, their Tiananmen Square. The place each night where they would make their stand. “These people have no other place, so they’ve made it their own,” said Chappelle-Nadal.

Capt. Ron Johnson, who as head of the Missouri State Highway Patrol is now overseeing all crowd control, engaged the marchers: “Just wanna know where you are going,” he declared.

“Up to the QuikTrip and then stopping,” said the man with the megaphone. And, for the next three days, the QuikTrip served as the meeting place, the rallying point, the town square for the thousands of people descending on Ferguson each night.

It also serves as ground zero for the daytime protests, with residents setting poster board down on the asphalt as they share markers to make signs. Just two blocks behind it is the memorial of candles and signs at the spot where Brown’s body lay after he was shot.

And, it sits at the center of the stretch of West Florissant Avenue that has been the nightly battleground between officers and protesters, serving as the barrier between the stretch of strip malls and businesses to the south and residential side streets to the north.
For days, a constant stream of noise emanated from the small lot. One night, a punk rock band set up and performed. The next, a crew of breakdancers. On Saturday afternoon, it was a troupe of silent performance artists who performed a play in the lot’s back corner.

“We drove overnight and came straight here,” said Lanna Hutson, 25, a University of Arkansas student who drove here with her roommate, Paige Moore, 20, to join the protests.
They went to the QuikTrip “because this is where the people are. Where else would we have gone?”

As she spoke on Saturday, she held a sign declaring “We must unite.” Organizers handed out water and sandwiches; a group of New Black Panthers directed traffic in along the street.

Between spirited chants of “No justice, no peace” and “Hands up, don’t shoot,” residents plastered what were once gas pumps with signs.

“His name was Michael Brown,” stated one.

“RIP Mike Brown,” said another.
On the large metal post that once displayed the red and white QT logo, one person spray-painted “The QT People’s Park. Liberated 8/10/14.”

But on Monday, police cleared the lot, removing the dozens of people who had been gathered there for days. The signs were torn down.

And on Tuesday morning, a newly constructed wire fence protected the gas station at the corner. A group of men in hard hats and yellow vests worked to pick up debris and drain the gasoline from tanks beneath the pavement. They moved quickly, and silently.

A single news crew shot a stand-up on the corner. But after a few takes, they left. Nothing happening here anymore.

The lot is private property, so the protesters had no right to assemble there. As rapidly as it had sprouted, it was gone.",46,NA,NA,NA

[tweetbegin 501876155990167552 tweetend]
A White House official told the Washington Post late Tuesday that ""officials from the Departments of State and Defense reached out to relevant social media sites to inform them of the video and requested that they take appropriate action consistent with their stated usage policies.""

But asked about the removal, a Twitter spokesperson said the company ""do[es] not comment on individual accounts, for privacy and security reasons"" and directed a reporter to its {stated policy on removing media concerning the deceased at the behest of family members.}<hyperlink=""https://support.twitter.com/articles/87894-contacting-twitter-about-a-deceased-user-or-media-concerning-a-deceased-family-member"">

""In order to respect the wishes of loved ones,"" the Twitter policy reads, ""Twitter will remove imagery of deceased individuals in certain circumstances. Immediate family members and other authorized individuals may request the removal of images or video of deceased individuals, from when critical injury occurs to the moments before or after death, by sending an e-mail to privacy@twitter.com. When reviewing such media removal requests, Twitter considers public interest factors such as the newsworthiness of the content and may not be able to honor every request.""

Asked whether in this case a family member or representative indeed asked for the removal of the video and photos, the Twitter spokesman said that confirmation of any requests would have to come from the Foley family.

Still, scores of horrifying images from the Foley video continued circulating on Twitter Tuesday night. The situation points to a complexity of serving as a social media platform at a time when sharing happens at the speed of light. Openness is in Twitter's DNA: the platform largely took hold in the public's consciousness when it played a role in the 2009 election uprisings in Iran, and it has served as a key medium for the distribution of news and outrage amid the ongoing protests over the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. By all appearances, the company embraces its role as an open publishing platform for journalists and non-journalists alike, and the very viral abundance that makes Twitter so powerful --  a half billion tweets are sent a day -- makes it difficult to police.
Andrew McLaughlin was the director of global public policy for Google from 2004 to 2009, and served as a deputy Chief Technology Officer of the United States from 2009 to 2011. Says McLaughlin of Twitter, ""They start from a free speech, pro-news bias.""

""The dilemma is that you're one, a human being, and you don't want to be a jerk. So you can imagine that if you're a family member of this person, by all means you would want the horrific photos of their moment of death taken offline. But, second, the photos are obviously newsworthy. It's awful that these photos were taken, and it's awful that this moment happened, but their very existence is news. It's the sort of thing that moves history.""

Companies like Twitter, says McLaughlin, ""have to calibrate between those two pressures.""

With Twitter as a middleman, the company is in the position of deciding whether photos like those of Foley's terrible last moments stay or go. Twitter has chosen to put that call on his family, and to McLaughlin that makes some sense. It's they who would likely be affected most. And even given the horror of the moments the images capture, McLaughlin isn't sure the decision is an easy one. ""Some families might want the photos to spread far and wide,"" he says, ""to spark worldwide condemnation.""

Last February, Google {was pressed}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/appeals-court-orders-youtube-to-remove-anti-muslim-film/2014/02/26/8ef1081e-9f2a-11e3-b8d8-94577ff66b28_story.html""> to take down from its YouTube service a pair of videos circulating under the banner of ""The Innocence of Muslims"" that were seen as offensive to the prophet Muhammad.
But even once the judgment is made to scrub content, Twitter's circumstances might make acting on that decision more complex. Google, says McLaughlin, has developed advanced image analysis tools, including ones capable of searching for a unique {""hash""}<hyperlink=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/998662/what-is-image-hashing-used-for""> that can serve as a fingerprint of a video or a photo. Google faced frequent complaints over child pornography and copyright, but McLaughlin says he isn't sure that Twitter has developed the same capacities.

What's more, even though Twitter and YouTube might appear a lot alike, their structures are very different. Photos on Twitter are often shared via third-party services like TwitPic, Imgur and yfrog. Those images display ""in-line"" in tweets but are hosted on non-Twitter servers. ""Twitter is more like a messaging service with lots of links to things and some hosted content,"" says McLaughlin, ""where YouTube is all hosted content."" It isn't impossible to monitor linked services, says McLaughlin, but ""it's a fantastical amount of processing power you would have to apply.""
Zelda Williams, daughter of Robin Williams, {recently faced offensive, faked images}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/08/13/twitter-vows-to-improve-our-policies-after-robin-williams-daughter-is-bullied-off-the-network/""> on Twitter and the photo-sharing service Instagram after her father's death by suicide, including ones altered to show bruises around his neck. ""We will not tolerate abuse of this nature on Twitter,"" Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, Del Harvey, said in a statement at the time. But the Foley videos and photos aren't abusive per se, and a quick glance at Twitter reveals that often those sharing them are well-meaning tweeters.

For the moment, at least, the burden of completely avoiding the worst of the Foley images might ultimately fall on users. The hashtag {#ISISMediaBlackout has begun}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/19/isismediablackout-goes-viral-following-purported-execution-of-james-foley/?hpid=z1""> trending as a way of rallying around the idea of not sharing videos and images distributed by the group.
