A local chapter of the NAACP is demanding the FBI get involved in the investigation into why an unarmed black teenager was killed Saturday by a police officer in a St. Louis suburb. After a night of protests in Ferguson following the shooting of Michael Brown, officials confirmed the 18-year-old was not armed and was running away when he was shot “more than just a couple” of times, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said. Still, Belmar said the teenager had tried to reach for an officer’s gun in a patrol car, where one shot was fired. Brown’s fatal gunshot wounds came outside the vehicle, reports {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-ferguson-teen-struggled-over-officer-s-gun-before-being/article_f9d627dc-e3c8-5bde-b2ab-7f0a3d36a083.html”>. It’s unclear what caused the altercation in the first place. The officer who shot Brown has not been identified but has been placed on administrative leave.

Belmar gave a brief news conference Sunday as some community members marched to the Ferguson police department with their hands up in the air, chanting “Don’t shoot.” They also carried signs that read “stop police terrorism” and “disarm the police,” reports the {Associated Press}<”http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_POLICE_SHOOTING_MISSOURI?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2014-08-10-11-23-22”>.

""My son just turned 18 and graduated from high school, and he don't bother nobody,"" Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told local NBC affiliate {KSDK}<hyperlink=”http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/10/ferguson-police-news-conference-michael-brown/13860601/”>. McSpadden says Brown, who was scheduled to begin classes at Vatterott College next week, was shot eight times. Police say they still have to investigate to determine how many times Brown was actually shot.

Brown’s shooting took place two weeks before a planned march to protest the death of 43-year-old Eric Garner, a Staten Island man who was killed by a police chokehold during an arrest on July 17.

Officer Brian Schellman of the St. Louis County police said two officers were injured overnight Sunday — one was hit by a brick and one suffered knee injuries. Police arrested 32 people for theft, assault or burglary.

A convenience store was smashed and set on fire—videos showed that parts of it were almost completely destroyed—and at least four other stores were attacked.

From the Associated Press:

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson tells The Associated Press that he was informed Monday that the FBI was going to take over the investigation into the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Jackson says he welcomes the move.

Police have said that Brown or a man he was with {attempted to take an officer's gun}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html”> in a struggle that took place next to and inside a police vehicle—but they also said that Brown was 35 feet away from the vehicle and unarmed when he was shot.

After telling the officer that they were almost at their destination, Johnson’s house, the two continued walking. But as they did, Johnson says the officer slammed his brakes and threw his truck in reverse, nearly hitting them.

Now, in line with the officer’s driver’s side door, they could see the officer’s face. They heard him say something to the effect of, “what’d you say?” At the same time, Johnson says the officer attempted to thrust his door open but the door slammed into Brown and bounced closed. Johnson says the officer, with his left hand, grabbed Brown by the neck.

Johnson does not report seeing Brown attempt to take the officer's gun, which police have claimed was the action that precipitated the shooting. He says Brown was first shot next to the patrol car, again after running away, and again after turning to face the attacking officer with his hands in the air.

When police arrived at the scene they saw the men running. One officer ""came into contact"" with a suspect, who turned and pointed a handgun at the officer.

A police officer fired at least once at the suspect, wounding him. He was taken to an area hospital in critical condition.

As I got tweets and emails from Gabfest listeners flagging it for me, I had that sick feeling you get when something awful happens that proves your point.

It was just one anecdote, just coincidence. Except of course, it wasn’t. Last Saturday, police in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson says Brown hit an officer and tried to take his gun; on Thursday, Jackson added that the officer had gone to the hospital and that his face was swollen. The friend Brown was with, Dorian Johnson, tells a different story. Johnson says he and Brown were walking down the middle of the street when a police officer told them to get on the sidewalk, and that Brown used only words, not his fists, to object. {Another witness}<hyperlink=“http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Another-witness-to-Michael-Brown-Jr-shooting-speaks-to-News-4-271139501.html”> said she saw Brown tussling with an officer at the window of a police car, and that Brown fled as shots were fired.

Maybe we will find out who is telling the truth about Michael Brown’s death, and who is not, but it’s hard to have faith in that right now, as the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting, turns Ferguson into a military zone.

Black writers like Jamelle and {Jelani Cobb}<hyperlink=“”http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/anger-ferguson> are explaining why Brown’s death resonates, adding it to a list of other suspect police shootings and explaining how, as Cobb put it, “the race-tinged death story has become a genre itself, the details plugged into a grim template of social conflict.”

I’ve been thinking about something related but different: Why writing about legal issues for 20 years has taught me that black people are at risk from the police in a way that the rest of us are not—and how that shapes my own choices.

Maybe the unfairness I’m talking about is obvious to you, whatever your race. There is {plenty}<hyperlink=“”http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/broken_windows_policing_deaths_racism_in_chokeholds_arrests_and_convictions.html> {of evidence}<hyperlink=“http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/crooked-ladder”> that black men, in particular, bear the brunt of {arrests}<hyperlink=“”http://www.nyclu.org/issues/racial-justice/stop-and-frisk-practices>, convictions, and {long sentences}<hyperlink=“https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/racial-disparity-sentencing”>, out of proportion to their crime rate.

In covering the law, I’ve had {more chances}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23strikes-t.html?pagewanted=all”> {than I want}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2012/04/jerry_brown_pardons_shirley_ree_smith_in_an_old_sad_shaken_baby_case_.html”> {to remember}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2012/03/why_george_zimmerman_trayvon_martin_s_killer_hasn_t_been_prosecuted_.html”> to watch these patterns play out in people’s lives. It’s become pretty much a given for me that if the criminal justice system gets a hold of a black person, especially if he is poor, there is a terrible, heightened risk that it will try to crush him. I know we need law enforcement. I know most cops are good people who are trying to do their jobs. But the police have so much power. And often, {they are not made to answer when they abuse it}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/26/nyregion/diallo-verdict-overview-4-officers-diallo-shooting-are-acquitted-all-charges.html”>—even when, {as it appears in Garner’s case, they broke their own rules}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/nyregion/9-cases-of-police-chokeholds-punishment-was-rare-review-board-says.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22%7D”>.

But I don’t just know this because of my job. I’ve known it since childhood, because I grew up in Philadelphia, and I’m old enough to remember the frightening, overt racism of Frank Rizzo’s police department and the sorrowful night in 1985 when a black neighborhood burned. Rizzo was gone by then, and we had a black mayor, but {the long-running conflict between the police and the black liberation group MOVE helped give rise to that  fire, which killed 11 people and burned down 61 homes}<hyperlink=“”http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/culturebox/2013/10/let_the_fire_burn_jason_osder_s_documentary_about_philadelphia_move_and.html>.

You might say, that’s a crazy extreme, and it happened a long time ago. (Or you might have, until you saw Ferguson last night.) Here’s a memory of an incident that’s far more ordinary but for me more indelible, because I didn’t see it refracted through a TV screen. It’s from 1998 or 1999, just across the border of New Haven, where I lived, in the town of Hamden, on a street called Cherry Ann. I was visiting a black family, four sisters and a mother. Bear with me while I explain what I was doing there. I met this family in 1993, when I was an intern at the New Haven Advocate. I was supposed to write about them as an example of successful reunification after foster care. It turned out that the story was more complicated than that. The girls were the victims of prolonged and serious sexual abuse at the hands of the father of the youngest one, who had lived with them and their mother. When I met them, his trial was a month away and the two oldest sisters were to be the main witnesses. They were 11 and 13. I spent the summer reporting their story, which mostly meant hanging out with them on their front porch, going to the park, and swimming at the public pool. The prosecutor in the case was dedicated, caring, and full of concern for them. The girls gave their testimony, credible and solid, and the man who hurt them went to prison for a long, long time. That part of the story is about the criminal justice system working.

But on the late ’90s night when I stopped by to say hello, I saw a side of law enforcement I’d never seen firsthand. I was inside the house, talking with the girls and their mom when we heard sirens come screaming down the street. We looked through the window and then opened the front door. The cops pounded on the door of another home on the block. They went inside and came out with two guys who they clubbed to the ground. When the men were down, faces against the asphalt and hands cuffed, the cops yanked them into a police car and went zooming off into the night.

I don’t know who those men were or what they’d done. I asked the girls and their mother if they were drug dealers, and they shook their heads: They didn’t think so, but they didn’t know. Mostly, they weren’t surprised. Whatever led up to that arrest, to them the use of force felt routine. Like everyone else on the street, they went back inside and shut the door.

For me, the whole thing was mind bending. It all seemed entirely unaccountable. This was before cellphones and the citizen videos that have changed how we see deaths like Garner’s or an {arrest of a black passerby like this one}<hyperlink=“”http://thedignityvirus.com/2014/08/09/activists-protest-bombing-of-gaza-and-innocent-passerby-harassed-by-pro-israel-opposition-and-arrested/>. I had no idea what to make of what I’d seen. Were the police protecting people like the family I was visiting from the thugs in the neighborhood? Or were they flexing their muscle because they could? Had they crossed the line into misconduct? Were they a force for good or for ill?

I still don’t know. But I came away sure of one thing: I couldn’t imagine anything like that happening on any street I’ve lived on. And it’s black people who tend to live in the places where it does happen—and when the police clearly do use excessive force, their victims often have little recourse. And sometimes, people die. That happened again on Monday night, in Los Angeles, to 25-year-old black man Ezell Ford, whose mental illness, his family said, was well known to the police but who the police say got into a struggle during an investigative stop, went for an officer’s gun, and was shot and killed.

Between 2003 and 2009, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 4,813 people died “while law enforcement personnel were attempting to arrest or restrain them, or shortly thereafter,” {as Gene Demby writes for NPR}<hyperlink=“”http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/07/29/335847224/what-we-see-in-the-eric-garner-video-and-what-we-dont>, and about 60 percent of the deaths are classified as homicides by the police (I don’t know how many of the people killed were black). Demby points out that this is a small number in the context of the 98 million arrests made nationally during the same time period. But it’s still a scary number, especially when, as in Michael Brown’s case so far, police departments seem intent on protecting their own from the consequences.

This is the sharp edge of my explanation for why as a white person, if I have a choice about whether to involve the police in the life of a black person, I will try to choose not to. I’m not saying that I won’t call 911 and pray as hard as I can for the police to come if someone, whatever race, breaks in to my house. But much of the time, our choices are made in a far hazier gray area. To go back to the story of Debra Harrell and her daughter, who wound up respectively, getting arrested and going into foster care: If I saw a 9-year-old black girl alone in the park, and she said her mom was at work, I would not call the police. I would ask that girl if she was OK and try to talk to her mom. Because, once the wheels of the bureaucratic state start to turn, they can grind people up. Maybe the police want to help but don’t have discretion. Maybe “the law is an ass,” as my colleague David Plotz put it on the Gabfest. Whatever the cause, I would rather stay away from bringing its weight to bear on someone else, especially when I know that person is likelier to get an unfair shake.

The girls whom I visited on Cherry Ann Street have grown up, and one of them has an 18-year-old son. He graduated from high school in May, and he’s supposed to start college next week. He is a good kid who has not had an easy life and who is making his way. One day earlier this summer, he says, a friend brought a moped to his house and said he could ride it. The boy I know drove the bike and got stopped by the police because he wasn’t wearing goggles. They ran the moped through the system and discovered it was stolen, and he’s now facing larceny charges. This wouldn’t happen to one of my sons. I just don’t think it would. Just like I don’t think I would ever have my kids taken away from me for letting them go to the park alone.

So what does this have to do with Ferguson? What’s happening there—the tear gas, the tanks—is not what’s happening in black neighborhoods all across America every day. But it’s the same dynamic that black people experience too often, and more often than everyone else: The arm of the government that is meant to protect them instead poses a danger, to their lives and their futures. Keep that in mind the next time you consider calling the cops.",1700,6800,NA,Has a subtitle under the title “Michael Brown. Eric Garner. Debra Harrell. And that’s just the latest.”

(Hannity himself uses the verb ""Hannitize"" to describe the act of being convinced by him. Really, he does.)

Hannitization {is not confined}<hyperlink=“”http://crooksandliars.com/2014/08/ferguson-police-chief-turns-hannity-handle> to raw politics. Last night, around the time that two journalists were being arrested for failing to flee a locked-down McDonald's quickly enough, Hannity got an exclusive with Ferguson's police chief, Thomas Jackson. Now, the {slow and stingy flow}<hyperlink=“”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teenager-and-officer-scuffled-before-shooting-chief-says.html?smid=tw-share&_r=1#> of information from Jackson's office is a real issue on the ground. The name of the officer who killed Michael Brown has not been released. The police department has not said whether eyewitnesses who have been talking to the media have been interviewed by police, too. And while it's not the key issue in the Brown case, the heavy militarization of the police forces, a trend that had been covered by the libertarian journalist Radley Balko and the Pulitzer winner Matt Apuzzo, has {broken out as a controversy}<hyperlink=“http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ferguson-the-blurred-line-between-law-enforcement-and-combat”>.

Hannity asked about none of this.

Indeed, the whole interview is a chance for Jackson to reiterate that the cops are doing the right thing. Here's how it ends:

HANNITY: You are certain that an altercation occurred and a shot was fired within the car, meaning Mr. Brown was in the car at some point?

JACKSON: He was, he was -- yes.

HANNITY: In other words, he wasn't handcuffed in the car. He went in the car of his own volition.

JACKSON: Yes.

HANNITY: And do you believe there was a struggle for that gun?

JACKSON: That's what the county police chief said in his opening statement. He's the one that took the -- his officers are the ones that took the statement from both the officer and the witnesses.

HANNITY: What about the unrest that has taken place now in your city? Do you believe a lot of the looting and a lot of what has happened is a result of outside agitators, as some have suggested, or do you think this is just a community angry at what happened?

JACKSON: No, it's a lot of outside agitators that are causing the violence. We've had some -- several very peaceful protests. I mean, they're angry. They want -- they have questions they want answers to. And I understand that. I get that.

Outside agitators! That's a whip-smart line to use on Fox News, which ran so much footage of the New Black Panther Party's bumbling 2008 ""protection"" of a Philadelphia polling place, and the subsequent legal cases against the NPP, that the Panthers practically qualified for the Screen Actors Guild.

Hannity's warm-milk interview gets at a division in conservative America. I mentioned that the reporter who's been on the ""militarized police"" beat the longest is Radley Balko. (While at the Cato Institute, in 2006, he published {a paper}<hyperlink=“http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/overkill-rise-paramilitary-police-raids-america”> on paramilitary police raids.) And in a popular column for National Review, Charles C. Cooke argued that the conservatives {trying to change the subject}<hyperlink=“http://www.nationalreview.com/article/385162/rights-wrong-reaction-missouri-shooting-charles-c-w-cooke”> in Ferguson to black-on-black crime are making themselves and their peers sound callous. ""The question of who guards the guardians pertains now as keenly as it ever has,"" he wrote. ""The Right’s answer should be 'we do' — and we’re happy to hang them high if we know that they have transgressed.""

The absence of President Obama from the conversation is one reason that the pro-cop, change-the-subject argument has been limited largely to buffoons. Yes, he put out a statement about Brown, and Todd Starnes, a Fox News commentator who can be counted on to react to events in a stupid way, asked why Obama didn't say anything about the police officer. (You know, the one whose name isn't being revealed.) But Obama has been on vacation, and taken his lumps, in a marked contrast to his quick, televised response to the killing of Trayvon Martin. That response, as {Ta-Nehisi Coates}<hyperlink=“http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/fear-of-a-black-president/309064/”> pointed out, fired the starting gun on conservative media coverage of Martin as {a thug who was up to no good}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2013/02/05/todd-kincannons-trayvon-martin-trolling/”> and could have killed a guy.

The modern GOP, the one that elected Richard Nixon and bult its base in the South and the suburbs, established early on that it was the {“law and order”}<hyperlink=“http://www.newsmax.com/ChristopherRuddy/buchanan-nixon-eisenhower-ailes/2014/07/22/id/584199/”> party. The crime waves of the 1960s and 1970s and the crack wars of the 1980s were crucial to Republican dominance, and led to tough-on-crime legislation that's still on the books. Only recently, as violent crime rates have tumbled, has the libertarian tendency of the GOP reasserted itself. We've seen the {“Right on Crime"" Republican}<hyperlink=“http://www.nationalreview.com/article/368877/bipartisan-prison-reform-betsy-woodruff”> legislators pass prison reform bills; we've seen {Rand Paul talk}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/republicans_are_favoring_going_easy_on_drug_offenders_the_young_gop_leaders.html”> about restoring the voting rights of felons, and shrinking the number of crimes that can be classified as life-ruining felonies. 

It's an open question: Which of these tendencies will characterize the conservative response to Ferguson? The law-and-order tendency that assumes the cops pointing their guns at protesters are preventing the outside agitators from doing something wild? Or the {libertarian tendency}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/499740253633388546”> that asks if you really want a photo of the occupation of Crimea to be indistinguishable from a photo of the St. Louis metro area?",632,954,NA,NA

I learned plenty from Balko, and one claim jumped right off the page. The story that protesters chanted ""kill the police"" was thinly sourced.

How could that be? The story was everywhere. This weekend Fox News report begins with the hook that as a crowd gathered outside the scene of Brown's death, ""some people [were] even yelling kill the police."" And here the problem starts, because the video doesn't really prove that, at all. One, the crowd's chants are indistinguishable. Two, Fox News' video was taken at night—but Brown {was shot}<hyperlink=“http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatoday-newstopstories”> in the afternoon.

So who yelled ""kill the police""? Let's go to the contemporary print reports, which credit {the ""kill the police"" chant}<hyperlink=“http://legacy.9news.com/story/news/2014/08/09/st-louis-ferguson-shooting-canfield-green-apartments/13848223/”> to the Associated Press. Here's where the AP got the scoop:

St. Louis County police said a large crowd confronted officers following the shooting, yelling such things as ""kill the police.""

ABC News, reporting independently on the story, {cites}<hyperlink=“http://abcnews.go.com/US/fatal-shooting-sparks-protests-shouts-kill-police/story?id=24916252”> St. Louis County police department spokesman Brian Schellman for the ""kill"" quote. So there you have it: The police department says that people yelled ""kill the police,"" but no video has emerged of anyone saying it, despite the presence of media and countless cellphone cameras.

Four years ago, several black members of Congress said that they'd been heckled, spit at, and called the N-word on their way out of health care votes. Andrew Breitbart offered a $100,000 reward for {any video proof}<hyperlink=“”http://www.salon.com/2010/04/13/andrew_breitbart_misleading_video/> that this had happened. No proof emerged. On the right, and more widely, the idea that Tea Partiers yelled racial slurs at John Lewis, et al. appeared to be debunked. 

So what should happen with the possible canard that the people at the first protest of the Michael Brown killing were yelling about murdering cops? We've {come a ways}<hyperlink=“https://newrepublic.com/article/119089/obama-makes-statement-michael-brown-shooting-and-ferguson-unrest”> since Sunday, but that detail definitely colored the way this story was received.",135,81,NA,NA
Slate,slate12,http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2014/08/ferguson_police_attack_protestors_with_tear_gas_rubber_bullets_on_site_reporting.html,How a Demonstration Turned Into a Disaster,Jamelle Bouie,08/14/2014,02/15/2016,"FERGUSON, Missouri—On Wednesday afternoon, a healthy-sized group of local organizers, religious leaders, parents, and teenagers walked down West Florissant—the street where Michael Brown was killed—chanting the unofficial slogan of the Ferguson demonstrations. “Hands up, don’t shoot! No justice, no peace!”

They were energized, animated, and peaceful. They were holding signs with slogans such as “Love, Peace & Prayer Equals Non-Violence” and demanding answers from police officials, who—four days after the shooting—have yet to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, nor have they said how many times he shot the unarmed 18-year-old.

Directly across from them, sitting near the intersection where rioters burned a convenience store on Sunday, were the local police, clad in riot gear and armed with batons. It was a bit much, given the modest, peaceful crowd, but it was a de-escalation from Tuesday, when SWAT teams entered the fray to disperse the demonstrators.

After an hour of marching, speeches, and calls for justice, most of the group moved to a nearby parking lot, where they continued to talk and demonstrate. A small number, however (including a state senator), wouldn’t budge, even after clergy asked them to move. They weren’t disruptive—they were sitting down, hands up—but they were blocking the road.

Still, the situation was calm. It wouldn’t have been easy, but police could have worked with the leaders of the demonstration to move people to the sidewalks and the parking lots.

Instead, they brought reinforcements. Police officers were replaced with camouflaged SWAT teams—clad in helmets and body armor—and batons were replaced with shotguns, high-powered rifles, and dogs. They didn’t identify themselves, and it wasn’t clear to the crowd where they were from. But St. Louis County has been in command of officers on the street since Sunday, and one of the armored vehicles was labeled “St. Charles County SWAT.” In any case, they weren’t interested in actual crowd control. On at least two occasions, they refused to let uninvolved bystanders go to their cars or leave the area. No, from their stance to their numbers, this was about intimidation. Two snipers monitored the demonstrators from their armored vehicles, and other police began to close off side streets and other exits, to prevent anyone from coming in (or going out, for that matter).

With the arrival of SWAT teams, the demonstration escalated into a standoff. And an hour after the teams’ arrival, they began marching down the street and shouting orders. “You must return to your vehicles, or your homes, in a peaceful manner,” they said, advancing down the street, “Your right to assembly is not being denied.”

The crowd backed away from the police, but people were clearly agitated by the show of force. Still, there was no aggression. At this point, I drove 15 minutes down the road to another event, one organized by the demonstrators. The contrast was incredible. There, hundreds of people were gathered in a community party, oblivious to the crackdown three miles away.

When I returned to the standoff, an hour after SWAT teams arrived, streets were completely blocked off, helicopters were circling, and officers were pouring tear gas onto West Florissant and the surrounding neighborhood, launching flash bangs, shooting rubber bullets, and using noise-based weapons to force people inside.

Police say this was a necessary response—someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail, and there is a photo to confirm as much. But the full picture tells a different story. If elements of the crowd reacted with violence, it’s because police stoked it with repression.

So far, police have killed an unarmed teenager, stonewalled anyone requesting information, and met peaceful demonstrations with draconian crackdowns. Indeed, at every stage, police have opted for repression rather than communication. Which is to say that, as much as {some reports}<hyperlink=“http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-missouri-riots-continue-2014-8”> have focused on the Sunday night riot, the chaos in Ferguson has much more to do with a {militarized}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/police_in_ferguson_military_weapons_threaten_protesters.html”>, out-of-control police presence than it does with any of the demonstrators.",1200,3100,NA,"Title has subtitle “The outrageous police actions in Ferguson, Missouri. “"

My colleague {Jamelle Bouie}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/jbouie”> is on the ground in Missouri, and I have a statement from the Huffington Post:

We are relieved Ryan Reilly and Wesley Lowery are safe, but we are disturbed by their arrest and assault.
 
Ryan was working on his laptop in a McDonald's near the protests in Ferguson, MO, when police barged in, armed with high-powered weapons, and began clearing the restaurant. Ryan photographed the intrusion, and police demanded his ID in response. Ryan, as is his right, declined to provide it. He proceeded to pack up his belongings, but was subsequently arrested for not packing up fast enough. Both Ryan and Wesley were assaulted.
 
Compared to some others who have come into contact with the police department, they came out relatively unscathed, but that in no way excuses the false arrest or the militant aggression toward these journalists. Ryan, who has reported multiple times from Guantanamo Bay, said that the police resembled soldiers more than officers, and treated those inside the McDonald's as 'enemy combatants.' Police militarization has been among the most consequential and unnoticed developments of our time, and it is now beginning to affect press freedom.

Reilly and Lowery are incredibly hard-working reporters, both well-liked and respected in D.C. (Don't hold that against them.) There are {reports that higher-ups}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/499719019747090433”> in the Missouri police forces realized that the arrests were terrible mistakes, committed by people who never heard {the cliché}<hyperlink=“”http://freakonomics.com/2011/05/12/ink-by-the-barrel/> that you don't ""pick a fight with people who buy ink by the barrel."" This is even truer when the barrel-owners happen to own Amazon.com and AOL.com.

But the story is moving at Twitter-speed, and there is little time to waste before assigning political blame. Shortly before midnight, BuzzFeed's political editor Katherine Miller (formerly of the Washington Free Beacon) captured the zeitgeist by {sharing the White House pool report}<hyperlink=“”http://www.buzzfeed.com/katherinemiller/president-obama-attends-birthday-party-in-marthas-vineyard?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter#3nslljf> and noting that ""violence continued"" in Missouri. Meanwhile:

[In] his toast for [Ann] Jordan, President quipped that he met Vernon and first, but liked Ann more. The menu consisted of surf and turf and pasta. The Obamas danced nearly every song. A good time was had by all.

The snark wrote itself: dancing while Ferguson burned. A tweet from the office of Gov. Jay Nixon elicited a similar, can-you-believe-the-gall response.

Update: From Ryan Reilly's Facebook page:

Only one of its six city council members is black. These facts, as much as anything, have shaped the protests over the police shooting of Michael Brown. Ferguson, with a 67 percent black population, is a place where the largest community has little political voice.

Why is that? David Kimball, a political science professor at the University of Missouri–St. Louis, {has studied}<hyperlink=“http://www.umsl.edu/~kimballd/dk_papers.htm”> the dynamics of race and elections in St. Louis proper. He says that the pattern in Ferguson is common throughout the city’s inner-ring suburbs, where blacks have gradually replaced whites in recent decades.

The issue boils down to who votes. Ferguson is roughly two-thirds black, but compared with the city’s whites, the community is younger, poorer (the city has a 22 percent poverty rate overall), and, as the New York Times recently wrote, {somewhat transient}<hyperlink=“”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/opinion/racial-history-behind-the-ferguson-protests.html?_r=0&assetType=opinion>, prone to moving “from apartment to apartment.” All of these factors make black residents less likely to go to the polls, especially in low-turnout municipal elections. And so whites dominate politically. “The entire mobilization side of it is what accounts for the difference,” Kimball said.

To illustrate the point, Kimball told me about a recent school board election in which the city’s racial fissures came to the fore. In 2013, Art McCoy, the young and promising school district superintendent, {was suspended}<hyperlink=“”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/suspension-of-ferguson-florissant-superintendent-questioned/article_d26b81af-7010-55b1-8233-50b33a08bb09.html> by the board without explanation. McCoy, who later resigned, was black, as were three-quarters of the district’s students. Six of the school board’s members were white, while the other was Hispanic. Local outrage grew quickly.

“It’s a white school board and then you have this black superintendent, who so many people are impressed with,” Esther Haywood, president of the St. Louis County branch of the NAACP, told the {St. Louis Post Dispatch}<hyperlink=“”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/suspension-of-ferguson-florissant-superintendent-questioned/article_d26b81af-7010-55b1-8233-50b33a08bb09.html>. “Why are they trying to get rid of this black superintendent?

“I think the school board election is illustrative, because all the elements are there,"" Kimball said. ""You’d think, OK, this is going to motivate the African American community.

A police car is leading the procession. Well-wishers and residents handed the marchers water, pizza, homemade dishes and cookies as they passed.”

From {the Associated Press}<hyperlink=“http://abcnews.go.com/US”>: “Early Thursday evening, St. Louis County police and state troopers were walking alongside demonstrators. Several marchers stopped to shake hands with officers. One woman hugged Capt. Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol, who is overseeing security. The scene stands in stark contrast to earlier this week when officers in riot gear and in military equipment clashed with protesters.”

“The governor just called me, and he’s on his way to St. Louis now to announce he’s taking away St. Louis County police out of the situation,” Clay, a Missouri Democrat, said in a telephone interview. He added that Nixon, a 58-year-old Democrat, may ask the Federal Bureau of Investigation to step in.

...when something like this happens, the local authorities, including the police, have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death and how they are protecting the people in their communities. There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. And here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.

As Slate’s Jamelle Bouie {reports}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2014/08/ferguson_police_attack_protestors_with_tear_gas_rubber_bullets_on_site_reporting.html”>:

An hour after SWAT teams arrived, streets were completely blocked off, helicopters were circling, and officers were pouring tear gas onto West Florissant and the surrounding neighborhood, launching flash bangs, shooting rubber bullets, and using noise-based weapons to force people inside.

Most of these crowd-control tactics are, unfortunately, familiar, whether you've personally encountered them or just heard about their use. But what’s a noise-based weapon? The ones used in Ferguson are called LRAD sound cannons, or Long Range Acoustic Devices, and they allow for very serious crowd control.

Manufactured by the {LRAD}<hyperlink=“http://www.lradx.com/”> company, the devices were originally developed in response to the October 2000 bombing of the {USS Cole}<hyperlink=“http://money.cnn.com/2009/03/06/smallbusiness/killer_sounds.fsb/”>. The idea, as {Gizmag reports}<hyperlink=“http://www.gizmag.com/lrad-long-range-acoustic-device/11433/”>, was to create acoustic technology that could clearly transmit sound, like verbal directions, over a long distance. The devices also began to employ intense sound as a deterring weapon against pirates at sea. Over time, LRADs came to be used for emergency response during natural disasters and extreme weather, but also for crowd control during protests. LRADs can help keep wildlife away from wind power generators, but can also make protesters, {like those at Occupy Wall Street}<hyperlink=“http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/occupy-wall-street-police-military-megaphone-amplify-point-protesters-article-1.979585”>, flee from painful sound waves. Listen to LRADs at work in this video footage from Ferguson:

The {LRAD 500X-RE}<hyperlink=“http://www.lradx.com/lrad_products/lrad-500rx/”>, the model that appears to have been present at the Ferguson demonstration, “achieves maximum sound projection and penetration beyond 2,000 meters” and can reach 149 decibels. The 500X-RE gives law enforcement “the ability to issue clear, authoritative verbal commands, followed with powerful deterrent tones.” And according to {a report by the Economist}<hyperlink=“http://www.economist.com/node/3423036”> in 2004, those deterrent tones cause immediate headaches and pain. Since LRADs can blast above {a person’s}<hyperlink=“http://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/noise/signs.htm”> 120-decibel discomfort mark, and their 130-decibel threshold for potential hearing loss, there’s no telling what the consequences of encountering a LRAD may be for protesters. One woman {sued the city of Pittsburgh}<hyperlink=“http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/09/23/40010.htm”> for permanent damage caused by an LRAD. And the Missouri Department of Transportation {purchased two LRADs in April}<hyperlink=“http://www.storyleak.com/lrad/”>, though it's unclear if they are the same ones used in Ferguson.

LRADs may look like dopey satellite dishes, but the SWAT teams in Ferguson on Wednesday definitely brought out the big guns when they turned on the deterrent tones. Not to mention their actual guns.",135,1800,NA,"Article by Future Tense, affiliate of Slate"

Slate,slate23,http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/ferguson_police_officers_should_be_forced_to_videotape_themselves_for_our.html,Tape Everything,Reihan Salam,08/15/2014,02/17/2016,"If you’ve ever had the distinct displeasure of calling a customer service hotline, you’ve probably heard a soothing voice tell you that “this call may be monitored for quality assurance purposes.” It can be comforting to know that there is, in theory, at least, someone out there monitoring customer service representatives who make life more difficult rather than less. Customer service representatives dealing with abusive customers can take comfort in this kind of monitoring too, as it can shield them from false accusations of bad behavior. By reviewing recordings of calls gone wrong and calls gone right, meanwhile, trainees can learn from the sometimes trying experiences of others. What’s not to like?

Thankfully, the stakes of customer service interactions tend to be pretty low. You might think that getting a small instead of an extra-small in the mail is a bona fide calamity, but no one else does. The same can’t be said about interactions between armed police officers and civilians, which can be a matter of life and death. The turmoil in Ferguson, Missouri, vividly reminds us that while most of these interactions go smoothly, far too many of them spiral out of control. We know little about the exact circumstances surrounding the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. But had the police officer who shot and killed Brown been obligated to wear a video recording device, there is at least some reason to believe that Brown would still be alive.

Over the past few years, the idea of requiring that police officers make use of so-called “body cams” has gained currency. Note that this is quite different from simply {allowing civilians}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/02/18/good-news-and-bad-news-on-recording-the-police/”> to record on-duty police officers, a right that shouldn’t even be {in dispute}<hyperlink=“”http://reason.com/archives/2010/09/20/how-to-record-the-cops>. Instead of waiting for a world in which every civilian records every encounter with the police, at least some students of law enforcement have argued that police forces themselves should move in this direction. Last fall, Guardian correspondent Rory Carroll {reported}<hyperlink=“”http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/california-police-body-cameras-cuts-violence-complaints-rialto> on the small southern California city of Rialto, where the local police department has affixed small body cams to all of its officers. The results were dramatic. Carroll cites {a jaw-dropping study}<hyperlink=“”http://www.policefoundation.org/sites/g/files/g798246/f/201303/The%20Effect%20of%20Body-Worn%20Cameras%20on%20Police%20Use-of-Force.pdf>, which found that in the year following the introduction of the body cams in February 2012, public complaints fell by 88 percent while officers’ use of force fell by 60 percent.

The success of the Rialto experiment makes intuitive sense. When we know that we are being observed, it affects our behavior in all kinds of ways. We become more aware of how others might judge our behavior, so we feel a not-so-subtle pressure to act in socially acceptable, rule-following ways. Moreover, the existence of a video recording allows police officers to revisit exactly how they performed in high-pressure situations. Our capacity to remember past events is notoriously faulty. There is a universal human tendency to fixate on some things while neglecting others. Video recordings can help correct for these deficiencies. In instances where something does go wrong—due to malice on the part of the police, a civilian, or something else entirely—the video provides a record that can help investigators sort out how things really came unstuck. In politically sensitive cases, in which all sides fear getting railroaded, a black box of this kind would be a godsend.

Granted, Rialto is not a major metropolis, and some will no doubt dismiss the success of its body cam initiative as a fluke, or one not easily repeatable in a big, bustling city. Even Bill de Blasio, the New York City mayor who came to office on the strength of his opposition to heavy-handed stop-and-frisk policing, has {hesitated}<hyperlink=“http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/08/8550154/city-maintains-not-quite-yet-position-nypd-cameras”> to require that NYPD officers wear body cams, insisting that “it’s not something that has been perfected yet.” The American Civil Liberties Union, however, has {endorsed the idea}<hyperlink=“https://www.aclu.org/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all?redirect=technology-and-liberty/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all#control”>, giving it much-needed liberal street cred. And now the Michael Brown shooting has led {a cavalcade of commentators}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/AdamSerwer/status/499910157103812608”>, mostly but not exclusively on the left, to speak out in favor of the idea. Given time, it’s easy to imagine body cams becoming standard-issue for police officers in the near future.

But why stop at video recording the police? While I will happily concede that video recording is particularly important for the police, in light of their ability to use deadly force, there are many public servants who have considerable power over others and who are shielded from scrutiny in the absence of video recording.

Public school teachers and administrators are the most obvious example. In March, the Justice Department issued {an alarming report}<hyperlink=“http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/expansive-survey-americas-public-schools-reveals-troubling-racial-disparities”> on racial disparities in school discipline policies. For example, while black children represent only 18 percent of all children attending preschool, 42 percent of all preschool students suspended once are black, as are 48 percent of children suspended more than once. Video recordings could surface whether teachers are systematically biased against black students, if they are disciplining students in an entirely race-neutral way, or if the truth lies somewhere in between. Investigators could identify patterns that could help inform how teachers are trained to manage their classrooms.

What’s more, video recording could allow teachers to evaluate their own progress, and to share their experiences with other teachers who can help them think through {how to improve their performances}<hyperlink=“http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_teachers_need_real_feedback/transcript”>. Teachers unions and their allies, however, are {not keen on the idea}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/05/10/bill-gatess-5-billion-plan-to-videotape-americas-teachers/”> of video recording. In light of the collapsing cost of collecting this data, it’s hard to understand why they’d be opposed to it, particularly if the recordings are used primarily for professional development. If anything, video recording could help teachers beat back shrill accusations of incompetence and top-down, one-size-fits-all schemes for measuring effectiveness. Many teachers have, for good reason, resisted the concept of value-added assessments that rely heavily on standardized tests, preferring instead classroom evaluations that involve occasional visits from outside observers. Video recording every class session would give observers far more data to work with, thus giving them a fairer and more complete picture of how well a given teacher is doing day in and day out—not just a brief snapshot drawn from an hour or two.

Some readers will surely be offended by the idea of video recording cops and teachers. You might even invoke the specter of mass surveillance or the spread of CCTV cameras, or some other outrage. I see things differently. Privacy is a wonderful thing, but on-duty police officers and teachers in classrooms are not in fact private citizens living their lives as they choose. They are public servants charged with, well, serving the public. Video recording is nothing more and nothing less than a tool for accountability. Those who use their power responsibly and who make a good-faith effort to do their jobs well have much to gain from video recording. Those who abuse their power and who otherwise cut corners will either have to shape up or answer for their actions. If you come across an argument against video recording that doesn’t sound like an attempt to avoid accountability, fill me in.",476,2700,NA,NA

All of these victims were of color, and all were unarmed.

Since these latest incidents, there has been much talk about the need for retraining officers; and there have been repeated calls from an outraged public for investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI. But training and federal investigations are ineffective responses to allegations of police misconduct. We know how to solve this epidemic; we just need to find the political will to do it.

Before they even don their uniforms, police officers receive hours and hours of training about the appropriate use of force. At the nation’s police academies, they learn how to evaluate situations where force could be an option and when it’s illegal. By the time officers are patrol-ready, they know how to use their firearms, batons, and stun guns. Yet, in response to the chokehold killing of Erin Garner, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton has called for the “retraining” of his officers. Training is, of course, essential to law enforcement. But it would be a serious and dangerous error to shrug off these deaths and beatings by cops and simply attribute them to inadequate training.

Retraining is useless when officers view people of color as “f--king animals”—the words shouted by a police officer at a crowd in Ferguson protesting the killing of Michael Brown. All of the training and retraining in the world are of no moment if officers see the people they are charged to protect and serve as subhuman and dangerous.

And while some investigations by the FBI and the Justice Department have resulted in major and positive changes to police departments, these kinds of costly inquiries frequently take years to complete. Case in point: the fatal shooting of Brown in Ferguson. The FBI has opened a civil rights inquiry in response to the public outcry, but a week after the shooting, critical information such as the name of the officer, and the number of times and where on his body Brown was shot, has not been released. This is not a training problem. It’s a transparency problem.

So, if more training and federal investigations are not the answer, what is? First, police departments must broaden the definition of reasonable use of force. In 1989 the U.S. Supreme Court in {Graham v. Connor}<hyperlink=“http://hanfordsentinel.com/news/local/crime/use-of-force-what-does-the-law-say/article_04a4ad69-7dd5-5099-a1e8-e764ab26c9b2.html”> defined the reasonable use of force as force “judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, and its calculus must embody an allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.” That definition has been interpreted narrowly by law enforcement agencies across the country to mean that the reasonableness of the force is limited to an examination of only the amount of force used in the moment. The conduct of officers right before the use of force is never examined. Under this definition, officers who provoke individuals and officers who escalate situations get a pass. 

The definition of what constitutes the reasonable use of force must be expanded to include the circumstances leading up to the use of force, so that the inquiry into the misconduct sweeps in whatever the officer did prior to the decision to  use force, along with the conduct of the victim. There is precedent for this. This year, both the Seattle Police Department and the Los Angeles Police Department expanded their definitions of reasonable use of force. Now, in Seattle, officers cannot use physical force “against individuals who only verbally confront them unless the vocalization impedes a legitimate law enforcement function or contains specific threats to harm the officers or others.” And in Los Angeles, the use of deadly force must include “consideration of not only the use of deadly force itself, but also an officer’s tactical conduct and decisions leading up to the use of force when determining its reasonableness.”

Second, cities and counties must establish independent civilian oversight agencies for their law enforcement departments. Civilian oversight of law enforcement is far from novel. Worldwide, countries such as South Africa, Canada, Belgium, and the European Union have police oversight agencies. And there are numerous cities and counties in the United States that have established civilian oversight departments, from Palo Alto, California, to Kalamazoo, Michigan, to Honolulu, Hawaii. (A complete listing of all civilian oversight agencies can be found at {nacole.org}<hyperlink=“http://www.nacole.org/”>). In San Jose, California, where I am the independent police auditor, our civilian oversight office has existed for 21 years. The beauty of civilian oversight is that it holds police officers accountable to the public by providing independent review of complaints of police misconduct, instead of relying solely upon internal investigations in which the police investigate themselves.

The 1988 murder of 20-year-old Cara Knott by Officer Craig Peyer, a six-year veteran of the California Highway Patrol, illustrates what happens when independent civilian oversight is not a part of misconduct investigations. After stopping Knott, ostensibly for a traffic violation, Peyer made sexual advances on her. When she refused, he killed her by bludgeoning her with his flashlight, strangling her, and then tossing her body over a bridge. It turned out that a number of young women had also been the victims of Peyer’s advances. And while they had filed complaints with the CHP’s Internal Affairs Unit, the department’s internal investigations dismissed their complaints, finding in favor of Peyer. Peyer is now serving a life sentence in a California prison for Knott’s murder.

Third, {and as Reihan Salam argues today in Slate}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/ferguson_police_officers_should_be_forced_to_videotape_themselves_for_our.html”>, every single law enforcement officer should be required to wear body-worn cameras, or BWCs; and every single law enforcement agency should adopt a protocol for the operation of these cameras that strictly regulates when the cameras can be turned off by officers. Bystanders with cameras have changed policing forever. Witness the public outrage after the release of videos that depicted the beating of Marlene Pinnock and the chokehold death of Eric Garner. Police officers should have cameras, too.

BWCs promote transparency in policing, they hold officers and the public accountable for their actions, and they reduce civil litigation. The police department of Rialto, California, has 115 sworn officers. In 2009 it became the first known police department to utilize BWCs. A study that analyzed the use of BWCs in Rialto showed that use of force incidents dropped by 59 percent, and that civilian complaints about police misconduct decreased by 87.5 percent. Those numbers are staggering. The benefit to police and the public of recording police interactions clearly justifies its costs. Even the ACLU has concluded that BWCs assist in holding law enforcement more accountable to the communities that they serve.

Over the last decade, claims against cities and counties across the country stemming from police incidents amounted to $22 billion. The special counsel to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department recently reported that between January 2013 and April 2014, 132 cases of excessive force against the department were closed by settlements or court verdicts, totaling $12,175,000. The largest payout in fiscal 2012–2013 was a jury award of $6 million, settled by the County for $3.9 million. The plaintiff in that case claimed that two deputies escalated a traffic stop into violence, pepper-spraying him, punching him in the head, kneeing him in the face, and slamming his head into the pavement. And don’t forget the attorneys’ fees that are often a key driver in the decision of whether or not to settle or proceed to litigation. In Los Angeles County, for every dollar spent on a payout in fiscal 2012, another dollar was spent on the lawyers, amounting to $43 million. Communities policed by officers wearing BWCs will see a dramatic decrease in litigation and the costs associated with it.

All the outrage surrounding the violence against unarmed black people this summer will amount to nothing if we simply settle for more investigations and more training. There are steps we can take to reduce police violence, and they have been proved to work.",341,4000,NA,NA

Ron Johnson Speaks Gracefully on Anger in Ferguson,Ben Mathis-Lilley,08/15/2014,02/17/2016,"Ron Johnson is the Missouri Highway Patrol captain who took over patrol in Ferguson Thursday night; Johnson, {a Ferguson native}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/meet-the-missouri-highway-state-patrol-captain-who-is-taking-over-in-ferguson/”>, spoke and walked with protesters and supervised a force that presented itself much less aggressively than the quasi-military SWAT teams that had confronted residents on previous days. The result, by all accounts, was a significantly less tense evening. ""There were not any calls for service, we did not deploy any tear gas, we did not make any arrests,"" Johnson said when he met minutes ago with members of the media and local citizens.

He seemed to have been taken by surprise by Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson's release this morning of {an incident report that alleges slain teen Michael Brown stole a box of cigars}<hyperlink=“”http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/08/14/ferguson_running_blog_updates_on_protests_in_missouri.html> from a convenience store and assaulted the store's clerk on Saturday. ""Today I will meet with the chief of Ferguson and talk about what was released and try to get a copy,"" he said, emphasizing several times that he will be returning to the protest site today to meet with residents. ""This afternoon I will be walking back down to the QuikTrip, and I will talk to the people there and explain what I see in the packet and some of the questions that may have been unclear in the presentation this morning, I will try to make those clear.""

He also spoke more broadly about the response to Brown's death: ""This inner anger ... we have to make sure that we don't burn down our own house, that we don't go down there and vandalize our own buildings. We can stand on the sidewalk and we can talk about our issues and we can talk about what we want and what we need and a conversation that needs to happen and we can make that happen. But what I don't want is us to go down and burn down our own neighborhood. That doesn't prove a point. That does not solve the issue. That hurts this community, and that's what I don't want.""

One questioner asked him a broad question about race relations and justice. ""The governor talked about old wounds,"" Johnson said. ""This is an old wound. It's time to stop saying it's an old wound, and close it for good."" Later he spoke about the future of the community: ""Yesterday we saw what it could be. We saw what it should be. And we saw what it will be.""",80,1000,NA,NA
Slate,slate27,http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/ferguson_libertarians_have_been_leading_the_charge_against_the_militarization.html,Don’t Bring a Tank to Pumpkin Fest,David Weigel,08/15/2014,02/17/2016,"In December 2012, when Washington’s press corps was peering over the “fiscal cliff,” Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn {released a report}<hyperlink=“http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public//index.cfm?a=Files.Serve&File_id=b86fdaeb-86ff-4d19-a112-415ec85aa9b6”> that looked and sounded too goofy to be real. The cover of “Safety at Any Price: Assessing the Impact of Homeland Security Spending on U.S. Cities” portrayed a child-size drone flying near the Capitol; over ATV-driving Lego men; and, for some reason, over R2D2.
 
“If in the days after 9/11 lawmakers were able to cast their gaze forward ten years,” wrote Coburn, “I imagine they would be surprised to see how a counter-terrorism initiative aimed at protecting our largest cities has transformed into another parochial grant program.”

His researchers had dug up dozens of examples and told the story of how local police forces started to look like occupying armies, thanks to $35 billion in Department of Homeland Security grants. Seattle had spent $80,000 on a drone, which it insisted was not a drone. Pittsburgh had spent $90,000 on a sonic cannon, and used it to break up G-20 protests, though a SWAT officer {assured a reporter}<hyperlink=“http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.html”> that the device was just “a speaker that delivers an intended message to an intended group of people to disperse.”

And then there were the armored vehicles. Police departments in less-than-bustling towns suddenly needed $250,000 armored BearCats. “Because Fontana, California considers itself a ‘top 100 terrorist target,’ ” wrote Coburn’s researchers, “it needed a BearCat.” In New Hampshire, the {libertarians of Keene}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/live_free_or_move.html”> had been fighting, unsuccessfully, a police department that wanted a BearCat to guard an annual harvest celebration. “Do I think al-Qaida is going to target Pumpkin Fest?” Keene’s police chief asked, rhetorically. “No, but are there fringe groups that want to make a statement? Yes.”

There were no attacks, and there was little coverage of Coburn’s report. Gene Healy, a vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute, {publicized Coburn’s findings}<hyperlink=“http://washingtonexaminer.com/gene-healy-homeland-security-grants-subsidize-dystopia/article/2515559”> in a column. Radley Balko, a former Huffington Post reporter who’d worked with Healy at Cato (and, full disclosure, with me at Reason), {praised the report}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/radley-balko/the-terrorfighting-boondo_b_2257954.html”>, which touched on stories he’d covered, like the BearCat fight in Keene. Coburn appeared on Neil Cavuto’s Fox Business show (not to be confused with the more widely watched Fox News shows), where the discussion quickly veered from the report’s highlights (“zombie apocalypse training”) to the more exciting fiscal cliff. Attacking the military buildup of local police, on its own, was just too kooky.

What a difference {Ferguson}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-missouri-in-wake-of-clashes-calls-to-demilitarize-police.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSum&module=b-lede-package-region&region=lede-package&WT.nav=lede-package&_r=0”> makes. This week, when {Sen. Rand Paul published}<hyperlink=“”http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/08/14/rand_paul_it_is_impossible_for_african_americans_not_to_feel_like_their.html> a brief op-ed denouncing “Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars,” he conquered the headlines. The New York Times, which had just published {an epic story about libertarians, offered that}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/magazine/has-the-libertarian-moment-finally-arrived.html”> “conservatives tend to be fairly consistent” on law and order, and Paul was acting as a disrupter. “Rand Paul is right,” {argued Al Sharpton}<hyperlink=“http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/15/al-sharpton-rand-paul-is-right/”>, who is more familiar with being labeled an “outside agitator” by conservatives than with complimenting them.

But libertarians and libertarian-leaning Republicans have been attacking the militarization of police forces for the better part of a decade. They come at the issue from a stronger ideological position than the left does, or can. Decades of tough-on-crime policies have made the right (and libertarians are part of the right) less vulnerable to charges of softness and thug-coddling. And the libertarian answer to crime has never been about empowering the police. In the ideal liberal scenario—{call it “Japan”}<hyperlink=“”http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/> or “any part of Europe”— civilians have as much access to firearms as they have to rocket launchers and ICBMs. In the libertarian ideal, the state has no more firepower to control civilians than the civilians have to police themselves, or to fight back.

It’s hard to date when the backlash began, or when it became mainstream, but 1989 is a good time to start. That was a hot year for the crack wars, not long before Washington Mayor Marion Barry was arrested with a pipe in the room, and the year Congress’ National Defense Authorization Act {added}<hyperlink=“”https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/41831/how-congress-helped-create-fergusons-militarized-police> Section 1208. The new NDAA language authorized the transfer of excess military equipment “suitable for use” in “counter-drug activities.”

In 1989, that meant almost anything. The first time many Americans realized that was in August 1992, when the ATF, FBI, Border Patrol, U.S. Marshals, Idaho National Guard, Idaho state police, and local police {laid siege}<hyperlink=“http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/weaver/weaveraccount.html”> to Randy Weaver’s home in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, with assault weapons and night-vision goggles. The siege started with the deaths of Weaver’s son and one of the dogs, and the Weaver family would eventually settle for more than $3 million. But less than a year later, some of the same agencies (and some of the same agents, as Radley Balko points out in {Rise of the Warrior Cop}<hyperlink=“http://www.amazon.com/dp/1610392116/?tag=slatmaga-20”>) raided David Koresh’s compound outside Waco, Texas, smashing the walls with tanks and shooting 350 rounds of tear gas inside.

Seventy-six people died. But Bill Clinton was in the White House. The gun control lobby was experiencing what would be, in retrospect, its finest hour—the passage of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which banned the sale of “assault weapons” until 2004.

As conservatives and libertarians saw it, and as the gun lobby saw it, the government was arming a police state while making it illegal and impossible for citizens to defend themselves from tyranny. “Not too long ago, it was unthinkable for federal agents wearing Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding citizens,” read a 1995 National Rifle Association fundraising letter signed by Wayne LaPierre. “Not today.” You can draw a straight line from that letter to, this week, WorldNetDaily {posting photos of American cops}<hyperlink=“http://www.wnd.com/2014/08/ferguson-focus-turns-from-riots-to-militarized-cops/”> who look like they’re breaking up rallies in Tahrir Square.

After the events of this week, the right-wingers who’d been warning about fat contracts arming thuggish police departments are suddenly finding themselves in step with the left. But it’s the right-wingers who might be the best political allies that Ferguson’s black protesters have. Like Trayvon Martin’s Florida, like {John Crawford’s Ohio}<hyperlink=“”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/family-man-killed-cops-walmart-demands-surveillance-video>, Michael Brown’s Missouri is governed by a Republican legislature that has gerrymandered itself into at least another decade of power. State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, who represents {Ferguson}<hyperlink=“https://ballotpedia.org/File:MO_SD_14.JPG”> and {live-tweeted}<hyperlink=“http://www.businessinsider.com/missouri-state-senator-gassed-while-protesting-in-ferguson-2014-8”> her tear-gassing by police, is one of 10 Democrats outnumbered by 24 Republicans. Florida’s Dream Defenders, {who occupied the state Capitol}<hyperlink=“http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-road-the-dream-defenders”> to demand a second look at “stand your ground” law, made up no ground at all with the conservative legislators.

But the Dream Defenders have common cause with libertarians. In Keene, for example, the {movement}<hyperlink=“”http://freekeene.com/2012/02/08/desperate-lenco-pulls-bearcat-promo-video-offline/> to stop the BearCat sale—“tanks, but no tanks”—was led by libertarians who ideally wanted a cop-free city. {Pete Eyre}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/inside-the-libertarian-version-of-burning-man-guns-booze-and-bitcoin/2014/07/01/74d9d996-ffcf-11e3-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd_story.html”>, who once aspired to become a police officer, became a libertarian instead, and ended up in Keene after touring the country in an RV to make movies about freedom.

“On the road, we just happened to have interactions with police employees, and it seemed clear that they didn’t like being filmed,” Eyre told me. “It became clear that capturing the truth of the situation might be powerful.”

That revelation led Eyre to co-found {CopBlock}<hyperlink=“http://www.copblock.org/”>, which encourages citizens to film the police—an action that got two reporters illegally arrested in Ferguson, piling outrage on top of the outrage. It also led to Eyre’s lobbying (“there were songs, music videos, petitions”) against the BearCat, which became enough of an early warning signal to make it into a Republican senator’s paper about post-9/11 police militarization.

“As people start to film what they see and pursue tactics that are peaceful,” said Eyre, “ultimately these incidents will continue to happen until the institution of policing, which is a coercive monopoly, is denied legitimacy. Badges don’t grant extra rights. If an action’s unlawful for me or you, it’s unlawful for anyone.”

That’s further than many liberals would be willing to go, obviously. And they’re not going to stop campaigning for gun control. But if they want to stop police departments from turning into shoot-first armies, the libertarians have been waiting for them. In June, 18 months after the Coburn report, the New York Times’ Matt Apuzzo published a {wide-ranging study}<hyperlink=“”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?smid=tw-share> of what military equipment was making it to the sheriff’s office and how. In Morgan County, Indiana, the police acquired an MRAP because, in one sergeant’s words, “a lot of people who are coming out of the military that have the ability and knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law-enforcement techniques.”

If that sounded familiar, it may have been because in April 2009 the DHS {released a report}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/14/federal-agency-warns-of-radicals-on-right/”> warning that the fringe was rising and that “rightwing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize returning veterans in order to exploit their skills and knowledge derived from military training and combat.” This was just days before the first big national wave of Tea Party rallies, and to the horror of progressives, some activists showed up with signs that dared the DHS to go after “rightwing extremists” like them.

Five years later, the progressives still disagree with the right-wingers. They still reject, as insane, the idea that a heavily armed citizenry might be safer than a country where the cops have the guns. But they suddenly agree about something.",955,3800,NA,Has a subtitle

Online activist Feminista Jones organized the protests, collectively called National Moment of Silence 2014, in response to the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In Washington, more than 1,000 people—brought together almost entirely through social media—chanted, shared the stories of those who have died, and debated, often heatedly, the merits of nonviolent protest against police brutality. 

The crowd that gathered in Meridian Hill Park (also known as Malcolm X Park) was remarkably diverse—an assembly one might call a vision of post-racial America if it weren’t for the fact that it was called into being by the bluntest possible reminder that race relations in America remain fraught. 

The organizers there were not interested in erasing race. They were interested in creating an America where one's racial identity need not be a death sentence. As protest demands go, theirs was fairly simple: Police officers and those who imagine themselves to be police should stop killing innocent black people.

As the event went on, some members of the crowd loudly voiced conflicting ideas about how to make that happen. One of the speakers berated military veterans now on police forces for staying on war footing at home. An Iraq veteran in the crowd yelled back his dissent. At several points, some voice from an unseen corner accused all assembled of cowardice and called for violent action. A newsstand of Marxist pamphlets for sale materialized.

Through it all, the majority of attendees who came voiced their commitment to nonviolence and talked with strangers who often shared little else with them but the shock and grief felt watching this past week's events in Ferguson.",21,40,NA,Has a subtitle

The violent protests came after a day in which public anger against authorities increased, after police said Brown was suspected of stealing cigars. But later the police said the officer who shot Brown did not know he was a suspect in a robbery. The Brown family was angry at the release of the surveillance tape that appeared to show Brown shoving a store clerk.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said one protester shot another. In all, seven people were arrested early Sunday for ""failure to disperse"" during a five-hour curfew that was imposed earlier in the day. Johnson said the police used tear gas in response to a report of the shooting and arrested the seven people from the roof of a restaurant.

Update, 2:45 a.m.: The vast majority of protesters left the streets of Ferguson peacefully around midnight as the curfew began to take effect. Less than an hour into the five-hour curfew, police began moving in on a group of around 150-200 protesters who defied the curfew (and heavy rain) to stay out in the street and protest. “No justice, no curfew,” they chanted.

A handful of protesters who were “a noticeably younger group than what has been the norm in Ferguson” began marching toward the police, reports {KTLA}<hyperlink=“http://ktla.com/2014/08/16/missouri-governor-declares-state-of-emergency-implements-curfew-in-ferguson/”>. As groups of police officers stood guard outside businesses to prevent looting, another set of officers began to slowly move toward the protesters. Police denied initial reports that they had fired several rounds of tear gas into the protesters, insisting they were smoke bombs. Others aren’t so sure.

The Guardian’s Jon Swaine, for example, directly calls the claim a lie:

Whether it was tear gas or not is a key question because State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of Ferguson security, had earlier said police wouldn’t enforce the curfew “with trucks, we won’t enforce it with tear gas.” Meanwhile, there are reports of a shooting, but Anthony Ellis, one of the “peacekeeper” volunteers at the scene said it was one protester shooting another as the police were moving in, according to the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=“http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/protesters-gather-police-deploy-in-ferguson/article_fd8c251f-ff3e-51ed-bfcb-2be8fbe252b4.html”>. There is no confirmation yet, but it seems several protesters were arrested. And almost two hours after the curfew began, it appears most of the streets of Ferguson have been cleared, but it’s difficult to tell, particularly considering that officers are keeping reporters away from the scene, reportedly threatening arrests to anyone who leaves a designated press area.

Original post, 5:35 p.m.: Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency Saturday, imposing a curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. on Ferguson after several stores were looted overnight. “We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching,” Nixon said at a news conference Saturday afternoon, according to the {Associated Press}<hyperlink=“http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_POLICE_SHOOTING_MISSOURI?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2014-08-16-16-40-45”>. “We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.”

Nixon, who gave the news conference with Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson at a church in Ferguson, was repeatedly interrupted while he tried to speak from people who demanded justice, illustrating the tense situation and widespread anger that continues to dominate in the St. Louis suburb. The FBI sent 40 agents to Ferguson on Saturday morning, and they are going door-to-door to question potential witnesses of Michael Brown’s shooting last week, Johnson said.

Baden also said that Brown would not have survived even if he'd been taken to the hospital immediately. He was also cautious about reading too much into his report. ""Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.""

To The Brown Family,
I wish I had a word of automatic comfort but I don’t. I wish I could say that it will be alright on a certain or specific day but I can’t. I wish that all of the pain that I have endured could possibly ease some of yours but it won’t. What I can do for you is what has been done for me: pray for you then share my continuing journey as you begin yours.
Further complicating the pain and loss in this tragedy is the fact that the killer of your son is alive, known, and currently free. In fact, he is on paid administrative leave. Your own feelings will bounce between sorrow and anger. Even when you don’t want to think about it because it is so much to bear, you will be forced to by merely turning on your television or answering your cell phone. You may find yourselves pulled in many different directions by strangers who may be well-wishers or detractors. Your circle will necessarily close tighter because the trust you once, if ever, you had in “the system” and their agents are forever changed. Your lives are forever changed…
Honor your son and his life, not the circumstances of his alleged transgressions. I have always said that Trayvon was not perfect. But no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed.

He did not spring into action when protests began in the suburb of St. Louis.

And—wonder of wonders, the calm was shattered on the night of Aug. 15. The state of emergency was declared the very next day.

America’s top law enforcement official will meet with FBI agents conducting the civil rights investigation into the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed, black 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a white police officer a little more than a week ago. The investigation into Brown’s death—which will include {a federal autopsy of his body}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/08/18/michael_brown_autopsy_report_shows_ferguson_teenager_was_shot_six_times.html”>—is expected to take some time. But its end will likely only mark the beginning of a larger probe into the Ferguson Police Department, which has seemingly gone out of its way to stoke protesters’ anger by refusing to clarify the circumstances of the shooting, and by greeting the originally peaceful protests with military-grade riot gear.

Any meaningful reconciliation to the chaos and conflict provoked by this episode will have to include reform of the Ferguson Police Department. But how could that be done? How do you fix a police department that has proven it can’t police itself?

If Holder concludes that there has been a pattern of misconduct by the police—either in the lead-up to Brown’s death or in its aftermath—the president has the ability to force widespread reforms within the department with the help of a law passed in the wake of the Rodney King beating. The provision in question, part of what was officially known as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, is {“one of the most significant” pieces of civil rights legislation}<hyperlink=“http://www.thecrimereport.org/news/articles/2014-07-police-reforms-best-tool-a-federal-consent-decree”> passed in the latter part of the 20th century, and also one of the most “overlooked,” {according to Joe Domanick}<hyperlink=“http://samuelwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DOJTheCrimeReport.pdf”>, the associate director of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice’s Center on Media, Crime, and Justice. The law gives the federal government two options: It can either formally pursue a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Ferguson Police Department by alleging a “pattern and practice” of misconduct or the administration and city officials can enter into what is known as a “consent decree” that would mandate a specific set of reforms that would then be overseen by an independent court-appointed monitor. Faced with the possibility of a costly court battle, most cities have historically taken the path of least resistance and signed on the decree’s dotted lines. Ferguson officials probably wouldn’t buck that trend.

According to Samuel Walker, the emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, such an outcome is “the best hope we have” for turning around the troubled department. The reforms that normally accompany a consent decree “really get at the critical issue here, which is the culture of the department,” Walker says. “Day in and day out, what do officers know they have to do and what do they know that they can get away with?”

For evidence of what happens when a department has a culture where officers have no reason to believe there is serious oversight, Walker didn’t need to dive far into the Ferguson timeline for Exhibit A—a video clip recorded this past weekend that captured a police officer shouting, {“Bring it, all you fucking animals! Bring it!”}<hyperlink=“http://www.colorlines.com/articles/police-officer-calls-ferguson-protestors-animals”> at protesters. “If they know they can get away with that type of language, that really defines the culture of the department,” Walker says. “You need to change the way that [officers] think and act so they know they can’t do policing the way they are used to doing it.”

So what would such a consent decree actually look like in Ferguson? Each settlement is unique, but generally speaking they last a minimum of five years and ensure that the reform process is a public one. The agreed upon reforms have historically covered three main areas, according to Walker: overhauling of the department’s use-of-force policies, including how such incidents are investigated internally; enacting an early intervention system that relies on a variety of data, ranging from citizen complaints against an officer to the demographics of his or her traffic stops; and creating a clear, open process through which citizens can lodge complaints when they feel they’ve been mistreated. All three seem necessary in the wake of what we’ve learned about Ferguson in the past week.

In the past two decades, more than 20 cities have entered into such agreements with the federal government, both in big cities like Los Angeles and New Orleans and in smaller ones closer in size to Ferguson, places like East Haven, Connecticut, and Steubenville, Ohio. The results are mixed.

Reforms are often slowed when local officials fail to buy in fully to the need for change and resist. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, for example, unsuccessfully tried to appeal a pair of decrees covering Orleans Parish Prison and his city’s police department, arguing the city didn’t have the money it would take to pay for the reforms. And as Domanick {recounted earlier this summer}<hyperlink=“http://samuelwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DOJTheCrimeReport.pdf”>, police in Cincinnati were so uncooperative during the time they were undergoing reforms that on “at least one occasion the monitor was actually kicked out of police headquarters.”

Still, there is evidence that real reform is possible, even if it takes time. The best-documented example of such an effort succeeding is, somewhat remarkably, in Los Angeles, where the beating of King by police helped prompt passage of the federal law in the first place. The city signed its consent decree in 2000 following a particularly shameful stretch that included both the King beating and the Rampart scandal that saw scores of officers affiliated with the department’s anti-gang efforts implicated in a variety of misconduct. Before the decade came to a close, however, there were already signs of significant improvement. An {independent study published in 2009}<hyperlink=“http://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/67474/1242706/version/1/file/Harvard_LAPD_Report.pdf”> by a trio of researchers at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government found rather stunning results. “Policing in Los Angeles today is noticeably different from what it was only a few years ago,” the authors wrote then. “The quality of service to residents is higher, the perception of the LAPD as fair has risen, and the use of force is down.”

The numbers behind that conclusion tell an even stronger story, most notably this one: 83 percent of residents said that the police department was doing a good or excellent job. That, again, was less than two decades after residents watched in horror as news stations broadcast a home video of a group of LAPD officers beating an unarmed King nearly to death.

Still, the LAPD reforms did not happen overnight and the reform of the Ferguson Police Department, if it ever happens, would likewise take years. And even if that were to happen there is no guarantee that any changes that are enacted will become permanent. “Once the monitor goes away, will these reforms have been institutionalized? Can [police departments] sustain these reforms?” says Walker of the problems facing any reformed department, not just a hypothetical Ferguson. “We need to make sure that these things last.”",860,635,NA,NA

His big point is that the local police have a strong financial incentive to arrest, ticket, and otherwise harass the city’s black residents for minor offenses, because that’s how the department funds its budget.

How so? From Smith:

St. Louis County contains 90 municipalities, most with their own city hall and police force. Many rely on revenue generated from traffic tickets and related fines. According to a study by the St. Louis nonprofit {Better Together}<hyperlink=“http://www.bettertogetherstl.com/”>, Ferguson receives nearly one-quarter of its revenue from court fees; for some surrounding towns it approaches 50 percent.

Municipal reliance on revenue generated from traffic stops adds pressure to make more of them. One town, Sycamore Hills, has stationed a radar-gun-wielding police officer on its 250-foot northbound stretch of Interstate.

When you split a metro area into dozens of tiny local governments (St. Louis County, to be clear, doesn’t include the actual city of St. Louis, which spun off from it in the 19th century), they tend to duplicate each others’ services, which is of course extremely expensive. But raising taxes so that each tiny borough can afford its own police and fire department is a nonstarter, since wealthy residents can always just move one town over. End result: You have police departments that self-fund by handing out tickets. And thanks to the delightful racial dynamics of U.S. law enforcement, black residents are disproportionately stopped and accosted, even though police in Ferguson are less likely to find contraband when they search black drivers than when they search whites.

Michael Brown wasn't being pulled over for speeding when he was shot. But we're talking about the broader issues that poison the relationship between a community and the cops who are, theoretically, paid to protect them.

In a way, you can think of it as a small-bore version of the problem with {civil forfeiture laws}<hyperlink=“http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/08/12/taken”>, which allow state and federal governments to confiscate property allegedly involved in crimes and which are often accused of encouraging “for-profit policing.” The same way the Justice Department puts the heat on its lawyers to increase forfeiture claims in drug cases—because that’s where they can skim money—local police have every incentive to crank up their traffic stops.  

Smith’s solution to the problem is to remerge St. Louis and its nearby suburbs, which will help the metro area feel less fragmented and help give the black community of Ferguson more political power to demand better treatment from police. As {I wrote last week}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/08/14/ferguson_missouri_government_why_is_it_so_white.html”>, while the city is two-thirds black, its government is mostly white, because the young, poor, and often transient black community has trouble mobilizing votes. In St. Louis, by comparison, the black population has been able to establish stronger civic institutions and exerted more influence. Of the many formidable problems that Ferguson has come to symbolize, we can add for-profit law enforcement to the list.",482,1200,NA,NA

{The unrest in Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/topics/f/ferguson.html”>, is posing some new questions about law enforcement and the militarization of the police. Three teenagers from Georgia have decided to take the issue into their own hands.

Caleb Christian, 14, and his two sisters—Ima, 16, and Asha, 15—are about to roll out an app called “Five-O,” which will let users document police abuse and join together as a community to problem-solve.

“We’ve been hearing about the negative instances in the news, for instance most recently the Michael Brown case, and we always talk about these issues with our parents,” Ima Christian told Business Insider. “They always try to reinforce that we should focus on solutions. It's important to talk about the issues, but they try to make us focus on finding solutions. That made us think why don't we create an app to help us solve this problem.”

Five-O lets users submit the details of any incident of police abuse and rate the specific officer. The app also has community boards for different counties so that users can communicate and plan responses to any difficulties with local police.

The idea is to collect data that users can then bring to community activists, the media, and other forms of law enforcement. That way, it's not just “he said, she said,” Caleb said. And they're hoping to illuminate both the negative and the positive interactions users have with police officers. They want the good examples to serve as motivation for officers to do better.

But don't be fooled by these teenagers’ young age. They are determined to make a difference. “You’re never too young to learn, and you're never too young to make a difference,” Caleb said.

The Christian siblings all have a strong background in coding, which made it possible for them to create Five-O along with two other apps (Coily and Froshly), all under their app development company called {Pinetart Inc.}<hyperlink=“http://pinetartinc.com/”> Caleb, Ima, and Asha all participated in MIT's k12 Scratch and App Inventor program, and with their parents' encouragement (both have backgrounds in technology), continued to learn JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java.

Five-O will be available on Monday for both iOS and {Android}<hyperlink=“https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.five_o”> devices.

Slate,slate40,http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/ferguson_protests_over_michael_brown_won_t_end_soon_the_black_community.html,Why the Fires in Ferguson Won’t End Soon,Jamelle Bouie,08/19/2014,02/18/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo.—Talk to anyone in Ferguson and you’ll hear a story about the police. “One of my friends had a son killed by the Ferguson Police Department, about 10 years ago,” said Carl Walker, a Vietnam veteran and former parole officer who came to show his support for demonstrators in Ferguson. “They wouldn’t release the name of the officer who killed him. Why wouldn’t you release the name?”

“The cops said he shot at them—case closed,” said Al Cole, referring to a cousin who was killed by Ferguson police in 2000. “Even as a teenager, 13 or 14 years old, I’ve been slammed on police cars … now I try to avoid riding through Ferguson.”

“Some police say they saw me at a house, pulled me, said I fit a description, locked me up, and found out I was on parole,” said Craig Beck, who was watching demonstrators under the shade of a burned-out QuikTrip convenience store. “They said I threw a plastic baggie, which they didn’t have when they took me into custody.” He continues: “I beat the case, but you know, this isn’t new. This happens every day.”

Everyone—or at least, every black person—can recall an incident. Everyone can attest to friends and relatives who have been harassed, assaulted, or worse by the police.

Perhaps one of the most disturbing cases was last year’s {shooting of Cary Ball Jr.}<hyperlink=“http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2013/05/29/second-rally-today-for-police-shooting-victim/”>, a 25-year-old black student at St. Louis Community College–Forest Park. The official police report is that Ball crashed his car after a high-speed chase, ran away, and aimed his weapon at officers after they confronted him. Witnesses say Ball had thrown his gun to the ground and was walking toward police—hands up—when he was shot and killed with 25 rounds. A federal investigation cleared the officers. Likewise, that February, surveillance video from a casino showed St. Louis police slamming a black man’s head into the bumper of a vehicle, after a {dispute}<hyperlink=“http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/accuser-in-st-louis-police-brutality-case-arrested-after-testifying/article_15d96980-5fef-52ff-8fe1-020e8921c8cc.html”> over gambling and trespassing. And in March of this year, a {video}<hyperlink=“http://legacy.ksdk.com/story/news/2014/04/03/mario-crump-video-police-beating-st-louis/7238979/”> showed St. Louis police officers beating a mentally disabled man in his home, after the family called police for help.

These weren’t isolated events. A 2012 report from University of Missouri–St. Louis criminologist David Klinger found that, from 2008 to 2011, St. Louis police officers fired their weapons 98 times. “Any comparison across cities right now is still missing the lion’s share of circumstances in which people are shot by the police,” Klinger {said}<hyperlink=“http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/study-of-st-louis-police-shootings-recommends-transparency-training/article_fa40beca-e401-5d05-bc60-34ea1923b296.html”> to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “There are only a smattering of cities that report their officer-involved shootings, and when compared against them, St. Louis is on the high end.” The data on police violence is incomplete, as there is no federal effort to pull together information on unjustified homicides. But the anecdotes of brutality and excessive force out of St. Louis  and St. Louis County are rampant and often startling. In 2009, {for example}<hyperlink=“http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html”>, a man was wrongly arrested, beaten by police, and subsequently charged for bleeding on their uniforms.

This abuse is so ubiquitous that the shooting of Michael Brown might seem like static against a backdrop of awfulness. But even for the area, Brown’s death was brutal. Which is why—in an otherwise quiet town in an otherwise quiet area—we’re dealing with an explosive fire that shows no signs of ending.

By now, if you’ve followed the news, you know the story has two sides.

Police say Brown resisted arrest and assaulted an officer. “The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,” said St. Louis County police Chief Jon Belmar during a press conference after the shooting. In the official narrative, a routine stop turned into a struggle with two men, Brown and his friend. As officer Darren Wilson tried to leave his vehicle, one of the two pushed him back into the car and lunged for his gun. During the struggle, one shot was fired, and soon after, Brown was shot multiple times on the street.

To the eyewitnesses, this story is nonsense. Dorian Johnson was with Brown at the time of the encounter. He was the “other man.” In {his account}<hyperlink=“http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2485988162”>, the two were walking down the middle of the street, having a conversation, when Wilson—the shooter—drove down and told them to “get the f--k off the street.” They continued, he drove off, and a few seconds later, he reversed his car in their direction and opened the door. As Johnson describes it, “He was so close to us that [the door] … bounced back toward him. At that point, he reached out the window and tried to choke my friend. We were trying to get away, and he tried to pull my friend into the car.” A few moments later, Wilson pulled out his gun and shot Brown, injuring him. “We look at [Brown], he was shot and there was blood comin’ from him. … We took off running, and I hid because I feared for my life. My friend took off running, too,” explained Johnson.

Wilson then stepped out of the car, weapon drawn, and shot again. “Once my friend felt that, he put his arms in the air, and he started to get down, but the officer still approached with the weapon drawn, and he fired several more shots, and my friend died. He didn’t say anything to him, he just stood over him and kept shooting.” Another witness {described}<hyperlink=“http://www.kmov.com/video?id=270621691&sec=549692”> a similar scene. “I know he shot that child, and when he shot him, the little boy fell, then he shot him six more times,” said one woman in an interview with local newscasters.

To residents of Ferguson, in other words, the situation is simple. Michael Brown was executed by an angry cop. You can hear their shock and fear in a {video}<hyperlink=“https://www.youtube.com/verify_controversy?next_url=/watch%3Fv%3DVdL9dqkyjhM%26feature%3Dyoutu.be”> recorded just after the shooting. “They killed him for no reason … they just killed this n---er for no reason,” said one man. “Do you see a knife? Do you see anything that would have caused a threat to these motherf--kin’ police? They shot that boy because they wanted to shoot that boy in the middle of the motherf--kin’ day in the middle of the motherf--kin’ street.”

A forthright police department could have calmed these nerves. They could have answered basic questions: Who was the shooter? How many times did he fire? What was Brown stopped for? And why did officers let his body sit in the street for four hours?

Instead, led by Chief Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson Police Department stonewalled at every turn, refusing cooperation and transparency. And when residents began to gather near the site of Brown’s shooting to demonstrate and memorialize, police responded with guns and dogs, sparking a cycle of protest and repression. Nightly demonstrations from residents were met with tear gas and rubber bullets by aggressive, militarized police, which sparked larger, more aggressive demonstrations and harsher, more draconian responses, justified by reports of looting and violence. After an especially bad night of clashes on Sunday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon sent the National Guard to Ferguson to attempt to keep the peace.

Given frustrated residents and a recalcitrant Ferguson Police Department—which has yet to release its autopsy report—it’s hard to know if calm is possible. Insofar that there’s new information, it’s from a private autopsy report, {released on Sunday}<hyperlink=“”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0>, which shows Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. And on Monday, demonstrations took another turn for the worst, as police fired tear gas into crowds, and a handful of protesters {returned fire}<hyperlink=“http://www.newsweek.com/sun-goes-down-ferguson-protesters-march-ninth-night-265506”> with live rounds.

But while calm is hard to predict, one thing is clear: The events in Ferguson—from the shooting to the police response and everything since—are a product of familiar forces and stem from a familiar history. Put another way, the area’s long-bottled racial tension has burst, and it’s difficult to know if it can be resolved, much less contained.

Like many American cities, {St. Louis can’t be untangled from segregation}<hyperlink=“”http://mappingdecline.lib.uiowa.edu/map/>. In 1916, it became one of the first places to formalize racial segregation by designating particular “Negro blocks” where blacks would be concentrated and legally forbidden from leaving. The Supreme Court struck the ordinance in 1917, but private real estate agents and other groups responded with informal means of enforcing segregation. In 1923, the St. Louis Real Estate Exchange created zones in the city’s black neighborhoods to limit the extent of black housing. Real estate agents could sell to black families inside the zones, but would lose their licenses if they sold homes outside the zones.

In 1941—bolstered by federal housing discrimination—real estate agents combined these zones into a single district and adopted “racial covenants” that restricted or banned the sale of properties to black families outside of the district. As professor Colin Gordon of the University of Iowa {wrote}<hyperlink=“http://mappingdecline.lib.uiowa.edu/map/”>, “Both the City’s Real Estate Exchange and the Missouri Real Estate Commission routinely and openly interpreted sales to blacks in white areas as a form of professional misconduct,” and by the 1940s, “almost 380 covenants covered large and strategic swaths of the City’s residential property base.”

The G.I. Bill and the end of World War II sparked a massive move to the suburbs. Between 1950 and 1970, close to 60 percent of whites had moved to suburbs in the western parts of St. Louis County. Blacks —pushed by “urban renewal” and other policies—also moved, but restrictive covenants limited mobility to northern parts of the city and county.

As the area entered the 1980s, racial succession had taken hold, as blacks entered older, inner-ring suburbs and whites left for the far reaches of the county. Depopulation accelerated—the city of St. Louis lost more than a third of its residents—and the suburban “color line” had drifted to include most of the North County suburbs. “Ghetto spillover,” said one local, noted by Gordon, “now stretches almost all the way across the county in a northwesterly direction.” In 1990, Ferguson was 74 percent white and 25 percent black. Now, at 67 percent black and 29 percent white, it’s nearly reversed.

As of 2010, 42 years after Congress passed the Fair Housing Act, greater St. Louis was one of {the most segregated areas}<hyperlink=“http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Data/Report/report2.pdf”> in the United States. And segregation comes with a familiar set of problems. Middle-class neighborhoods—and thus middle-class services—are few and far between, with most wealth concentrated in the farther, whiter reaches of the county.

As the New America Foundation’s Dana Goldstein {finds}<hyperlink=“”http://www.danagoldstein.com/2014/08/michael-browns-school.html>, the schools are in bad shape as well. Michael Brown attended Normandy High, where he was one of the 58 percent of students who graduated this year (compared with a statewide average of 80). In 2011, 98 percent of the 1,064 students at the school were black, and 74 percent were low-income. Most tellingly, 45 percent of Normandy students were suspended that year, and—given what we know about the area—there’s no question some were funneled into the criminal justice system.

With broad housing inequality and entrenched segregation, it shouldn’t be a shock to learn that banks targeted North County—and other predominantly black areas {nationwide}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/black_homeownership_how_the_recession_turned_owners_into_renters_and_obliterated.html”>—with {subprime loans}<hyperlink=“http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/blame-poverty-age-for-weak-north-county-home-market/article_95c998e5-bb87-5bc0-9054-83e801b357ac.html”>. The result was a community {hit hard}<hyperlink=“http://m.stltoday.com/business/columns/david-nicklaus/nicklaus-frustration-in-north-county-has-deep-economic-roots/article_3e54262d-59b5-5e2a-beac-349d0f63a1e8.html?mobile_touch=true”> by the 2008 recession. The unemployment rate for blacks there is three times as high as it is for whites, and among black men aged 16 to 24, the unemployment rate is a whopping 47 percent. This high inequality is exacerbated by intense sprawl, which {separates low-income residents from potential jobs}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/ikea_raising_wages_why_pay_hikes_aren_t_enough_to_solve_income_inequality.html”>. Which is to say that the same patterns of housing segregation that impede black wealth in cities like Chicago and Detroit—which top the list of segregated cities—are also operative in St. Louis.

“We’re continuously economically depressed, chronically unemployed, voter participation is typically low, and on any measure of health and viability, we would be at the bottom in the most deplorable ways,” said Etefia Umana, who sits on the board of Better Family Life, a local nonprofit, and hopes the Michael Brown demonstrations lead to broader social action.

All of these ills are made worse by the absence of black political and civic representation in many of the area’s 90 independent municipalities. For example, as has been {widely reported}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/08/14/ferguson_missouri_government_why_is_it_so_white.html”>, Ferguson has just one black city council member and three black police officers out of a force of 55. The mayor is white, the school superintendent is white, and the police chief is white. The disparity is easy to understand. “North County is becoming more transient, and you have a lot of people who are moving in temporarily and moving right out,” said Wesley Bell, a local law professor and prosecutor who ran for a seat on the St. Louis County Council this year. “Therefore, they may not get registered, they may not get involved in local politics if they’re just moving through.”

Moreover, as New School professor (and former St. Louis politician) Jeff Smith {explained}<hyperlink=“”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/opinion/in-ferguson-black-town-white-power.html> for the New York Times, overwhelmingly white labor organizations and other groups run effective get-out-the-vote operations, which bring thousands of voters to low-turnout elections and ensure white dominance in local political bodies. It also helps that area municipal elections are held in the spring, on off years, a Progressive-era election reform that {dramatically lowers turnout}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/15/how-ferguson-exposes-the-racial-bias-in-local-elections/”>. In the 2012 presidential elections, turnout for Ferguson blacks was 54 percent. The next year, in municipal elections, turnout had dropped to 6 percent.

An overbearing police presence is a defining feature of life in Ferguson and the rest of North County. Last year in Ferguson, 86 percent of stops, 92 percent of searches, and 93 percent of arrests {involved}<hyperlink=“http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf”> blacks, despite the fact that police found more “contraband” stopping white residents than black ones. I spoke to several young men in Ferguson—all teenagers or in their early 20s—who said they were stopped on a weekly basis. At a makeshift Michael Brown memorial, I asked one 20-year-old how many times he’s stopped by police, “About 10 times a month,” he said.

Again, the forces in St. Louis are familiar. And when it comes to police, what we see in Ferguson is a microcosm of the long and contentious relationship of black Americans to law enforcement.

During the first Great Migration of blacks in the early 20th century, a nascent group of black academics, lawyers, and other professionals began to study and report police violence toward blacks, prompted by the growing use of crime statistics to justify urban segregation—like the kind we see in St. Louis.

“They saw police officers as a form of state authority, and the most consistent form of government interaction for African-Americans,” says Khalil Gibran Muhammad, director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and author of {The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America}<hyperlink=“”http://www.amazon.com/dp/b008ttmga6/?tag=slatmaga-20>. For them, police weren’t civil servants as much as they were vectors for brutality, meant to isolate and contain black communities. “Blacks were the easiest targets of the police; their rights were the least respected, and they had only a modicum of political influence to hold officers accountable,” Muhammad wrote in his book. Criminality was well-distributed among the ethnic and racial groups of the North, but blacks were disproportionate targets for police. The result was a perception of black criminality despite the lack of clear evidence it actually existed.

That trend continued into the middle of the century. “African-Americans throughout the country confronted repressive police departments that were threatened by black demands for equality after World War II and intimidated by an expanded black populace as whites fled to the suburbs,” University of Texas professor Leonard N. Moore noted in {Black Rage in New Orleans: Police Brutality and African American Activism From World War II to Hurricane Katrina}<hyperlink=“http://www.amazon.com/dp/b004p1jcwm/?tag=slatmaga-20”>. He continued: “[A] cursory examination of black newspapers in the postwar period reveals articles … detailing cases of police brutality. Likewise, the archives of local and national civil rights organizations are filled with thousands of affidavits and letters relaying first-person experiences of police brutality.”

One incident, the 1961 killing of 11-year-old Allen Bruce Foster in New Orleans, stands out for its brutality. As one witness described it, “I saw the child running toward a red automobile. Just as he reached it he was shaken violently as bullets tore into his body. The boy let out a piercing scream—one I shall never forget and fell to the ground. A policeman then stooped over the boy and said, ‘Why didn’t you stop when I told you to halt?’ The boy never answered, never moved. I never heard anyone tell the boy to halt.”

What’s important to understand is that these incidents and interactions reflect upon themselves. “Too often the policeman’s club is the only instrument of the law with which the Negro comes into contact,” wrote Howard University criminologist Kelly Miller in a 1935 op-ed. “This engenders in him a distrust and resentful attitude toward all public authorities and law officers.”

If you’re trying to grasp the looting that has struck Ferguson throughout the demonstrations, there’s some of your answer. For as much as there are bad apples and provocateurs in any mass gathering, it’s also true that there’s a deep distrust of law enforcement across the black community that stems from decades of unfair treatment. “That’s our life. We black. We get pulled over everyday,” said two young demonstrators who declined to give their names, but were adamant—as chants of “Hands up, don’t shoot” filled the air—that they were “out here for Michael Brown” and “they would do it however they [the police] wanted to do it.”

Perhaps the closest analogue to the Michael Brown shooting is the Trayvon Martin killing. Both were young men in their teens, and both sparked discussions of profiling and racism.

But there’s a key difference. Martin wasn’t killed by a police officer; his shooter was George Zimmerman, a neighbor. Which meant that, for supporters of Martin, there was a concrete goal and a clear hope: Bring Zimmerman to trial and hope he’s convicted. Zimmerman wasn’t convicted, but his trial brought a measure of closure to the situation.

It’s possible that Darren Wilson will also be arrested and go to trial. But even if he’s convicted—even if the Brown family finds a measure of procedural justice—we will still be left with an unequal, segregated Ferguson in an unequal, segregated St. Louis County. The underlying problems of white flight, discrimination, and disinvestment will remain, and—absent a dramatic and unexpected change—they’ll persist into the next generation. We may never see another “Trayvon Martin” in Sanford, Florida, but I’m positive we’ll see another “Michael Brown” in Ferguson, Missouri.

Or somewhere else. Soon enough, demonstrators will be chanting the name of another young black man killed by another agent of the state charged with containing blacks, not protecting them. We want it to be one way—a world where the police are here to serve us all—but it’s the other way, a world where black bodies are the chief targets of American fear.

On last Thursday, the scene West Florissant, the main site of the demonstrations, was jubilant. The streets were thick with people chanting slogans and demanding “justice,” while cars drove by honking in support. A gospel choir sang, and Capt. Ron Johnson—the Missouri Highway Patrol chief tasked with maintaining order—mingled with the crowd, going so far as to march with the demonstrators.

By the next night, everything had fallen apart. Despite Johnson’s promise, police used tear gas against protesters, prompting more anger and more destruction.

On Sunday and Monday, the chaos repeated itself, with more gas and more rubber bullets. In all of the live streams and videos, one scene caught my eye.

On Monday night, they could watch (and follow along on Twitter) as CNN’s {Don Lemon was shoved by police}<hyperlink=“http://www.rawstory.com/2014/08/cnns-don-lemon-pushed-around-by-st-louis-cops-now-you-see-why-people-are-so-upset/”> and as his colleague {Jake Tapper fled tear gas}<hyperlink=“”http://www.thewrap.com/cnns-don-lemon-and-jake-tapper-flee-tear-gas-in-ferguson-video/>. The night before {MSNBC’s Chris Hayes was threatened with mace}<hyperlink=“”http://www.vox.com/michael-brown-shooting-ferguson-mo/2014/8/18/6032891/chris-hayes-ferguson-interview> and, in one of the more troubling moments caught on film since the demonstrations began, Mustafa Hussein, a journalist who has been live-streaming the unrest for Argus Radio, was warned by an officer to {turn off his camera light lest he be “shelled.”}<hyperlink=“”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/08/18/officer-appears-to-threaten-cameraman-covering-chaos-ferguson/>

Those reporters’ experiences aren’t unique­ and in fact are less threatening than what some of their colleagues have encountered (never mind the people of Ferguson, who have faced the greatest dangers by far). At last count, at least {11 journalists have been arrested or detained}<hyperlink=“http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-journalists-arrested/”> in Ferguson while covering the unrest, including the Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery and the Huffington Post’s Ryan Reilly, who were {the first high-profile media arrests}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/08/13/two_journalists_briefly_arrested_in_ferguson.html”> when they were taken into custody while in a McDonald’s. On Monday, Getty photographer Scott Olson {was arrested}<hyperlink=“http://darkroom.baltimoresun.com/2014/08/scott-olson-getty-images-photographer-arrested-documenting-ferguson-mo-unrest/#1”> after he ventured outside one of the pre-approved media pens that police have used to sequester reporters. All this despite President Obama twice publicly urging local authorities to let journalists do their jobs.

So it comes as little surprise that some media-watchers are beginning to argue that the reporters on the ground have lost their objectivity and are now, consciously or not, aligning themselves with the protesters and against the police. As Politico’s Dylan Byers {put it Tuesday}<hyperlink=“http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/has-the-media-gone-too-far-in-ferguson-194166”>, “Any journalist who stands on the front lines will inevitably be pushed, prodded or find themselves on the receiving end of a rubber bullet or tear-gas canister. In such an environment, it becomes near impossible not to identify with the protester.” Hot Air’s Noah Rothman, whose piece prompted Byers’ post, {had gone even further}<hyperlink=“http://hotair.com/archives/2014/08/19/is-the-press-in-ferguson-behaving-irresponsibly/”>. It is “clear that the press is no longer serving as objective chroniclers of the proceedings,” Rothman concluded after offering a few caveats about the media’s right to challenge authority. “In many ways, the media appears to believe that it is an active participant in the events in Missouri.”

Those worries are valid. But missing from such handwringing about the reporters’ ostensible loss of objectivity is the fact that the media had left the sidelines long before Lowery and Reilly were handcuffed. The very reason that national reporters—{including Slate’s Jamelle Bouie}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/ferguson_protests_over_michael_brown_won_t_end_soon_the_black_community.html”>—packed their bags for Ferguson was to get answers. Answers to why a member of the Ferguson Police Department opened fire on an unarmed black teen in broad daylight. Answers to why city officials originally refused to identify the cop involved in the shooting or even say how many bullets he had fired. Answers to why police were responding to what originally were largely peaceful protests with military-grade riot gear.

In short, the media descended on Ferguson looking for the same thing that had led protesters to take to the streets: the truth. That’s the real reason the media is siding with the protesters: What the people in the streets of Ferguson want is the same thing the journalists were sent there to find.  

Depending on events, that shared goal may last for many more days or it may be fleeting. The two sides are starting to part ways slowly as an increasing (yet still small) number of protesters turns violent, a parting that will likely accelerate if and when the protesters {start making specific demands}<hyperlink=“”http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/08/19/what_should_protesters_be_demanding_in_ferguson.html>. But for now, the protesters and the press have, to varying degrees, risked arrest and injury to force local authorities to be honest about what happened to Michael Brown 10 days ago. Reporters who appear to side with protesters may be failing some impossible litmus test of journalistic objectivity, but at least they’re being honest about why they’re there.",712,1100,NA,Has a subtitle
