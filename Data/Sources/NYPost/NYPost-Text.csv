Officer Darren Wilson suffered an “orbital blowout fracture to the eye socket,” {Gateway Pundit reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2014/08/breaking-report-po-darren-wilson-suffered-orbital-blowout-fracture-to-eye-socket-during-encounter-with-mike-brown/"">, citing sources in the St. Louis County Police Department and the DA’s office.

Wilson, who shot unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9, has not spoken publicly about the shooting, and is currently holed up at an undisclosed location.

A close friend revealed text messages the pair exchanged in which the cop said he is under 24-hour guard and “can’t go out,” the Daily Mail reported.

Jake Shepard, a nurse who has been friends with Wilson for 14 years, said Wilson did the right thing by defending himself against the hulking teen.

Wilson’s first text was sent last Friday after Shepard spoke to CNN in support of his pal.

“Thanks buddy I wasn’t expecting that,” Wilson wrote.

“No problem buddy, you deserve it,” Shepard responded, to which Wilson replied, “It means a lot thank you.”

Wilson texted him again on Monday, saying, “The support is really keeping me going during this stressful time. Just stay safe. I appreciate all you have done.”

Meanwhile, tensions flared in St. Louis — four miles from where Brown was slain — when cops killed a knife-wielding robbery suspect shouting, “Shoot me now! Kill me now!,” authorities said.

The shooting happened about 12:30 p.m. local time after the unidentified man had swiped energy drinks and pastries, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said.

“The suspect, who right now is described as a 23-year-old African-American, was acting erratically — walking back and forth up and down the street,” Dotson told reporters.

“As officers arrived, the suspect turned towards the officers and started to walk towards them clutching his waistband. He then pulled out a knife . . . and told the officers, ‘Shoot me now! Kill me now!’ ” the chief said.

“One of the witnesses described it as a suicide by cop.”

Cops said the shooting had no connection to the Ferguson case, describing it as an isolated incident.

But a crowd of about 100 gathered at the scene, some of them chanting “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” — the same refrain chanted by protesters in Ferguson.

The St. Louis cops involved in the shooting were placed on administrative duty according to department policy, Dotson said. Their identities were not revealed and neither officer’s race was immediately disclosed.

In Ferguson, officials called yet again for calm after at least 31 people were arrested overnight Monday into Tuesday — including a self-styled Communist revolutionary from Brooklyn.

Travis Morales was charged with refusal to disperse after he ignored cops’ orders to move, sources said.

A Vine video shows a man believed to be Morales — clad in a T-shirt that reads “Revolution, Nothing Less” — arguing with cops before his arrest.

State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson ripped Morales and other outside agitators for bringing violence to Ferguson.

“I am not going to let the criminals that have come here from across this country, or live in this neighborhood, define this community,” Johnson said.

About 17 others busted were also from out of state, including demonstrators from Chicago and other parts of Illinois, Alabama, Iowa, California, Washington, DC, and Austin, Texas.

Two people were shot overnight, but neither shooting involved the police. However, cops did fire multiple canisters of tear gas to disperse rioters and prevent further looting.

Also Tuesday, Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown’s family, said the teen’s funeral and memorial service would be held Monday.",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYPost,nyp2,http://nypost.com/2014/08/19/keep-your-distance-from-this-70s-show/,Keep your distance from this ‘70s show,John Podhoretz,08/19/2014,01/07/2016,"America first developed its taste for “nostalgia” culture — sentimental, rose-colored journeys into the recent past — in the 1970s.

From its first day to its last, that decade was a wretched time for the United States, and so it made sense for people living through it to lose themselves in memories of days not so long gone that seemed simpler, more innocent and less dirty (in every sense of the word).

Now, in the summer of 2014, we’re in the midst of a 1970s revival.

Only instead of the bittersweet sentiment that nostalgia usually invokes, the primary emotion today is a kind of horrified disbelief at the return of the decay and disorder that characterized our nation during its shabbiest decade.

Consider the ongoing tragedy in Ferguson, Mo. These nightly scenes of street rage following the killing of Michael Brown offer an eerie parallel to the anti-enforcement frenzy that followed the shootings of four college students during a Vietnam demonstration at Kent State University in Ohio in 1970.

Just as protests erupted nationwide after Kent State, we’ve seen marches in every major US city. And, as was the case after Kent State, peaceful demonstrators commingled with more subversive agitators looking not to quell tensions but to inflame them.

Indeed, there is reason to believe Ferguson may represent a tipping point, with libertarians and liberals coming together to discredit law-enforcement and incarceration policies.

In New York City, the reaction to the death of Eric Garner indicates that the ending of stop-and-frisk hasn’t calmed or quieted the Sharptons but has whetted their appetite to delegitimize “Broken Windows” policing — the revolutionary approach that ended the three-decade crime wave in New York City and has continued to make the city safer in the two decades since it was instituted.

The 1970s also saw a general turn among the elites against the NYPD, though in that case, the issue wasn’t so much police brutality as small-time corruption.

The department was paralyzed for years by the investigation by and findings of the Knapp Commission, which Mayor John Lindsay empaneled in 1970 to look into allegations by Frank Serpico (later immortalized by Al Pacino in the film named for him) that his fellow cops were both demanding and accepting graft from local businessmen and drug dealers.

Just as no one could say the National Guard did the right thing at Kent State, and just as no one could defend the NYPD’s notorious “grass eaters” and “meat eaters,” so it is with the cases of Michael Brown and the apparent chokehold:

Obviously, cops shouldn’t strangle a man as they take him into custody, and just as obviously, there ought to be some way police can immobilize a suspect without killing him.

But when cops use such tactics in potentially threatening circumstances, as the authorities in Ferguson have been doing — like firing tear gas and issuing orders for large groups of people to keep moving or disperse — they’re immediately accused not of showing restraint but of excessive force.

The problem, then and now, is that the criticism of police has moved from the specific to the general — from warranted concern about individual acts of excess by individual officers to the unwarranted notion that these excesses happen by design and are the conscious result of police policy.

This constitutes an ideological assault on policing itself, and it had parlous consequences in the 1970s — giving fearful police departments even more reason to stick cops in cars and work as first responders to crimes already committed (so-called “911 policing”) rather than serving as a strong public presence to deter crime in the first place.

Look, I saw “Guardians of the Galaxy,” and, like you, I really enjoyed the 1970s-laden soundtrack; Blue Swede’s 1974 version of “Hooked on a Feeling” brought me right back to the year of my bar mitzvah. The nostalgia ran riot in me.

But I lived through 1974 in New York City, and I don’t want to live through it again — and trust me, neither do you.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Al Sharpton’s anti-cop rally on Staten Island — as a growing number of teachers vow to cancel their contributions to the union’s political action committee.

The United Federation of Teachers’ Committee on Political Education, or COPE, raked in more than $6 million between Jan. 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission.

But ever since the union announced its support last week for a protest over the police chokehold death of Eric Garner, hundreds of members have used the UFT’s own Facebook page to publicly sever ties with COPE.

“I would like a refund on my COPE contributions,” Jaime Russo Sclafani wrote. “It makes me sick that I donated money from my paycheck to support and provide transportation to march against the very people who keep us safe.”

Other posters listed contact information for the COPE office and a form letter to cancel payroll deductions that fund the powerful lobbying organization.

The UFT didn’t return requests for comment.

Tuesday’s announcement by Staten Island DA Dan Donovan that a special grand jury would hear evidence in Garner’s death had no impact on plans for Saturday’s protest, and law-enforcement sources said the NYPD was working hard to ensure it remained peaceful.

A high-ranking source said the recent rioting in Ferguson, Mo., over the police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown “is on the minds of everyone.”

“It’s of definite concern what’s happening down there . . . We don’t want another Ferguson on Staten Island,” the source said.

The source also noted that “Sharpton is bouncing back and forth from Ferguson to the city and now he’s having this rally on Staten Island. So we’re going to be ready.”

As many as 15,000 protesters are expected to show up, and merchants along the march route said they were preparing for the worst.

Ebdo Ali, manager of the Wedyan Food Deli on Stuyvesant Place, said he planned to close the store once he saw marchers approaching, which will likely cost at least $1,000 in receipts.

“You never know what’s going to happen — the windows could get broken, people could come in and steal, or take things and throw them at the cops,” said Ali, 36.

Lori Honor, owner of Honor Wines on Bay Street, said she also planned to close her store, despite the fact that Saturday is usually the busiest day of the week.

“Even if it goes smoothly, there’s no access for our customers,” she said. “We may have to reopen Sunday to recoup our losses.”

The shooting — about four miles from where an unarmed black teen was shot by a white cop in nearby Ferguson — happened just before 1 p.m. local time n the northern part of the city, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said.

“The suspect, who right now is described as a 23-year-old African American, was acting erratically — walking back and forth up and down the street,” Dotson told reporters, KSPR TV reported.

“As officers arrived, the suspect turned towards the officers and started to walk towards them clutching his waistband. He then pulled out a knife … and told the officers, ‘Shoot me now. Kill me now,’” the chief said.

The officers repeatedly told the man to stop and drop the knife, but he kept advancing until he was within about four feet of one of the officers, Dotson said.

Both officers then fired their weapons, killing the suspect, he said.

The officers – who were not injured – were placed on administrative duty according to department policy, he said.

[tweetbegin 501796619097239552 tweetend]

Neither the officers nor the victim’s race was immediately disclosed, and it did not appear that the shooting was related to the protests in nearby Ferguson.

But a crowd quickly gathered at the scene, some of them chanting “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” – the same refrain chanted by protesters in Ferguson angry over the Aug. 9 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson.

That shooting sparked nightly demonstrations marred by rioting and looting, and prompted Gov. Jay Nixon to call in the National Guard.

“Police sources tell me more than a dozen witnesses have corroborated cop’s version of events in shooting,” St. Louis Post-Dispatch crime reporter Christine Byers tweeted, without elaborating.

[tweetbegin 501556693382094848 tweetend]

Officer Darren Wilson has not spoken publicly about the Aug. 9 shooting of 18-year-old {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/tag/michael-brown/""> shortly after Brown and a pal allegedly stole a $50 box of cigars in a strong-arm robbery at a convenience store.

But two friends have come forward to defend him — with one describing his version of events leading up to the killing.

A man who said he played hockey with the 28-year cop said on “Good Morning America” Tuesday that Wilson was a “really quiet, well-mannered, respectful guy” who showed no signs of violence.

“‘I can tell that this is really hard on him,” said the man, who said he had exchanged texts with Wilson since the shooting, which sparked nights of violence on the streets of Ferguson, {prompting the governor to call in the National Guard}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/08/18/national-guard-arrives-in-ferguson-amid-violent-protests/"">.

Earlier, another friend who identified herself only as Josie called “The Dana Show” on radio station KFTK to say that Wilson told her the tall, burly Brown, 18, had “bum-rushed“ him before the shooting.

Josie — who said she heard the version from Wilson’s girlfriend — said the cop encountered Brown and his pal Dorian Johnson walking down the middle of a street, pulled up and ordered them onto the sidewalk.

Wilson then noticed the pair were carrying cigars, and had heard the report of the robbery and recognized the pair as possible suspects.

“And he’s looking at them and they got something in their hands and it looks like it could be what, you know, those cigars or whatever. So he goes in reverse back to them,” Josie said.

Wilson, she said, “tries to get out of his car. They slam his door shut violently. I think he said Michael did. And then he opened the car again. He tried to get out. He stands up.

“And then Michael just bum-rushes him and shoves him back into his car. Punches him in the face and then Darren grabs for his gun. Michael grabbed for the gun. At one point he got the gun entirely turned against his hip. And he shoves it away. And the gun goes off,” Josie said.

“Well, then Michael takes off and gets to be about 35 feet away. And Darren’s first protocol is to pursue. So he stands up and yells, ‘Freeze!’ Michael and his friend turn around. And Michael taunts him … And then all the sudden he just started bum-rushing him. He just started coming at him full speed,” she told the station.

“So [Wilson] really thinks [Brown] was on something, because he just kept coming. It was unbelievable. And so he finally ended up, the final shot was in the forehead, and then he fell about two to three feet in front of the officer,” she said.

An autopsy performed by the St. Louis County medical examiner determined Brown had marijuana in his system when he was shot.

Meanwhile, police said {31 people were arrested overnight Monday into Tuesday}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/08/19/ferguson-officer-overheard-reporting-a-gunshot-victim-during-latest-protests/""> as rioting continued unabated despite the National Guard’s presence.

But NBC News reported that 78 people had been taken into custody, citing arrest records.

State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said at least one person from New York and another from California were among those busted, though cops on Tuesday provided no further details.

Two people were shot, though police were not involved.

“Our officers came under heavy fire. Not a single bullet was fired by officers,” Johnson during a news conference at 2:30 a.m. Tuesday.

But cops did fire multiple canisters of tear gas to disperse the rioters and prevent further looting.

“This nation is watching each and every one of us,” said Johnson, who was clearly angry during the news conference, The Post-Dispatch reported. “I am not going to let the criminals that have come here from across this country, or live in this neighborhood, define this community.”

NYPost,nyp8,http://nypost.com/2014/08/19/ferguson-officer-overheard-reporting-a-gunshot-victim-during-latest-protests/,"Two shot, 31 arrested as Ferguson erupts again",Associated Press,08/19/2014,01/07/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The National Guard arrived in Ferguson but kept its distance from the streets where protesters clashed again with police, as clouds of tear gas and smoke hung over the St. Louis suburb where Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer.

Protesters filled the streets after nightfall Monday, and officers trying to enforce tighter restrictions used bullhorns at times to order them to disperse. Police deployed noisemakers and armored vehicles to push demonstrators back. Officers fired tear gas and flash grenades.

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said bottles and Molotov cocktails were thrown from the crowd and that some officers had come under heavy gunfire. At least two people were shot and 31 were arrested, he said. He did not have condition updates on those who were shot. Johnson said four officers were injured by rocks or bottles.

Demonstrators no longer faced the neighborhood’s midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew, but police told protesters that they could not assemble in a single spot and had to keep moving. After the streets had been mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave as well, citing the risk from gunfire that had been reported.

A photographer for the Getty photo agency was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released. Two German reporters were arrested and detained for three hours. Conservative German daily Die Welt said correspondent Ansgar Graw and reporter Frank Herrmann, who writes for German regional papers, were arrested after allegedly failing to follow police instructions to vacate an empty street. They said they followed police orders.

Johnson said members of the media had to be asked repeatedly to return to the sidewalks and that it was a matter of safety. He said in some cases it was not immediately clear who was a reporter but that once it was established, police acted properly.

Citing “a dangerous dynamic in the night,” Johnson also urged protesters with peaceful intent to demonstrate during the daytime.

The latest clashes came after a day in which a pathologist hired by the Brown family said the unarmed black 18-year-old suffered a bullet wound to his right arm that may indicate his hands were up or his back was turned. But the pathologist said the team that examined Brown cannot be sure yet exactly how the wounds were inflicted until they have more information.

Witnesses have said Brown’s hands were above his head when he was repeatedly shot by an officer Aug. 9.

The independent autopsy determined that {Brown was shot at least six times}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/08/18/police-use-tear-gas-to-clear-streets-of-ferguson/"">, including twice in the head, the family’s lawyers and hired pathologists said.

The St. Louis County medical examiner’s autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday. But she declined to comment further, saying the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown’s death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County’s prosecuting attorney.

A third and final autopsy was performed Monday for the Justice Department by one of the military’s most experienced medical examiners, {Attorney General Eric Holder}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/08/18/eric-holder-sent-to-ferguson-for-michael-brown-investigation/""> said.

Holder was scheduled to travel to Ferguson later this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown’s death.

The Justice Department has mounted an unusually swift and aggressive response to Brown’s death, from the independent autopsy to dozens of FBI agents combing Ferguson for witnesses to the shooting.

In Washington, President Barack Obama said the vast majority of protesters in Ferguson were peaceful, but warned that a small minority was undermining justice. Obama said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to “listen and not just shout.”

Obama said he also spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon about his {deployment of the National Guard}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/08/18/national-guard-arrives-in-ferguson-amid-violent-protests/""> in Ferguson and urged the governor to ensure the Guard was used in a limited way.

Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump said Brown’s parents wanted the additional autopsy because they feared results of the county’s examination could be biased. Crump declined to release copies of the report.

“They could not trust what was going to be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child,” he said during Monday’s news conference.

The second autopsy, Crump said, “verifies that the witness accounts were true: that he was shot multiple times.”

Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells, who assisted former New York City chief medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden during the private autopsy, said a bullet grazed Brown’s right arm. He said the wound indicates Brown may have had his back to the shooter, {or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/08/18/michael-brown-might-have-been-shot-with-his-hands-up-pathologist/""> or in a defensive position across his chest or face.

“We don’t know,” Parcells said. “We still have to look at the other (elements) of this investigation before we start piecing things together.”

Baden — who has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial — said one of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when he suffered that fatal injury. The hired pathologists said Brown, who also was shot four times in the right arm, could have survived the other bullet wounds.

Baden also said there was no gunpowder residue on Brown’s body, indicating he was not shot at close range. However, Baden said he did not have access to Brown’s clothing, and that it was possible the residue could be on the clothing.

Crump also said Brown had abrasions on his face from where he fell to the ground, but there was “otherwise no evidence of a struggle.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the guardsmen to protect the State Highway Patrol’s command center, which was nearly overrun Sunday by mobs protesting the fatal Aug. 9 shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown by a white cop.

“I join the people of Ferguson, and all Missourians, in strongly condemning the violent acts we saw [Sunday] night, including the firing upon law-enforcement officers, the shooting of a civilian, the throwing of Molotov cocktails, looting and a coordinated attempt to overrun the unified command center,” the Democratic governor said.

“We are all frustrated and looking for justice to be achieved regarding the shooting death of Michael Brown. As the dual investigations continue into what happened nine days ago, we must defend Ferguson from these violent interlopers.”

In other developments Monday:

President Obama dispatched US Attorney General Eric Holder to Ferguson to calm tensions. Holder was expected to arrive Wednesday as part of an unusually swift and large federal response that included 40 FBI agents canvassing for witnesses.

Former New York City Medical Examiner Michael Baden, who conducted an autopsy for Brown’s family, said that he found no signs of struggle by the teen and that the teen may have been shot at least once from behind.

Another autopsy performed by the St. Louis County medical examiner showed Brown had marijuana in his system when he was shot, The Washington Post reported, citing a source close to the investigation.

New video from a woman who lives near the scene and obtained by CNN showed Ferguson cop Darren Wilson nervously pacing and speaking to another officer minutes after shooting Brown, whose body lay uncovered and bleeding just feet away.

A Missouri grand jury was expected to begin hearing evidence Wednesday to decide whether Wilson should be criminally charged. But the case prosecutor, Bob McCulloch, was already taking heat over whether he could remain impartial: His father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for St. Louis’ police department, with his dad killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect.

Missouri National Guard Brig. Gen. Gregory Mason said his “well-trained and well-seasoned soldiers assigned to the command post’’ were “well-equipped’’ to handle their mission of protecting the site.

The state Highway Patrol continued to patrol the surrounding streets to try to maintain order.

They were given the job last week after St. Louis County cops and SWAT teams were accused of employing heavy-handed, military-style tactics while confronting protesters.

Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald S. Johnson — who, like Nixon, blamed the rioting on outside agitators — vowed to maintain order.

“We will not allow vandals, criminal elements to impact the safety and security of this community,” Johnson said.

While the president previously planned to head back to DC, now he will spend two days huddling with advisers over the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen, by a white cop in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo.

He told reporters he had already ordered US Attorney General Eric Holder to fly to Ferguson to personally oversee the investigation into Brown’s death.

“[Holder] will also be meeting with other leaders in the community whose support is so critical to bringing about peace and calm in Ferguson,” the president said.

While a “vast majority” of people are protesting peacefully, a “small minority” are acting criminally, Obama said.

“While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos. It undermines rather than advancing justice,” Obama said.

“In order to truly begin the process of healing, we must also see an end to the acts of violence in the streets of Ferguson,” Holder said.

“Those who have been peacefully demonstrating should join with law enforcement in condemning the actions of looters and others seeking to enflame tensions.”

Obama also addressed criticism of local police departments using grant money to buy military equipment, saying, “There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement and we don’t want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions.”

Holder said the Justice Department is putting its full resources into its investigation into Brown’s death.

“During the day today, more than 40 FBI agents continued their canvassing of the neighborhood where Michael Brown was shot,” Holder said in a statement Monday.

“As a result of this investigative work, several new interviews have already been conducted.”

Holder criticized the “selective release” of sensitive information in the case.

Over the weekend, the Ferguson Police Department said Brown was a robbery suspect when he was stopped by the cop who killed him, although the officer didn’t know that at the time.

“The selective release of sensitive information that we have seen in this case so far is troubling to me,” Holder said.

“No matter how others pursue their own separate inquiries, the Justice Department is resolved to preserve the integrity of its investigation,’’ Holder said.",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYPost,nyp11,http://nypost.com/2014/08/18/obama-we-dont-want-lines-blurred-between-cops-military/,"Obama: ‘We don’t want … lines blurred’ between cops, military",Associated Press,08/18/2014,01/11/2016,"WASHINGTON — Calling for a sharp separation between the nation’s armed forces and local police, President Barack Obama on Monday urged a re-examination of programs that have equipped civilian law enforcement departments with military gear from the Pentagon.

The transfers have come under public scrutiny after the forceful police response to racially charged unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.

Amid video images of police with combat weapons and other surplus military equipment confronting protesters, Obama said it would be useful to review how local law enforcement agencies have used federal grants that permit them to obtain heavier armaments.

“There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred,” Obama told reporters at the White House. “That would be contrary to our traditions.”

Obama’s remarks came as he called for understanding in the face of racially charged anger in Ferguson in the wake of a police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old man. Obama said the vast majority of protesters in a St. Louis suburb were peaceful, but said that a small minority was undermining justice for the unarmed black man shot and killed by police.

The initial police reaction to the protests drew attention to the militarization of local police departments, with critics arguing that the heavily armed police presence only fueled the tensions. A report by the American Civil Liberties Union in June said police agencies had become “excessively militarized,” with officers using training and equipment designed for the battlefield on city streets. Attorney General Eric Holder and several lawmakers have suggested that the practice of supplying police with such military surplus be reconsidered.

Obama said he also spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon about Nixon’s deployment of National Guard units to help secure Ferguson. Obama said he urged that the Guard be used in a “limited and appropriate way.”

“I’ll be watching over the next several days, to assess whether, in fact, it’s helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson,” he said.

Pausing briefly in the middle of his summer vacation, Obama expressed sympathy for the “passions and anger” sparked by the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. But he said giving in to that anger through looting and attacks on police only stirs tensions and leads to further chaos. He said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to “listen and not just shout.”

“That’s how we’re going to move forward together, by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another,” Obama told reporters at the White House.

Obama said Holder would travel to Ferguson this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown’s death.

Appearing in the White House briefing room in a dress shirt but no tie, Obama also spoke for the first time to the racial tensions and grievances perceived by African-Americans in Ferguson. In previous comments about the situation, Obama had avoided talking directly about race, wary of rushing to judgment or further inflaming the situation.

Weighing his words carefully, Obama said it was clear that disparities in how blacks and whites are treated and sentenced must be addressed, calling for more safeguards and training to prevent missteps. At the same time, he acknowledged the difficult situation that police officers sometimes face.

“There are young black men that commit crime. We can argue about why that happened — because the poverty they were born into or the school systems that failed them or what have you— but if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted,” Obama said. “Because every community has an interest in public safety.”

Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a police officer on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, a predominantly black community that long has been at odds with its mostly white police department. Results of an independent autopsy released Monday by Brown’s family determined that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

Obama’s remarks on the crisis were the first since the situation in Ferguson escalated over the weekend, with Nixon, the Missouri governor, ordering a midnight curfew for Ferguson and ordering the National Guard to help restore order. Nixon lifted that curfew on Monday, but tensions remained high the morning after police once again deployed tear gas in response to what they said were reports of gunfire, looting and vandalism by protesters.

Shortly before speaking to reporters Monday, Obama received an update from top advisers including Holder and White House counsel Neil Eggleston. Obama has asked the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate Brown’s death, and Holder over the weekend ordered a federal medical examiner to perform a third autopsy on Brown.

Obama weighed in on the crisis during a brief break in his annual summer vacation at Martha’s Vineyard, where the president was spending two weeks with his family while juggling multiple crises in the U.S. and overseas. Obama returned to the White House late Monday and planned to return to the Massachusetts island on Tuesday.

In Dellwood, glass from shattered windows was strewn in front of local shops such as the Dellwood Market, a McDonald’s and other shops, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

In Rehobeth, looters stole pain medication and Xanax from the Rehoboth Pharmacy, its owner said.

“Our city isn’t included in this, but we’ve been dragged into it because we are so close,” griped Dellwood Mayor Reggie Jones.

In Ferguson, where the police killing occurred, merchants such as 911 Hair Salon owner Dellana Jones said the riots were “devastating” businesses.

“A lot of my customers fear coming in, and I understand that,” Jones told reporters.

Drug testing performed during an autopsy by St. Louis County Medical Examiner Mary Case showed that Michael Brown, 18, had the pot in his system, {the Washington Post reported}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/official-autopsy-michael-brown-had-marijuana-in-his-system-was-shot-6-times/2014/08/18/8c016ef8-26f4-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html?hpid=z1"">, citing a source close to the investigation.

Case’s report was released to the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office on Friday night but has not been made public.

The county autopsy is in addition to a private examination of Brown’s body by an expert hired by his family and another expected by the feds.

Brown’s death has sparked racial tensions across the US and nights of rioting and looting in Ferguson, his hometown.

Protesters anticipated that test results could show pot in Brown’s system — and demanded that the officer who shot him be tested, too.

“What was in the system of that cop when he was pumping bullets into that boy’s body?” a protest leader griped during one demonstration.

Meanwhile, the family’s independent autopsy conducted on Brown determined that the teen was shot at least six times during the Aug. 9 confrontation.

Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells, who assisted former New York City chief medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden during the autopsy, said a graze wound on Brown’s right arm could have occurred in several ways. The teen may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position in front of his face.

“But we don’t know,” Parcells said.

Witnesses have said Brown had his hands raised above his head when he was repeatedly shot.

Baden said one of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when he suffered the fatal injury. He also was shot four times in the right arm, he said.

Baden has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

Family attorney Benjamin Crump said the family wanted the additional autopsy because they feared results of the county’s examination could be biased.

Crump declined to release copies of the report to the media, and the county’s autopsy report has not been released.

“They could not trust what was going to be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child,” he said during Monday’s news conference with Parcells and Baden. “It verifies that the witness accounts were true: that he was shot multiple times.”

He said Brown’s mother “had the question any mother would have: Was my child in pain. Dr. Baden shared with her in his opinion, he did not suffer.”

He also noted that Brown had abrasions on his face from where he fell to the ground, but “otherwise no evidence of a struggle.”

Brown’s death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters.

NYPost,nyp14,http://nypost.com/2014/08/18/obama-takes-vacation-break-to-return-to-washington/,Obama takes vacation break to return to Washington,Associated Press,08/18/2014,01/13/2016,"WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama returned to Washington just after midnight Monday for a two-day break from a summer vacation, during which airstrikes in Iraq and violent clashes in a St. Louis suburb intruded on his golf and beach plans.

The exact reason for Obama’s return remained unclear, though it appeared aimed in part at countering criticism that he was spending two weeks on the Massachusetts resort island of Martha’s Vineyard in the midst of multiple crises. His return to Washington was planned even before the U.S. military began striking targets in Iraq and before the standoff between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.

Obama had meetings on both matters scheduled for Monday. The president was scheduled to return to Martha’s Vineyard Tuesday night.

The president spent a leisurely Sunday on the island before his late-night departure. He played a round of golf — his most frequent vacation activity — then attended a jazz concert and dinner with first lady Michelle Obama.

While Obama has had plenty of downtime since arriving in Martha’s Vineyard a week ago, he also made two public statements about the situations in Iraq and Ferguson. The president had ordered the Iraq strikes days before leaving for vacation, while the tensions in Ferguson that stem from the shooting death of an unarmed teen boiled over during his vacation.

“I think it’s fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that’s why you’ve seen the president stay engaged,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.

Obama’s vacation has also been infused with a dose of politics. He headlined a fundraiser on the island for Democratic Senate candidates and attended a birthday party for veteran Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan’s wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

That get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama’s vacation. Just as Obama arrived on Martha’s Vineyard, an interview with the former first lady was published in which she leveled some of her sharpest criticism of Obama’s foreign policy.

Clinton later promised she and Obama would “hug it out” when they saw each other at Jordan’s party. No reporters were allowed in, so it’s not clear whether there was any hugging, but the White House said the president danced to nearly every song.",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYPost,nyp15,http://nypost.com/2014/08/18/governor-calls-national-guard-to-restore-peace-in-ferguson/,National Guard sent to Ferguson,Post Wire Report,08/18/2014,01/13/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Missouri’s governor on Monday ordered the National Guard to a St. Louis suburb convulsed by protests over the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen, after a night in which police used tear gas to clear protesters off the streets well ahead of a curfew.

Gov. Jay Nixon said the National Guard would help “in restoring peace and order” to Ferguson, where protests over the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer entered their second week. Police said they acted in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails.

“These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served and to feel safe in their own homes,” Nixon said in a statement.

The latest confrontations came on the same day that US Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on Brown, and as a preliminary private autopsy found that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, the teen’s family said.

As night fell in Ferguson on Sunday, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated and the streets were empty well before the midnight curfew.

“Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of response,” said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is in command in Ferguson. At least two people were wounded in shootings, he said.

The “extraordinary circumstances” surrounding Brown’s death and a request by his family prompted the Justice Department’s decision to conduct a third autopsy, agency spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement. The examination was to take place as soon as possible, Fallon said.

The results of a state-performed autopsy would be taken into account along with the federal examination in the Justice Department investigation, Fallon said.

The family’s autopsy was conducted by former New York City Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Baden, and showed that the teen was hit by six bullets — all fired from the front and not at close range, Brown family lawyer Anthony Gray told CNN.

Two rounds hit Brown’s head and four more struck his right arm, according to Gray.

One of the bullets entered Brown’s right eye, exited his jaw and re-entered at his collarbone, according to the family autopsy, suggesting that the teen was falling forward as that round struck.

The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation into the shooting. A day earlier, officials said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson neighborhood where Brown was shot to death Aug. 9.

A federally conducted autopsy “more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises” might help that investigation, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami’s US Attorney’s Office.

Federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case, Weinstein said.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot.

Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

Sunday’s clashes in Ferguson erupted three hours before the curfew imposed by Nixon. Officers in riot gear ordered all the protesters to disperse, and many did, but about 100 stood about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley of tear gas.

Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the street in an apparent attempt to block police vehicles, which easily plowed through. Someone set a trash bin on fire, and the crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away.

Within two hours, most people had been cleared off West Florissant Avenue, one of the community’s main thoroughfares. The streets remained quiet as the curfew began. It was to remain in effect until 5 a.m.

Earlier in the day, Johnson said he had met members of Brown’s family and the experience “brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart.”

“When this is over,” he told the crowd, “I’m going to go in my son’s room. My black son, who wears his pants sagging, who wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, but that’s my baby.”

Johnson added: “We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael’s going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.”

The protests have been going on since Brown’s death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Nixon to put the state highway patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before he was killed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a robbery suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

The officer who shot Brown has been identified as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting, and the department has refused to comment on his whereabouts.

Reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Classes were canceled Monday for Ferguson schoolkids.

“Due to continuing unrest in some areas of Ferguson, and in the interest of the safety of students and families, all schools in the Ferguson-Florissant School District will be closed Monday,” the district said in a statement posted on Facebook.

“Information we received from officials on the scene late Sunday evening has contributed to concerns we have about children walking to school or waiting for buses on streets impacted by this activity, debris on the roads that could impact transportation, and continued disruption affecting our students and families in the area.”

The preliminary report on the autopsy, performed by former New York City Medical Examiner Michael Baden at the request of Michael Brown’s family, showed that the 18-year-old was struck four times in the right arm. A fifth bullet went into his right eye and the sixth pierced the top of his skull, which was the fatal wound, The New York Times reported.

Some of the bullets caused multiple wounds and were all fired from in front of the body — disproving claims of protesters that Brown was shot in the back while fleeing.

It was the most detailed autopsy information publicly released.

“This information could have been released on Day 1,” Baden told the Times. “They [didn’t] do that, even as feelings built up . . . that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.”

The private autopsy results came as US Attorney General Eric Holder said the Justice Department has ordered its own autopsy.

The St. Louis County Medical Examiner’s autopsy concluded that Brown died of gunshot wounds, but local authorities released no other details.

The private-autopsy report came as Ferguson police deployed tear gas Sunday to disperse protesters in advance of a second night of a curfew.

Most of the demonstrators ignored the curfew. There were no immediate reports of arrests.

The first night of the midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew saw seven arrests amid thick clouds of tear gas as police in riot gear used armored vehicles to chase off defiant protesters.

One man was shot and critically wounded in the melee, but not by police, insisted authorities, who pledged to investigate the shooting.

Meanwhile, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who ordered the curfew, said Sunday he wasn’t consulted by local cops before they showed video of Brown allegedly stealing a box of cigars and shoving a storekeeper, a move that further fanned the flames of civil unrest.

“When you release pictures and you clearly are attempting to besmirch a victim of a shooting, shot down in his own street . . . and at the same time you’re releasing information to try to make it, to tarnish him, then properly there was a lot of folks that were concerned about that,” Nixon told CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

His concerns were echoed by the NAACP’s new president, Cornell William Brooks.

“I would liken it the Keystone Cops, but I don’t want to insult the Keystone Cops,” he told “Face the Nation.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

The “extraordinary circumstances” surrounding the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown and a request by Brown’s family members prompted the order, Department of Justice spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.

The examination was to take as soon as possible, Fallon said, adding that the Justice Department still planned to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of its investigation.

As night fell Sunday in Ferguson, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated after marchers pushed toward one end of a street. Police attempted to push them back by firing tear gas and shouting over a bullhorn that the protest was no longer peaceful.

A preliminary private autopsy found that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, told The New York Times that one of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when he suffered a fatal injury.

Brown was also shot four times in the right arm, and all the bullets were fired into his front, Baden said.

A federally conducted autopsy “more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises” might help that investigation, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami’s U.S. attorney’s office. The move is “not that unusual,” he added.

Federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case, Weinstein said.

Back in Ferguson, the latest clashes erupted three hours before the midnight curfew imposed by Gov. Jay Nixon. It was not clear why officers acted ahead of the deadline for people to be off the street.

Police in riot gear ordered all the protesters to disperse. Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley of tear gas.

Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the pavement near the QuikTrip convenience store that was burned down last week. It was an apparent attempt to block police vehicles, but the vehicles easily plowed through. Someone set a nearby trash bin on fire, and gunshots rang out several blocks away.

Within two hours, most people had been cleared off West Florissant Avenue, one of the community’s main thoroughfares.

Johnson added: “We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael’s going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.”

The Rev. Al Sharpton told the rally Brown’s death was a “defining moment for this country.”

Sharpton said he wants Congress to stop programs that provide military-style weaponry to police departments. He said he expects police to “smear” the slain teenager, his family and his attorneys. He also condemned the recent violence and looting in Ferguson.

The protests have been going on since Brown’s death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Missouri’s governor to put the state highway patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before he was killed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a robbery suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Nixon said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that he was not aware the police were going to release surveillance video from the store where Brown is alleged to have stolen a $49 box of cigars.

“It’s appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,” Nixon said.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

“When you’re exhausted, when you’re out of resources, when you’re out of ammunition, you surrender,” Brown’s uncle, pastor Charles Ewing, told worshippers during a Sunday sermon at Jennings Mason Temple in Ferguson. “He surrendered and yet he died.”

The officer who shot Brown has been identified as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting, and the department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Also Sunday, about 150 people gathered in St. Louis to show support for Wilson. The crowd protested outside a TV station because it had broadcast from in front of the officer’s home.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the station, KSDK, later apologized. Other in the group, composed mostly of police and relatives of officers, carried signs urging people to wait for all the facts.

Cops fired smoke bombs and tear gas in yet another night of violence erupted in the St. Louis suburb, where an unarmed black teen was killed by police last week.

the deadline arrived at midnight, defiant protesters chanted “No justice! No curfew!” and refused to disperse.

“You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately. Failure to comply, may result in arrest,” an officer said over the loudspeaker.

As cops donned gas masks, the crowd chanted: “We have the right to assemble peacefully.”

Moments later, tear gas and smoke bomb canisters were fired.

“Obviously, we’re trying to give them every opportunity to comply with the curfew,” said Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Johh Hotz.

Much of Sunday morning’s activity centered around Red’s Barbeque, as police in an armored vehicle responded to reports of a break-in at the restaurant, officials said.

Protesters followed behind, and one man pointed a gun at cops en route, officials said. At least one person shot at a police car, but no officers were hit, authorities added.

“I was disappointed in the actions of tonight,” said Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, head of operations in Ferguson.

The violence came hours after the emergence of photos of the white police officer whose fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, has touched off a week of local rioting and a national debate.

The photo of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, a six-year veteran, had been posted on his father’s Facebook page six months before the cop’s shooting of Brown during a curbside confrontation in the St. Louis suburb.

“Very proud of my son, Darren Wilson, on his receiving a commendation from his Police Department,” the cop’s father, John, had posted on Facebook, Yahoo News reported.

Wilson had earned the unspecified commendation for what a Ferguson town Web site called “extraordinary effort in the line of duty.”

But by last week, pride had turned to worry. “Our family is in need for prayers to be sent up for a family member,” the father posted before the page was deactivated on Saturday. “Put a covering of protection over our family member please.”

The state of emergency and midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew were announced by Gov. Jay Nixon at a contentious Saturday press conference that was interrupted by angry shouts from audience members.

“Why hasn’t Darren Wilson been indicted!” one shouted. “Charge him with murder!”

Protesters have also been enraged over video and details police have released about Brown’s involvement in a robbery unrelated to his confrontation with Wilson.

Protesters’ anger had been stoked to a frenzy on Friday, when Ferguson police released not only Wilson’s name but also details of the unrelated robbery, including video showing a menacing Brown shoving his way past someone who tries to stop him from leaving the store — allegedly with a $50 box of cigars.

Now he’s sent the civil-rights unit to St. Louis to do the same thing in the {fatal shooting of Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/tag/ferguson-shooting/"">.

Less known, however, is the role of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, who’s made incendiary — and shamefully disingenuous — statements about race relations in America.

Last month, for instance, Perez told hundreds of black students in Washington, DC, that school authorities in the South recently had black high-schoolers arrested for infractions as innocuous as fashion faux pas and farting.

He made the shocking allegation during a July 15 speech he delivered at Howard University.

Perez recounted a recent visit to Mississippi, claiming: “I was looking at their feet and every one of them had an ankle bracelet — they were 14 years old — and that’s because they were all in the school-to-prison pipeline.

And I asked them: ‘What are you in for?’ One was, uh, wrong color tie. One was the wrong color socks. One was flatulence.

“I’m not making this up,” Perez insisted. “This is Meridian, Miss., where we still see separate and unequal,” adding, “We thought we had made progress [but] this is America” today.

Only, he was making it up. Meridian Public School District students have never been jailed simply for breaking school dress code, as he implied. That would be false imprisonment.

They have, however, been mildly disciplined for wearing the wrong uniform to school. Meridian, which is mostly black, has a strict dress code to prevent gang violence.

And some students do wear ankle bracelets to school — but only because they broke actual laws and were convicted of crimes by a juvenile judge.

Perez conflated the circumstances, even though he knew better.

Two years earlier, in a speech to the National School Boards Association in Boston, Perez described it much differently.

“I had an opportunity to visit Meridian and listen first-hand to students,” he said. “They told me of serving time in in-school suspension for wearing the wrong color socks. I listened to a panel of eight students, roughly half of whom were wearing ankle bracelets…Regrettably, students of color are receiving different and harsher disciplinary punishments.”

At Howard, Perez made it sound as if Meridian were run by a bunch of white, racist Bull Connors.

What he failed to mention is that the Meridian school superintendent, Dr. Alvin Taylor, and four of the five Meridian school board members are all black. So is the judge running the juvenile court.

Why would this Cabinet official say one thing to an audience of administrators and another to an audience of black students?

There’s only one explanation: To rile young African-Americans up about the specter of a still-racist America. (Requests to Perez’s office for comment went unanswered.)

School administrators aren’t the only people Perez has framed as racists. He’s also railroaded dozens of banks, including Bank of America and Wells Fargo, for alleged lending discrimination.

From 2009-2013, he used a discredited civil-rights theory known as “disparate impact,” which relies on statistics to prove racism, to extort huge settlements from bankers and mortgage lenders, whom he’s compared to Klansmen.

He claims they discriminate “with a smile” and “fine print,” a kind of racism that though more subtle is “every bit as destructive as the cross burned in a neighborhood.”

Meanwhile, EEOC Chairwoman Jacqueline Berrien, a former NAACP activist, has framed several major employers as racists.

For example, she recently sued Freeman Companies and Kaplan Higher Education Corp. for allegedly running discriminatory background checks on black job applicants.

The charges were so egregiously groundless that both judges hearing the cases scolded her department for ever bringing them, before summarily tossing them out.

One judge slammed her prosecutors for using “cherry-picked” data and hiring expert witnesses who engaged in “scientific dishonesty.”

In court documents, he also said they attempted to “pump up” statistics to make it look like employers were biased.

Both cases charged employers were racist simply for conducting criminal background checks and credit checks for all their job applicants, whites and blacks equally.

Even though, as the court pointed out, that’s exactly what Berrien and every other Cabinet official does before they hire their own workers for government jobs.

With all the trumped-up charges of racism leveled by this administration, you’d think Rev. Sharpton and the rest of the racial arsonists running the Grievance Industry were in control of the government.

Exaggerating civil-rights abuses does the minority community no favors. When real racism does rear its ugly head, few will believe it and tragically little may be done about it.

Sharpton, who is set to lead a march in Staten Island later this month to protest the police chokehold death of Eric Garner, said he will travel to St. Louis, where Michael Brown, 18, was killed. Police on Sunday said he was unarmed.

Sharpton said Brown’s grandfather asked him to make sure there was a fair investigation and justice for the teen.

“I assured him the National Action Network will stand with the family,” the civil-rights activist and talk-show host said.

The shooting occurred Saturday afternoon when an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said. One man pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began, he added.

It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer.

At least one shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the car. The clash spilled out onto the street, and Brown was then shot multiple times.

NYPost,nyp21,http://nypost.com/2014/08/10/crowd-shouts-kill-the-police-after-cop-fatally-shoots-teen/,Crowd shouts ‘kill the police’ after cop fatally shoots teen,Associated Press,08/10/2014,01/19/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The fatal shooting of a black teenager by police sent hundreds of angry residents out of their apartments Saturday in a St. Louis suburb, igniting shouts of “kill the police” during a confrontation that lasted several hours.

A St. Louis County chapter of the NAACP called for the FBI to look into the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Brown’s grandmother, Desiree Harris, said she saw him running in her neighborhood Saturday afternoon when she passed him in her car. Just minutes later, after she returned home, she heard a commotion and went outside to check on it. Less than two blocks away, she found Brown’s body.

“He was running this way,” she said. “When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn’t tell me nothing.”

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported several distraught relatives were outside talking with neighbors, including Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, and stepfather, Louis Head. Head held a sign that read: “Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!”

A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting at the request of the local department, confirmed a Ferguson police officer shot the man. The spokesman didn’t give the reason for the shooting. St. Louis County police said a large crowd confronted officers following the shooting, yelling such things as “kill the police.”

John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, said the FBI should get involved “to protect the integrity of the investigation.” He alluded to the 2012 racially-charged shooting of a 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, as well as the death of a New York man from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes on the street.

“With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers … this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,” Gaskin said.

Gaskin said officials in the organization spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who told them teenager had been shot twice.

By early Saturday night, dozens of police cars remained parked near the shooting scene as mourners left votive candles, rose petals, a large stuffed animal and other remembrances at a makeshift memorial in the middle of the street. At the height of the post-shooting tensions, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents, about two-thirds of whom are black.

Harris said her grandson had recently graduated high school and was looking forward to the future, including possibly attending college.

“My grandson never even got into a fight,” she said. “He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.”

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told the Post-Dispatch that the officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave.

“We are hoping for calm and for people to give us a chance to conduct a thorough investigation,” Jackson said.

Gaskin said the angry crowd was reacting to a “trauma.”

“Anytime you have this type of event that’s taken place, emotions are going to run high,” he said. “But for 600 people to gather around an area to see where a man is lying in the street, that means something happened that should have not happened.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

The photo of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, a six-year veteran, had been posted on his father’s Facebook page six months before the cop’s shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown during a curbside confrontation in the St. Louis suburb.

“Very proud of my son, Darren Wilson, on his receiving a commendation from his Police Department,” the cop’s father, John, had posted on Facebook, Yahoo News reported. Wilson had earned the unspecified commendation for what a Ferguson town Web site called “extraordinary effort in the line of duty.”

But by last week, pride had turned to worry. “Our family is in need for prayers to be sent up for a family member,” the father posted before the page was deactivated on Saturday. “Put a covering of protection over our family member please.”

The state of emergency and midnight to 5 a.m. curfew were announced by Gov. Jay Nixon at a contentious Saturday afternoon press conference that was interrupted by angry shouts from audience members.

“Why hasn’t Darren Wilson been indicted!” one shouted. “Charge him with murder!”

Others decried the continued use of tear gas by officers and asked whether the new curfew would be maintained without police violence.

“Last night we had several officers who were trapped in a parking lot,” explained Capt. Ron Johnson, who is leading the Missouri State Highway Patrol’s effort to maintain order.

“We sent in armored vehicles to get them out,” Johnson said, adding that one officer deployed a single can of tear gas and that he’d reminded his officers “that we do not use any force that is unnecessary.”

Early Saturday, some 200 protesters clashed with police near the site of Brown’s death at a liquor store where Ferguson’s police captain said Brown had committed a strong-arm robbery moments before his death.

The store and several others nearby were looted, and protesters hurled bottles. The crowd was mostly dispersed by 4 a.m.

Protesters’ anger had been stoked to a frenzy on Friday, when Ferguson police released not only Wilson’s name but also details of the unrelated robbery, including video showing a menacing Brown shoving his way past someone who tries to stop him from leaving the store — allegedly with a $50 box of cigars.

The feds warned Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson against accusing Brown of the robbery, CNN reported.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon’s office tweeted “Long night. Thanks to all who tried to stop unnecessary violence” and said the governor would be in Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday to meet with local leaders.

Police and about 200 protesters clashed late Friday after another tense day that began with authorities identifying the officer who fatally shot Michael Brown as 28-year-old Darren Wilson. At the same time, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released documents alleging Brown, 18, had stolen a $48.99 box of cigars from the convenience store and strong-armed a man on his way out.

Just before midnight, some in what had been a large, rowdy but mostly peaceful crowd broke into that same small store, Ferguson Market & Liquor, and began looting it, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said. Some protesters yelled at the aggressors to stop what they were doing, and about a dozen eventually helped protect the store.

Teams of police officers holding rifles and dressed in riot gear used their cars to block a one-mile stretch of West Florissant Avenue, the street at the center of the protests. Occasional firecrackers sounded in the distance.

Some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Johnson said. One officer was hurt; details were not immediately available. Johnson said police backed off to try and ease the tension. No arrests were made.

[tweetbegin 500561307142459392 tweetend]

“We had to evaluate the security of the officers there and also the rioters,” Johnson said. “We just felt it was better to move back.”

Brown’s death a week ago had already ignited several days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But Friday night marked a resurgence of the unrest.

Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly.

Jackson’s decision to spell out the allegations that Brown committed the robbery, and his releasing of surveillance video, angered Brown’s family and many in the community.

“They have attempted to taint the investigation,” U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay told protesters through a bullhorn Friday night. “They are trying to influence a jury pool by the stunt they pulled today.”

Family attorney Daryl Parks acknowledged the man in the footage “appears to be” Brown. But he and others said Brown’s family was blindsided by the allegations and release of the footage. They said that even if it wasBrown, the crime didn’t justify the shooting after Brown put up his hands in surrender, as witnesses describe.

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said police “are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the killing.

Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, did not know the teen was a robbery suspect at the time of the shooting and stopped Brown and a companion “because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic,” Jackson said Friday. Police said they found evidence of the stolen merchandise on Brown’s body.

Wilson is a six-year police veteran — two in neighboring Jennings and four in Ferguson — and had no previous complaints filed against him, Jackson said, describing him as “a gentle, quiet man” who had been “an excellent officer.”

[tweetbegin 500574147949625344 tweetend]

The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson’s whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley asked Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster on Friday to take over the case, saying he did not believe McCulloch could be objective. Koster said Missouri law does not allow it unless McCulloch opts out, and McCulloch spokesman Ed Magee said the prosecutor has no plans to surrender the case.

Also Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said that FBI agents had conducted several interviews with witnesses as part of a civil-rights investigation into Brown’s death. In the days ahead, the agents planned to canvass the neighborhood for more information, the statement said.

While Taser is best known for its stun guns, its Axon cameras have been garnering attention amid concerns over a spate of deaths at the hands of police officers, in particular the Missouri shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Taser saw its stock rise 9.4 percent on Friday, to close at $13.91, on expectations that there will be a surge in orders.

Indeed, Public Advocate Letitia James called this week for a pilot program to outfit New York City’s finest with body cameras.

The idea was sparked by the death of an unarmed man in Staten Island at the hands of police who were trying to arrest him. She estimated the cost of equipping just 15 percent of the city’s police force at under $5 million.

Taser also told investors it has been seeing strong demand for the cameras in the current quarter.

Earlier this month, Taser said it had received multiple new orders that it expects to ship in the third quarter, including 194 body cameras for the Winston-Salem Police Department in North Carolina, and 90 body cameras for the Madison County Sheriff’s Department in Alabama.

The cameras, which can be worn by officers and attached to guns, come with a digital evidence management system, known as Evidence.com.

Not mayhem, disorder and destruction that could endanger others.

That’s even more true when the story isn’t clear — as with the deaths of Eric Garner here in New York City and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. So let’s hope activists don’t stir up more mayhem, disorder and destruction in either place.

Activists, in particular, like the Rev. Al Sharpton.

“Let’s not act like we’ve solved the problem because we now have the cops marching with the marchers,” Sharpton said Friday, referring to the relative calm in Ferguson after Gov. Jay Nixon put state police in charge. “We’re not out of this yet.”

It almost sounds like Sharpton is upset by the calm.

Nixon’s move to send in the state police proved wise. In prior nights, Ferguson had been gripped by unrest, including bottle-throwing and the burning of a convenience store.

Protesters were outraged at a cop’s fatal shooting of Brown, an unarmed black teen. Police responded with tear gas and snipers in what seemed like a military operation.

But the facts of that case are in dispute: Police say there was a struggle between Brown and the cop, involving the officer’s gun. A witness says Brown was shot while trying to surrender.

Back in New York, Sharpton plans a major protest of the Garner case next week. Here, too, the facts are unclear.

The medical examiner cited a cop’s “chokehold” as the primary cause of Garner’s death while resisting arrest, and a video captured the incident. But the ME’s full report has yet to be released. And so far, there’s no conclusive proof the cop acted unlawfully.

In both cases, the facts are key. Any conclusions are best drawn only after those facts come out.",NA,NA,NA,NA

This hysterical nonsense must be stopped.

The Cirque du Cop-Bashing, with Al Sharpton as ringmaster, is working overtime to exploit the deadly incident in Ferguson, Mo. That means stoking anti-law-enforcement fires at all costs.

Are there bad cops? Yes. Does the police state go overboard sometimes? Yes.

Do the demagogues decrying systemic racism and braying about “assassinations” know what happened when teenager Mike Brown was tragically shot and killed last week? No.

Here’s a reality check. While narcissistic liberal journalists and college kids are all posting “Hands Up” selfies in hipster solidarity with Ferguson protesters, it’s law-enforcement officers who risk their lives in “war zones” every day across the country.

The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund reports that a total of 1,501 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty during the past 10 years, an average of one death every 58 hours or 150 per year.

These include local and state police officers, federal officers, correctional officers and military law enforcement officers.

Fact: Last year, 100 law-enforcement officers were killed. On average, over the past decade, there have been 58,261 assaults against law enforcement each year, resulting in 15,658 injuries.

Fact: New York City has lost more officers in the line of duty than any other department, with 697 deaths. Texas has lost 1,675 officers, more than any other state.

Just this week, the memorial fund released preliminary fatality statistics from August 2013 to August 2014. Total fatalities are up 14 percent, from 63 last year to 72 this year.

“Five officers were killed in ambushes, which continue to be a major threat to law-enforcement safety,” the group notes.

Among the men in uniform who gave their lives this summer:

Police Officer Scott Patrick of the Mendota Heights Police Department in Minnesota. He was shot and killed while conducting a traffic stop on July 30. Patrick leaves behind a wife and two teenage daughters.

Police Officer Jeffrey Westerfield of the Gary Police Department in Indiana. Westerfield was shot in the head and killed in a July 6 ambush while sitting in his police vehicle after responding to a 911 call. The suspect had been previously arrested for domestic violence and for kicking another officer. Westerfield, a 19-year police department veteran as well as an Army veteran, leaves behind a wife and four daughters.

Officer Perry Renn of the Indianapolis Police Department. He was shot and killed while responding to reports of gunfire on July 5. After 20 years on the job, Renn chose to serve in one of the city’s most dangerous areas, even though his seniority would have allowed him to take a less dangerous role. “He chose to work in patrol to make a difference in the field,” Police Chief Rick Hite said at Renn’s funeral. “Every day, Perry got out of his police car.” Renn is survived by his wife.

Deputy Sheriff Allen Bares, Jr. of the Vermilion Parish Sheriff’s Office in Louisiana. The 15-year law enforcement veteran was shot and killed on June 23 while investigating two suspicious suspects. Bares had been mowing his lawn while off-duty when he witnessed a suspicious car crash.When he went to investigate, he was gunned down. The assailants stole his truck as he lay dying. “He’s the type of person that would give his shirt off his back to anybody,” a cousin said in tribute. “Anyone that knows Allen will tell you that he was that kind of person.” Bares leaves behind a wife and two children.

Police Officer Melvin Santiago of the Jersey City Police Department in New Jersey. Santiago, a proud rookie cop who loved his job, was ambushed on July 13 by a homicidal armed robber. Santiago was 23 years old. After Santiago’s killer was shot dead by police, the violent Bloods street gang vowed to “kill a Jersey City cop and not stop until the National Guard is called out.”

NYPost,nyp28,http://nypost.com/2014/08/15/police-identify-officer-in-michael-brown-shooting/,Cop who shot Brown didn’t know he was a suspect: chief,Associated Press,08/15/2014,01/14/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Police on Friday identified the officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager and released documents alleging the young man had been suspected of stealing a $48.99 box of cigars from a convenience store in a “strong-arm” robbery shortly before he was killed.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know the teen was a robbery suspect at the time of the shooting and stopped Michael Brown and a companion “because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.”

Darren Wilson, 28, has been an officer in suburban St. Louis for six years, Jackson said.

Brown’s relatives immediately questioned whether the officer really believed Brown was a suspect and said no robbery would justify shooting the teen after he put his hands up.

The family’s attorney, Benjamin Crump, said Brown’s parents were blindsided by the allegations.

“It’s bad enough they assassinated him, and now they’re trying to assassinate his character,” Crump said.

An attorney for the teen who was with Brown on the day of the shooting said his client has acknowledged to investigators that Brown took cigars from the store.

Wilson has been on administrative leave since the Aug. 9 shooting.

Jackson described Wilson as “a gentle, quiet man” who had been “an excellent officer.” He’s been on the Ferguson force for four years. Prior to that, he patrolled in the neighboring community of Jennings, Jackson said.

At 11:51 a.m. on the day of the shooting, police records show, authorities received a 911 call reporting a robbery at the Ferguson Market. An unidentified officer was dispatched to the store, arriving within three minutes. The officer interviewed an employee and customer, who gave a description of a man who stole the cigars and walked off with another man toward a QuikTrip store.

Descriptions of the suspect were broadcast over the police radio. The officer did not find the suspects either on the street or at the Quik Trip, the reports said.

The robber took a box of Swisher Sweets Cigars valued at $48.99, according to the reports. The suspects were identified as 18-year-old Michael Brown and 22-year-old Dorian Johnson.

Separately, Wilson had been responding to a nearby call involving a sick 2-month child from 11:48 am until noon, when he left that place. A minute later, he encountered Michael Brown walking down Canfield Drive. The documents contained no description of what happened between Brown and Wilson.

Crump noted that police did not release a photo of the officer but released images from the store’s security video that they say show Brown grabbing a man inside the store. Crump said he had not seen the photos.

Police “are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style” killing, said Crump, who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.

The Aug. 9 video appears to show a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store’s door. A police report alleges that Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and “forcefully pushed him back” into a display rack.

Johnson, Brown’s friend, told investigators that Brown “did take cigarillos,” his attorney, Freeman Bosley, told MSNBC. Bosley said he was aware of video but had not seen it.

Police have determined that Johnson was not involved in the robbery and will not seek charges against him, Jackson said.

Brown’s uncle, Bernard Ewing, questioned whether Wilson really believed Brown was a suspect. He referred to Johnson’s account that the officer’s only command to the two young men was to get out of the street.

“If he’s a robbery suspect, they would have had the lights on,” Ewing said. “If you rob somebody, you would tell them, ‘Get on the ground’ or something, not, ‘Get off the sidewalk.'”

A robbery “still doesn’t justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,” he added. “You still don’t shoot him in the face.”

Brown’s death ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. The tension eased Thursday after the governor turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Within hours, the mood on the street lighted, with state troopers walking side-by-side with peaceful protesters and no hint of violence. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, pointing assault rifles at protesters and firing tear gas into crowds.

But Friday’s announcement by the police chief was met with disbelief and anger by several dozen Ferguson residents who also attended the news conference, which was hastily held at a gas station burned during a night of looting earlier in the week.

“He stopped the wrong one, bottom line,” yelled Tatinisha Wheeler, a nurse’s aide at the news conference.

A couple of dozen protesters began marching, chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!”

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer’s weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times, according to police.

Dorian Johnson has told reporters a different story.

The dramatic shift came after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol, stripping local officers from the St. Louis County Police Department of their authority after four days of clashes with furious crowds protesting the {weekend death of 18-year-old Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/08/10/crowd-shouts-kill-the-police-after-cop-fatally-shoots-teen/"">.

“All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,” said Pedro Smith, 41, who has participated in the nightly protests. “This is totally different. Now we’re being treated with respect.”

The more tolerant response came as President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday’s fatal shooting — and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

Obama said there was “no excuse” for violence, either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.

Nixon’s promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening in the neighborhood where looters had smashed and burned businesses Sunday and where police had repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

But the latest protests had a light, almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd, more akin to a parade or block party. The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell — the point at which previous protests had grown tense — no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.

“You can feel it. You can see it,” protester Cleo Willis said of the change. “Now it’s up to us to ride that feeling.”

Nixon appointed Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, to lead the police effort. Johnson, who grew up near Ferguson and commands a region that includes St. Louis County, marched alongside protesters Thursday, joined by other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol as well as the county department. The marchers also had a police escort.

“We’re here to serve and protect,” Johnson said. “We’re not here to instill fear.”

Several people stopped to shake hands and even hug Johnson and other officers, thanking them by name. At one point, Johnson spoke to several young men wearing red bandanas around their necks and faces. After the discussion, one of the men reached out and embraced him.

At the QuikTrip, children drew on the ground with chalk and people left messages about Brown.

Obama had appealed for “peace and calm” on the streets.

“I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,” Obama said. “But let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family.”

Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown’s shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control — a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police had taken over the investigation of Brown’s shooting and security at the request of the smaller city.

Nixon vowed that “Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it.” The governor was joined at a news conference by the white mayor of St. Louis and the region’s four state representatives and the county executive, all of whom are black.

The city and county remain under criticism, though, for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others. The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said the name was incorrect.

As with the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, social media brought international attention to the tragedy. Ferguson spawned a proliferation of hashtags and has been a dominant subject on Twitter, Facebook and other sites. Journalists and protesters offered real-time pictures, videos and updates, and the world responded.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer’s weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown, has told a much different story. He has said the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend’s neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Attorney General Eric Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed witnesses to the shooting. A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said federal authorities have interviewed Johnson. Holder spoke by telephone Thursday with Brown’s family.

In St. Louis, Brown’s mother appeared briefly Thursday night at an anti-brutality gathering near the city’s Gateway Arch, urging through a relative for peace to prevail. The observance was among many staged nationwide, each with a minute of silence for Brown and others affected by alleged police brutality.",NA,NA,NA,NA

In the wake of the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in disputed circumstances last week, rioters burned down a convenience store and looted sporting-goods and auto-supply stores, among other businesses.

This completely unjustifiable lawlessness is waved off by the Left as, in the typical cliché, the boiling over of “rage.”

We’re supposed to believe that the rioters were so deeply hurt by the Brown shooting that they felt compelled to go steal and destroy innocent people’s property — and, judging by video of the looting, apparently have a grand time doing it.

The Brown family, to its credit, appealed for calm, but the unrest has continued in Ferguson, with nightly confrontations between police and protesters.

The majority-black suburb of St. Louis is becoming the nation’s latest hyper-racialized melodrama.

President Obama has weighed in twice already, and the usual commentators and activists are already making Ferguson a byword for official racism.

We don’t know what happened in the prelude to the fatal shooting of Michael Brown.

His friend says the teen was shot by an officer in cold blood after a dispute with the cops over walking in the middle of the street. The police say there was a struggle in the police squad car and an attempt to take the officer’s gun.

There is a tried and true method of resolving such disputes — a full and fair investigation, and a prosecution and trial if the facts warrant.

This is a process that takes time and care, but the Left and the media are working themselves up for a good old-fashioned rush to judgment.

The Ferguson police have done themselves no favors in what is now, inevitably, a no-holds-barred public-relations war.

In response to protests, highly militarized teams have been deployed with equipment better suited to fighting ISIS than controlling potentially unruly crowds.

There is a long-running trend, ably documented and critiqued by The Washington Post’s Radley Balko, of local police forces acquiring surplus military equipment wholly inappropriate to domestic police work.

The Ferguson police have also been ham-fisted and high-handed in dealing with the press, appearing in one video to deliberately tear-gas an Al Jazeera camera crew and, in another instance, arresting and briefly detaining two reporters for the offense of not leaving a McDonald’s quickly enough.

All that said, there would be no routine confrontations between cops and protesters if the protesters weren’t inviting them.

Ferguson officials have, reasonably enough, urged people to protest during the day, and daylight demonstrations have been peaceful. It is at night, the St. Louis Dispatch notes, that the protests take on their edge of “defiance and lawlessness.”

No one has a First Amendment right to block streets and throw things at cops, or the right to complain if the cops move to stop such acts.

Once protesters are throwing projectiles, cops aren’t going to look or act like the friendly neighborhood officers out of Nelson Rockwell paintings.

Even if they aren’t tricked out in military gear, riot police never appear cute and cuddly. Would the critics of law enforcement in Ferguson really be happier if the cops were controlling crowds with horses and batons?

We’re told that the military-style of the cops is “provoking” the protesters. But these sort of flare-ups over controversial shootings by police have been a part of American life for a very long time.

They happened long before any police department thought to buy military equipment, and would happen even if police were deployed on Segways and carried cap-guns for protection.

The formula for calm in Ferguson is very simple: Let justice take its course. Too many people are already vested in not letting that happen.",NA,NA,NA,NA

“To police officers, the incongruity of his evaluating police tactics from the comfort of Martha’s Vineyard in the horrible tragedy which occurred in Missouri and ensuing the events is unfortunate,” Jim Pasco, executive director of the national Fraternal Order of Police, told The Post.

Obama on Thursday appealed for calm and took a shot at the police a day after he was dancing and smiling during a birthday party for the wife of a longtime friend.

“There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights,” Obama said of the mayhem since the police shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Mo.

The cop who shot the teen is a member of Pasco’s group and is being represented by one of its lawyers, he said.

The vigils, observed in more than 90 cities as part of a National Moment of Silence, came days after the {shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/08/10/crowd-shouts-kill-the-police-after-cop-fatally-shoots-teen/""> and the {death of a New York man caused by a police officer’s chokehold}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/07/19/man-in-chokehold-death-had-no-throat-damage-autopsy/"">.

In downtown St. Louis, in a tiny park near the Gateway Arch, several hundred people, seemingly equal numbers of whites and blacks, gathered in Brown’s memory.

[tweetbegin 500094749215563776 tweetend]

The site is a short drive from suburban Ferguson, where Brown’s killing has stoked racial unrest. In Ferguson, two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black and all but three of the 53 police officers are white.

The St. Louis gathering was peaceful, in contrast with a night of looting and clashes between demonstrators and police in Ferguson earlier in the week.

The attendees included Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, who didn’t address the crowd but waved, drawing applause as she wiped away tears.

The observance was among many staged nationwide, each with a minute of silence for Brown and others who died at the hands of police.

Bishop Elliott Coleman, of St. Louis’ El Bethel Temple Church, said in opening the observance there that people were coming together “for this reason of healing.”

“Realize there are tears in every city, tears in homes, tears in the eyes of young people, tears in the eyes of old people,” Coleman said. “The tears need to be wiped away, and the hearts need to be healed.”

In New York, about 1,000 people peacefully marched in Manhattan’s Union Square, at times invoking the rallying cries “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “I can’t breathe,” alluding to the death of 43-year-old {Eric Garner}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/tag/eric-garner/"">, who was arrested on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes and was placed in a chokehold by an NYPD officer.

Garner, who had asthma, can be heard on tape shouting “I can’t breathe!” and died a short time later.

The police commissioner of New York has said officers will be retrained on the use of force. Police in Ferguson have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street and one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and physically assaulted him.

Antonia Moe, who attended the Union Square vigil with her 12-year-old son, said incidents like Brown’s death have changed the way she talks to her son about being black.

“When things like this happen, you kind of have to remember to remind him that some of the rules that apply to others don’t necessarily apply to you,” she said.

In Orlando, Florida, about 15 miles outside the Sanford suburb where unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin was shot and killed by neighborhood watch leader George Zimmerman in 2012, a multicultural crowd of about 100 people gathered in front of a park amphitheater.

One woman carried a sign that read: “No Justice, No Peace. We Stand With Ferguson.” Another man’s sign said: “Hands up. Don’t Shoot! RIP Mike Brown.”

In Nevada, about 40 people gathered outside the federal courthouse in Reno, and dozens gathered in Seattle, holding up signs that read “Unite Against Racism” and “Solidarity With Ferguson.”

Police have used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse large crowds, including on Wednesday night when some people threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers.

Nixon, who has faced increasing criticism over suggestions he has not done enough to calm tensions, said local police will still be involved in providing security, but under state supervision.

House Majority Leader John Diehl (R-Town and Country) said Gov. Jay Nixon should act to avoid a repeat of Wednesday night’s violence, when protesters angry over the police-shooting death of an unarmed teen threw Molotov cocktails at cops, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

“Whether it’s 8 o’clock or 9 o’clock, whenever it hits, law-abiding people would know they need to be off the street at that time,” Diehl told the paper. “Curfews are routinely and legitimately used as a law enforcement technique in situations like this.

Jay Nixon said Thursday that unspecified “operational shifts” are ahead for law enforcement in the St. Louis suburb that has been the scene of violent protests since a police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager.

Speaking at a meeting of clergy and community members, the governor told the audience that “you all will see a different tone” in law enforcement’s response to the demonstrations in the town of Ferguson.

Nixon did not elaborate on the changes ahead, but they are likely to be explained at a news conference planned for later in the day.

In his first in-person remarks about the tense standoff, President Barack Obama appealed for “peace and calm” on the streets.

“In talking to these guys, it is scary,” Schellman said of officers’ experience on the front lines of the protest. “They hear gunshots going off, and they don’t know where they’re coming from.”

But the police response has drawn heavy criticism from many circles. Civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton called Thursday for the Justice Department to monitor Ferguson and the way police are handling the crisis.

“Even if we disagree, this climate is not good for anyone and is dangerous for everyone,” Sharpton said in a statement.

At the community meeting, Sierra Smith, who lives in the neighborhood where Brown was shot, told the governor that “the police have no respect at all for the community.”

Nixon responded that the Bill of Rights gives the people “the right to speak truth to power” and added that “we will work to live out those rights.”

Nixon has faced increasing criticism over suggestions he has not done enough to calm tensions.

State Sen. Maria Chapelle-Nadal had been particularly critical of the governor, accusing him of being missing in action during the crisis. In an interview on MSNBC, she called the governor a “coward.”

The police chiefs of Ferguson and St. Louis County said Wednesday that race relations were the top priority in the town. A meeting was scheduled for Thursday between civil rights leaders and police.

Officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, “Hands up, don’t shoot.” Protesters faced heavily armed police who at times trained weapons on them from armored trucks.

Two reporters said they were detained by police for not clearing out quickly enough from a McDonald’s where they were working, near the protests but away from the more volatile areas. The two, who work for The Washington Post and The Huffington Post, were released without any charges. Both say they were assaulted but not seriously hurt.

Among those arrested was St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been chronicling the protests on social media.

“I think the heavy-handed approach by police is escalating the situation and more people are going to get hurt if this keeps up,” French told KMOX Radio.

“The governor just called me and he’s on his way to St. Louis now to announce he’s taking away St. Louis County police out of the situation,” US Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) told the news service.

But it was unclear who would step into the breach after a fourth night of rioting Wednesday in which members of a mob in Ferguson tossed Molotov cocktails at cops, who responded by firing tear gas into the crowd.

Clay said Nixon may ask the FBI — which is already investigating the case — to step in, and that he has been urging US Attorney General Eric Holder to “take over the entire situation because we will not get justice for Michael Brown and his family and friends if the St. Louis County police and prosecutor have a say.”

Cops and protesters have faced off every night since Brown, 18, was shot by a still-unidentified cop Saturday as he walked down the street with a pal a few days before he was to head off to college.

President Barack Obama, who is vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, issued a statement of sympathy that also called for calm, but hasn’t reacted publicly to the unrest.

But Obama was expected to talk about the case from Martha’s Vineyard, where he is on vacation, at 12:15 p.m. Thursday.

The White House said Obama was being briefed by Holder and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, both of whom are also on the island.

Clay told Bloomberg that federal and state authorities have waited too long to take charge.

“Yeah, because they are relying on the St. Louis County authorities to do the right thing. Now the governor realizes that they’re not going to do the right thing,” Clay said. “It will become apparent to the federal, to the Justice Department soon, that they won’t be doing the right thing.”

Nixon, a Democrat considered a likely vice presidential candidate in 2016, has so far only issued a statement on the case.

“The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans,” he said. “While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.”

In Ferguson, officers dodged Molotov cocktails, fired tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs and arrested two journalists during mayhem late Wednesday and early Thursday.

Brown’s killing Saturday has sparked outrage in the town, which is two-thirds black but is patrolled by a city police force that has just three African-American cops among its 53 officers.

Ten people, including St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post writer Ryan Reilly, were arrested late Wednesday.

The two journalists were handcuffed and briefly detained by police who said the reporters didn’t clear out of a McDonald’s, where they’d been working, fast enough.

A Los Angeles Times reporter said he called Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson to tell him about the journalists’ arrest and the city’s top cop responded: “Oh God.”

“I told them [police] to release them,” Jackson said later.

Before the latest skirmishes broke out, Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal confronted Jackson during a press conference.

“I just wanted to know if I was going to be gassed again, like I was on Monday night,” Chappelle-Nadal asked. “We couldn’t get out, and we were peacefully sitting. I just wanted to know if I’m going to be gassed again?”

Jackson answered: “I hope not.”

Protesters said police unnecessarily reacted with excessive force late Wednesday.

But St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar defended officers’ work in controlling the angry crowd, saying cops responded with “an incredible amount of restraint.”

“It’s pretty amazing how impressed I am and inspired by these officers,” he said. “This is a very difficult circumstance.”

The St. Louis County Police Department has taken over the investigation of the Ferguson shooting.

Scores of police from across Missouri donned riot gear and used military-style armored trucks to form a defense line outside the Ferguson Police Department headquarters where demonstrators had gathered.

Most of the crowd finally dispersed at about 2:15 a.m. local time, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Protesters raised their hands and chanted: “Hands up, don’t shoot.”

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown, has said the teen was shot to death while his hands were raised, telling an officer that he was unarmed.

Johnson said he and Brown drew the ire of a cop because they were walking in the street and didn’t heed orders to get back on the sidewalk.

City police chief Jackson called improving race relations “the top priority right now,” despite a growing outcry from Ferguson residents to release more information about Brown’s killing.

The police have not released the name the officer who shot Brown or the number of shots he fired at the teen.

“We have the right to know, and the family has the right to know who murdered their son,” said Sahari Gutierrez, a 27-year-old Ferguson legal assistant.

St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch pleaded for patience and said his office needs more time to probe the officer’s actions on Saturday.

“The timeline on this is there is no timeline,” McCulloch said. “We will do this as expeditiously as possible. But we won’t rush.”

The prosecutor said he appreciates the public’s demand for immediate action, but won’t hurry the process.

“I know that’s not the answer anybody wants to hear at this point,” McCulloch said. “Everybody wants to know what happened.”

The Rev. Al Sharpton said he called Belmar on Thursday and told him he believed police acted with “excessive force.” Sharpton was in town earlier this week, meeting with Brown’s family.

“I told Chief Belmar that I was outraged by what I have seen on TV since leaving Ferguson and that we must not have excessive force to deal with legitimate protest of excessive force,” Sharpton said.

“We want to solve the problem, not create new ones. Even if we disagree this climate is not good for anyone and is dangerous for everyone.”",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYPost,nyp38,http://nypost.com/2014/08/14/hacker-group-names-officer-they-say-shot-ferguson-teen/,Officials say hacker group named wrong officer in Ferguson case,Reuters,08/14/2014,01/15/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Authorities in Missouri on Thursday stood by their earlier decision to withhold the name of the police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager, but denied he was the person identified online by a hacker activist.

Demonstrators and the family of the victim, 18-year-old Michael Brown, have called on police to release the name of the officer, but officials have refused to do so, citing security concerns.

Among the concerns, they said, are online threats from the hacker group Anonymous, which has said it would release personal information about the police officer involved and on Thursday identified him by name in a Twitter post.

Edward Magee, a spokesman for the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office, which is investigating the shooting, said the name posted online was incorrect.

“We can’t let anonymous groups or even public groups pressure us into doing anything we don’t think we should do,” Magee said.

In Ferguson, protesters have gathered every night since Brown was fatally shot on Saturday in the mostly black suburb of St. Louis during what authorities said was a struggle over a gun in a police car. Some witnesses say he was outside the car with his hands up.

Police in Ferguson fired tear gas, stun grenades and smoke bombs Wednesday night to disperse some 350 protesters, on the fourth night of racially charged demonstrations.

Protesters have said the lack of transparency by police investigating the incident — including the refusal to release the officer’s name — have added to already high tensions.

Magee said the officer’s name will be made public if he is charged. Even if he is not arrested, his name will be released after the investigation because of the high public interest, Magee added. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.

Anonymous, which has also called for nationwide protests over the situation in Ferguson, said it would release the officer’s photo and other “damaging information” about him later Thursday.

Police have deployed camouflage-clad officers in body armor, including one manning a rifle on a tripod atop an armored car, to Ferguson.

Dozens of protesters have been arrested since Saturday, and on Wednesday night a St. Louis alderman and two journalists were among those arrested.

“I’ve had enough of being pushed around because of the color of my skin. I’m sick of this police brutality,” said one 18-year-old protester, who gave only his first name, Terrell. “I’m going to keep coming back here night after night until we get justice.”

National figures from President Barack Obama to civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton have called for a peaceful response to the shooting.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said in a series of Twitter messages he would visit the area Thursday, and urged “law enforcement to respect rights of residents (and) press” with the hopes that the “ongoing crisis” does not compound Saturday’s “tragedy.”

“Situation in Ferguson does not represent who we are. Must keep the peace, while safeguarding rights of citizens and the press,” Nixon wrote.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson told reporters his priority was improving race relations in Ferguson, which has seen a stark demographic shift in recent decades, going from mostly white to mostly black. About two-thirds of the town’s 21,000-strong population are black. On a police force of 53, three officers are black.

“This is an opportunity to fix what’s wrong,” he said at a news conference Wednesday.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson did not immediately return a cellphone message from The Associated Press seeking comment.

Earlier Wednesday, authorities urged people to confine their protests to daylight after three nights of tense confrontations, looting, tear gas and a second shooting nearby.

Computer hackers have also targeted the city’s website and released details online about individual city employees.

But civil rights activists and the attorney for Brown’s family, all pressing for calm amid nights of unrest since Saturday’s shooting, counter that knowing the officer’s name may help the area to heal, allowing the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and others to dig into the officer’s background for any prior brutality.

“We don’t want anyone’s life threatened. If someone like this officer is killed, then there is no justice,” said John Gaskin III of St. Louis County’s NAACP chapter. “What the officer may have done is certainly unacceptable, and we are outraged. But we want to be realistic here: This is a man with a family.”

Investigators have released few details, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Brown and another man to get out of the street, and that the officer’s weapon fired at some point inside a patrol car. Witnesses say Brown had his hands raised when the officer repeatedly shot him.

In the aftermath of Brown’s death, the group Anonymous said in online postings that it was monitoring police treatment of Ferguson’s protesters and threatened to disrupt the suburb’s government websites.

On Monday, someone burrowed into the city website and shut it down for much of the day. Representatives of Anonymous have taken credit. Separately someone snipped City Hall’s fiber-optic cable during a protest that day, Jackson said.

Jackson, whose 53-person police force includes just three black officers, said he was unaware whether the hackers obtained any personal information about his officers. But, he added, “I don’t know why they’d sit on it if they did.”

On Tuesday, hackers went after St. Louis County’s chief, Jon Belmar, whose department has been asked to investigate Brown’s death. Some posted pictures of Belmar’s home and family online, as well as his home address and telephone number.

“Realistically, what positive could come from that information coming out?” Jackson said. “Right now, people want it so they can destroy that person’s life. That’s the only reason that group’s asking for it.”

At a Tuesday night community meeting, Belmar and the county’s prosecutor, Robert McCullough, said law enforcement won’t release the officer’s name unless criminal charges are filed.

Still, impatience grows by the day.

“We have the right to know, and the family has the right to know who murdered their son,” said Sahari Gutierrez, a 27-year-old Ferguson legal assistant.

“The community is crying out for transparency, and we want to be able to know what kind of person would shoot an unarmed kid in broad daylight,” said Ben Crump, the Brown family’s attorney who also represented relatives of Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder. “Can you imagine if you are parents of a child shot multiple times in broad daylight and police won’t even tell you the name of the shooter?

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said someone burrowed into the website and shut it down for much of Monday, two days after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed.

The death has stoked racial tension, protests and a night of looting, along with calls for police to publicly release the officer’s name.

An anonymous global group of activists and hackers had pledged to create mischief with Ferguson’s city computers if the name wasn’t released.

But Jackson said releasing the information could endanger the officer, who has received numerous death threats.

Jackson said he was unaware whether the hackers obtained any personal information about police officers from the website.

Ferguson, a predominantly black city of roughly 21,000 residents, is about 10 miles northeast of St. Louis.

John Gaskin III of St. Louis County’s NAACP and the Brown family’s attorney, Ben Crump, said separately Wednesday that knowing the officer’s name would allow groups outraged by the shooting to scrutinize the officer’s background and learn whether he has faced other complaints of brutality.

Investigators have released few details, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Brown and another teen to get out of the street, and that the officer’s weapon fired at some point inside a patrol car.

Early Wednesday, a police officer shot and critically wounded a man who drew a handgun near the site of protests over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, a St. Louis County Police Department officer said.

Police responded about an hour after midnight to reports of four or five men with shotguns and wearing ski masks. They encountered multiple suspects running, one of whom pulled a gun on an officer, who fired at him, the county officer said. The man was taken to an area hospital.

Shortly after midnight, police fired tear gas into protesters who had confronted a line of officers after a far larger crowd dispersed, St. Louis County Police Department spokesman Brian Schellman said.

A photograph in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch showed a protester wearing a shirt with an American flag printed on it throwing a tear gas container back at police. There were other media reports of bottles being thrown at police.

The incidents followed two nights of violent protests, looting and arrests in Ferguson, the largely black St. Louis suburb where the shooting of Brown took place.

Obama promised a full investigation by the US Department of Justice into the teenager’s death.

“I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but … I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,” Obama said in a statement.

Friends and family of Brown held a peaceful church vigil Tuesday night, after his father pleaded for an end to the violence. Standing with supporters, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, Michael Brown Sr. said he wanted justice for his son but wanted it “the right way.”

“I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,” said Brown Sr., who wore a T-shirt showing his son’s baby picture. “No violence.”

Several hundred protesters appeared to heed the calls for non-violence late Tuesday, chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “No justice, no peace” during a tense but ultimately peaceful stand-off with police clad in riot gear and flanked by armored vehicles near the site of Brown’s death.

The protesters, some of whom waved signs as the group was led in chants by megaphone, had dwindled to a handful before midnight.

Also on Wednesday, a woman was shot in the head in a drive-by shooting blocks from the area where Brown was killed. Her condition and whether the shooting was related to the protests were unknown, Schellman said.

In a separate incident simmering in California, a vigil was planned after Monday’s shooting death of an unarmed 24-year-old black man in Los Angeles, USA Today cited a Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman as saying.

Controversial shooting

Sharpton, a New York-based civil rights leader, called for peaceful protest in the wake of looting and more than 50 arrests since the shooting.

“To become violent in Michael Brown’s name is to betray the gentle giant that he was,” Sharpton said of the 6-foot-4 Brown, who had planned to start college this week.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told a packed church in North St. Louis County on Tuesday evening the community was “reeling from what feels like an old wound that has been torn open afresh.”

The activists also were demanding authorities make public the name of the officer involved. The police had said they would do so on Tuesday, but changed the plan, citing fears of retaliation, according to media reports.

Police said Brown was shot in a struggle with a gun in a police car but have not said why he was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.

A witness to the shooting interviewed on local media has said that Brown had been putting his hands up to surrender when he was killed.

The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the racially charged case and St. Louis County also is investigating.

Demonstrations on Sunday night turned violent, with looting and property damage. Violence broke out again Monday night as police officers in riot gear, armed with rifles and accompanied by dogs, tried to secure the area.

Residents in the low-income, mostly black neighborhood where Brown was killed say they are often harassed by police. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said the neighborhood had a lot of crime but there were no race problems.

Investigators have released few details, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Brown and another teen to get out of the street. At some point, the officer’s weapon fired inside a patrol car, police said.

“The local authorities have put themselves in a position — hiding names and not being transparent — where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,” Sharpton said during a news conference in St. Louis where he was joined by Brown’s parents.

He also echoed pleas for peaceful protests by the NAACP and Brown’s father, Michael Brown Sr., who told the crowd: “I need all of us to come together and do this right. … No violence.”

President Barack Obama also urged calm, saying people must comfort each other “in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.”

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told a standing-room only crowd at a community forum Tuesday night that the shooting feels “like an old wound torn fresh” in a nation still struggling with race relations.

The forum, held at a church, was organized as an alternative response to two nights of unrest in which more crowds have burned stores, vandalized vehicles assaulted reporters and taunted officers. Ferguson’s mayor and police chief also attended the meeting and were welcomed with applause.

Earlier in the day, Police Chief Tom Jackson said he had decided against releasing the officer’s name Tuesday after death threats were called into police and City Hall and posted on social media. Jackson said it could be weeks before he releases the name.

Nearly three dozen people were arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night as crowds burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers. A large crowd that gathered Monday at a burned-out convenience store turned rowdy at nightfall, with people throwing rocks at police, Jackson said. Officers used tear gas and shot “beanbag rounds” meant to stun them.

There were at least five arrests from Monday’s unrest but no reports of looting, said Brian Schellman, spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, which is leading the investigation.

“People are tired. They have reached the end of their rope,” Ruth Latchison Nichols said after an NAACP-hosted town meeting Monday night that drew hundreds of people. “Enough is enough. This is a state of emergency.”

By early Tuesday, the streets in Ferguson were again calm. A handful of police officers sat in patrol cars near the burned out gas station, vastly outnumbered by news crews.

[tweetbegin 499287522091216896 tweetend]

“If we come out and say, ‘It was this officer,’ then he immediately becomes a target,” Jackson said. “We’re taking the threats seriously.”

The officer has been with the force for about six years and was on a routine patrol when he encountered the two young men, Jackson said.

Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. Brown was black.

The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. Jackson said the city has had trouble recruiting and retaining black officers.

The fullest account of Brown’s death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home from a convenience store with Brown when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who, using expletives, ordered them to move to the sidewalk.

In the hours after the shooting, Johnson told news crews that he and Brown had kept walking and explained to the officer they were near their destination. The officer then reversed his car “to where it almost hit us.”

The officer, Johnson said, tried to open his door, but he was so close to the men that it “ricocheted” back. Johnson said the officer then reached through the window, “grabbed my friend around the neck” and tried to pull him into the car. The officer then reportedly pulled out his weapon and said, “‘I’ll shoot you,’ or ‘I’m going to shoot,'” Johnson said.

When the officer opened fire, Brown was hit and started to bleed, Johnson said. Johnson ran to hide behind a car.

Brown “kept running, and he told me to keep running because he feared for me, too,” Johnson said.

Johnson said the officer pursued Brown with his weapon drawn and fired again.

When Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. But the officer kept firing, Johnson said.

“And my friend died. He didn’t say anything to him. He just stood over and he’s shooting.”

Authorities have not commented directly on Johnson’s account.

Another witness, Phillip Walker, told the AP he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he saw a white officer with Brown, who was “giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued.” Walker said the officer then “stood over him and shot him.”

Police have said there is no security or police video of the confrontation.

“People are tired. They have reached the end of their rope,” said Ruth Latchison Nichols after the NAACP forum, where many more were left waiting outside once the pews reached capacity. “Enough is enough. This is a state of emergency.”

National NAACP President Cornell William Brooks implored residents to “turn your anger into action” while condemning the violent response to Brown’s death.

“To sneak around under the cover of darkness, to steal, to loot, to burn down your neighborhood — this does not require courage,” he said. “Courage is when you strive for justice.”

“Martin Luther King did not live and die so that we may steal and lie in the middle of the night,” he added.

The FBI has opened an investigation into Brown’s death, {looking into possible civil rights violations}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/08/11/fbi-eyeing-civil-rights-probe-into-shooting-that-sparked-st-louis-riots/"". Witnesses have said Brown had his hands raised when the unidentified officer approached with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly.

Brown’s parents have been among those calling for calm. His family, who had planned to drop him off at a technical college Monday to begin his studies, have asked people to share any information and videos they might have related to the shooting.

Authorities have been vague about what led the officer to open fire, saying only that the shooting — which is being investigated by the St. Louis County police at the smaller city’s request — was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man in which the officer’s weapon discharged once inside a patrol car.

Investigators have refused to publicly disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave. But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.

Brown “was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,” Walker told the Associated Press. The officer “had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times.” The officer then “stood over him and shot him” after the victim fell wounded.

Dorian Johnson offered a similar account, telling KMOV-TV that he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of the vehicle.

Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away.

“He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,” Johnson said. “But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.”

“We wasn’t causing harm to nobody,” Johnson said. “We had no weapons on us at all.”

Walker said that he did not see a scuffle or the circumstances that preceded the first gunshot.

Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, said there’s no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex or from any police dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but has not yet put to use.

Some civil rights leaders have drawn comparisons between Brown’s death and that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder charges.

“Instead of celebrating his future, they are having to plan his funeral,” said Benjamin Crump, a family attorney who also represented Martin’s relatives after he was slain in 2012 in Florida.

“I don’t want to sugarcoat it,” Crump added. Brown “was executed in broad daylight.”",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYPost,nyp46,http://nypost.com/2014/08/11/fbi-eyeing-civil-rights-probe-into-shooting-that-sparked-st-louis-riots/,FBI probes St. Louis shooting for civil rights violations,Associated Press,08/11/2014,01/19/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The FBI said it opened an investigation Monday into the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by police in suburban St. Louis, a day after tension surrounding the case erupted in unrest following a candlelight vigil for the teen.

Questions loomed over the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was unarmed and shot multiple times Saturday after an altercation with an officer in Ferguson. It’s unclear whether Brown or a man he was with was involved in the alleged scuffle, and authorities have been vague about what led an officer to open fire.

But Dorian Johnson told WALB-TV that he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and then outside his car.

Johnson said the officer fired, and he and Brown were scared and ran away.

“He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and he started to get down,” Johnson said. “But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.”

“We wasn’t causing harm to nobody. We had no weapons on us at all,” Johnson told the television station.

The St. Louis County Police Department, which is leading the investigation, refused to discuss Johnson’s remarks, citing the ongoing investigation. But County Police Chief Jon Belmar has previously said that an officer encountered Brown and another man outside an apartment complex in Ferguson, and that one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled before the shooting.

The FBI is looking into possible civil rights violations arising from the shooting, said Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI’s St. Louis field office. But she noted that the FBI would be investigating such a shooting regardless of the public attention surrounding it.

Nearly three dozen people were arrested after tensions around the case following a candlelight vigil Sunday night, as crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted officers who tried to block access to parts of the city.

Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used Brown’s death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.

“Most came here for a peaceful protest but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. … I can understand the anger and unrest but I can’t understand the violence and looting,” Trout, 53, said.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said 32 people were arrested for various infractions, including assault, burglary and theft. Schellman said two officers suffered minor injuries and that there were no reports of civilians hurt.

Several businesses were looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer, and carted rims away from a tire store. Some climbed atop police cars as the officers with riot shields and batons stood stoic nearby, trying to restrict access to the most seriously affected areas.

There no immediate reports of serious injuries. Pat Washington, a spokeswoman for St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, said tear gas had been used.

“The small group of people are creating a huge mess,” Mayor James Knowles said. “Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. … We’re only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.”

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV that there’s no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn’t yet put to use.

Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and it wasn’t clear if he was armed.

Jackson said blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him. Toxicology tests can take weeks to complete.

Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting “Don’t shoot me” while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn’t use force; the crowd eventually left. A similar protest that attracted about 250 people was held Monday morning.

Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she didn’t understand why police didn’t subdue her high school graduate son with a club or stun gun, and that the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

“I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,” she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

Brown’s family planned to speak further at a Monday afternoon news conference with their attorney, Benjamin Crump, who also represented Martin’s family.

“We’re outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,” said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.

Ferguson’s population of about 21,000 people is almost 70 percent black. The race of the officer has not been disclosed. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Li,08/11/2014,01/19/2016,"Rioting and looting broke out in a St. Louis suburb Sunday night following protests over the fatal police shooting of an unarmed African American teen.

The demonstration and candlelight vigil turned ugly in Ferguson, Mo., as two officers were injured and 32 people arrested, authorities told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Authorities also said officers and a police helicopter were fired upon during Sunday night’s frenzy, but no one was hit.

Protesters were demanding action against police who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown on Saturday night during a scuffle with officers.

Brown was supposed to begin classes at a technical college on Monday.

Emotions boiled over Sunday night when angry protesters looted a check-cashing store, a sporting good store, a cell phone retailer, a tire and automotive shop and a small grocery store.
Riots set fire to that QuickTrip grocery store.

“It breaks my heart, last night was the worst night of my life,” Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson told CNN on Monday.

“I’ve never seen anything like it and I hope that I never see anything like it again.”

Jackson spoke as peaceful protesters marched back and forth in front of police headquarters, as cops in riot gear kept a watchful eye.

Many of the protesters walked with their hands up, chanting: “Don’t shoot.”

Outside agencies, the FBI and St. Louis County Police Department, will lead separate probes into Saturday night’s shooting, officials said.

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles blamed hooligans who live outside of his town — about 12 miles northwest of St. Louis — for Sunday night’s unrest.

“The small group of people are creating a huge mess,” Knowles said. “Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. We’re only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.”

DeAndre Smith, a 30-year-old Ferguson resident who moved from New York in December, said he understood why rioters acted the way they did.

“This is exactly what is supposed to be happening when an injustice is happening in your community,” Smith said. “You have kids getting killed for nothing.”

Smith predicted there’d be more bad scenes like Sunday night to come.

“I don’t think it’s over honestly,” he said. “I just think they got a taste of what fighting back means.”

Another Ferguson resident Deanel Trout, 53, blamed troublemakers from out of town for Sunday’s violence.

“Most came here for a peaceful protest but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch,” said Trout, a 14-year Ferguson resident. “I can understand the anger and unrest but I can’t understand the violence and looting.”

Protesters on Sunday also marched on the Ferguson Police Department and chanted: “Don’t shoot me!”

Brown’s mom Lesley McSpadden said cops could have controlled her son without using lethal force.

“I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,” the tearful, grieving mom said.

The St. Louis County Police Department is leading the probe into Saturday night’s shooting.

Middle school English teacher Leonette Hilliard visited the burned remains of QuikTrip on Monday and taped a note the wall: “Corporate neighbor: I am sorry this act of robbery and violence has happened. Please return soon.”

Hilliard’s note, written on a school folder, was taped over graffiti that said. “187 county police.” The slang term “187” is a reference to murder.",NA,NA,NA,NA
