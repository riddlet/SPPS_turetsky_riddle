It was just 24 hours ago that {Black Twitter}<hyperlink=""http://www.eurweb.com/2014/08/beanie-sigel-released-from-prison-black-twitter-blasts-nelly/""> was going in on St. Louis rapper {Nelly}<hyperlink=""http://www.eurweb.com/tag/nelly/""> for being MIA as far as what’s going on with the Mike Brown situation.

Like we said, that was then. Now he has something to say such as folks in Ferguson may have jumped the gun by protesting too early, contributing to the violence.

“I understand the frustration, but we have to strategize before we overreact,” the “Country Grammar” performer told {TMZ.}<hyperlink=""http://www.tmz.com/#ixzz3AdCOKiF0""> “We don’t get no do-over on sh*t like this, so we have to do it right the first time.”

“Ain’t nothing happen no different that hasn’t been happening … At the end of the day, we should have waited to strategize first and take all the right steps to organize,” added Nelly.

T.I. is chiming in as well with his thoughts on the subject and would you believe, he’s on the same page as Nelly:

“We needed to play chess instead of checkers. We should have waited to see if justice was going to be served first … We shouldn’t have played our strongest hand first.”

Nelly says he wants to do something constructive, so he’s starting a scholarship fund in Michael Brown’s name. So he, along with T.I., Kevin Hart and NBA star Al Jefferson are the first 4 celebs to pledge $15,000 a year in college tuition to teens chosen by the Brown family.",29,703,St. Louis Rapper Creates Mike Brown Scholarship Program,NA

It appears that the officer who did the shooting will argue that Mike Brown attacked him and even tried to take his gun – a version unlikely to be believed if Brown was just a typical innocent teen walking down the street.

But if, as the videotape seems to show, he had just committed a brazen daytime “strong-arm” robbery, a jury is much more likely to believe that his concern over being apprehended and convicted of a felony would provide a very strong motivation to attempt to extricate himself, even if it involved the grave risk of confronting an armed police officer.

Indeed, the fact the Brown apparently committed the robbery in broad daylight, and made no attempt to flee or hide, could suggest a brazen recklessness, and a disregard for his own safety and for the safety of others, including a police officer, suggests Banzhaf.

The videotape of the robbery will also tend to discredit any testimony which might be provided by the closest eye witness, Dorian Johnson, should he seek to testify against the officer. As a general rule, juries are much more likely to distrust the testimony of people whom they know to be criminals.

If, as it appears, Johnson was actually an accomplice in the very felony which gave Brown a strong motive to flee, he might well be completely discredited as a witness for the prosecution.

Although – according to one statement allegedly made by the police chief in Ferguson – the officer who shot Brown was not aware of the robbery at the time of the incident, the chief is also alleged to have claimed later that the officer was in fact aware of the robbery when he stopped the teen.

If so, it is possible that the officer suspected Brown of having committed the robbery, either based upon a description of the perpetrator and/or if the officer saw cigars in Brown’s hand.

That would strengthen an argument that the officer reasonably believed that Brown posed a serious threat at the time he was shot – i.e., that anyone who would pull off a brazen strong-arm robbery in broad daylight should be considered quite dangerous, especially given his great size and apparent strength.

It is also possible that, as in too many murder cases, defense lawyers will try to put the victim on trial; suggesting, even if indirectly, that he somehow deserved his fate and/or brought the tragedy upon himself by committing a crime.

While certainly not a valid legal argument, it is entirely possible that at least one juror could be persuaded to feel that way and, exercising his legal right under the well established doctrine of jury nullification, refuse to convict.

In short, says Banzhaf, while not defending either the officer or the police chief, there may be valid legal reasons making the videotape of the robbery relevant, and perhaps even important evidence.",0,12,"Tape of Crime Could Support Officer's Claim, and Discredit Key Witness",NA

“While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police, only dis-serves to raise tensions and stir chaos, it undermines, rather than advancing justice,” Obama said at a press conference Monday afternoon.

Of the situation, Obama said Ferguson is “rightly hurting,” but called once again for people to “seek some understanding rather than to simply holler at each other.”

“Let’s seek to heal, rather than to wound each other,” the president said.

“I’ve said this before, in too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,” Obama said, before pointing to his own initiative, My Brother’s Keeper, which he said is already making significant progress.

Holder met with Obama at the White House on Monday to discuss the situation in Ferguson after perhaps the most violent night of demonstrations since the fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old.

The president said Holder’s visit to Ferguson would include meeting with investigators and other leaders of the community. In addition to meeting with Holder, Obama said he also spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon as well as Missouri Sens. Roy Blunt and Claire McCaskill.

Other Obama administration officials in the meeting included White House deputy chief of staff Anita Breckenridge, White House counsel Neil Eggleston and Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco, the report said.

This chilling video shows the aftermath of Michael Brown's murder, as Ferguson police unceremoniously dump his still-warm body into an SUV.

In the latest vile news about unarmed teenager Michael Brown's terrifying execution by Ferguson, Mo. police - right in front of all the neighbors - comes a YouTube video with police unceremoniously dumping Brown's body into an SUV.

That's right. A sports utility vehicle. No ambulances or justice for black folks in Ferguson. Just shoot first, think later.

Apparently, Ferguson's finest feel so confident in their impunity, and so little respect for the black community, they've got no problem with murdering a child in the street. Even with all the neighbors watching, and using their cell phones to capture photos and video footage of their racist crimes.

A YouTube user with the handle {Law Abiding Citizen}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wt8yEGacIs""> caught the whole thing on video, along with firsthand accounts from those who witnessed Brown's murder.

One outraged woman declared:

""[Police] shoot him all in his face and his chest and everything, I watched the man go down. He just f*cking killed him, period. There was no time to protect himself or nothing. He killed him.""

Another sadly added:

""Police just shot this man for no reason."" 

The video ends with the caption:

Mike Brown was said to have been jaywalking and mouthing the officer involved. But since when has mouthing and jaywalking been punishable by death?

This isn't a white vs. black thing. This is a citizens vs. brutality issue.

Ferguson police dump Michael Browns' body into an SUV.

Here's the video. The contrast between the neighbors' raw and deeply emotional reactions and the police officers' casual cruelty makes it hard to watch… yet hard to stop watching.",1,73,NA,NA

As has been reported, rioting and looting broke out in Ferguson after an unarmed black teenager {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://eurweb.com/tag/michael-brown""> was shot to death by police over the weekend.

Arenas argues racism is black on black and not white on black since black folks are robbing each other and burning down their OWN neighborhoods whenever there’s injustice.

“I would like to start off by saying too the family of the victim GOD BLESS#RIPmichealbrown you will be missed: too EVERY African American out there..how dumb are we really???every time we hear some bad news, the first thing we do is #RIOT #ROB #STEAL #BURN sh-t in our OWN neighborhoods..,” he wrote on Instagram.

He added, “this racism fight has never been #blackvswhite, it’s ALWAYS been #blackvsblack from what the stats.. About 10 riots from the black community over the years and the only thing damaged ,was the BLACK COMMUNITY by The BLACK COMMUNITY..only reason they issue riot police isssss just in case you actually got smart enough to walk 6 blocks ,YALL ain’t f-cking up white rich sh-t smdh.”

But Rev. Al Sharpton got the worst of it. Arenas blamed Sharpton for making racial injustices worst. He even called Sharpton an attention-seeking ‘THOT’ (That Hoe Over There).

He wrote; “FAMILiES of the victims pleaseeeeee stop asking #alsharpton to speak or ur behalf,you have a better chance having #caesar the monkey from #planetoftheapes to get justice for you..the stats also show AL coon sharpton has not helped one situation he has protested at,he actually made it worst and because of him the jury goes the other way..”

He continued with: “(think about it) Jena six,trayvon and the list goes back way back..#AL ur like a #THOT in the club,lookn for attention what u said at trayvons rally #enoughisenough ur right were tired of u PRETENDING.”

Arenas isn’t the only one questioning Sharpton’s motives. The Wall Street Journal posed the question of why didn’t he visit Chicago over the weekend after there were 26 deaths. Instead, he flew to St. Louis.

Whenever there is a major case of racial injustice, Sharpton pops up to represent the family.

“Arresting this man and making him accountable for his actions; that’s justice,” Lesley McSpadden said in an exclusive interview with “Good Morning America’s” Robin Roberts.

The St. Louis suburb has been wracked by clashes and violence since Brown’s Aug. 9 death. Brown, 18, was unarmed when he was shot by a Ferguson police officer, identified by the department as Darren Wilson.

McSpadden said she spoke Sunday with Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson.

“He had a heartfelt message for me, and it was that that could have been his son, and he was sorry, and he’s, like everybody else, supporting and hoping and praying that this doesn’t happen again,” McSpadden said, holding back tears.

A private autopsy performed Sunday at the request of Brown’s family showed that the teen was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, said Shawn Parcells, the medical investigator who performed the autopsy with Dr. Michael Baden.

It’s unclear whether Brown’s arms were raised when he was shot, but he was not shot in the back, despite witnesses’ claims, Parcells told ABC News.

The shooting death of Brown has sparked riots and protests in the St. Louis suburb, a situation that intensified after Ferguson police released video Friday they say shows Brown robbing a convenience store before the fatal shooting.

McSpadden said she was surprised by the video’s release, and that it doesn’t help to explain the shooting that followed.

“I feel like it has nothing to do with what he did to my child. Nothing,” McSpadden said.

Jay Nixon said today.

Ferguson has “looked a little bit more like a war zone, and it’s not acceptable,” Nixon said during a press conference this afternoon.

Police on Thursday defended their use of tear gas, smoke bombs and “bean bag” bullets to repel demonstrators after another night of chaos over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said officers on Wednesday night tossed tear gas to disperse a large crowd of protesters after some threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers. More than 10 people were arrested in Ferguson. More protests are expected.

Nixon also announced Thursday that the highway patrol unit in the embattled town will be overseen by Capt. Ron Johnson, a native of Ferguson.

At a meeting earlier Thursday with area clergy and activists in the predominantly African-American town of around 20,000, Nixon told the participants of his plans to address the police situation, “I think you will all see a different tone.”

The Democratic governor said he would make it clear that the right of people to protest would not be curtailed as long as they respect the property and person of others.

“If people have things to say, they ought to be able to say them, and if people in the news media want to cover stuff and take pictures, they ought to do it,” he said to applause from the gathering. “We live in a free country.”",0,12,NA,NA

Also Sunday afternoon, at a rally in Ferguson, speakers including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III sounded calls for the nation to respond constructively to the situation by addressing what Sharpton called the militarization of police. Brown was shot and killed Aug. 9 by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson, and his death has touched off a weeklong series of protests in the St. Louis suburb.

Community members need to take positive action too, Sharpton said. “Don’t loot in Michael’s name,” he implored, and told residents to wield influence by participating in elections. “You all got to start voting and showing up — 12% turnout is an insult to your children.”

The rally, hosted by Brown’s family, Sharpton’s National Action Network and the National Bar Assn., filled Greater Grace Church and spilled out the door.

Money for Brown’s relatives was raised, and Sharpton announced a class-action lawsuit for people hurt in the demonstrations of the last week.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who took over direction of Ferguson’s security last week, got a standing ovation at the rally. “This is my neighborhood. You are my family, you are my friends, and I am you,” he said. His own son is a young black man who wears sagging pants and has tattoos on his arms, he said. “That’s my baby.”

“This morning, I met with President Obama to discuss the events in Ferguson, Missouri. Like the President, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of Michael Brown. While his death has understandably caused heartache within the community, it is clear that the scenes playing out in the streets of Ferguson over the last several nights cannot continue.

“For one thing, while the vast majority of protests have been peaceful, acts of violence by members of the public cannot be condoned. Looting and willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers who are genuinely trying to protect the public do nothing to remember the young man who has died. Such conduct is unacceptable and must be unequivocally condemned.

“By the same token, the law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them. Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.

“At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message. At my direction, Department officials have conveyed these concerns to local authorities. Also at my direction, the Department is offering – through our COPS office and Office of Justice Programs – technical assistance to local authorities in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force. The local authorities in Missouri have accepted this offer of assistance as of this afternoon.

“Department officials from the Community Relations Service are also on the ground in Missouri to help convene law enforcement officials and civic and faith leaders to plot out steps to reduce tensions in the community. The latest such meeting was convened in Ferguson as recently as this morning. Over time, these conversations should consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities.

“All the while, the federal civil rights investigation into the shooting incident itself continues, in parallel with the local investigation into state law violations. Our investigators from the Civil Rights Division and U.S. attorney’s office in Missouri have already conducted interviews with eyewitnesses on the scene at the time of the shooting incident on Saturday. Our review will take time to conduct, but it will be thorough and fair.”",0,23,NA,NA

Today, the police chief announced that the unarmed black teen was actually a suspect in a robbery that occurred shortly before the shooting. Needless to say, the delay in revealing the robbery’s connection to the shooting, and the manner in which the information was released has Brown’s family and their attorneys “beyond outraged.”

Their statement, released Friday from both the family and their lawyers, was tweeted out by attorney Ben Crump after police announced Darren Wilson as the officer who shot Brown, and named the teen as the robbery suspect.

Read the full statement below:

Michael Brown’s family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piece mil information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.

There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.

The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.

It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.

The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.

“I’ve been doing this since I was a teenager. I didn’t think I would have to do it when I was 90,” Epstein told The Nation, as two officers walked her to a police van. “We need to stand up today so that people won’t have to do this when they’re 90.”

Epstein escaped Nazi Germany for England in 1939 on the Kindertransport. Her parents and other family members died in Auschwitz, according to her personal website.

Epstein has been active in civil rights and human rights causes as well as social justice, including fair housing, abortion rights and anti-war activities.

The chief said that the officers repeatedly ordered the man to drop the knife and drew their weapons after he did not drop it. The chief said the man told the police: “Shoot me now. Kill me now.”

He said the two officers fired after the man moved toward one of them and came within 3 to 4 feet.

There was a heavy police presence at the scene, and police marked off the intersection with yellow tape. Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who was arrested last week during protests over the Brown killing, urged the crowd to maintain peace.

“The last thing we need is violence in our neighborhood,” he said. “And that’s not going to be on the police to make sure there’s not violence in our neighborhood, that’s going to be on us. No silliness here.”

Missouri Law Authorizes Shooting Fleeing Robbery Suspects :(,EurPublisher,08/19/14,06/15/16,"Here’s some potentially devastating news for folks looking for justice in the killing of {Michael ‘Mike’ Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.eurweb.com/tag/michael-mike-brown/""> by Ferguson, Missouri police officer {Darren Wilson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.eurweb.com/tag/darren-wilson/""> courtesy of Professor John F. Banzhaf III, Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University Law School.

Professor Banzhaf says that while much of the media is suggesting that the only defense in the killing of an unarmed Mike Brown, is that the officer acted in self defense to protect his own life (or possibly the lives of others), a Missouri statute authorizes shooting a fleeing robbery suspect.

Section 563.046 authorizes a law enforcement officer to use “deadly force” “when he reasonably believes that such use of deadly force is immediately necessary to effect the arrest and also reasonably believes that the person to be arrested . . . has committed or attempted to commit a felony.”

Thus, even if Michael Brown were in fact fleeing from the officer’s attempt to arrest him, and posed no threat whatsoever to the officer’s safety, officer Darren Wilson might still be able to argue that he reasonably believed that Brown had committed a robbery, and that he could not “effect the arrest” without shooting the suspect, says John Banzhaf, public interest law professor.

In addition to possibly providing another defense argument, the existence of the statute more clearly establishes the legal relevance of the videotape released by authorities which seemingly shows Brown committing a strong-arm robbery just minutes before his confrontation with the officer.

“Although many have argued that the videotape has no relevance to the issues in Ferguson, it is legally relevant because it provides a strong motive for Brown to attempt to resist arrest.”

Also, Wilson might have suspected Brown of being the robber – and therefore a very serious danger – based either on a physical description of the robbery suspect broadcast over the police radio, or if he noticed a box of cigars in Brown’s hands when he was stopped, says Banzhaf.

Moreover, even if the robbery videotape is ruled not admissible at trial – i.e., because of its strong prejudicial effect – it is now so well known that virtually all potential jurors will have seen it, and concluded that Brown was not just an innocent graduate going to college, but actually a bully and a robber.

Banzhaf notes that a very effective although ethically dubious defense tactic in homicide cases is to put the victim on trial by suggesting to the jury that somehow he deserved what was coming to him.

The irony of the statute, says Banzhaf, is that it would seem to be unconstitutional under a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court which limited the circumstances under which an officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect.

However, as law professor Paul G. Cassell noted, Wilson might try to argue that he relied upon the statute in good faith, perhaps unaware that it apparently violated a Supreme Court ruling.",9,99,'Self Defense' Claim by Ferguson Officer May Be Unnecessary in Mike Brown Killing,NA

On Friday, as we reported, {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.eurweb.com/tag/darren-wilson/""> was identified by the Ferguson, MO police department as the one who shot Brown multiple times.

However, six months before the fatal shooting of the unarmed teenager, Wilson earned a commendation for his “extraordinary effort in the line of duty.”

The information about the award which was presented to him by the Ferguson City Council on February 11 was posted on Wilson’s father’s Facebook page.

“Very proud of my son, Darren Wilson on his receiving a Commendation from his Police Department,” John Wilson wrote on February 11. “Congratulations Son.”

One image shows Wilson shaking hands and receiving the commendation from Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson. In a second photo,  Wilson flashes a smile as he returns to his seat with his honor.

Unfortunately, no details of why he was given the commendation were stated in the Facebook post. In fact, the Facebook page for the officer’s father appears to have been taken down not too long after {Yahoo News}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/photos-ferguson-officer-darren-wilson-received-police-award-earlier-this-year-021255893.html""> first reported the story Saturday morning.

Four days ago Facebook is also where John Wilson turned to for support without mentioning his son by name.

“Dear FB friends, Our family is in need for prayers to be sent up for a family member,” wrote John Wilson. “Circumstances do not allow for us to say anything further. Please pray with our family in mind. Put a covering of protection over our family member please.”

John Wilson thanked his many friends who were quick to offer encouragement.

“Please continue to do so as we deal with a family situation that is very challenging,” he wrote.

Darren Wilson was revealed today as the officer who shot Michael Brown, 18, and officials have moved the six-year police veteran and his family from the town as a safety precaution.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said earlier that at the time of the shooting on Saturday, the officer was on a routine patrol when he encountered Brown and a friend walking in the street. Authorities have said that a scuffle ensued after the officer asked the teens to move to the side. Witnesses have said Brown’s hands were raised when he was shot multiple times.

“We’re learning and we’re moving forward. This all starts now to heal, to just make things better,” Jackson told ABC News.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said that he thinks releasing the name of the officer involved in the shooting would help in Ferguson’s healing process.

Additionally, Jackson also announced the department would be releasing video of a strong-armed robbery that took place in the area. He outlined events that took place beginning at 11 a.m. the day of the shooting and offered an account of the incident that implies officers confronted Brown in connection to the robbery.

Rev. Al Sharpton says he’s answering the call of the family to come to the area help them in the investigation of Brown’s death:

“I just spoke with Leslie McSpadden, the grandfather of Michael Brown. He has asked me to come to St. Louis in light of the police killing of his grandson to assist the family in achieving a fair investigation and justice. I assured him that National Action Network will stand with the family, as we have done for families around the country and assist in any way that we can. I am dispatching Rev.

Meanwhile, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after an officer encountered two people — one of whom was Brown — on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer.

Maybe she shouldn’t have bothered.

The following are Draya’s comments on the Mike Brown situation:

“To keep seeing things escalate makes me upset…I don’t know what I can do with my voice other than make other people aware… I wish #MichaelBrown was alive to tell his side of the story, somehow we never get to hear the other side when things like this happen. I don’t think it’s a race thing, I think the police training is outdated, I don’t know maybe the sensitivity has risen due to 9/11 but I really think it’s time for new procedures based on all these accidental killings. #PrayforFerguson.”

Needless to say, Draya got a lot of backlash from what she posted. Which is why she went on Twitter to smooth things over

“And yeah I was just saying, we can’t fix the race issues… But we can train the people to protect and serve us better procedures,” the reality TV star tweeted. “Poor choice of words saying accidental :: I meant homicides that just shouldn’t have happened .

For anyone trying to convince others that racism still exists here in America, police in Ferguson, Missouri are the toxic gift that never stops giving.

This time, the dubious gift is a series of live, real-time tweets from a neighbor who witnessed Michael Brown's summary execution – and who saw the entire aftermath from the window of his apartment from just a few hundred feet away.

Once again, we are flabbergasted. Bruh's Twitter feed reveals first-hand accounts of Ferguson police murdering Michael Brown, shooting him in the back twice as he ran away, and then pumping eight more bullets into him when he turned and faced them - all for the alleged shoplifting of a pack of cigarellos.

This came to our attention via {Tim Dickinson}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/7im"">‘s Twitter feed, national affairs reporter for Rolling Stone.

At 10:03 a.m. on August 9th, a flabbergasted Twitter user with the handle Bruh looked out his window and tweeted:

[tweetbegin 498152572062945281 tweetend]

Then he adds:

[tweetbegin 498152622012907520 tweetend]

[tweetbegin 498152874312867840 tweetend]

Bruh captured a clear photo with Brown lying dead and bleeding on the ground with Ferguson's finest standing over him.

Bruh continues to report from the front-row seat he never wanted:

[tweetbegin 498153293583884288 tweetend]

[tweetbegin 498155002305581056 tweetend]

Marvalace asked why police shot Brown, and Bruh replied:

[tweetbegin 498155311153180672 tweetend]

He added:

[tweetbegin 498155651617411072 tweetend]

[tweetbegin 498155867208822784 tweetend]

Another neighbor didn't see Brown's murder, but he heard it.

[tweetbegin 498157514332979200 tweetend]

The neighbor asked how old Brown was, and Bruh replied:

[tweetbegin 498166774865465344 tweetend]

Turns out, Ferguson police shot Brown 10 times, not ""just"" 7.

[tweetbegin 498166843933077505 tweetend]

Bruh also tweeted that the cops shot Brown two times in the back, and then pumped the remaining bullets into him he turned around.

[tweetbegin 498167134367645696 tweetend]

[tweetbegin 498170110968750081 tweetend]

Bruh also saw that the cop was armed with an AR rifle. That seems excessive for street policing. 

He heard the parents screaming…

[tweetbegin 498203965633224704 tweetend]

Some neighbors thought Brown had stolen a pack of cigarellows from the nearby QuikTrip gas station and convenience store.

[tweetbegin 498205424714145793 tweetend]

Some disputed that Brown was the one shown in the video footage.

[tweetbegin 500365050448596992 tweetend]

But Brown's friend told his attorney - who in turn, told reporters - that Brown had robbed the store.

[tweetbegin 500365810716901376 tweetend]

Even if Brown did rob the store, did he deserve to die for stealing a pack of cigarellos? Apparently, tobacco really does kill.

Bruh then thanked his friends and neighbors for checking in with him..

According to {NicoleBitchie.com,}<hyperlink=""http://necolebitchie.com/2014/08/keke-palmer-visits-ferguson-after-twitter-backlash-mom-pelted-with-rubber-bullet/#gXT3gBhYm3u3ZeF9.99""> Palmer received “extreme backlash” when she posted the following tweet, which questioned the reason why people were killing and causing harm as she advised her followers to stop using race to separate themselves:

“Oh my Lord, bless Mike Brown & his family. This is terrible. Why y’all? Why do we do this to each other. Why do we hate each other, harm each other, kill each other? We are brothers & sisters y’all. All colors! Peace is the answer. Stop separating yourself through race. That’s the issue. We actually think that’s a thing, we are ALL family! You don’t stop hate with hate. Come on now, MLK taught us that. If you want to end racism, you start by not generalizing/grouping ppl w/ the thought that they all believe the same things.”

Aware of the backlash, Palmer addressed her tweet during an interview with the Huffington Post, as she confessed that she might have been naïve when speaking on what was going on. In addition, the actress mentioned that she planned to visit Ferguson to get a better understanding of what was going on:

“Being naïve is never anything to be ashamed of, because I believe me being naïve [to racism] is what has allowed me to do all the things that I can because if I believe in and quote what’s realistic then I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing right now. I simply wouldn’t be ‘Cinderella’ on Broadway, I wouldn’t have ‘Just KeKe,’” she stated.

“I wouldn’t have done any of the things that I’ve done. So I think that’s a play on people’s ideas of what they can’t do and what they believe is possible. And for me, I believe everything is possible. That’s the way that I was raised, and from what I’ve been able to do I’ve seen that to be true that your reality is what you make it.”

Regarding her opinion of the Mike Brown situation, Palmer said:

“As far as what’s going on with Mike Brown, I spoke up on that, because unproductive outrage has never gotten us anywhere. Even with MLK and everything that he did for black people…all he spoke about was unity, because throwing hate and being angry, and violence, that doesn’t give us peace and equality. That’s like having sex in order to get your virginity. It’s just the complete opposite thing to do.

“I don’t have all the answers and there are no quick fixes for things like this. But uniting and coming together on one clear message and trying to get that message across is much better than us all being everywhere and fighting against one another and coming from all different sides. That’s never going to get us anywhere.

“I’m very excited to see what can be done and if I can really get involved, and how we can unite one another. That’s what I always believe is the way to go. Uniting us all. Not just black people, but everybody that’s coming to talk the same message,” continued Palmer as she revealed the real . “It’s unfortunate when things like this happen, but hopefully it can wake people’s eyes up and let them know that we need to unite as a people.

“No one person can do anything. So, going further into my statement of ‘taking it to the streets,’ if you feel strongly, organize things that can best execute your message. That’s what I mean by that. Being angry and outraged freezes train of thought. We all have to take a breath outside of our pain and figure out a way to be heard. Everybody, anybody, can make a difference if they try.”

Palmer made good on visiting Ferguson. This past weekend, the 20-year-old entertainer attended a peaceful protest that turned hectic when she was later shot at by the police and her mom was hit by a rubber bullet.

“God bless this woman right here! (See the video below.) I met her out here in Ferguson tonight, & she was telling me about her violent run in with the police not too long ago. She was in an accident & called the police, & allegedly THIS is what SHE was put through.

The fatal shooting of unarmed teen Mike Brown by a Ferguson, MO policeman continues to resemble genocide to those in the black community; where the killing of black men, young and older; and the manhandling of black women continues to be documented by the cellphones of witnesses on an almost regular basis.

The hashtag, #IfTheyGunnedMeDown, has images that people posted of themselves in two different postures; asking which one would be used if they were gunned down by police.

Questions linger over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after an altercation with an officer in Ferguson, Missouri.

It was unclear whether Brown or a man he was with was involved in the scuffle, and authorities were vague about what led an officer to open fire.

Dorian Johnson told WALB-TV that he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of his car.

Johnson said the officer fired, and he and Brown were scared and ran away.

“He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,” Johnson said. “But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.”

“We wasn’t causing harm to nobody,” Johnson told the television station. “We had no weapons on us at all.”

The race of the officer was not disclosed. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.

The St. Louis County Police Department refused to discuss Johnson’s remarks, citing the ongoing investigation. But Police Chief Jon Belmar previously said that an officer encountered Brown and another man outside a Ferguson apartment complex, and that one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled.

The FBI is looking into possible civil rights violations arising from the shooting, said Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI’s St. Louis field office. She said the FBI would be investigating regardless of the public attention surrounding the matter.

{As previously reported,}<hyperlink=""http://www.eurweb.com/2014/08/mikebrown-shooting-leads-to-rioting-looting-watch/""> nearly three dozen people were arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night after crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted officers who tried to block access to parts of the city.

Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used Brown’s death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.

“Most came here for a peaceful protest, but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. … I can understand the anger and unrest, but I can’t understand the violence and looting,” Trout said.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said 32 people were arrested for various offenses, including assault, burglary and theft. Two officers suffered minor injuries, and there were no reports of civilians hurt.

Several businesses were looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People also took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer and carted rims away from a tire store.

Some climbed atop police cars as the officers with riot shields and batons stood stoically nearby, trying to restrict access to the most endangered areas.

A spokeswoman for St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said tear gas had been used.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV that there’s no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but has not yet put to use.

The second person has not been arrested or charged, and it was not clear if he was armed, Jackson said. Blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him for toxicology tests, which can take weeks to complete.

Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting “Don’t shoot me” while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase until the crowd eventually left. A similar protest that attracted about 250 people was held Monday morning.

Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she did not understand why police did not subdue her son with a club or stun gun. She said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

“I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,” she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

Jackson reiterated to Fox’s Sean Hannity that Brown struggled with his killer inside the cop’s vehicle before trying to take the officer’s gun. However, the two new eyewitnesses told CNN that Jackson was never inside of the vehicle, and that the gun fired as the officer was trying to pull Brown toward the car.

During Hannity’s five minute interview, he asked Jackson if he knew “for a fact” that the purported “struggle” between Brown and the policeman who killed him resulted in a shot being fired inside the cop’s vehicle. Jackson’s response was “It was, yes.”

Hannity: You said, in fact, the officer was injured, had a facial wound of some kind, and that, in fact, a struggle ensued over the officer’s weapon, and a shot was actually fired inside the car. Why is there such a dramatically different story being told here?

Jackson: Well Sean, unfortunately we’re going to have to wait until all the witnesses have been interviewed and all the forensic evidence has been examined before we’re going to have a real, true picture of what happened that day.

Hannity: It… well, either a shot was fired inside the police officer’s car, or it was not. Do we know for a fact, do you know for a fact—

Jackson: It was, yes.

Hannity: That is a fact, then. So, there was a struggle for the gun—

Jackson: That is a fact.

About 20 minutes later, Tiffany Mitchell and Piaget Crenshaw, two new witnesses to Brown’s murder, were interviewed on CNN by Don Lemon and Aliysn Camerota. Lemon and Camerota asked Mitchell and Crenshaw if they saw Brown struggle with the officer inside the car, as Jackson claimed. They responded with affirmative denials.

Camerota: Did you ever see a moment where Michael was in the police car?

Crenshaw: No, ma’am.

Don Lemon: Because that’s what police are saying, that they were in the police car and there was a tussle… inside the police car. And at no time—and I know that you weren’t there from the very beginning, Piaget or Tiffany—but at no time did you see Michael Brown in the car?

Both: No, not at all.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson released several police reports and documents during the Friday morning news conference alleging Brown was killed after a robbery in which he was suspected of stealing a $48.99 box of cigars.

[Scroll down to read embedded copy of police report.]

Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, were suspected of taking a box of Swisher Sweets from a convenience store in Ferguson that morning, according to the police reports obtained by the AP.

Jackson said Officer Wilson went to the area after a 911 call reporting a “strong-arm” robbery just before noon. He said a dispatcher gave a description of the robbery suspect, and Wilson, who had been assisting on another call, was sent to investigate.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the police department, encountered Brown just after 12:01 p.m., with a second officer arriving three minutes later, Jackson said.

Police said that Brown was shot after an officer (identified Friday as Darren Wilson) encountered him and another man (Dorian Johnson) on the street during a routine patrol. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer’s weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times, according to police.

Dorian Johnson has told media a different story. He said he and Brown were walking in the street when an officer ordered them onto the sidewalk, then grabbed his friend’s neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He said Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Johnson did not mention in his multiple interviews that he and Brown had been in a convenience store just before, or that Brown had stolen anything.

In an interview with MSNBC shortly after the report was released Friday morning, Johnson’s lawyer confirmed that Brown had taken cigars from the store.

“We see that there’s tape, that they claim they got a tape that shows there was some sort of strong-armed robbery,” said Freeman Bosley, Johnson’s attorney. “We need to see that tape, my client did tell us and told the FBI that they went into the store. He told FBI that he did take cigarillos, he told that to the DOJ and the St. Louis County Police.”

Meanwhile, Brown’s uncle, Bernard Ewing, questioned whether Wilson really believed Brown was a suspect. He noted Johnson’s account that the officer told the two young men to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk, and that Brown had his hands up when he was shot.

“If he’s a robbery suspect, they would have had the lights on,” Ewing said. “If you rob somebody, you would tell them, ‘Get on the ground’ or something, not, ‘Get off the sidewalk.'”

“It still doesn’t justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,” he added. “You still don’t shoot him in the face.”",15,192,NA,NA

Police officials dusted off a well-worn cover themselves template. They would either hold a press conference, publicly release, or leak documents that depicted Brown as having gang ties, smoked dope, dealt dope, had an arrest record, was a school trouble maker, or engaged in some kind of deviant behavior. With Brown, they added to their cover themselves template by waving pictures to the national press that purported to show Brown robbing a convenience store moments before he was gunned down.

The crude and clumsy message was that Brown was a bad guy. Though, they didn’t dare say it openly, the even more unstated but lethal message was that there was a legitimate cause, if not outright justification, for the deadly train of events that occur. The aim of the savage assault on Brown’s character was to deconstruct him as an innocent victim. If enough dirt could be tossed at Brown to cast doubt and suspicion about his character and motives, then maybe there was probable cause to kill.

Brown’s parents swiftly and correctly denounced this brazen and clumsy effort to bestow absolution on the cop that killed him as character assassination of the vilest order. Police produced not a shred of hard evidence at the moment they pointed the criminal blame finger at him to nail him as the culprit. But even if he was a legitimate suspect in the theft, he was not stopped, confronted and shot because of that. He was stopped for allegedly jay walking. There was no other offense at that moment than that. A suspected robbery hours before can’t absolve or cancel out the hard fact that Brown was unarmed, and as stated by multiple eyewitnesses was compliant with the officer. The only reason the officer was not arrested and charged with murder is precisely because he is an officer.

The problem though with the silliness of this juvenile attempt by police official’s to cover themselves is that they hold most of the cards in these cases. They know that merely dropping a tell-tell litany of veiled and not so veiled hints, innuendoes, digs, and crass, snide, accusing comments, remarks, slander and outright lies about men like Brown is more than enough to divert, distract, and pollute the air surrounding the killing. The image mugging often works because it rests firmly on the ancient, shop worn, but serviceable litany of stereotypes and negative typecasting of young black males. It’s the shortest of short steps to think that if Brown can be depicted as a caricature of the terrifying image that much of the public still harbors about young black males, then that image seems real, even more terrifying, and the consequences are just as deadly.

The hope was that President Obama’s election buried once and for all negative racial typecasting and the perennial threat racial stereotypes posed to the safety and well-being of black males. It did no such thing. Immediately after Obama’s election teams of researchers from several major universities found that many of the old stereotypes about poverty and crime and blacks remained just as frozen in time. The study found that much of the public still perceived those most likely to commit crimes are poor, jobless and black. The study did more than affirm that race and poverty and crime were firmly rammed together in the public mind. It also showed that once the stereotype is planted, it’s virtually impossible to root out. That’s hardly new either.

In 2003 and 2008 Penn State University researchers found that many whites are likely to associate pictures of blacks with violent crime. This was no surprise given the relentless media depictions of young blacks as dysfunctional, dope peddling, gang bangers and drive by shooters. The Penn State study found that even when blacks didn’t commit a specific crime; whites still misidentified the perpetrator as an African-American. Immediately after the election of Obama in 1968 the researchers still found public attitudes on crime and race unchanged. The majority of whites still overwhelmingly fingered blacks as the most likely to commit crimes, even when they didn’t commit them.

The gunning down of unarmed young blacks is not the only lethal consequence of this warped public perception of black males. A Stanford study released days before Brown’s killing found that a significant number of whites and non-whites were even more willing to cheer tough sentencing, three strikes laws, and draconian drug busts, when they perceive that the majority of those busted and imprisoned are black. Though no study has yet been done on it, it wouldn’t surprise, in the backdrop of the disturbances in Ferguson following Brown’s slaying that a significant number of Americans would applaud the use of the massive war zone weaponry and tactics against American citizens that was used in Ferguson, as long as those citizens were perceived as young blacks.

The image mugging of Brown doesn’t change the official record. He was killed not because he was a suspected robber, but a suspected jay walker. To suggest anything else is nothing more than a second slaying of Brown.",10,25,NA,NA

According to {MailOnline.com,}<hyperlink=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2726614/Mother-policeman-shot-dead-Michael-Brown-serial-artist-defrauded-thousands-dollars-neighbors-stolen-credit-card-scheme.html#ixzz3AdJ0ZVKS""> Tonya Durso, Wilson’s mother, was a serial con artist who cheated her victims out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by stealing their identities and taking out huge loans, which resulted in credit card debt.

During her crime spree, Durso was on parole for similar crimes she committed in Missouri. She died at age 35 under mysterious circumstances, MailOnline noted.

Until she was exposed as a con artist, Durso and her family were popular residents in St. Peters, a predominantly white suburb of St. Louis. Among Durso’s victims was Sandy Finney, who mentioned that Wilson’s mother intercepted her mail and sent off for pre-approved credit cards that she would use herself.

Durso wound up in so much debt from her capers that she took out loans to keep the scam going.

“My husband and I were naïve,” Finney shared with MailOnline. She cleaned us out for at least $100,000 and $30,000 in cash which we didn’t get back.’

The site went to report that Durso’s con game ended in February 2001, when Finney was told by her own bank that she could not deposit any money and the authorities were alerted. Durso ultimately pleaded guilty to six counts of forgery and one count of stealing at the 11th Judicial Court in St Louis.

Although she pleaded guilty to those crimes as well as confessed to another six counts of stealing in an unrelated situation, Durso’s victims tell MailOnline that she didn’t serve any time in jail and went into bankruptcy in October 2002. A month later, the matriarch died.

“I’m surprised Wilson passed the background checks to become a policeman,” Finney told the site. “People can change but that was a bad home. His mother was a serial conwoman.”

News of Durso’s illegal activities comes days after Ferguson police named Wilson as Brown’s killer. Media sources report that the revelation came after authorities faced unrelenting pressure from the public and lawsuits from civil liberties groups.

Confession:  I have to force myself to keep up with the current situation in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.   Although I could blame the attention-grabbing headlines of Robin Williams’ death, or the onslaught of airstrikes, cease-fires and Ebola outbreaks occurring around the globe for my lack of awareness, it’s my business to stay abreast with what transpires specifically in the black community.  Problem is, I think I’ve hit a threshold involving transgressions against black folk.

Updates about the unlawful death of Eric Garner, coupled with the recent guilty verdict in the Renisha McBride trial held my total attention going into the weekend.  Suddenly, headlines about a young, unarmed teen gunned down in his neighborhood for allegedly stealing candy casually floated by on my screen.  With his arms reportedly raised in surrender, Mike Brown was shot multiple times by an unidentified police officer who is currently placed on paid administrative leave while the FBI investigates.  While we await more details surrounding another erasure of a young black man, I minimized the articles’ links on my screen, finding it difficult to allow the reality of Brown’s murder to bypass the still lingering pain of Trayvon’s or Jordan Davis’ slayings.  I’ve checked out as a coping mechanism to the hopelessness I feel in protecting our own.

The media’s manipulation of the images accompanying this story make a huge contribution to my indifference.  Before getting to know the life of Mike Brown, media outlets have portrayed his death in a demonizing fashion.  Most captions about Brown’s death are accompanied by photos that show him in a “thuggish” light.  For instance, pictures of his lifeless body strewn across the ground piques most of our interest, but if you look close, his pants are completely below his rear, exposing his underwear.   (This has prompted the latest Twitter campaign {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theroot.com/blogs/the_grapevine/2014/08/_iftheygunnedmedown_shows_how_black_people_are_portrayed_in_mainstream_media.html"">)  I have become more numb when the media continues to paint black men’s lifestyles with broad, urban, low-income, criminal-minded strokes that are meant to further diminish their existence in this country.

The struggle has rendered me helpless and forlorn.  I honestly don’t know if the vigils, protests and Al Sharpton appearances are making any differences in the long run.  Hoodies and trending hashtags make us believe change is a-coming, but in reality they mean absolutely nothing when policies and legalities continue to ignore the ongoing extinction of our brothers.",15,57,NA,NA

Holder as a college student or Holder as a federal prosecutor was not immune from the harassment, targeting, possible arrest, and even in some cases violence while walking or driving while black.

Tragically, this was not the case with Ezell Ford in Los Angeles or Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Though separated by 2000 miles, both men had three things in common with Holder the student. They were young, black and male. They were not accused of any crimes. Yet they were still stopped and slain by police officers.

Their slayings proved what Holder and legions of other blacks know. That is that racial profiling might kill. There’s the astounding report that nearly 30 black males have been killed by police or security guards the last two years

{http://hiphopandpolitics.com/2012/04/06/29-black-people-have-been-killed-by-policesecurity-since-jan-2012-16-since-trayvon/.}<hyperlink=""http://hiphopandpolitics.com/2012/04/06/29-black-people-have-been-killed-by-policesecurity-since-jan-2012-16-since-trayvon/"">

Nearly all were unarmed. There is no conclusive proof that the young men were killed solely because they were black. But the irrefutable fact is that they were black, and countless studies and surveys of police and public attitudes show that young black males are far more likely to be stopped, searched and arrested than white males. It’s at times only a short step from that to a deadly altercation.

In Ferguson, a study based on police statistics found that in 2013 while African-American drivers make up a little less than two-thirds of the driving-age population in the city, they made up nearly 90 percent of all traffic stops. They were almost twice as likely to be searched as whites and twice as likely to be arrested even though police found no weapons or drugs on them. An ACLU study found that blacks were likely to be stopped, searched and arrested in nearly every category of crime than whites. The LAPD has tried several approaches to root out racial profiling from mediation to dialogue sessions to intense sensitivity training of officers. But the hard reality is that despite hundreds of complaints of racial profiling received by the LAPD almost none have been sustained.

Many police officials hotly deny that racial profiling exists. Yet they have no credible answer to two crucial questions about these stops. One is that the overwhelming majority of stops result in no arrests, or even citations. And no weapons or drugs are found. New York City has continually topped the list of big city police departments that make the highest number of unwarranted street stops. A study of the city’s study and frisk policy shows that only a small fraction of those persons stopped were arrested. The studies also found a comparable low number of arrests in relation to the high number of street stops in every other city. The other troubling and largely unanswered question is why many of those who have been stopped have been prominent black and Latino professionals, business leaders, and even some state legislators and House representatives as was the case with Holder? The susceptibility of even celebrated black men to be hauled off when there’s even the slightest suspicion, mistaken or otherwise, of criminal wrongdoing has left many police officials red-faced with embarrassment when they realized their goof.

Before the 9/11 terror attacks, civil rights leaders had made some headway in drawing public attention to the fight against racial profiling. In its report “Police Practices and Civil Rights in America” issued in 1999, the Civil Rights Commission called on police departments to immediately fire any officer guilty of racial profiling. The Justice Department initiated investigations of police departments in several cities for civil rights violations, mostly against young black and Latino males. It brokered consent decrees with city officials in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles to rein in the blatant, and well documented abusive practices of police departments in those cities in those years.

There was some hope that Congress would finally consider passing the Traffic Stops Statistics Study Act introduced by Michigan Democrat John Conyers in 1999 and 2000. The bill required the Justice Department to compile figures from local police departments by race on highway traffic stops. The data would document why a driver was stopped and whether an arrest was made or not. The Justice Department could use the figures to determine how pervasive racial profiling was. The bill did not force local police agencies to collect data and imposed no sanctions on those that refuse to compile stats. It has gone nowhere in Congress.

The admission that racial profiling does exist is a hard slap to the official embedded notion that justice is color blind and impartial. The killings of Brown and Ford aren’t likely to change that. But the brutal reality is that they stand as stark proof that racial profiling just might kill.",0,11,NA,NA

One of the bullets entered the top of Mr. Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury, according to Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, who flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family’s request to conduct the separate autopsy. It was likely the last of bullets to hit him, he said.

Mr. Brown, 18, was also shot four times in the right arm, he said, adding that all the bullets were fired into his front.

The bullets did not appear to have been shot from very close range because no gunpowder was present on his body. However, that determination could change if it turns out that there is gunshot residue on Mr. Brown’s clothing, to which Dr. Baden did not have access.

In other news, Black Twitter blasted {Nelly}<hyperlink=""http://eurweb.com/tag/nelly""> for promoting Cheerios on Twitter instead of posting about the death of {Michael Brown.}<hyperlink=""http://eurweb.com/tag/michael-brown"">

A police officer shot Brown to death last weekend in Ferguson, Mo. — right outside of St. Louis where Nelly grew up and still owns a home.

The photo above of Nelly holding a box of Cheerios was met with much criticism since he acknowledged the product over a black teenager who died at the hands of a racist system — right outside of his hometown.

“We are human beings. We deserve to be buried by our children not the other way around. No matter how u felt about black people look at this Mother and look at this father and tell me as a human being how u cannot feel empathy for them. How can u not feel sympathy for their pain and loos. These are not “THOTS, niggas/niggers, hoes, Ballers, Divas. These two people are parents. They are humans that produced a child and loved that child and that child was slaughtered like Game and left face down as public spectacle while his blood drained down the street.

“Look at the pain of this mother, look into her eyes. Look at the Man behind her. Look at that father made helpless and hurt that he cud not defend his seed. Don’t debate. Don’t insert your agenda. Save me the bullshit Black On Black Crime speech and look at these to Noble creatures called humans and look at what govt sanctioned murder has done. It has robbed them of their humanity and replaced it with pain and shame, suffering and hurt.

“I don’t care if others rioted or why. I don’t care that ball players and Rappers are what they shud be. I care that we as humans care as much about one another more. I care we see past Class, race and culture and honor the humanity that unites our species. Stop talking and LOOK at these PEOPLE. LOOK at these HUMANS and stand with them against a system allows a Human PIG to slaughter their child. Forgive any typos love and respect u all.”",2,22,NA,NA

Sybrina Fulton, whose 17-year-old son Trayvon was shot and killed by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman in 2012, says she wishes she could say “it will be alright” but the truth is she can only “pray” as their ‘lives are forever changed.”

“Our children are our future so whenever any of our children – black, white, brown, yellow, or red – are taken from us unnecessarily, it causes a never-ending pain that is unlike anything I could have imagined experiencing,” Fulton wrote in the letter, {published in TIME magazine.}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3136685/travyon-sybrina-fulton-ferguson/"">

Fulton explains the dichotomy of detractors and supporters family members will face since they’ve sadly joined “this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.”

For Fulton, the loss meant devoting her life to the missions of The Trayvon Martin Foundation. She lends her support to Brown’s family and “to seek justice for your Michael and the countless other Michaels & Trayvons of our country.”

Read Fulton’s letter in its entirety below:

To The Brown Family,

I wish I had a word of automatic comfort but I don’t. I wish I could say that it will be alright on a certain or specific day but I can’t. I wish that all of the pain that I have endured could possibly ease some of yours but it won’t. What I can do for you is what has been done for me: pray for you then share my continuing journey as you begin yours.

I hate that you and your family must join this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence. Of particular concern is that so many of these gun violence cases involve children far too young. But Michael is much more than a police/gun violence case; Michael is your son. A son that barely had a chance to live. Our children are our future so whenever any of our children – black, white, brown, yellow, or red – are taken from us unnecessarily, it causes a never-ending pain that is unlike anything I could have imagined experiencing.

Further complicating the pain and loss in this tragedy is the fact that the killer of your son is alive, known, and currently free. In fact, he is on paid administrative leave. Your own feelings will bounce between sorrow and anger. Even when you don’t want to think about it because it is so much to bear, you will be forced to by merely turning on your television or answering your cell phone. You may find yourselves pulled in many different directions by strangers who may be well-wishers or detractors. Your circle will necessarily close tighter because the trust you once, if ever, you had in “the system” and their agents are forever changed. Your lives are forever changed.

However with those changes come new challenges and opportunities. You will experience a swell of support from all corners of the world. Many will express their sympathies and encourage you to keep fighting for Michael. You will also, unfortunately, hear character assassinations about Michael which I am certain you already have. This will incense and insult you. All of this will happen before and continue long after you have had the chance to lay your son to rest.

I know this because I lived and continue to live this. I have devoted my life to the comprehensive missions of The Trayvon Martin Foundation – including providing support to families that have lost a young child to senseless gun violence regardless of race, ethnicity or gender. I will support you and your efforts to seek justice for your Michael and the countless other Michaels & Trayvons of our country. The 20 Sandy Hook children. Jordan Davis. Oscar Grant. Kendrick Johnson. Sean Bell. Hadya Pendleton. The Aurora shooting victims. The list is too numerous to adequately mention them all. According to The Children’s Defense Fund, gun violence is the second leading cause of death for children ages 1-19. That is a horrible fact.

Facts, myths, and flat out lies are already out there in Michael’s case. Theories, regardless of how ridiculous, are being pondered by the pundits. My advice is to surround yourselves with proven and trusted support. Through it all, I never let go of my faith, my family, or my friends. Long after the overwhelming media attention is gone, you will need those three entities to find your ‘new normal.’ Honor your son and his life, not the circumstances of his alleged transgressions. I have always said that Trayvon was not perfect. But no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed.

But know this: neither of their lives shall be in vain. The galvanizations of our communities must be continued beyond the tragedies. While we fight injustice, we will also hold ourselves to an appropriate level of intelligent advocacy. If they refuse to hear us, we will make them feel us. Some will mistake that last statement as being negatively provocative. But feeling us means feeling our pain; imagining our plight as parents of slain children. We will no longer be ignored. We will bond, continue our fights for justice, and make them remember our children in an appropriate light. I would hate to think that our lawmakers and leaders would need to lose a child before protecting the rest of them and making the necessary changes NOW…

With Heartfelt Support,

EurWeb,eur42,http://www.eurweb.com/2014/08/woman-josie-gives-darren-wilsons-side-of-michael-brown-killing-listen/,Woman ‘Josie’ Gives Darren Wilson’s Side of Michael Brown Killing (Listen),EURPublisher01,08/18/14,06/16/16,"For the first time since the Aug. 9 shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown, we're supposedly getting the shooter's side of the story.

A woman claiming to be a friend of Darren Wilson, the officer who fatally shot Brown, called into The Dana Show on St. Louis radio station KFTK to give Wilson’s account of what happened.

The woman, who would identify herself only as “Josie,” said that she came by the details via Wilson’s significant other.

Conservative host Dana Loesch explained on the show’s website, “After I hung up [on ‘Josie’] she called back and told my programming director that her relationship to the named officer is legitimate. I haven’t personally vetted the association, but wanted to post the audio for comparison to the pending results of the investigation.”

Paraphrasing “Josie’s” account:

Wilson rolled up on Brown and Dorian Johnson and told them to get out of the street. The teens argued that they were almost at their destination. Some cursing was involved, and Officer Wilson drove off. But over the radio, the description of the suspects from the convenience store robbery caused him to stop. Believing he had just encountered the suspects, he backed up and attempted to open the door, but Brown “violently” slammed it shut. Wilson attempts to get out again, but Brown “bum-rushes” Wilson back into the car, punches Wilson’s face and goes for his gun. In the struggle, the gun goes off and Brown takes off running, as does Johnson. Josie said protocol calls for Darren to pursue. Wilson yells “freeze,” Brown turns around “and starts taunting him, yelling, ‘Oh, what are you gonna do about it? You’re not gonna shoot me.'” Then Brown, “all of a sudden, started to bum-rush [Wilson], started coming at him full speed. So [Wilson] just started shooting. And [Brown] just kept coming. So [Wilson] really thinks [Brown] was on something.”

Listen to Josie’s account in her own words below:

Also, surfacing Monday – audio from a video recorded in the moments after Brown’s fatal shooting. Overheard is a man recounting what he witnessed. Another man asks him how Brown ended up at least 30-feet away from the police truck that was being driven by Wilson.

The first man explains that Brown had previously been inside the police truck before running, which would contradict the account given to police and the media by Brown’s friend and witness, Dorian Johnson.

Johnson has said that Brown was never inside Officer Wilson’s vehicle before the shooting. Johnson alleges that Wilson exited his car and struck Brown as he was trying to open the door, setting off the series of events that ended with Brown running from a firing Wilson, before turning with his hands raised in surrender – just before Wilson gunned him down.

However, the first man may have corrected his account of Brown being inside of the police truck, with the words: “He was like, over the truck or what not.” [at :31 on the video]. That could be consistent with Johnson’s account of Wilson grabbing Brown through the window, depending on the position of Brown’s body during the struggle.

The first man goes on to say, “The police got out and ran after him, and the next thing I know he’s coming back towards him. The police had his gun drawn already. …The police kept dumping in him. I’m thinking the police [is] missing! …Then dude started running, coming toward the police.”
