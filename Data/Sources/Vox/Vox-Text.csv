This article has been updated to reflect the change.

As the nation's attention is on the {aggressive, militarized police response to protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, }<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5988925/mike-brown-killing-shooting-case-ferguson-police-riots-st-louis/in/5757650”> there's a lot of clamoring for accountability. On Thursday morning, the St. Louis County Police Department, which was in charge of the response to the protests on the night of Wednesday, August 13, {was pulled out of Ferguson}<hyperlink=”http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”>. That afternoon, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said that the Missouri Highway Patrol would be put in charge of the response to protesters.

You can't understand the police actions in Ferguson — and the size of the change Nixon's announcement represents — without understanding this: for the first several days of protests in Ferguson, there were several different agencies on the ground. And none of them were in charge.

Prior to Thursday morning, there were at least four different police departments on the ground in Ferguson at any given time: the Ferguson police themselves, the St. Louis County police (where Ferguson is located), police from the City of St. Louis, and police from the Missouri Highway Patrol. Additionally, police forces from neighboring cities — such as Dellwood — were photographed at the scene. St. Louis County police were withdrawn on Thursday, and the head of the St. Louis city police said that his officers would not be in Ferguson on Thursday night.

At the press conference Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson held Wednesday — the first press conference since the unrest on Sunday — reporter Matt Pearce of the Los Angeles Times asked who was in charge of making the decision to tear-gas and shoot rubber bullets at protesters and use flashbangs. Jackson's response, at 15:56, was interesting and important:

Here's the transcript of the exchange (emphasis added):

Pearce: Who makes decision to tear gas (inaudible)? 
Jackson: The commander on the scene. 
Pearce: What agency is he from? Who's in charge? 
Jackson: Sometimes it's highway patrol, St. Louis County, us, St. Louis City... 
Pearce: So when something goes down on West Florissant (inaudible) at night, police (inaudible) from different agencies there, there's one person in charge of all of them, or (inaudible)? 
Jackson: There's one incident commander each night. 
Pearce: So that commander rotates, it's not the same guy. 
Jackson: Yes.

What that means is that at least four different people, from different police departments, made the decision to tear-gas protesters: one for each night tear-gas canisters were fired (August 10, 11, 12, and 13). That meant that the problem wasn't just with the St. Louis County police, or with the Ferguson police. (Ferguson mayor Jay Knowles {said on Thursday}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-ferguson-police-tactics/index.html?iid=article_sidebar”> that the St. Louis County police had been in charge ""tactically"" since Sunday, which conflicted with Jackson's account — but raised further questions about who was really in command of what was going on.)

More importantly, it made it impossible for one police chief to be held accountable for what officers are doing in Ferguson. It wasn't clear what the relationship was between an ""incident commander"" who was making decisions at the protest site, and the chief of his police department. But because the public didn't even know which agency the ""incident commander"" was with, it was impossible to demand that that police chief restrain his officers. When Ferguson chief Jackson gave his press conference Wednesday, he was asked whether there would be tear gas used on Wednesday night. He said, ""I hope not."" But he honestly couldn't make any promises, because it turned out that the St. Louis County police were the ones in charge. Now, Governor Nixon has officially designated the Missouri Highway Patrol as the agency to whom the public should be directing their demands for accountability and de-escalation.

Police chiefs who want to defuse the tension simply can't

In fact, the promises Jackson did make about what police would do on Wednesday were quickly broken by the police on the scene. He said repeatedly that protesters would be allowed to continue to assemble, even after sunset (although the Ferguson police and city government had asked protesters to leave 5pm), as long as they were peaceful and weren't blocking the road for more than a brief time.

That's not what happened — guns and tactical vehicles were aimed on protesters on the sidewalk, even hours before sunset, and the confrontation between police and protesters after sunset began when police started demanding that protesters retreat 25 feet from where they'd been standing peacefully for hours. Jackson was wrong, and the contrast between his words on Wednesday afternoon and officers' actions a few hours later further eroded public trust in a police force that was already losing it rapidly. The lack of accountability in Ferguson made it impossible to rebuild the public's trust.

Jackson said Wednesday that he's been working with the Community Relations Service of the Department of Justice, so that the Ferguson Police Department can rebuild its relationship with the city's black community. ""I've asked them, 'Tell me what to do,"" Jackson said. But his actions didn't matter at that point.

Governor Nixon did exactly what he needed to do in placing one agency in charge of the response to protesters. Until there are no longer dozens of police from multiple agencies responding to protests, the Ferguson Police Department can't fix its relationship with the community and defuse tension. Now that there is a clear agency to hold accountable, hopefully that tension will begin to be defused — and as tension is defused, it's likely police will feel they need to de-escalate their presence.",NA,2119,NA,NA
Vox,vox2,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/6043247/ferguson-police-media-harassment,"If police in Ferguson treat journalists like this, imagine how they treat residents",Max Fisher,08/18/2014,02/29/2016,"It looked at first like {police in Ferguson, Missouri, }<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/ferguson-mo-protests-police”> were lashing out at journalists only incidentally. Everyone in their path seemed to be at risk of being teargassed, arrested without charge, or having assault rifles pointed at them without warning — so naturally the reporters milling around town were at similar risk. Increasingly, though, it is becoming clear that police in Ferguson are targeting journalists, using intimidation, arbitrary arrests, and physical force.

This has a much deeper and more damaging effect than just suppressing media coverage. Arresting and intimidating journalists are inherently political acts, guaranteed by design to generate attention. Much as when it's done in far-away conflict zones and authoritarian states, it's about making a statement. It's about demonstrating, to ordinary citizens even more than to journalists, that police believe they can exercise absolute control over the streets and anyone in them.

That police in Ferguson are targeting journalists so openly and aggressively is an appalling affront to basic media freedoms, but it is far scarier for what it suggests about how the police treat everyone else — and should tell us much about why Ferguson's residents are so fed up. When police in Ferguson are willing to rough up and arbitrarily arrest a Washington Post reporter just for being in a McDonald's, you have to wonder how those police treat the local citizens, who don't have the shield of a press pass.

Intimidation of journalists is becoming routine in Ferguson

On Wednesday, police in Ferguson roughed up and arrested Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post for {failing to exit a McDonalds}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/6000785/wesley-lowrey-and-ryan-reilly-arrested”>. According to Lowery's Twitter account, the two were ""assaulted and arrested"" because ""officers decided we weren't leaving McDonalds quickly enough, shouldn't have been taping them."" They were later released, but the fact of their arrest was enough to show how police would treat journalists in Ferguson.

Since those first arrests, police actions against journalists in Ferguson have escalated in severity and frequency.

Getty photographer Scott Olson, who's been in Ferguson all week, was {arrested}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/501497010189791232”> on Monday and stuffed into the back of a police van for no clearly discernible reason. ""He was literally just across the street from the media area. Not a good sign for media access tonight,"" Reilly {tweeted}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/501498695045877761”>.

CNN's Don Lemon was broadcasting live from one of the town's designated protest areas when a police officer began shoving him in an attempt to physically force him to leave the area:

An Al Jazeera America TV crew, set up to safely shoot on the sidelines of a recent police deployment, had to {abandon their equipment}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/6001193/al-jazeera-journalists-teargassed-by-security-forces-in-ferguson”> when police fired tear gas at them. After they ran, police walked over and dismantled the set-up, turning over the equipment.

Reporters have been shouted at by police, had heavy weapons pointed at them, been subjected to {military-law style curfews}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6025831/ferguson-curfew-rules-criminalize-journalism”>, and been ordered to confine themselves to small, set areas when outdoors. Journalists who leave these corralled zones or venture outside during the curfew — who attempt to walk down a public suburban street in America, in other words — are threatened with arrest.

""If you walk about 100 feet from OK'ed press area you find yourself lit up by a spotlight and a squad of police on hair trigger,"" MSNBC host Chris Hayes {tweeted}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/statuses/501208540451979264”> recently from Ferguson. Later that night, as Hayes' team filmed the protests, police told them, ""Media do not pass us. You're getting maced next time you pass us.""

CNN reporters in Ferguson apparently feel so physically threatened, either by police or protesters or both, that they {emptied}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/PatriciaBynes/status/501439656899387392”> a local military surplus store of its helmets.

The problem is so bad that the ACLU sued Ferguson to stop harassing reporters — and won

Mustafa Hussein is a local journalist from KARG Argus radio who has spent the past week livestreaming video from the ground in Ferguson, sometimes to tens of thousands of Web viewers. Police have tried to block him from reporting so frequently that, on Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union {announced it was suing}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/aclu-sues-to-obtain-mike-brown-shooting-report/article_e121542f-f920-58ae-af45-74530c4aa499.html”> the town and the county, seeking a court order from a judge telling police that they cannot bar journalists from reporting.

On Thursday, the ACLU got what they wanted: a court agreement, signed by the city and the county and the Missouri Highway Patrol chief, {stating: }<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/501494032803954688”> ""Parties acknowledge and agree that the media and members of the public have a right to record public events without abridgment unless it obstructs the activity or threatens the safety of others, or physically interferes with the ability of law enforcement officers to perform their duties.""

Even more astounding than the fact that this was necessary is the fact that it was so quickly ignored.

On Sunday, a police officer appeared to threaten to shoot Hussein for reporting, as he was recording. The video, at the time streaming to tens of thousands of viewers, {captured}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6029739/video-police-threatens-to-shoot-reporter-taping-ferguson-protests”> the officer shouting in a wildly aggressive tone what sounded like, ""Get the fuck out of here and get that light off, or you're getting shot with this.""

There's too much continuity between arrests for it to be disconnected

Intimidation of journalists in Ferguson is not just coming from the occasional hotheaded cop.

On Sunday night, three days after citizens of Ferguson {marched alongside}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6004215/a-considerably-different-atmosphere-in-ferguson-tonight”> Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, in gratitude for Johnson taking over the heavy-handed police presence, and mere hours after Johnson gave an {emotional speech}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6028883/watch-capt-ron-johnsons-riveting-speech-at-ferguson-rally”> apologizing for the police violence and promising its end, the savior of Ferguson ordered three journalists arrested for witnessing an apparently unprompted police crackdown on protesters.

Shortly after police in Ferguson lobbed tear gas and fired high-tech noise cannons at protesters, three reporters from major outlets attempted to walk down the street to talk to the protesters. Police approached them and ordered them to leave the area. Though the police had no legal authority to do this — it was a public street with no imminent danger — the reporters, one of them a veteran war correspondent, had perhaps heard enough reports of police in Ferguson intimidating and arresting journalists to know they should leave.

""Capt Johnson said walk away or be arrested. I started walking away. They followed and arrested us,"" one of the reporters, Robert Klemko of Sports Illustrated, {tweeted}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/RobertKlemko/status/501200937986580481”>. Another of the reporters posted a video clip showing Johnson {ordering}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/neiLmunshi/statuses/501199324844687360”> that the journalists be arrested and cuffed.

Their zip-cord cuffs were cut minutes later, but Johnson's arrests were nonetheless a success. The three reporters, and others in the area, now understood that crossing the police's ever-tightening list of restrictions on journalists, stated and unstated, no matter how arbitrary or unlawful, came with personal, bodily risk. And the police under Johnson's command saw very clearly how they were to treat the media.

The police crackdown on journalists in Ferguson has become so severe that President Obama, in public comments, had to remind police that media freedom is protected in the United States.

""Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their job and report to the American people what they see on the ground,"" he said. This would be banal statement if uttered about China or Russia; that the American president had to say it about his own country is a staggering sign of how badly the situation has turned.

You don't arrest reporters just to stifle journalism — you do it to make a statement

Press freedom organizations, typically focused on abuses halfway around the world, have {condemned}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-journalists-statement-press-freedom-organizations-ferguson_n_5678833.html”> the police behavior in Ferguson. The Committee to Protect Journalists warned that authorities were curbing journalists' ""right to work freely on the streets of any American city."" Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press called the police actions ""unwarranted"" and ""unthinkable.""

The parallels between Ferguson and the harassment of journalists abroad are disturbing. Consider some of these recent cases from countries we think of, rightly, as despotic and hostile to the press.

In eastern Ukraine this April, Russia-backed rebels {kidnapped}<hyperlink=”https://newrepublic.com/article/117476/vice-reporter-simon-ostrovsky-taken-hostage-pro-russian-forces”> a Vice News reporter who had been asking to check the passports of separatists, a number of whom were actually Russian citizens, almost certainly to intimidate him and others not to pursue such stories.

In Egypt in June, the government sentenced three Al Jazeera journalists, including an Australian and a Canadian citizen, to several years in prison on transparently {trumped-up charges}<hyperlink=”http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/egypt-finds-al-jazeera-journalists-guilty-201462373539293797.html”> of aiding the Muslim Brotherhood and ""reporting false news."" The case is widely understood to be a warning to other journalists in Egypt: don't report news that the government dislikes, especially about the Muslim Brotherhood, or we will put you in jail for years — Western citizenship be damned.

In July, Iranian plainclothes security forces stormed the home of Washington Post Tehran bureau chief Jason Rezaian, arresting him, his wife, and two others. Analysts generally agree the arrest was likely instigated by anti-Western hard-liners within the Iranian government, perhaps from the Revolutionary Guard Corps. Their goal was almost certainly not to muzzle Rezaian, but to {undermine}<hyperlink=”http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-detaining-jason-rezaian?utm_source=tny&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dailyemail&mbid=nl_081514_daily&CUST_ID=28469487&spMailingID=6917706&spUserID=NTQwNTUzMDUxMzYS1&spJobID=501590253&spReportId=NTAxNTkwMjUzS0”> moderate government factions, especially the president who is engaged in nuclear talks with Western countries, and to maintain what they see as a shadow war with the West.

What these cases have in common, like many others in conflict zones and authoritarian states, is that the purpose of arresting journalists is about much more than just putting those specific reporters in prison. The arrests have much larger, political goal, in which intimidating reporters is a tool for influencing non-journalists as well.

This is most alarming for what it says about how police treat non-journalists

The thinking behind intimidation of journalists in Ferguson is certainly less sophisticated and less carefully planned. But there are political ramifications too clear and powerful to be dismissed as incidental, just as there are with the police's decision to demonstrate as much force as possible, to present themselves as an occupying army that sees the Ferguson community as an enemy to be suppressed.

By forcing reporters off of streets with curfews, assaulting or threatening them when they wander out of tiny designated zones, and arresting them seemingly arbitrarily, police are doing much more than suppressing media coverage of their crackdowns. The police are signaling that they exercise total control over every inch of public space in Ferguson and believe they have the authority to treat people in that space however they wish. That message comes through clearly not just to the reporters, but to their vast audiences in Ferguson and beyond it.

Journalists can at times be the canary in the coal mine for situations when basic order and public safety have broken down. It is unfair and unjust that a reporter from a well-known outlet can expect better treatment, and a far greater degree of physical security, than can other people in just about any situation in America or abroad. So if this is how police in Ferguson are treating journalists, just imagine how they treat local residents.

When a police officer is willing to run up to a video journalist and shout, ""Get the fuck out of here ... or you're getting shot with this,"" knowing this will be heard by the journalist's viewers, you have to wonder how that officer behaves when the cameras aren't running, how he talks to the local citizens he is supposed to be protecting.

That is what makes Ferguson's treatment of journalists truly alarming. It is part and parcel of the police's treatment of regular citizens, an extension of their militarized tactics and their practice of treating the community as a hostile force to be controlled. When we see police cracking down on journalists, we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg of Ferguson police abuses, and that should help us understand why Ferguson's residents are protesting.",NA,18000,NA,NA

Yet presumption of innocence prevails and sober minds know both the need to wait for an investigation and the reality that we may never really know what happened that fateful Saturday in Ferguson, Missouri. But watching events unfold Wednesday night in the St. Louis suburb, there can be no doubt that what happened on August 13 was an outrage.

The local authorities clearly have no idea what they're doing, and higher powers from the state or federal government need to intervene before things get even worse.

The {arrest of two reporters}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/6000785/wesley-lowrey-and-ryan-reilly-arrested”>, Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, with whom many of us in Washington, DC, are acquainted was neither the beginning nor the most important part of the outrage, but it drives home in a visceral way the extent to which the situation is being monumentally mishandled.

Police officers, for some unfathomable reason, were pointing guns at unarmed civilians at twilight.

[tweetbegin 499697652385464320 tweetend]

Crowd control is a normal complement to any modern protest. And as I remember well from the late-Giuliani days in New York, crowd control sometimes gets heavy-handed when relationships between the police and the community are strained. But you do crowd control with horses, batons, and shields, not rifles. You point guns at dangerous, violent criminals, not people out for a march.

A number of wags have gotten mileage over the past few days out of joking that it's hard to tell if you're looking at photos of Missouri or Baghdad. But military veterans say the display of force from the cops last night went beyond any sound wartime practice.

Of course cops, like soldiers, must be prepared to use serious weapons from time to time. But there was no rioting last night in Ferguson. No looting. And it's difficult to imagine any scenario that would call for police officers to be dressed in the kind of military-style camo fatigues that are visible in many pictures from last night.

Lowery and Reilly were released soon after being detained, and the Ferguson police chief {told Matt Pearce}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/499719019747090433”> from the LA Times that the arrestor was ""probably somebody who didn't know better.""

That sounds about right. There were an awful lot of somebodies who didn't know better out on the streets of Ferguson last night wielding an awful lot of deadly equipment. Quite a few people have been injured over the past few days by rubber bullets and rough handling (although in a Wednesday press conference, a police spokesperson insisted that no one had been injured during the protests).

Wednesday night's outing ended for many protestors in a cloud of tear gas. In my experience, these ""nonviolent"" crowd-control tactics are a good deal more painful than people who've never been at the receiving end appreciate. There's no real reason they should be inflicted on demonstrators who weren't hurting anyone or even damaging property. We are lucky, to be honest, that nobody's been killed yet. But somebody who does know better needs to take charge. And soon.

The state's governor, Democrat Jay Nixon, spent the early evening tweeting about an education policy dispute in the state legislature, and was MIA on the issue at hand as events unfolded.

But it is clear at this point that local officials in the town of Ferguson and St. Louis County don't know what they are doing. Of course people will not be calm while police officers charged with protecting them trample their rights.

The governor needs to either step in and ensure — not urge — that law enforcement do its job properly, or else to appeal to the federal government to come in and take charge. Obama and his team are, with good reason, reluctant to see the president involved in highly racialized controversies.

Vox,vox4,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/6029019/9-essential-facts-about-whats-happening-in-ferguson-missouri-michael-brown,11 essential facts about Ferguson and the shooting of Michael Brown, Amanda Taub ,08/18/2014,03/02/2016,"On August 9, a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In the days since his death, Ferguson has been rocked by protests, some of which have turned violent. On Saturday, August 16, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew on Ferguson, closing the streets from midnight to 5am.

Here are the essential facts you need to know to understand who Brown was, how he was killed, and why the nation's eyes are on Ferguson.

1) Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed teenager Michael Brown on Saturday, August 9

Michael Brown was {shot to death}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-police-officer-darren-wilson”> by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson around noon on Saturday, August 9. Wilson, 28, is six-year veteran of the Ferguson police department, with no prior disciplinary record. Although the exact circumstances of the shooting remain unclear, {Brown was unarmed}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-shooting-facts-details”> at the time of the shooting. All shells found at the scene were from Wilson's gun.

Brown had graduated from Normandy High School in Wellston in the spring of 2014. He was planning to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday, August 11, two days after he was killed.

2) Ferguson is a majority-black city with an overwhelmingly white police force and city government

Ferguson is a {majority-black town}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/12/5994181/ferguson-is-67-percent-black-and-its-police-force-is-94-percent-white”>. According to the 2010 census, about 67 percent of residents are black and 29 percent are white.

That racial makeup is not reflected in the town's institutions. Ferguson's {mayor}<hyperlink=”http://www.fergusoncity.com/directory.aspx?EID=6”> is white. Five of the six members of its {city council}<hyperlink=”http://www.fergusoncity.com/171/Council-Members”> are white. Six of the seven members of its {school board}<hyperlink=”http://www.fergflor.org/pages/Ferguson-Florissant_SD/About_Us/Board_of_Education/Board_Roster”> are white.

And, most importantly, its {police forc}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/12/5994181/ferguson-is-67-percent-black-and-its-police-force-is-94-percent-white/in/5757650”>e is overwhelmingly white. Out of the 53 commissioned officers in the Ferguson Police Department, only three are black. And the chief of police, Thomas Jackson, is also white.

There is also evidence that the Ferguson police department, like many other local law enforcement agencies, disproportionately stops and arrests black residents. According to a racial profiling {report}<hyperlink=”http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf”> from the Missouri Attorney General's office that was obtained by {Buzzfeed}<hyperlink=”http://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/blacks-overwhelmingly-get-stopped-by-the-police-in-ferguson#.fl0KxjWjK”>, of the 5,384 traffic stops made last year, 4,632 of them — 86 percent — targeted black drivers. Only 684, or 12.7 percent, targeted white drivers, even though Ferguson is almost 30 percent white.

The report also found that innocent black people were much more likely to be searched than innocent white people were:  21.7 percent of black people who were searched were found to be carrying contraband, which means that about four out of every five of them were innocent.  However, searches of white people produced a contraband ""hit"" 34 percent of the time.

Yet black people were also far more likely to be arrested than whites. According to the same report, 92.7 percent of all people arrested by the Ferguson police in 2013 were black, and 6.9 percent were white.

3) Police and eyewitnesses gave contradictory accounts of the shooting

Some details of {what occurred during the shooting}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-shooting-facts-details”> are undisputed. Brown was originally stopped for jaywalking, because he and a friend were walking in the middle of the street. Wilson fired multiple shots at Brown, at least one of which was fired from his squad car. Brown was unarmed, and all of the shells found at the scene were from the officer's gun.

However, many of the other details of what happened remain unclear, and a police account of the shooting is different from what eyewitnesses have said happened.

Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, who was with him when the shooting occurred, gave {this account to MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”>: Johnson said that he and Brown had been walking in the middle of the street when a police officer approached and told them to use the sidewalk. They complied, and the officer began to drive away, but then threw his car into reverse and came back alongside the teens, nearly hitting them. Johnson heard Wilson say something like ""What'd you say?"", before trying to open his car door, slamming it into Brown. Then the officer reached out and grabbed Brown by the neck with his left hand. The two men struggled briefly, and then Wilson, still in his car, shot Brown once.

Johnson said that he and Brown both attempted to flee, but Brown was shot a second time. After the second shot, Brown turned around and surrendered, putting his hands in the air and saying, ""I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!"" Johnson said that Wilson then approached Brown and fired several more shots, killing him.

Eyewitness Piaget Crenshaw {told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/anger-confrontation-after-fatal-shooting-of-teen-by-ferguson-police/article_04e3885b-4131-5e49-b784-33cd3acbe7f1.html”> that she was waiting for a bus when she saw a police officer try to place Brown in his squad car. Then she saw Brown attempt to flee, with his hands in the air. The officer shot Brown multiple times as Brown ran away, said Crenshaw, who has provided photographs of the scene to law enforcement.

The local police who are tasked with investigating the shooting, by contrast, claim that Brown was killed after he assaulted Wilson. St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar {said}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/10/justice/missouri-police-involved-shooting/index.html”> that the shooting occurred after Brown pushed Wilson back into his squad car, ""where he physically assaulted the officer"" and then struggled over Wilson's weapon. According to Belmar, Wilson then fired once from the car, and then several more times as Brown attempted to flee. Belmar's verbal account has thus far been the only source for Wilson's version of events, as no incident reports of the shooting have been released despite media requests. During a briefing on Wednesday August 13, Ferguson Police chief Tom Jackson said that Officer Wilson was injured during the encounter with Brown, and that the side of his face was ""swollen"" afterwards.

4) A private autopsy found that Brown had been shot at least six times

On Sunday, August 17, the Brown family {released}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6029685/autopsy-michael-brown-shot-at-least-six-times”> a preliminary report on the private autopsy they had commissioned. Michael M. Baden, who conducted the examination, found that Brown was shot at least six times, and all of the bullets were fired into his front. Baden also determined that Brown had been shot twice in the head, and that a bullet that hit the top of his head was most likely the shot that killed him.

Baden said that he did not find evidence of gunshot residue on Brown's body, which suggests that he was not shot at close range. However, Baden noted that he had not been able to test Brown's clothing, so he cannot say whether it may have had residue on it.

5) The police have refused to release the state autopsy report or any information about their investigation of what happened during the shooting

The St. Louis County Police are in charge of {the local investigation}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-shooting-investigation-facts-details”> into Brown's death. However, they have refused to release the report from the autopsy conducted by the St. Louis County medical examiner, or any details about the evidence they have gathered so far. This lack of information has become a major rallying point for the protesters, who have made repeated demands that Wilson be brought to justice.

Although Dr. Mary Case, the St. Louis County Medical Examiner who conducted the state's autopsy of Brown, has not yet released the results of her examination, she did give a brief statement to the {Washington Post}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/county-investigation-michael-brown-was-shot-from-the-front-had-marijuana-in-his-system/”> saying that Brown was shot multiple times in the head and chest. In addition, a ""person familiar with the County's investigation"" told the Post that Brown had between six and eight gunshot wounds, and had been shot from the front. The same anonymous source said that Brown had marijuana in his system at the time of his death. However, as my colleague Dara Lind has {pointed out}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/michael-brown-shooting-ferguson-mo/2014/8/18/6031309/michael-brown-marijuana-killed-autopsy-criminal-legal-ferguson”>, there is no reason to believe that Brown's marijuana use was relevant to his shooting.

Although the lack of detail makes it difficult to know for sure, there are worrying signs that investigators may not be approaching the investigation in a thorough, professional manner. For instance, the police apparently {did not interview Brown's friend Dorian Johnson}<hyperlink=”http://m.stltoday.com/online/ferguson-statement-on-brown-shooting-call-for-daylight-only-protests/pdf_2dd60ce0-1834-52db-b948-ec38f4c528ee.html?mobile_touch=true”> until Wednesday, August 13, even though he was a key eyewitness.

6) The police released information suggesting Brown had stolen from a convenience store, but that wasn't the reason Wilson stopped him

In marked contrast with the lack of detail about the autopsy or investigation into the shooting, the Ferguson police did release {information}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5988925/mike-brown-killing-shooting-case-ferguson-police-riots-st-louis#Friday15”> on Friday that suggested Brown may have stolen cigars from a local convenience store shortly before his death, including a copy of a police report and surveillance video footage of the alleged crime, which Ferguson police Chief Tom Jackson referred to as a ""strong-arm robbery.""

The video footage released by police appears to show a man taking cigars from behind the counter, and then shoving the store clerk aside when he attempted to block the door.

Jackson has been heavily criticized for releasing the footage, particularly after he indicated, hours after the release, that Wilson was not aware that Brown was a robbery suspect at the time. Jackson {said}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6007055/mike-brown-robbery-shooting-unrelated”> that the ""initial contact was unrelated to the robbery,"" and that Wilson was not responding to a call about the robbery. Instead, he had stopped the teen for jaywalking. As Vox's {Dara Lind}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/5994305/michael-brown-case-investigation-legal-police-kill-force-murder”> and {Ezra Klein}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6005861/michael-brown-darren-wilson-ferguson-shooting”> have noted, even if Wilson had stopped Brown because of a robbery, that fact alone would not make it legal for Wilson to shoot Brown while he was surrendering. (Jackson {later told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/michael-brown-a-suspect-in-robbery-of-cigars-from-store/article_52c40b84-ad90-5f9a-973c-70d628d0be04.html”> that Wilson thought Brown could be the robbery suspect during the course of the stop, when he saw the packet of cigars Brown was holding.) He said he released the information to comply with requests from journalists.

On Saturday, it was reported that Jackson had released the robbery footage and police report over objections from the Department of Justice. An unnamed law enforcement source told {NBC News}<hyperlink=”http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/feds-urged-police-not-release-michael-brown-robbery-video-n182346”> that the DOJ had urged local police not to make the footage public, arguing that it could inflame tensions in the town.

Many local residents greeted Jackson's announcement with outrage. Brown's family {said}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-releasing-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown/”>, through their lawyer, that they believed the release of the robbery footage was ""strategic,"" and an ""attempt at character assassination."" And a handful of protesters in Ferguson did turn violent for several hours that night, prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency the following day.

7) The DOJ is also investigating Brown's death

Two days after Brown was killed, on August 11, Attorney General Eric Holder said that the shooting deserved ""a fulsome review"" and {announced}<hyperlink=”https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-holder-recent-shooting-incident-ferguson-missouri”> that FBI agents from the St. Louis field office would conduct a ""concurrent"" investigation into Brown's death, working with attorneys from the DOJ's Civil Rights Division and the US Attorney's Office.

On Saturday, August 16, Johnson, of the Highway Patrol, announced that {40 FBI agents}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/16/6024539/federal-investigation-begins-40-fbi-agents-arrive-in-ferguson-michael-brown/in/5757650”> were on the ground in Ferguson and would be canvassing door-to-door in the neighborhood where the shooting took place in the hope of finding eyewitnesses to testify about what had happened. The FBI also handed out cards requesting information from local residents.

The DOJ announced Sunday, August 17, that a federal medical examiner would conduct a {new autopsy}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/17/6026843/holder-doj-michael-brown-federal-autopsy/in/5757650”> of Brown's body. That will be the third time an autopsy is done in this case: the St. Louis County medical examiner performed the first one, and Brown's family also commissioned its own private autopsy.

According to a statement by Justice Department spokesperson Brian Fallon:

Due to the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family, Attorney General Holder has instructed Justice Department officials to arrange for an additional autopsy to be performed by a federal medical examiner. This independent examination will take place as soon as possible. Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.

8) Grand jury proceedings began on August 20

On Wednesday, August 20, the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office began to present evidence about the shooting to a {grand jury}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6047467/missouri-governor-will-not-remove-embattled-prosecutor-from-michael”>. County Attorney Robert McCulloch has {promised}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6044833/former-federal-prosecutor-suggests-da-is-abdicating-responsibility-in”> that ""absolutely everything will be presented to the grand jury. Every scrap of paper that we have. Every photograph that was taken."" He estimates that the grand jury process could last until October.

Former prosecutor Alex Little {told Vox}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6044833/former-federal-prosecutor-suggests-da-is-abdicating-responsibility-in”> that McCulloch’s grand jury strategy seems like a ""delaying tactic"":  ""When a District Attorney says, in effect, ‘we’ll present the evidence and let the grand jury decide,’"" Little said,  ""that’s malarkey."" The approach, said Little, suggests that ""he’s already decided to abdicate his role in the process as an advocate for justice. At that point, there’s no longer a prosecutor in the room guiding the grand jurors, and — more importantly — no state official acting on behalf of the victim, Michael Brown.""

9) Several different law enforcement agencies are involved in the response to the shooting and the protests

Many law enforcement agencies have played roles in the investigation into Brown's death, and in the security response to the protests that followed. At times, this has caused {serious problems}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002291/ferguson-police-st-louis-county-in-charge-jay-nixon-tear-gas-officer-fired”>.

Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, works for the Ferguson Police Department. After the shooting, Ferguson's police chief asked the St. Louis County Police to take over the investigation, so they are the ones who are tasked with gathering evidence for a potential case against Wilson.

From August 9 through August 13, there were at least four police departments in Ferguson participating in the security operation: the Ferguson Police Department, the St. Louis County Police Department, the St. Louis City Police Department, and the Missouri Highway Patrol. There were also reports that additional police from other nearby towns were also on the scene.

For the first few days of the protests, command of the security operation in Ferguson rotated between different departments, Jackson, Ferguson's police chief, said during a press conference. As my colleague Dara Lind points out, that system was a disaster in terms of police accountability:

More importantly, it made it impossible for one police chief to be held accountable for what officers are doing in Ferguson. It wasn't clear what the relationship was between an ""incident commander"" who was making decisions at the protest site, and the chief of his police department. But because the public didn't even know which agency the ""incident commander"" was with, it was impossible to demand that that police chief restrain his officers. When Ferguson chief Jackson gave his press conference Wednesday, he was asked whether there would be tear gas used on Wednesday night. He said, ""I hope not."" But he honestly couldn't make any promises, because it turned out that the St. Louis County police were the ones in charge. Now, Governor Nixon has officially designated the Missouri Highway Patrol as the agency to whom the public should be directing their demands for accountability and de-escalation.

On Thursday, August 14, Gov. Nixon {""reframed""}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6003199/possible-deescalation-in-ferguson-as-two-police-departments-pull-out/in/5757650”> the command for the security operation in Ferguson, placing Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, a Ferguson native, in charge of security operations.  Although multiple departments are still participating in the operation, they are now under a single non-rotating command. Johnson has {publicly acknowledged}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6006343/local-police-didnt-inform-the-highway-patrol-about-todays-news-release”> that communication between departments is poor, with Ferguson police releasing information about the case without telling him first.

On Monday, August 18th, Gov. Nixon {announced}<hyperlink=”https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/following-coordinated-attacks-civilians-and-law-enforcement-governor-nixon-signs”> that he had also ordered {the state national guard}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/6030619/missouri-governor-orders-national-guard-to-ferguson”> to Ferguson, to assist in ""restoring peace and order to this community.""

10) Protests began immediately after Brown's death, and continued throughout the week

Protests erupted in Ferguson as soon as news of Brown's death began to spread. A crowd began to gather around the scene of the shooting almost immediately, while Brown's body was still lying in the road. His body would remain there for {several hours}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-three-minutes--and-two-lives-forever-changed/2014/08/16/f28f5bc0-2588-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html”>. (Ferguson Police Chief Jackson later said that he was ""uncomfortable"" with the amount of time that Brown's body had been left on the ground.) After the demonstration at the scene dispersed, a smaller group of approximately 100 people gathered outside Ferguson police headquarters and continued to protest.

Non-violent protests continued on Sunday, but tensions began to rise between the demonstrators and the police, who had deployed with military equipment and body armor. One {video}<hyperlink=”http://www.colorlines.com/articles/police-officer-calls-ferguson-protestors-animals”>, from CNN, showed an officer shouting at protesters to ""bring it, you fucking animals! Bring it!""

The protests briefly erupted into violence on the night of Sunday, August 10, when a group of people looted and burned a QuikTrip convenience store. A SWAT team used tear gas to disperse the looters, and at least 32 people were arrested.

Protesters remained largely non-violent during the demonstrations from Monday to Thursday, but on Friday night there was more looting. A group of community leaders {organized}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/16/6022277/antonio-french-ferguson-looting”> non-violent protesters to protect the businesses being targeted, and they eventually managed to defuse the situation, and the looters dispersed by about 4am.

On Saturday August 16, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency, and announced that there would be a curfew from midnight to 5 am. Most protesters {obeyed the curfew}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6025931/first-night-of-ferguson-curfew-ends-in-brief-clashes”> over the next two nights, but the the areas did not clear without a certain amount of {turbulence}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6029591/tear-gas-curfew-riot-police-ferguson-sunday”>, with police using tear gas to disperse crowds — in some instances hitting children and journalists — and in response to what they say was violence from protesters.

11) The protests were met with an aggressive police response

Although the protests have been largely peaceful, they have nevertheless drawn an extremely heavy {police response}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/police-ferguson-mo-st-louis-military-militarized-army-tear-gas”>. On Saturday, more than 100 officers from 15 different local departments arrived at the scene, bringing police dogs in an effort to control the crowd. The departments' use of dogs has since been roundly criticized by law enforcement experts, with former Seattle Police Chief Norman Stamper {saying}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002451/ferguson-police-militarization-seattle”> that ""using dogs for crowd control is operationally, substantively, and from an image point-of-view just about the worst thing you can do.""

The aggressiveness of the security operation escalated even further during the following days, and involved the use of {military equipment and tactics}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6003239/police-militarization-in-ferguson”>. Officers deployed through the streets wearing full body armor and gas masks, and carrying rifles. They also used MRAP armored vehicles originally designed to withstand explosions from land mines or IEDs, and a sound weapon called a Long Range Accoustic Device, or LRAD.

Some improvement was seen on Thursday the 14, after Capt. Johnson from the highway patrol was placed in charge of thesecurity operations.

Johnson's tactics emphasized communication over confrontation, and they immediately produced a {much calmer}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6004215/a-considerably-different-atmosphere-in-ferguson-tonight/in/5757650”> atmosphere in Ferguson. On Thursday evening, he marched with protesters, and apologized for the use of tear gas. Later that night, he spoke to the press while {holding a photograph}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5988925/mike-brown-killing-shooting-case-ferguson-police-riots-st-louis#Thursday14”> of Michael Brown — a powerful symbol of respect.",NA,2622,NA,NA
Vox,vox5,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002451/ferguson-police-militarization-seattle,Seattle's former police chief speaks out on Ferguson and police militarization,Amanda Taub,08/14/2014,03/02/2016,"Norman Stamper spent 34 years as a cop, including as the chief of police for Seattle, a job he left one year after the city's police drew international attention for their heavy-handed response to 1999 anti-WTO protests. Now he speaks and writes often about police issues, including the militarization of American police forces, which believes was one of the causes of Seattle's 1999 violence — and now is a major contributor to the ongoing unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. Stamper is also on the advisory board of {Law Enforcement Against Prohibition}<hyperlink=”http://www.leap.cc/about/who-we-are/”>, which advocates for improvements in drug policy.

I spoke with Stamper about the dangerous implications of America's police militarization, what's happening Ferguson, and more.

Amanda Taub: I was hoping to find out a little bit more about your reflections on the police response that was used in Seattle around the 1999 WTO protests, and how you think those kind of insights could apply to what's happening in Ferguson.

Norman Stamper: What happened in Seattle in 1999 was a police overreaction, which I presided over. It was the worst mistake of my career. We used chemical agents, a euphemism for tear gas, against nonviolent and essentially nonthreatening protesters. The natural consequence of which are that we were the catalyst for heightened tension and conflict rather than peacekeepers, or for that matter even peacemakers. It's a lesson, unfortunately, that American law enforcement in general has not learned.

AT: What do you think a preferable course would have been in Seattle, and how would those lessons apply to Ferguson?

NS: From a distance, and without having interviewed anyone in Ferguson or talked with anyone on it, just relying on media reports, I would have to characterize the police response as an overreaction. Had you set out to make matters worse, you couldn't have done a better job.

I'm just very, very disappointed and troubled that lessons that we learned in Seattle have not been embraced by American law enforcement in general, by these police departments that are facing mistrust and distrust in their communities in particular. If anything, the police in America belong to the people, not the other way around. As such, they have a responsibility to forge what I would call an authentic partnership with the community where they reject unilateral decision-making. One partner in a partnership just simply does not make unilateral or arbitrary decisions.

Now there's an exception to that. The exception is where you have an active shooter, where you have a barricaded suspect, where the situation really does call for the military-like response. Those are situations where you don't hold a seminar. You don't do telephonic polling, you take action, and it had better be decisive action or somebody's likely to get hurt or killed. There are those situations that come up in police work. They are far less frequent in occurrence than one would imagine.

Most times you have the luxury of time, but I fear that what's happened over the course of the last 10, 15 years, certainly with the advent of the drug war 40-plus years ago, and then in the aftermath of September 11, we have the police taking, increasingly, a military response to a wide variety of situations, and making matters much worse in the process.

AT: Are there specific things that you've seen police in Ferguson do that you think would be escalating the situation rather than defusing it?

NS: Yes. There's a real place for dogs in police work, but it is not in the context of a nonviolent protest. In fact, using dogs for crowd control is operationally, substantively, and from an image point-of-view just about the worst thing you can do.

We should have learned that lesson as an institution back in the ‘60s in this country. When [Birmingham, Alabama, public safety commissioner] Bull Conner unleashed his police dogs on nonviolent civil rights demonstrators, he was essentially saying to those peacefully protesting Americans, ""You are the enemy.""

Tracking suspects, looking for a missing juvenile, occasionally dealing with a violent suspect, it really does make sense, but it does not make sense at all under these circumstances [in Ferguson]. It's a throwback to an earlier era, and it's a real setback, I think, not just for the image of policing, but for those who are generally committed to forging constructive relationships with the communities that are served by law enforcement.

AT: Are there other tactics that you think were a mistake?

NS: I'm simply not close enough to it. All of my impressions are just that — they are impressions drawn from what I've read and heard. Other than images of nonviolent protesters with dogs straining at their leashes, and attempting to control a crowd, that's been my image of what I've seen.

I would also say that if you're not collaborating with the community in advance of these situations, if you're not forging joint policy-making and decision-making, then you're essentially distancing yourself from the community. You’re isolating yourself from the community when you need to be joining with that community and carving out guidelines or rules of constructive engagement, rather than escalating the potential for and the reality of violence in that relationship.

AT: One thing that has surprised me, looking at some of these images, is what seems to be a really widespread use of rifles. That police are not just out in force with rifles kind of hanging at their side, but that they're actually holding them and pointing them at people.

NS: More likely than not, what you're looking at are the so-called rubber bullets that are fired from what appear to be military rifles. You may be looking at that beanbag technology.

I think it's so important to hold those kinds of weapons in reserve, and use them or show them only when you're dealing with a violent confrontation. Keeping the peace at a demonstration essentially means having police officers in standard everyday uniforms not military garb.

It means doing everything they can to demonstrate the de-escalation tactics and techniques, and not allowing themselves to get hooked emotionally. That requires not just sound policies and procedures and excellent training and supervision, it requires individual maturity on the part of every police officer.

It requires self-confidence — maybe even a dose of courage — to not overreact, but police officers who view themselves as in opposition to their communities have a tendency to view the community as the enemy. In the process they become an occupational force where they are in charge — in the name of control, in the name of public safety, taking actions that actually undermine legitimate control, is foolhardy at best.

AT: Can you talk a little bit about some of the de-escalation tactics that can be used for crowd control when the situation is not yet violent?

NS: First order of business is to make sure that you know, as a law enforcement agency, what your purpose is, and that is to de-escalate. In other words, your mission is not to provoke, it is to de-escalate. It is to ease tension, and if everyone knows that that's the mission that's a huge step forward — a huge advancement, frankly, over where we are in many law enforcement agencies.

It starts with that: what is our purpose? How do we want to be perceived, how do we want to look, and how do we want to act? Everybody within the police department needs to be singing from that same sheet of music, from the chief to the cop on the beat.

Then you want to be very sensitive to how you look. We were described as looking like ninja warriors in Seattle during the WTO [protests]. Now, I'm all for providing protective gear for police officers, and providing basic safety equipment to police officers, if the situation dictates it — using that safety gear. But we tried it out well in advance of what I consider to be a legitimate threat. Now the vast majority of demonstrators were nonviolent and nonthreatening.

That does not mean we didn't have individuals, anarchists by definition, engaged in tactics that were intended to be provocative, because certainly we saw that. If you've got policies and procedures and training and supervision, and individual self-discipline, then you've got the means to isolate that behavior and go after it.

There are many who say we were simply overrun in Seattle, that we didn't have nearly enough police officers on the street during WTO. There's a case to be made for that. I personally believe that's true, but we did overreact. Putting police officers out there in so-called soft uniform or their everyday working uniform is a huge step in the right direction towards de-escalation.

If they're out there in military gear from the beginning that's an act of provocation. We just simply need to use defusing techniques: they are listening, listening, listening. They are speaking softly, not screaming or shrieking or acting out of control.

When cops, just like other human beings, are frightened — and sometimes they are! — there's a tendency to act impulsively. Which is to say: to do exactly the opposite of what they need to be doing.

That's a function of training. That's on individual cops to be sure, but it's also on the organization itself. You should ask, have you trained your officers? Have you helped them develop psychological resilience and the kind of emotional hardiness that is necessary to keep cool and calm even in the face of provocation?

Good cops do know what to do if they are physically threatened, or other innocent citizens are physically threatened. They have a responsibility to meet physical force with force, but not to overreact in anticipation. In a false anticipation of a physical confrontation, they can actually provoke the confrontation. Then they've made a huge mistake strategically and tactically, and one that costs them the trust and support and respect of the community.

Good police officers understand that they need to be hearing what is actually being said, listening actively to the concerns the grievances of the community, paraphrasing it and feeding it back, and saying okay, now what can we do jointly to address these problems? It's a function of collaboration. It's a function of a specific set of skills, and a body of knowledge, and a set of defusing or de-escalation techniques. Good police academies teach it, and they reinforce it constantly.

This is what we need to be doing on a daily basis within law enforcement. It's reasonable to ask where is supervision both in reinforcement of those principles of de-escalation, and reinforcement and enforcement. Holding people accountable for escalating tension is a vital supervisory responsibility. Unfortunately, many supervisors are not trained in that, and the culture tends to reward action. The culture tends to reward decisiveness, and, dare I say, a macho tendency that is so counterproductive. It doesn't mean being soft. It doesn't mean being touchy feely, what it does mean is being sensitive to the situation you're facing, and behaving as a mature and responsible and dignified law enforcement officer.

AT: One of the things that I've been reporting is how much heavy military equipment is being distributed to police departments from the federal government, through the 1033 program and other similar programs, and there doesn't seem to be any accompanying training or oversight that comes with that. I'm trying to get a sense of how the training priorities would need to be for that equipment to be used safely, and whether that's within the capability of small police departments.

NS: Well the first order of business is to ask whether there is a purpose, a domestic law enforcement purpose, for much of that equipment. Often times the answer, if we're going to ask and answer that question honestly, is no. There simply is not. There is a time and a place for military grade equipment in police work.

I responded to the {McDonald's massacre in 1984}<hyperlink=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Ysidro_McDonald%27s_massacre”> as a chief officer in San Diego. Twenty people shot and killed, and the shooter still firing on his fellow citizens and killing children and women and men seemingly at will. Now, had we had an armored personnel carrier rather than a slot sharpshooter many, many yards away, we could have driven that armored vehicle up to, and maybe through the door of the McDonald's, and taken James Huberty out in a way that would have reduced the carnage. That simply didn't happen, because we didn't have that equipment. We eventually did use a sniper who took him out, but maybe we could have saved lives had we had that equipment.

San Diego's a big urban police department. A strong case can be made for having that equipment, for having specialty trained SWAT officers, and for ensuring that they're carefully selected, that they are thoroughly trained, and retrained routinely. When we start parceling out that kind of equipment to small rural law enforcement agencies with no training, with no maintenance responsibility, we're adding to the culpability of at least two if not three levels of government. That would be the feds for doing it in the first place, and the local jurisdictions for receiving it without the concurrent or concomitance training and policies and procedures and inspections and maintenance schedules and the like.

The one thing I would say is to reserve SWAT, reserve that equipment and those tactics for active shooter cases, barricaded suspects, armed and dangerous barricaded suspects with hostages. Do not employ those tactics, that equipment on routine drug raids or warrants service, or any other situation where you don't have what I would consider to be inherently dangerous circumstances.

AT: Would you include crowd control as an inherently dangerous circumstance?

NS: I would not. How often do we hear of political, social upheaval, the demonstrations that accompany the questioning and the concerns about police behavior, that have individuals who are armed within the crowd?

But there's really no room for disagreement about when it's reasonable for officers of the law to take off their badges and start policing anonymously.

There's only one reason to do this: to evade accountability for your actions.

Olson was released shortly after his arrest, as were Reilly and Lowery before him. Ryan Devereaux from The Intercept and Lukas Hermsmeier from the German tabloid Bild were likewise {arrested last night and released without charges}<hyperlink=”https://theintercept.com/2014/08/19/intercept-reporter-detained-covering-ferguson-protests/”> after an overnight stay in jail. In other words, they never should have been arrested in the first place. But nothing's being done to punish the mystery officers who did the arresting.

And what's particularly shocking about this form of evasion is how shallow it is. I can't identify the officers in that photograph. But the faces are clearly visible. The brass at the Ferguson Police Department, Saint Louis County Police Department, and Missouri Highway Patrol should be able toeasily identify the two officers who are out improperly arresting photographers. By the same token, video taken at the Lowery and Reilly arrests should allow for the same to be done in that case.

Policing without a nametag can help you avoid accountability from the press or from citizens, but it can't possibly help you avoid accountability from the bosses.

For that you have to count on an atmosphere of utter impunity. It's a bet many cops operating in Ferguson are making, and it seems to be a winning bet.

In his statement today, President Obama observed that ""there's no excuse for excessive force by police or any action that denies people the right to protest peacefully,"" seeking to tap into the widespread view that some instances of excessive force and denial of first amendment rights have taken place. But Obama did not even vaguely hint that any officer of the law would or should face even the slightest sanction for this inexcusable behavior.

Statements from Governor Jay Nixon and Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson have suffered from the same problem. It is nice, of course, to hear that one's concerns are in some sense shared by the people in power.

But on another level, it would almost be nicer to hear that nobody in charge thinks there's been any misconduct. After all, a lack of police misconduct would be an excellent reason for a lack of any disciplinary action. What we have is something much scarier. Impunity. The sense that misconduct will occur and even be acknowledged without punishment. Of course there are some limits to impunity. Shoot an unarmed teenager in broad daylight in front of witnesses, and there'll be an investigation. But rough up a reporter in a McDonalds for no reason? {Tear-gas an 8 year-old}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6029589/report-8-year-old-hit-with-tear-gas-in-ferguson”>? Parade in front of the cameras with no badges on? No problem.

According to a Pew poll released earlier today, most white people have a good amount of confidence in the investigation into Michael Brown's death. They have the good sense, however, to at least admit to some misgivings about the handling of the protests.

What they ought to see is that the two are hardly so separable. The protests would not be handled so poorly if the officers doing the handling felt that they were accountable for their actions. And a policing culture that doesn't believe cops should be accountable for their actions is not a culture that lends itself to a credible investigation.

Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union tried to produce a comprehensive report on the militarization of America's police forces. But they couldn't. ""The militarization of policing in the United States has occurred with almost no public oversight,"" they {concluded}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf”>. ""Not a single law enforcement agency in this investigation provided records containing all of the information that the ACLU believes is necessary to undertake a thorough examination of police militarization. Some agencies provided records that were nearly totally lacking in important information. Agencies that monitor and provide oversight over the militarization of policing are virtually nonexistent.""

The people charged with protecting us are afraid of what will happen if we know what they're doing.

But the ACLU did discover something worth knowing: after aggregating the reports and data on SWAT raids they could find, they found that the militarized police operations were overwhelmingly aimed at minorities. ""Overall, 42 percent of people impacted by a SWAT deployment to execute a search warrant were Black and 12 percent were Latino. This means that of the people impacted by deployments for warrants, at least 54 percent were minorities."" (For comparison, 72 percent of Americans identified as white in 2010.) The feel of the police presence is much more militarized in minority communities than white communities.

There was a time when crime drove American politics. It was a top issue in 1984, and 1988, and 1992. The infamous Willie Horton ad was about race, but it was also about crime. The crack epidemic was ongoing, and murders were rising, and people were afraid. Washington's answer was cops, prisons and harsher sentencing rules.

Today, the crack epidemic is over, the murder rate has fallen, and Americans feel much safer. But cops, prisons and sentencing rules are coming back as an issue. This time, though, they're not seen as the answer. This time they're the problem.

There is no reason to be subtle on this point: the American criminal justice system is racist.

White and black people are {similarly likely}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/7/1/5850830/war-on-drugs-racist-minorities/in/5452637”> to use drugs, but black people are 3.6 times likelier to be arrested for drug use than white people — a disparity that has grown much worse in recent years. That's because America's criminal justice system is racist.

Until 2010, triggering the mandatory 5-year sentence for cocaine, which is used more often in the white community, required possession of 100 times as much of the drug as for crack, which is used more heavily in the black community. After the 2010 reforms, the disparity was {brought down}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/7/1/5850830/war-on-drugs-racist-minorities/in/5452637”> to a (still huge) 18:1. That's because America's criminal justice system is racist.

Prison sentences for black men {tend}<hyperlink=”http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324432004578304463789858002”> to be almost 20 percent longer than prison sentences for white men who commit similar crimes. That gap actually widened after 2005, when the Supreme Court gave judges more control over sentencing. That's because the criminal justice system is racist.

The result is that more than 60 percent of the people in prison are minorities. The Sentencing Project {estimates}<hyperlink=”http://www.sentencingproject.org/template/page.cfm?id=122”> that among black males in their 30s, more than one in 10 is in prison on any given day. That's because our criminal justice system is racist.

New York's stop-and-frisk program gave police the power to stop people on the street for essentially no reason. More than 80 percent of those {stopped}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/stop-and-frisk-racist-and-ineffective”> were black or Latino (and 88 percent of those stopped were not charged with any crime). That's because our criminal justice system is racist.

African Americans are often hugely underrepresented on police forces. In Ferguson, MO, for instance, the city is 67 percent black, but just {three of its 53 police officers}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/12/5994181/ferguson-is-67-percent-black-and-its-police-force-is-94-percent-white”> are. Incidents of excessive force are commonplace, and increasingly, there's a list of young black men who have died for no other reason than that they ran into a police officer at the wrong time and in the wrong way. The result, as UCLA's Darnell Hunt {says}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/5999929/shooting-mike-brown-final-straw-ferguson-st-louis-missouri/in/5757650”>, is that ""there's a standoff attitude between police and the communities.""

Something very dangerous has happened here: we have let the people and the system that's supposed to protect our communities become a threat to some of them. This is not tenable in a democracy; you cannot have the men and women who carry guns be seen as enemies by so many of the people whose taxes pay their salaries.

We are again entering a period in American politics where the criminal justice is a central issue. But this time, cops and prisons and sentencing laws aren't the answer. They're being seen as the problem. And politicians on both sides of the aisle recognize it.

Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, said in a {statement}<hyperlink=”http://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/media-center/news-releases/mccaskill-in-ferguson-time-to-de-militarize-this-situation”> that ""we need to de-militarize this situation — this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution.""

In a {column}<hyperlink=”http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter”> for Time magazine, Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, wrote, ""given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.""

Prominent politicians ranging from Rand Paul to Paul Ryan to Cory Booker to Dick Durbin to Mike Lee to Barack Obama have started putting forward reforms to the nation's sentencing laws. ""When people are in prison, their skills and social networks deteriorate,"" wrote Ryan in his recent poverty report. ""And when they get out, certain laws and business practices make it even harder for them to find a job. In short, having a prison record makes it very difficult to move up the economic ladder. Minority men are much more likely to serve time and therefore feel the weight of these effects.""

Notably, the press conference where Wilson's name was announced was held at the Quik Trip convenience store that was burned on Sunday night when protests following Brown's death briefly turned violent.

The release of the officer's name has been a core demand of protesters in Ferguson since Brown was killed on Saturday, August 9. Previously, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson had said that he would not reveal the officer's identity unless ordered to do so by a judge, or until official charges were filed. Jackson cited safety concerns as the reason the name was originally withheld, claiming that threats against the officer had been made on social media.

The reason for Jackson's change of heart was not immediately clear. The chief cited ""a lot of sunshine requests,"" but did not take questions from the press.

At the press conference, Ferguson police also distributed documents to reporters which appear to suggest that Michael Brown was the primary suspect in a strong arm robbery of a convenience store that took place immediately before he was killed.

At least {four different police departments}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002291/ferguson-police-st-louis-county-in-charge-jay-nixon-tear-gas-officer-fired”> have been involved. Two of these departments are now pulling out, and the state's governor, Jay Nixon, has said the police will deescalate the level of force. They need to: according to one expert on how to police protests, this isn't just shockingly unjust, it's also utterly incompetent police work.

Jason Fritz, an Iraq war veteran who's now an analyst focusing on policing in conflict zones, was appalled by what he saw in Ferguson, where the shooting of an unarmed black teen, Michael Brown, has sparked days of protests. ""They are taking steps that are going to do nothing but exacerbate the situation,"" Fritz told me over the phone. ""It's not any kind of policing tactic, technique, or strategy that I'm aware of. It goes against against all of the police manuals that I've studied.""

In our conversation, Fritz explained why no police force that's really concerned with protecting the population and preserving the rule of law would ever do what the police in the St. Louis suburb have done.

Zack Beauchamp: You {wrote}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/JasonFritz1/status/499701662706327552”> that the police conduct in Ferguson isn't just immoral and unconstitutional, it's also ineffective. What do you mean by that?

Jason Fritz: In the Ferguson police's perception, they're trying to disrupt a hostile crowd. I'm not saying the people of Ferguson are hostile, just that that's how the police see it. [And when you're responding to a hostile crowd], what the police use is a phalanx system: police with their batons and their shields, like at the [World Trade Organization] protests. They become a physical presence to either block off terrain or push the hostile crowd off of the terrain.

There's a couple levels on which what the Ferguson police are doing, compared to the phalanx, is ineffective. They're not near the protestors, and they're not pushing them off the ground they want to push them off of. They're not doing what they want to do. They're standing back, using this show of force — I guess that's the best way to describe it — and it doesn't work. Obviously, the protestors are still there.

Trying to intimidate the crowds off the street, especially considering that it's a protest against police aggression — well, it's just stupid. It's going to exacerbate the problem.

ZB: Under what circumstances do police normally use things like sniper rifles loaded with rubber bullets and tear gas?

JF: Police will use rubber bullets and tear gas, but in conjunction with a phalanx. They aren't systems to be used on their own. These are supporting tactics they can use, specifically when removing people from a scene or preventing them from getting access to something.

And the sniper rifles: If there is a threat that requires a sniper, the idea that a sniper can place himself on top of a very large vehicle, in the middle of the street — that's not how snipers work. He's clearly exposing himself to fire.

What these snipers are useful for is to get rid of sources of fire with precision shooting. Just by placing themselves there, there's nothing that man is accomplishing other than intimidating the people he's pointing a sniper rifle at.

ZB: From your description, it sounds like they're taking military equipment, and using it to do utterly incompetent police work.

JF: That is exactly correct.

ZB: Where else have you seen police forces behave like this? Everyone seems shocked that this is happening in the United States, but I imagine there's got to be other places in which police forces misuse military weapons against protesters.

JF: The places where you'll see this used are the kinds of countries where they can get away with it. Countries that are known as oppressive states and there's no media to report on the situation.

We saw this, for example, in Tiananmen Square. China has an almost insignificant line between the military and the police. So China and other states like it.

Police forces usually fall into one of two categories, though there some grey situations between the two. You either protect the rule of law and the population, or you're the type of police force that's there to protect the regime. What's happening in Ferguson is what regime protection forces do, not what rule of law police do.

ZB: What normally happens when police use these kind of tactics? How does the situation in Ferguson end?

JF: If the police keep doing what they're doing, I don't see any possibility of them quieting the unrest and forcing the people off the street. Which is not something police should want here in the United States anyway.

There are some cases of police and excessive force like this in Kosovo, and all that did was bring out larger crowds the next day and bring more attention to the situation, until the police position becomes untenable and they actually have to leave the field themselves (to put in military terms).

ZB: How does the media coverage play into this effect? It seems like that has a role in this ""getting more attention effect,"" so is that why police arrested two journalists in a McDonald's last night?

JF: Yes. I don't remember seeing anything like this here in my lifetime in the United States.

Look, if there's no one there to record it, or to watch it, then it didn't happen. If the word doesn't get out about how awful things are, then it doesn't get out. The arrests last night were a blatant run at trying to quiet this thing up.

ZB: Does there even need to be a huge police presence here? Maybe there was when, say, the QuikTrip got burned on Sunday night. But right now, these are mostly nonviolent protests.

JF: That's a very good question. I don't have the answer.

Even with the scattered reports I've heard of the occasional Molotov cocktails, or seeing firearms in the crowd, these are things police are trained to handle. There are certainly phalanx things they can do get these extremely violent people out of the crowd. But if there's just a peaceful protest, I don't see the utility of what they're doing.

If they're thinking about storming something, I get that. But that doesn't seem to be what the protestors are trying to do.

ZB: If you were put in command of the police in Ferguson today, what would you tell them to do?

JF: I would send everyone home.

Have most people go home. Keep a few people around in case there are any actual threats from actions that require law enforcement. But the best thing to do right now is to get everyone off the street. That's the best way for this to resolve itself.

That, of course, should be followed by pretty extensive retraining.

ZB: How much of the police response is that they just have these weapons? Is there some kind of enabling effect: you have these weapons and then they want to use them?

JF: I'm going to guess there must be an element of that. They have the toys, and they just want to play with them, to put it bluntly. They look like guys playing army.

Like the militia members in Eastern Ukraine, they like looking cool and looking like badasses.

ZB: Ferguson is hardly the only place in the United States with serious racial tension, nor is it the only one where the local police is seriously militarized. Have we created, by virtue of the kind of country that we are and the way that we equip our police, the conditions for this to happen again?

JF: Quite likely. There must be thousands of places like Ferguson around the country, and police with that kind of mentality. And the equipment's easier to get right now.

Vox,vox17,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/6029141/why-ferguson-government-is-so-white,White political domination of Ferguson is doomed,Matthew Yglesias,08/18/2014,03/07/2016,"The events of August 2014 in Ferguson, MO are primarily important not because they are so unusual, but because the backdrop is in most respects so banal. From the {excessive militarization of the local police forces}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6003239/police-militarization-in-ferguson”> to the {structural racism of the criminal justice system}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002175/its-not-just-ferguson-americas-criminal-justice-system-is-racist”>, we are dealing primarily with problems that are all too familiar.

But there is one exception. In Ferguson — unlike in every state and most towns in the country — African-Americans are not a minority. The town is 67 percent black, it just happens to {have a government that's overwhelmingly dominated by whites}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6003793/why-is-fergusons-local-government-so-white/in/5757650”> including the mayor, the police chief, the school board, and the bulk of the city council. And while many of the deeper issues in American society exposed this month are unlikely to be resolved any time soon, this one is. The town's white power structure is almost certainly doomed.

Jeff Smith, a professor at the New School in New York who until recently served as a State Senator from the St. Louis area recently explained {how whites have maintained their grip}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/opinion/in-ferguson-black-town-white-power.html?_r=0”> on North County towns with black majorities:

Many North County towns — and inner-ring suburbs nationally — resemble Ferguson. Longtime white residents have consolidated power, continuing to dominate the City Councils and school boards despite sweeping demographic change. They have retained control of patronage jobs and municipal contracts awarded to allies.

The North County Labor Club, whose overwhelmingly white constituent unions (plumbers, pipe fitters, electrical workers, sprinkler fitters) have benefited from these arrangements, operates a potent voter-turnout operation that backs white candidates over black upstarts. The more municipal contracts an organization receives, the more generously it can fund re-election campaigns. Construction, waste and other long-term contracts with private firms have traditionally excluded blacks from the ownership side and, usually, the work force as well.

These kind of tactics depend crucially on an atmosphere of public apathy and mass indifference to local politics. Americans are asked to vote in a baffling array of elections (in addition to a school board and a town council, a Ferguson resident must vote for a district attorney, a county executive, a county council, two state legislators, a governor, a lieutenant governor, an attorney general, a secretary of state, a state auditor, a state treasurer, two US Senators, one member of the US House of Representatives, and a bunch of judges) and the level of information and enthusiasm about most of them is low.

As Zachary Roth has written, typically, {fewer than 15 percent of eligible voters}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ferguson-lack-diversity-goes-way-beyond-its-cops?cid=sm_m_main_1_20140814_29785586”> cast ballots in municipal elections in Ferguson. Ian Milhiser observes that the low turnout is in part a consequence of the city {choosing to hold municipal elections in April of odd-numbered years}<hyperlink=”http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/18/3472278/this-is-the-most-important-reform-ferguson-can-enact-to-prevent-another-standoff/”>.

That makes patronage-based get-out-the-vote campaigns incredibly effective in controlling the levers of power. But if the past couple of weeks have done anything, they've shattered those background conditions of indifference. Nobody who lives in the area could possibly think that local government doesn't matter any more, and a community capable of organizing nightly protest marches should have relatively little trouble getting people to come out and vote. And if Ferguson's African-American residents do vote, they should have relatively little trouble installing a government that hears their concerns and leans against the systemic inequities in the American criminal justice system.

In other words, the town at the center of this drama may well see a real improvement in political representation. The deeper problem is going to lie elsewhere — in the many towns large and small where people of color are a minority of eligible voters and the basis of white political power is firmer.",NA,351,NA,NA

{Darnell Hunt}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/darnell_hunt”>, UCLA professor and director of the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, has been studying these types of events for decades — going back to {the Los Angeles riots of 1992}<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VyQcBBNhdM”>, which followed the videotaped beating of Rodney King. I spoke with Hunt by phone on Wednesday to get his take on what's now happening in Ferguson.

German Lopez: What leads to events like the protests in Ferguson?

Darnell Hunt: An event like Michael Brown's shooting does trigger it, but it's typically the pressure or tension that has been building up for years prior to the event that is the ultimate cause. There's usually a range of different factors that are involved that motivate people to essentially take to the streets.

Although black people made up 67 percent of Ferguson's population in 2013, they made up more than 93 percent of arrests carried out by Ferguson Police that same year.

My understanding of Ferguson is that there have been longstanding issues with the police, which is pretty typical of largely minority communities and their relationships with police forces. African Americans in particular are {pretty severely underrepresented among police officers}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/12/5994181/ferguson-is-67-percent-black-and-its-police-force-is-94-percent-white/in/5757650”>, so there's a standoff attitude between police and the communities.

There's other factors as well. This tragic incident comes on the heels of what happened with Trayvon Martin and some of the other high-profile cases in recent years. These cases really drove home the point for people in these communities that black life is not considered as sacred as it should be.

So people are taking to the streets to protest the way this all happened.

In some ways, it parallels what led to {the Los Angeles riots}<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VyQcBBNhdM”>. The Rodney King beating and the verdict that exonerated the officers for the most part triggered it, but broader factors played a role.

GL: If you look at the past year, there's a lot of news coverage about racial tensions between the criminal justice system and minority communities. Do you think the buildup of these cases in our collective consciousness is one of the causes of protests?

DH: Yes.

The most obvious and immediate cause was what happened with Michael Brown. But prior to that, you have all these other events going on that create this widespread awareness that there are injustices that are aimed particularly at African American male youth.

If you think about the incidents in Florida — not just Trayvon Martin, but incidents like {the killing of teenager Jordan Davis}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/15/justice/florida-loud-music-trial/”> as well — they didn't fault the police directly, but they represent this whole idea that black male youth constantly represent a threat to police and deadly force can be used to keep them in check, even if they're unarmed.

The events in Missouri speak to that. All these cases contributed to the buildup of tensions. The shooting of Michael Brown was the final straw for people in Ferguson.

GL: We seem to hear more and more about these sorts of incidents. Why do you think that is? Is it increased media awareness, or are they happening more often?

DH: It's hard to say definitively.

Rewinding back 20-plus years, what was significant about the Rodney King case is it happened at the beginning of the video camera era in which the typical person might have a video camera and capture what was happening. What happened to Rodney King wasn't unusual — in the sense that people in black communities have been complaining for years about police profiling and brutality. What was significant about Rodney King is it was captured on video, and the whole world saw it. Most people who saw the videotape assumed that the officers were going to be found guilty of something.

That was what was new about it: the video was available, a local TV station picked it up, and it went viral. In that sense, media coverage and the availability of images showing what's happened definitely plays a role. It convinces people it actually happened, as opposed to having to wonder whether personal accounts of what happened are accurate.

Whether or not we could argue that what's happening lately is more an artifact of the media being engaged with this topic or theme, I'm not sure. I think there is something happening socially as it relates to black male youth and the way they've been vilified over the past few decades through the {war on drugs}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/7/27/5940783/prohibition-marijuana-legalization-pot-weed-racism-new-york-times”> and war on crime. There's a real sense they're seen as the prototypical threat that needs to be contained. That's real, not just a product of media coverage.

But when you combine those trends with more availability of media and news through the internet, you have the perfect storm. People are acutely aware of what's happening, and every injustice becomes another block in this edifice of understanding what's so wrong in America as it relates to race.

GL: With all those factors building up, do you think people are reaching a boiling point when it comes to racial disparities in the criminal justice system?

DH: I think people are getting fed up. In a place like Ferguson, it hit close to home. It was one of their own. It was the local police, which had issues for years.

Who knows how it will this all play out? There haven't yet been the same kinds of protests in other parts of the country that you see around St. Louis.

That said, the Trayvon Martin incident led to protests around the country. Not only was this something that affected people across the country, but other people realized that the fate of Trayvon was possibly the fate of their own sons.

I think most people around the country — African Americans in particular — empathize with the people of Ferguson and the family of Michael Brown. They understand this is something that all black people have to fear — being profiled and possibly killed in a very unjust way.

GL: Do you think these events will lead to a new movement across the country?

DH: It's hard to say whether this is a continuation of growing resentment or if this a different phase. We have a black president who himself has articulated what these events show about where we are as a nation, and he says it's gotten better.

But in some ways I would argue things are getting worse, because the disparities continue and some have gotten worse since the Great Recession.

The racial disparities in incarceration are still huge. I know the Obama administration reduced {disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentencing}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/7/27/5940783/prohibition-marijuana-legalization-pot-weed-racism-new-york-times”> to level the playing field a little bit in terms of incarceration.

But the disparities are still real and huge.

GL: Do you think one of the problems is that even though Americans recognize all these issues, not much happens to fix them?

DH: That's a huge part of it. What will ultimately shape the way this unfolds is what the response will be to the protests and the incident. Will justice be served? Will real attempts be made to alter the relationship between the police and the community?

Ultimately, that's what happened in Los Angeles. We're far from a perfect relationship between LAPD and local communities. But {surveys}<hyperlink=”http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/22/local/me-poll22”> from right before the 20th anniversary of the LA riots showed that police-community relationships have improved. Most people in Los Angeles think LAPD is doing a better job. Black people tend to be the least trusting, but their level of trust is higher than it was 20 years ago.

That's due to a lot of turmoil the LAPD went through. They went through a handful of police chiefs. They had changes in the police commission. They tried to move more toward community policing models.

Again, the LAPD is not perfect; there's still issues — {the Christopher Dorner case}<hyperlink=”http://graphics.latimes.com/christopher-dorner-manhunt/”> brought up some of those issues — but it's better than it was. For the most part, you don't hear police chiefs saying things like {Daryl Gates}<hyperlink=”http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/18/opinion/la-oe-domanick18-2010apr18”> did when he was chief during the Rodney King beating, basically vilifying black communities.

The same kind of changes have to happen in Ferguson as well for there to be any real healing.

GL: Do you think economic factors have played a role as well?

DH: Absolutely. The economic disparities are huge. If you look at {who was affected by the recession}<hyperlink=”http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/07/26/wealth-gaps-rise-to-record-highs-between-whites-blacks-hispanics/”>, minorities were hit particularly hard. It contributes to the sense that the system is stacked against minorities.

GL: It's easy for some people to see some of the bad events in these protests, like the looting of a convenience store, and blame the protests on immoral behavior. Do you think that ignores the history behind these issues?

Darnell Hunt: Yes.

President George H.W. Bush called the Los Angeles riots ""the brutality of a mob, pure and simple."" That minimized the role the economy and the government played in the crisis. It was taken as a slap in the face by most people here in Los Angeles who felt passionately about the injustice of the day.

That kind of response just fans the fires. It doesn't extend the olive branch to those in the community who feel alienated and disaffected. You have to go beyond the symptoms and look at the causes, and the causes run quite deep.

Brown's mother, Leslie McSpadden, said that he was funny and could make people laugh. He graduated from high school in the spring, and was headed to college to pursue a career in heating and cooling engineering. Monday would have been his first day.

Brown was One Of The Good Ones. But laying all this out, explaining all the ways in which he didn't deserve to die like a dog in the street, is in itself disgraceful. Arguing whether Brown was a good kid or not is functionally arguing over whether he specifically deserved to die, a way of acknowledging that some black men ought to be executed.

During Friday's press conference, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson tried to sow doubt that Brown really was One Of The Good Ones. He released stills from a ""strong-arm robbery"" showing someone who might be Brown grabbing a convenience-store clerk by his collar and throwing him backwards. The Good Ones don't rob convenience stores. The Good Ones don't assault clerks.

But this is a sick conversation. The Good Ones don't deserve to be shot when they're surrendering. But neither does anyone else.

It doesn't matter that Michael Brown was starting college on Monday. And it doesn't matter if he was involved in a robbery on Saturday. What matters is the precise circumstances in which Officer Darren Wilson shot Brown.

Constitutionally, there are {two circumstances}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/5994305/michael-brown-case-investigation-legal-police-kill-force-murder”> in which a cop is allowed to shoot: if he believes his life — or the life of another innocent party — is in danger, or if a violent felon is escaping.

At the core of the Brown investigation are {two competing stories}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-shooting-facts-details”>: Darren Wilson, the police officer, says Brown assaulted him in his car and tried to grab his gun.

Dorian Johnson, the eyewitness and Brown's friend, says that Wilson grabbed Brown, Brown fled, Wilson shot, and then — crucially — Brown stopped and put his hands in the air, but Wilson kept shooting.

If Brown assaulted Wilson and tried to grab his gun, and Wilson believed that his life or the life of others was threatened, then Wilson could have been legally justified in using deadly force at that moment. But Brown was shot multiple times, and the final shots, according to eyewitnesses, were fired after Brown surrendered with his hands up and told Wilson that he was unarmed. If Brown surrendered, the threat was neutralized, and Wilson shot him down anyway, then the shooting was illegal whether or not Brown had previously committed a violent crime.

This case is not about whether Michael Brown was One Of The Good Ones. It's not even about whether he robbed a convenience store. The penalty for stealing cigars from a convenience store is not death. This case is about whether Wilson was legally justified in shooting Michael Brown.

It is a powerful thing to give some men and women guns and charge them with protecting the peace. It is a powerful thing because it can so easily, and so quickly, become a dangerous thing. As a society, we strictly regulate when police officers can use deadly force. The question here is whether those rules were followed, not what kind of kid Michael Brown was.

Update: Later on Friday afternoon, the Ferguson Police Department {clarified}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6007055/mike-brown-robbery-shooting-unrelated”> that Brown was stopped because he was jaywalking, not because he was thought to have been involved in a robbery. So, as far as we know, Darren Wilson had no reason to believe Brown was involved in any kind of violent crime at all. Which makes the Ferguson PD's decision to release the robbery photos today, absent this context, look even more like an attempt to sow doubts about Brown's character.",NA,7561,NA,NA

But what we all know, as Americans who are familiar with our country's problems as well as its virtues, is that the truth is a lot uglier in Ferguson. Now this Iraqi Kurd knows it too.

Meanwhile, at least 78 people were arrested on Monday night

The list above only covers journalists. According to {arrest data obtained}<hyperlink=”http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/78-arrested-overnight-most-missouri-arrest-records-show-n184036”> from NBC News, some 78 people in total were arrested on Monday, August 18.

Those arrest records showed that just 18 of those people were from outside Missouri — contradicting earlier statements from authorities that largely blamed out-of-state protesters for causing problems.

That was confirmed again by data released this evening from the St. Louis County police department, who reported that they had arrested 52 people in Ferguson over the same time period. (Presumably this is just a subset of all arrests in Ferguson, as there are multiple police departments there.)

Of those, 14 arrestees were from out of state — and four of those were from neighboring Illinois. Here's a more precise breakdown:

In-state arrestees:

Bel-Ridge, MO (1) 
City of St. Louis, MO (15) 
Creve Coeur, MO (1)
Ferguson, MO (4)
Flordell Hills, MO (1) 
Florissant, MO (7)

Maryland (1)

Khamenei is a odd person to be criticizing violent police crackdowns on peaceful protestors. In June 2009, his government did exactly that after conservative presidential candidate Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won reelection in a close vote amid heavy allegations of fraud. {Hundreds of thousands of people}<hyperlink=”http://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/green-movement”> who supported reformist candidate Mir Hussein Mousavi protested, especially in Tehran, but were suppressed violently — and in some cases fatally — by police and security forces.

This movement, collectively called the Green Movement, met with brutal repression from Iranian police and paramilitary operatives, called the basij, loyal to the regime. The New Yorker's John Lee Anderson {breaks down}<hyperlink=”http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/16/after-the-crackdown”> the human toll:
Riot police and Basij, armed with knives and guns, were sent into the streets to attack the protesters. Between forty and eighty people were killed, Mousavi's nephew among them, and thousands were arrested.
In show trials held in August, more than a hundred detainees were paraded in court, many of them thin and pale and clearly terrified; according to Amnesty International, many detainees had been beaten, tortured, and raped by guards and interrogators, often at secret detention centers. Several ""confessed"" to an improbable range of political crimes, including treason.
The Iranian government itself does not treat minorities particularly well. Take Iran's Kurds, for example. About 6.5 million Kurds live in western Iran, but not in peace. A 2009 Human Rights Watch report {documents}<hyperlink=”https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/iran0109_web.pdf”> widespread restrictions on Kurdish free speech (like banning books), denial of due process rights to Kurds suspected of political dissidence, and torture of Kurdish detainees. Dozens of Kurds {are on death row}<hyperlink=”https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2013/09/iran-halt-execution-four-kurds-death-row/”>, often convicted of political offenses.
But here's the catch: Khamenei, awful as he may be, still has a point about Ferguson. Despite the staggering hypocrisy of his tweet, he's correct that the police conduct in Ferguson is unconscionable and racist. The United States doesn't, or shouldn't, want human rights-abusing enemies to be able to point to things like this to whitewash their own abuses.
There are earlier echoes of this. During the Cold War, American presidents were worried that Jim Crow and America's brutal response to the civil rights movement were undermining America's image abroad. That wasn't the first, second, third, or twentieth reason any American leader should have cared about equal rights for their citizens. But it'd be good if the police in Ferguson, and others like them around the country, discovered a little bit of that old attention to how violent American racism looks around the world.",NA,527,NA,NA

The Washington Post is one of the most respected media outlets in the world (full disclosure: it is also my former employer), and its many reporters can trust that this stature will, if nothing else, keep them safe. It was rightly treated as major international news when Rezaian and his wife were arrested by Iranian authorities. So what does it say that the second Post reporter to be arrested was picked up by heavily armed police in a midwestern town in the US?

One major difference, of course, is that Lowery was quickly released, whereas Rezaian has been detained now for weeks. Jason is a friend, and I worry about him and his wife constantly in a way that I would not worry about Lowery.

Underrepresentation of minority communities is government is a problem nationwide: While African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Americans make up 13.2 percent, 17.1 percent, and 5.3 percent of the United States, respectively, they only make up 8.1 percent, 6.8 percent, and 2.4 percent of {Congress}<hyperlink=”http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42964.pdf”>.

Using a 2001 data set, Masket plotted the percentage of the population that was African-American in cities with at least 10,000 residents against the percentage of their city councils that was. There is a strong relationship between the two, as one would expect. African-Americans are underrepresented in general — the trend line would predict that a 50 percent black city would have a 43 percent black city council — but Ferguson is a huge outlier:

Now, the demographics of both Ferguson and its city council have changed since this data was collected.

But black residents are still wildly underrepresented, and Masket finds that observable factors like having off-cycle, nonpartisan elections or being (arguably) in the South can't entirely explain the representation gap. He concludes: ""There are national problems, but even given that, Ferguson’s illnesses appear to be unusually acute.""

But this week, the timing of Let's Be Cops's release yesterday seemed terrible.

It's not just that Let's Be Cops has that title on a week when events in Ferguson, Missouri, bring to mind not low-level police officers trying to bring down petty criminals but, instead, officers armed with military-grade weaponry confronting protesters (or, worse, the unknown officer who sparked the incident by killing the unarmed {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5993609/michael-brown-ferguson-shooting-protests-riots-police-violence-unarmed”>). It's that the whole release strategy behind the modern movie machine involves blanketing the world with marketing, which results in the following bit of awful incongruity on Twitter last night, as pointed out by my friend and former A.V. Club colleague Erik Adams.

[tweetbegin 499751497224429568 tweetend]


There probably wasn't much 20th Century Fox could do about the film's release. The protests (and overcompensating response to said protests) didn't begin in earnest until Monday night, only a little over 24 hours before Let's Be Cops began midnight screenings. And {early box office returns}<hyperlink=”http://deadline.com/2014/08/lets-be-cops-opens-to-1-2m-in-late-night-tuesday-818733/”> suggest the movie will do fine, if not be a massive hit. It's a comedy, smartly released at a time when there aren't a lot of comedies, and Fox could probably scale back its marketing efforts (which it will almost certainly have to after last night's events in Ferguson) and not lose too many ticket sales because of that counterprogramming.

But the terrible timing of Let's Be Cops points to a larger problem in the ways Hollywood tells stories about the police: though the film and television industries continue to tell stories about cops by the boatload, those stories have done a horrible job of evolving to reflect the ways the militarization of police forces can create rifts between officers and the people they're ostensibly protecting.

How we think about crime

To be sure, art usually reflects life, and it can take time for these sorts of things to filter their way into the public consciousness. The horrifying night-vision images of Wednesday's confrontation in Ferguson will eventually be reflected somewhere in something Hollywood produces, because they have been so widely spread and commented upon.

But movies and TV shows about police officers have long been one of the foremost ways Americans process and reflect upon their feelings about both crime and efforts to stop that crime. We might have more stories about cops than ever, but they seem largely unable or unwilling to think about the issues that have reached a crisis point in Ferguson.

It seems silly today, but at the time of its debut in 1968, The Mod Squad was widely acclaimed for helping make sense out of things like the era's youth culture and the struggles of both women and people of color to find equality in the workplace. Growing anxiety about violent crime in the ‘70s found its expression in films like The French Connection and Dirty Harry, while the 1980s' Hill Street Blues is one of the smartest, most compassionate TV shows ever made and an earnest plea for understanding and empathy about the plight of American inner cities that also managed to become a top 30 Nielsen hit.

Consider, also, the wave of buddy cop movies that arrived in the ‘80s, many of which had surprisingly thoughtful attempts to deal with issues like racial relations (48 Hours) or mental health (Lethal Weapon) at or near their cores. Those attempts can seem cloying now, but at the time, they were revolutionary. Even ersatz ‘90s cop show The X-Files reflected that era's growing suspicion of government action, to say nothing of how Law & Order directly confronted the issues of the day.

If there's a demarcating line here, it's likely the debut of CSI in 2000. The CBS series was too big to ignore, meaning that essentially every cop show on TV had to grapple with it in some way. Most shows chose to just copy it. Oddly enough, CSI is, at least metaphorically, about the growing reliance of police departments on advanced technology that cuts said departments off from the people they're meant to protect. Hill Street and its descendants built out whole universes around their central police precincts. In contrast, CSI's Las Vegas was divided between the police officers and their cool toys and a city full of cardboard cutouts who existed mostly to kill or be killed.

There's nothing inherently wrong with this approach. Early CSIwas a lot of fun, and even in its dotage, the show is capable of a handful of solid episodes per season. There have always been straightforward ""cops vs. robbers"" stories, and they can be good fun. But what happens when this is the only story viewers get told?

Shiny new toys

The CSI approach rapidly became essentially the only approach TV had for telling stories about police officers, while movies about cops were increasingly relegated to the sidelines in favor of big budget extravaganzas. And when the primary story being told about police officers is that all of their new toys are fantastic and they're living in a crime wave straight out of viewers' worst nightmares, it sends subconscious assumptions that are easy to filter out into reality.

There are a couple of major exceptions to the CSI rule, but neither has proved as fruitful as that show in terms of shifting the TV landscape. The Wire is one of the greatest television shows ever made, a beautiful, bruising, realistic look at all sides of the war on drugs and the death of the American city that has immense empathy for every character within its universe. But it's also sui generis, and therefore much too hard for other shows to copy (to say nothing of how it was never a massive hit and teetered on the brink of cancellation for its entire run).

More successful in this regard was The Shield, which looked at the uneasy relationship Americans often have with cops who break the law but, nonetheless, get results — in both fiction and reality. In some ways, that show was a very delayed response to the Rodney King beating and the culture of corruption within the Los Angeles Police Department that was made glaringly public after that incident. But in other ways, it was also (inadvertently) the perfect post-September 11 show, about how easy it is to cross moral lines when working to fight crime. If Hollywood is ever going to deal with the militarization of police forces, The Shield's creator, Shawn Ryan, who has also done several solid military series (The Unit, Last Resort), would be a good choice to consider those questions.

But if you're looking for the TV show or movie that directly deals with these issues, it doesn't exist yet. Hollywood can occasionally be a little slow at dealing with social issues, but this creeping militarization has been going on for a while, with little on TV to reflect either the simple fact of its existence or the moral and ethical issues that go along with it. Indeed, the upcoming CBS show Battle Creek is a series that feels unstuck in time, dealing as it does with an underfunded police department that can't get its hands on good equipment. Real world police departments are getting more and more advanced technology; fictional ones are devolving.

Obliterating the stakes

To some degree, that has something to do with the fact that stories about police officers usually have police officers as protagonists. It's much easier to level the playing field between protagonist and antagonist when the hero is a beat cop up against a serial killer than it is when the hero can ride a tank into battle with civilians. Good storytelling demands dramatic stakes, and tanks tend to skew that equation.

Consider, for instance, the Fox summer series Gang Related, which did deal with a militarized police department, but set it up against a gang that also possessed such technology, creating a show where open war essentially raged on the streets of Los Angeles. That might be fun for an action show, but it doesn't reflect the images from Ferguson, where the conflict was decidedly imbalanced.

We need more TV shows and movies that reflect the world we're seeing in news reports from Ferguson, and we need ones that do so directly. Fiction helps us process and make sense of the world, and there's room in the images out of Ferguson (and so many other cities) for an earnest and nuanced consideration of what happens when police officers are given military-grade weaponry. That story could be told from the point-of-view of cops or ordinary citizens or even criminals. But it's there to be told, and it too rarely is — certainly not in projects like Let's Be Cops.

And if nothing else, it's time for the CSI template to gain that nuance. There are times when technology is helpful in solving crime (especially in a lab setting), but it's not a de facto good for police departments around the country. To suggest otherwise does a disservice to viewers and storytelling.",NA,49,NA,NA

Tear gas is effective at dispersing crowds because its key ingredient — called 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile — {triggers the activation of huge numbers of pain receptors}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6001995/ferguson-missouri-tear-gas-painful”> in the eyes, as well as irritation in the throat and difficulty breathing. This causes a person's eyes to start tearing and closing involuntarily, effectively incapacitating that person within seconds.

A large number of {people in Ferguson}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6025917/police-protesters-ferguson/in/5757650”> — including an {eight year-old boy}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6029589/report-8-year-old-hit-with-tear-gas-in-ferguson/in/5757650”> and {a group of journalists}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/6001193/al-jazeera-journalists-teargassed-by-security-forces-in-ferguson”> — have suffered from these symptoms, and there are various photos showing them using a number of different remedies (such as milk and water) to treat tear-gas exposure.

But the unfortunate truth is that effectively treating exposure to tear gas is very difficult, and the best protections and remedies are solely in the hands of medical professionals. Even worse, we still know virtually nothing about the gas' long-term effects. Here's a rundown of what researchers have discovered about dealing with the effects of tear gas:

1) Most makeshift masks don't work perfectly

The {most effective defense}<hyperlink=”http://facingteargas.org/bp/70/if-youve-been-gassed”> against tear gas is a gas mask. But gas masks and filters aren't easily available to civilians.

Some protestors have often used a pair of goggles and a wet bandana worn over the mouth to minimize the tear gas' effects on the respiratory system (historically, protesters have usedbandanas soaked in lemon juice, cider vinegar, Coca-Cola, or other acidic solutions, though {it's not proven}<hyperlink=”http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/02/numb_and_coke.html”> that this is more effective). These measures won't fully protect someone by any means, but they can temporarily reduce the amount of tear gas entering the body, giving a person a few extra moments to escape.

2) The best step is usually to leave the area

Once someone has been exposed to tear gas — whether wearing protection or not — the best thing to do is to get out of the gas-filled area as soon as possible. Simultaneously, {experts recommend}<hyperlink=”http://facingteargas.org/bp/70/if-youve-been-gassed”> that victims cough, spit, and blow their noses in an attempt to get as much of the chemical out of their bodies as soon as possible.

People with conditions that make them especially vulnerable to tear gas — such as asthma, other respiratory diseases, or immune system disorders — as well as infants and the elderly should seek professional medical help immediately.

3) Victims' eyes need to be washed out thoroughly

Once in a secure location, it's crucial for anyone exposed to tear gas to wash out their eyes thoroughly until the symptoms begin to subside. If the person is wearing contacts, they need to be removed and thrown away.

Protestors in Ferguson have sometimes been using milk as a rinse — and victims of tear gas in other protests around the world have used a variety of remedies, such as {lemon juice}<hyperlink=”http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tear-gas-and-lemon-juice-in-the-battle-for-taksim-square-525101”> or a mix of {Maalox (or other antacid) and water}<hyperlink=”http://www.rawstory.com/2011/10/maalox-and-water-solution-used-as-anti-tear-gas-remedy-by-protesters/”>. But these treatments haven't been clinically tested, so it's hard to say if they're better than water, which is still the rinse {proven most effective}<hyperlink=”http://columbia.library.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/wvn/2012/00000009/00000003/art00002?token=00511dc2482dd44d4ea91405847447b496e2f7831446f7c4779474833757e6f4f2858592f3f3b5723”> in clinical trials.

(There is also a chemical called diphoterine that {has been shown}<hyperlink=”http://www.jem-journal.com/article/S0736-4679(05)00064-8/abstract”> to be a more effective rinse and is sometimes used in emergency rooms, but it's not widely available apart from medical supply companies.)

4) Longer-term care is often necessary

Apart from tearing and involuntarily blinking, tear gas also causes a longer-term inflammatory response in a person's eyes and skin — and this can take a few days to subside. Initially, it's recommended that victims take cold showers, because warm water can open up a person's pores, allowing further tear gas particles to enter.

Afterward, any piece of clothing or object that was exposed to the tear gas needs to be thoroughly washed or thrown away. Structures hit by tear gas need to be similarly decontaminated of residue, a process that's {especially difficult}<hyperlink=”http://www.cmmonline.com/articles/231761-a-plan-for-removing-tear-gas-residue”> if tear gas has been deployed indoors.

Rubber bullets can be dangerous and harmful. The small body of research that has looked at the injuries they cause has routinely found a high number of serious injuries and a small number of deaths.

The British Journal of Surgery {published}<hyperlink=”http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bjs.1800620613/abstract”> the first report on rubber bullets in 1975, shortly after the British Army introduced the new technology in Northern Ireland in 1970.

They looked at the injuries caused to 90 patients that the new rubber bullets struck. These are all people who went to seek health care services — so this does leave out those who may have been struck but did not suffer significant injury. Of the 90 patients studied, the researchers found that 40 patients required hospital admission. Seventeen of those admitted were left ""with permanent disabilities or disfigurements."" One person died.

""Despite the low mortality, the rubber bullet cannot be considered completely safe in its present form,"" the authors of that study warned. ""This is chiefly a consequence of its inaccuracy [in being shot].""

Rubber bullets have {changed and evolved}<hyperlink=”http://bmhlibrary.info/19696582.pdf”> since the 1970s, but the most recent research (which, unfortunately, is now 14 years old) doesn't suggest they have become any less dangerous.

Israeli researchers {looked at}<hyperlink=”http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(02)08708-1/abstract”> injuries caused by rubber bullets during the Israeli-Arab conflict in the fall of 2000. Their study included 151 patients who had a combined 201 injuries caused by rubber bullets. The injuries appeared all over the patients' bodies, a random distribution that — as the British researchers warned in the 1970s — indicated a lack of accuracy in shooting.

Of the 151 rubber-bullet patients who were seen, 68 people had to be admitted to the hospital for treatment. Eleven of them underwent surgery that required general anesthesia. Three, two of whom were struck somewhere in the face, ultimately died as a result of their injuries.

""This type of inaccurate ammunition … makes it difficult or impossible to avoid severe injuries to vulnerable body regions such as the head, neck, and upper torso, leading to substantial mortality, morbidity, and disability,"" the authors of that Lancet study wrote.

The most recent research on rubber bullet injuries was published in 2010. In the journal Injury, French researchers {examined}<hyperlink=”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19552903”> six patients who were treated for rubber bullet related trauma since 2000 (rubber bullet guns are marketed to European Union citizens as self-defense weapons).

The professors — Christian Davenport, Sarah Soule, and David Armstrong — took a database of 15,000 American protests from 1960 to 1990 and used newspaper reports to identify which protests had at least some black protesters. After controlling for some confounding variables, they compared those protests to ones with no black protesters.

The first major finding is that police were more like to show up when black people were in the crowd. This chart shows how that looks over time:

Then, the researchers looked only at protests where police showed up, comparing policed protests with some black protesters with those where were none. Davenport, Soule, and Armstrong found that ""once police are present, they are more likely to make arrests, use force and violence, and use force and violence in combination with arrests at African American protest events.""

We've spent the past two decades militarizing our police forces to respond to problems that never materialized.

The two problems were the drug-fueled crime wave of the '70s and '80s and the post-9/11 fear that local police forces would soon be overwhelmed with local terrorist plots. In America, big problems require big guns, and so one response to these fears was the so-called ""1033 program"", where the Department of Defense distributed surplus military equipment to local police forces. As Amanda Taub {explains}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6003239/police-militarization-in-ferguson”>:

The 1033 program's roots lie in the drug war — hence the counter-narcotics impetus. It was originally created in 1990, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, which authorized the Pentagon to transfer military equipment to local law enforcement if it was ""suitable for use in counter-drug activities."" In the wake of the September 11th attacks, the program's focus has expanded to include counter-terrorism activities as well.

While the 1033 program's intent may have been to equip specialized units for extreme, dangerous situations, fighting al-Qaeda sleeper cells or powerful drug cartels, the effect has been to incorporate SWAT-style raids into ordinary police operations. That includes, but is certainly not limited to, the serving of search warrants. This may partly be because the program requires that all equipment issued through the 1033 program be used within one year of the date it is granted. That means that if police departments want to keep their new gear, they can't wait for a rare emergency like an active shooter or hostage situation in order to use it.

Read those last few sentences carefully. Police get all this equipment and, as a condition of the program, need to use it within a year. What they don't get is training. The ACLU's Kara Dansky, who authored an {important report}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/feature/war-comes-home?redirect=war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing”> on police militarization, told Vox she was ""not aware of any training that the government provides in terms of use of the equipment,"" or of ""any oversight in terms of safeguards regarding the use of the equipment by the Defense Department.""

So police have all this military equipment, very little training on how to use it, and a requirement that they deploy it within a year. But the problems they were supposed to use the equipment against have either eased or vanished.

The crime wave that ripped through the country in the '70s and '80s broke in the '90s and continued to fall through the Aughts.

""Police militarization was a mistake,"" concludes Drum. ""You can argue that perhaps we didn't know that at the time. No one knew in 1990 that crime was about to begin a dramatic long-term decline, and no one knew in 2001 that domestic terrorism would never become a serious threat. But we know now. There's no longer even a thin excuse for arming our police forces this way.""",NA,5497,NA,NA

University of South Carolina's Robert Brame, University of Albany's Shawn Bushway, University of Maryland - College Park's Ray Paternoster, and University of North Carolina - Charlotte's Michael Turner estimated ""cumulative arrest prevalence"" by race and gender using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). They focused on the 1997 cohort, born {between 1980 and 1984}<hyperlink=”http://www.bls.gov/nls/”>. The respondents were surveyed at ages 18 and 23, which would have been between 1998-2002 and 2003-2007, respectively.

The authors group together all non-black, non-Hispanic people, a category that includes white, mixed race, Asian-American, and American Indian people. Disturbingly, if not surprisingly, black men are significantly more likely to have been arrested at both age 18 and age 23 than non-black, non-Hispanic men. Hispanic men are somewhere in between, but the difference between them and both black and non-black, non-Hispanic men isn't statistically significant:

The results for women are more mixed. At age 18, there are barely any racial disparities in arrest prevalence at all, and at age 23 white women are somewhat more likely to have been arrested, though none of the differences are statistically significant. Keep in mind, when interpreting this graph, how different the Y axis is from the male graph. Regardless of race, women are less likely to have been arrested by age 18 or 23 than men:

One caveat to keep in mind is that a substantial number of people targeted for the survey did not reply, and some who responded at age 18 did not respond again at 23. The authors assume these people are ""missing at random."" That is, that ""individuals with missing information in a particular race and sex cell have the same arrest rate as the individuals who provided information on their arrest experiences."" The authors concede that this is a ""strong and untestable assumption.""

So they also analyzed the data as if either all the missing respondents in a given gender or racial category had been arrested, or none of them had been, to see how off, in theory, the numbers could be. No conclusions about racial or gender differences in arrests hold up in the most extreme cases of error. That doesn't necessarily mean the overall findings are wrong. It seems fairly unlikely that, say, every missing non-black, non-Hispanic respondent had been arrested but every missing black respondent hadn't been, such that the racial arrest gap disappears. But it's a good reminder of the limits of even the best survey research.",NA,604,NA,NA
