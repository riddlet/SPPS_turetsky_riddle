Police Officer Fatally Shoots Mike Brown", Evette Dionne,8/11/2014,11/2/2016,"It’s time to mourn another dead Black child.

Dorian Johnson – a friend of the victim – told KMOV, St. Louis’ CBS-affiliate station, that an {officer confronted and aimed his rifle at them while they were walking to Brown’s grandmother house}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html"">.

“He (the officer) shot again and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air,” Johnson said. “He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.”

Another witness has a similar account of the shooting. {Piaget Crenshaw, 19, told the St. Louis Post Dispatch that she saw the police officer “attempting to place Brown in the rear seat of a squad car.”}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/anger-confrontation-after-fatal-shooting-of-teen-by-ferguson-police/article_04e3885b-4131-5e49-b784-33cd3acbe7f1.html""> Crenshaw observed Brown with his hands in the air as the officer fired bullets into his head and chest.

Despite these matching stories, the St. Louis County Police Department maintains that the shooting was justified.

{“The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,” Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County Police Department, said at a news conference}<hyperlink=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html?_r=1"">. According to Belmar, Brown “physically assaulted the police officer” and attempted to steal his weapon. At that time, the officer fired and killed Brown. He was approximately 35 feet away from the police vehicle at the time of his death. Though there were multiple shell casings recovered at the scene, Belmar wasn’t sure how many times Brown was hit. Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, said that the police shot her son eight times.

Belmar said the police department is conducting a thorough investigation. However, Ferguson police cars are not equipped with dash cameras, according to Officer Brian Schellman, a St. Louis Police Department spokesman.

“There is no video in the apartment complex,” Schellman said. “We are still trying to determine if any witnesses recorded the incident.

The accused officer is on paid leave, but that isn’t enough for a grieving mother. McSpadden told the Associated Press that she’d like to see her son’s killer fired and incarcerated. “I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,” she said.

The Ferguson community is also seeking answers. Following Brown’s death, hundreds of demonstrators staged a peaceful protest and candlelight vigil to demand justice for the slain teen, who was set to begin classes at Missouri’s Vatterott College today. Brown’s stepfather, Louis Head, held a sign that read, “Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son.” More than 100 officers – including some dressed in riot gear – were dispatched to Ferguson, in response to the protest.

The police response left many disappointed. {Antonio French, a city councilman in St. Louis, told the New York Times that he’s dissatisfied with the police department’s explanation}<hyperlink=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html?_r=0"">.

“It’s a textbook example of how not to handle the situation,” French said. “Ferguson has a white government and a white mayor, but a large black population. This situation has brought out whatever rifts were between that minority community and the Ferguson government.” Ferguson’s population

We plan to do everything within our power to ensure that the Ferguson Police Department as well as the St. Louis County Police Department releases all details pertinent to the shooting. We strongly encourage residents to stay away from the crime scene so that no additional citizens are injured.”

The U.S. Justice Department is also monitoring all developments in the case at the request of Attorney General Eric Holder, according to spokeswoman Dena Iverson.

Yet, none of this quells the sadness. We’ve buried Renisha McBride, Trayvon Martin, Amadou Diallo, Eric Garner, Jordan Davis, Rekia Boyd, Pearlie Golden, and a multitude of others. With the death of Brown, it’s clear that open season on Black folks is just beginning.",35,18,NA,18(FB)

The reoccurring nightmare of tear gas, rubber bullets, flash grenades and unlawful arrests that held a small Missouri town hostage for six days may be receding, but we must remain aware in this moment, present and fully engaged.

Because we’ve been here before.

We, who are witnesses and participants in the 2014 Ferguson Uprising in response to the public, police execution of 18-year-old Michael Brown, are simultaneously reliving and creating history. Black bodies falling lifeless to the ground, detached from their humanity and treated like trash. The screams of the grieving piercing our hearts, just as the bullets pierced the flesh of their loved ones.

Chaos, confusion, anger, pain, fear, resolve. Rage.

We’ve been here before.

We remember the bloody streets of Selma, Alabama. We remember the 1965 Watts Rebellion that occurred during this very week 49 years ago. We remember burning crosses and strange fruit hanging from the Poplar trees.

We remember Rekia and Oscar, Wendall and Jonathan, Sean and Eric, John and Amadou, Kimani and Aiyana, Ramarley and Tarika, and so many others who fell victim to the domestic, state-sanctioned terrorism of police officers sworn to protect and serve.

If we have learned anything, it is this: There exists in this country officers—those who fear us and those who hate us—who will gladly kill us and our children. And they are emboldened by a racist judicial system that will tell them they’re justified.

We know this as sure as our skin is brown and our neighborhoods are Black.

President Barack Obama, who has frequently said that “no country on Earth would tolerate missiles raining down on its citizens from outside its borders,” in defense of Israel’s massacre of the Palestinian people, stood silently by as police infiltrated the residential neighborhoods of Ferguson, MO, assaulting citizens with a legal right to peaceful assembly with military weapons.

Though Obama did finally address the murder of Michael Brown and the subsequent uprising in Ferguson, calling for peace, calm and reflection,  there was no statement on why Ferguson citizens were supposed to tolerate police brutality without fighting back. This glaring lack of outrage on behalf of citizens in his own country once again proves Obama’s willingness, indeed, his preference, to distance himself from the simmering Black rage that got him elected.

His very job description puts him at odds with justice and equality for Black people because this nation does not prioritize justice and equality for Black people. So we can expect nothing but the empty promises of the same justice department who has yet to announce any forward movement in the investigation into the murder of Trayvon Martin.

There is no justice. Just us.

Then there are mainstream media outlets “reporting” on how difficult it is to be Black in America, capitalizing on the police murders in the last month for page views.

Be clear: If you’re not actually reporting on the issues that fuel this White supremacist system—lack of food safety, poverty, inadequate healthcare, Prison Industrial Complex, war on drugs, sub-par wages and unemployment—and the criminals in power who perpetuate it, while also pointing to the system as the foundation of the devaluation of Black lives, then you are not reporters. You are voyeurs, vultures salivating over the desecration of Black flesh.

And the rage rages on.

“Hands up! Don’t shoot!”
“Pigs go home. You’re blocking the street.”
“Paid assassins!”
“Fuck tha police!”

This is the language of the oppressed, of the weary, of the strong, of the brave. Of the furious.

And as so many have said before me: Time is up.

The revolutionaries in Ferguson—and they are revolutionaries—are not just fighting for their lives and the lives of their children. They are fighting for their humanity. They are putting the world on notice that peace is secondary to justice and the world is listening.

Make no mistake: this is war. Police departments across this country, from Ohio to L.A. to New York City to Ferguson, are committing crimes against humanity and are not being held responsible. And they are allowed to commit these crimes under the cloak of anonymity so that they’re lives are protected while they kill with impunity.

Do not doubt that our collective rage is justified. We should not be made to feel like savages. The savages are the police officers hiding behind their badges to commit murder. We should not be made to feel embarrassed. A president who vacations while martial law is declared in a US town after days of citizens being under relentless attack should be embarrassed.

Though the Missouri Highway Patrol has seized control of Ferguson from its police department, effectively halting their GI Joe role-playing, there has been no victory. We still do not know the name of the officer who killed Mike Brown, nor has he been held accountable for the murder of the unarmed teen. The rights of the citizens of Ferguson, Missouri {elected officials}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/missouri-state-sen-fuck-you-jay-nixon""> and {visiting reporters}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/wesley-lowery-slams-joe-scarborough-193926""> were still willfully violated.

Yes, we are weary of watching our children slain in the streets by those sworn to protect them, but not too weary to mistake the positioning of a {Black officer in front of the cameras}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/meet-the-missouri-highway-state-patrol-captain-who-is-taking-over-in-ferguson/?utm_term=.7feca7d77f0f"">, nor the convenient video of police officers {dancing}<hyperlink=""https://www.yahoo.com/news/st-louis-police-danceoff-video-161245826.html?ref=gs""> {with Black children}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/meet-the-missouri-highway-state-patrol-captain-who-is-taking-over-in-ferguson/?utm_term=.5af7c82d7aaa"">, for justice.

We stay woke.

Our right to life is something worth fighting for and it must be protected at all costs. A Black person being killed in the United States {every 28 hours}<hyperlink=""https://mxgm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Operation-Ghetto-Storm.pdf""> by law enforcement officials is something to be enraged about, not something to reflect upon in silence.

We’ve been here before.

James Baldwin wrote in 1965: “If we–and I mean the relatively conscious whites and the relatively conscious black, who must, like lovers, insist on, or create, the consciousness of others–do not falter in our duty now, we may be able, handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world.”

No more water the fire next time.

Ferguson is the fire. Our rage is the fire.

And we don’t need no water, let it burn.",52,1000,NA,1k+(FB)

Experts Weigh In!,Nikki Tucker,8/19/2014,11/2/2016,"As there continues to be a complete disregard for the black and brown bodies who are shot down like animals, the question that troubles any individual with a respect to human life is why hasn’t Darren Wilson been arrested yet?

As details of the unfortunate death of Mike Brown are made public, the people of Ferguson, along with those who support the community, await anxiously for justice to prevail. While authorities in Ferguson neglect the Bill of Rights and its first amendment, Twitter erupts stressing a call-to-action.

However, what are the likely chances of Darren Wilson being arrested? In an interview with Salon.com Peter A. Joy, Henry Hitchcock Professor of Law and director of the Criminal Justice Clinic at Washington University Law in St. Louis, stated, “The prosecutor has two avenues: One is to immediately press charges, issue a warrant for the officer’s arrest and arrest Officer Wilson. The other option is not to press charges immediately but to present the case to a grand jury and see if the grand jury will find probable cause to indict the officer. Even if the prosecutor immediately presses charges while we’re on the phone, that case would still be presented to the grand jury — the difference being that the officer would be placed under arrest before the grand jury considers the matter.”

As we look forward to the arrest of Wilson (sooner rather than later), Shaun King of Los Angels created a petition that calls on President Obama to enact new federal laws. In the document he stresses the importance to protect citizens from police violence and misconduct. King writes:

I love good police officers. I have them in my immediate family. Like all civil servants they are underpaid and under-resourced for a difficult job.

However, a long and completely avoidable history of violence by police officers has killed too many innocent civilians, caused a destructive level of mistrust in the community, and is causing a rising tide of anger, frustration, and despair among millions of good people.

He continues by naming all of the known victims of police brutality starting with Amadou Diallo and ending with Mike Brown. King also lists five policy solutions.

The St. Louis County NAACP called for the FBI to investigate the death of Michael “Mike” Brown, who was shot multiple times Saturday after police say he was involved in a scuffle with an officer in Ferguson, Mo..

“It is our hope that this discussion will provide accurate and reliable information to be shared with the community,” Esther Haywood, president of the county’s NAACP, said in a statement. “Our expectation is to educate the public on the NAACP’s strategy toward justice for the Brown family and the community.”

The St. Louis County executive and Ferguson police chief also they welcomed FBI involvement. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon also said Monday that he requested an independent U.S. Department of Justice investigation.

“I ask St. Louis County residents to exercise patience and respect for their neighbors as federal authorities work to get to the bottom of what happened,” Nixon said in a statement.

“The federal investigation will supplement, rather than supplant, the inquiry by local authorities. At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right,” Holder said.

The “Grey’s Anatomy” star is most certainly about that activist life and proved exactly that when {he expertly dismantled the overwhelmingly biased reporting}<hyperlink=""http://jezebel.com/jesse-williams-on-ferguson-we-are-not-treated-like-hum-1623217610""> surrounding the killing of Ferguson teen Michael Brown. Jezebel reports that during an appearance on CNN, Williams chided the type of journalism that aims to cover up the core issue in Brown’s death—blatant and unchecked racism against blacks in America.

In particular, Williams questioned the media’s decision to focus on the convenience store robbery that took place prior to Brown being killed, even after the press conference held by Ferguson Police Chief Thomas failed to justify why the robbery footage and the name of the officer who killed Brown were released at the same time.

Williams said:

“We also have to talk about the narrative and making sure that we’re starting at the beginning. You’ll find that the people doing the oppressing always want to start the narrative at a convenient part, or always want to start the story in the middle. This started with a kid getting shot and killed and left in the street for four hours. I’ve never seen a white body left in the street for four hours in the sweltering heat. The cop doesn’t call in the shooting, the body isn’t put in an ambulance, it’s shuttled away in some shady unmarked SUV.

This idea that because he stole a handful of cheap cigars, what’s that $5? I’ve lived in white suburbs of this country for a long time, I know plenty of white kids who steal stuff from a convenience store. [There’s] this idea that every time a black person does something, they automatically become a thug worthy of death when we don’t own drug crimes. We’re not the only ones who sell and do drugs all the time.We’re not the only ones that steal and talk crazy to cops.

There’s a complete double standard and a complete different experience that a certain element of this country has the privilege of being treated like human beings, and the rest of us are not treated like human beings, period. That needs to be discussed, that’s the story. That’s what gets frustrating for people — because you don’t know five black folks, five black men in particular, that have not been harassed and felt threatened by police officers. You can’t throw a rock and find five of them. We’re not making this up.”

Thank goodness for Williams’ non-PC approach to this matter. It’s refreshing to hear his bold, honest assertion about biased reporting, and hopefully it will steer the attention away from speculation, and more towards the undeniable facts.",30,97,NA,97(FB)
ClutchMag,clutch7,http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2014/08/tragedy-finding-organization-chaos/,After the Tragedy: Finding Organization in the Chaos,Diana Veiga,8/18/2014,11/2/2016,"By now we have all heard the name Michael Brown, the 18 year old who was gunned down by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. We have watched his mother wail before news cameras and felt her palpable pain that seems to be able to reach through the television screen and into our living rooms. We have seen footage of the police armed in riot gear, their fingers ready to aim and fire. Contrast that image with that of the protestors (mostly black and brown folks) who have stood directly across from the police, then gotten into don’t shoot position – on their knees, hands down – to make a point. We have watched the neighborhood be tear gassed, streets blocked off, the media refused access to cover the events, and the people told to go home as if they aren’t already home watching their world be slowly torn apart.

It is a heartbreaking sight. Is this America? Our America? Is this the same America that can twice elect a black man as President and yet gun down a black man in the street and then leave him there for hours like he is a dog? But we know the answer is yes. We know that injustice is at America’s core because it was there in its founding. These type of events do not surprise the black person who knows better, who is aware of the nation’s history, who goes outside and may have to interact with the police.

In recent years, it seems that we have done this rehearsed dance too many times. A tragic incident occurs and in the present moment there is rage and anger that fuels us to protest, march, scream, and make demands. But the more important question, the one that never seems to get answered enough is – what happens next? Months later. When the camera crews leave. When the people return to their normal lives. When the blood has been washed away by the rains.

What do we do with the anger and the rage?

For almost three years I had the privilege to work for a political non-profit organization where I supported black clergy and lay leaders who mobilized and organized their churches and communities around progressive issues. This was a nationwide effort that made deep impacts on a wide range of issues, one of them notably being increasing civic engagement and participation in the 2012 elections. Many of these ministers were aged 50 and above and they had been in the struggle for decades, several had been active in the Civil Rights Movement. They were committed to non-violence, to increasing access to the ballot box, to ensuring equality and justice for all, but they were no punks. They too were filled with a rage that fueled their work and kept them going.

After the murder of Michael Brown, I emailed one of my favorite ministers from the organization who lives near St. Louis and has been active in the community for several years. I knew that he would be on the frontlines of any organizing efforts that would occur. He responded that he was headed to a meeting that evening, but then said: it is hard to get us to seek proactive means instead of always reacting.

I understood him immediately for it is in the quiet times, the lulls, the days in between elections, when injustice rages on, suffocates, and even kills the people. Injustice, racism, and oppression never take a holiday. They don’t have vacation or sick leave. They never go on break.

So neither can we.

The Civil Rights Movement and its accompanying successes are usually packaged into a neat and uncomplicated narrative. When presented without historical context, it seems that black folks just woke up one day in 1955 and decided to stop taking buses in Montgomery, Alabama after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. However, for this year’s Martin Luther King, Jr., Day, my church in Washington, D.C., hosted Howard University professor Dr. Eleanor Traylor as speaker. Dr. Traylor is a native of Atlanta and a contemporary of Dr. King and several other Atlanta preachers and freedom fighters.

In her speech, Dr. Traylor provided vivid accounts of her childhood in Atlanta during the 1930’s and 40’s. She called the names of the various churches and their respective pastors and described that it was in these places where as children they learned the names of notable ancestors and freedom fighters like, Frederick Douglass and Ida B. Wells. It was there that they learned and sung the hymns that would sustain them. In this sacred space, they were told they were valued and that they weren’t just children of God, but also citizens of this country. Every week they were being equipped with the necessary tools to lead the battle. This is years before Greensboro. Before Montgomery. Before Selma. In this instance, the church planted the first seeds of possibilities, served as the training ground. But it wasn’t the only place.

Katrina Rogers, Principal of Kalaro Media a communications firm that specializes in political communications, public affairs and media training, remarks, “Too often, our leadership doesn’t adequately prepare us for the fight. Too many of us are accustomed to instant results and have no context for this being a marathon instead of a sprint. When the Civil Rights Movement is discussed, it’s presented as Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, MLK made a great speech and then we got to vote. It’s rarely presented as a movement with tens – if not hundreds – of thousands of people who worked – from different angles – for decades.”

As I watched the youth of Ferguson, a city that is sixty-seven percent black with nearly thirty percent of its population under the age of eighteen, I wondered if they have been adequately prepared for the fight. In today’s modern world the lack of safe spaces for black and brown children to learn they are valued and valuable and have a right to push back against an unjust system are few and far between. And yet they need it now more than ever.

More places like the Children’s Defense Fund Freedom Schools where there is a focus on civic engagement and participation are needed. A new generation needs to know the importance of local politics and the very real impact it has on their lives. They need to know that voting is still an effective tool against oppressive forces and that no one should ever be denied the right to vote. They need to know that in a town like Ferguson where the population is majority black but elected leadership is all white, that they can be trained and taught on how to become elected leaders in their own community and push for crucial policy changes. This is a teachable moment not just for Ferguson community, but for all of us, because it is a time when a new generation of leaders can be birthed and raised up in organizing work.

Today, there are terrific organizations that are building upon the movements of yesteryear and pushing them forward. They are serving as training grounds for the next generation of organizers and freedom fighters. There are young leaders who are on the forefront of today’s most important battles: police brutality, voter suppression, housing discrimination, and women’s rights. Moral Monday that started in North Carolina and has moved to other locations, the Dream Defenders who held a 31 day sit-in in the Florida Capitol, the Black Youth Project 100 (BYP100) that provides grassroots organizing training and has spoken out on the Michael Brown case, and Young People For (YP4) that serves as a leadership development program on progressive issues for college aged youth. Within these organizations are modern day activists who inhale and exhale the work all year round, day in and day out, and push for a better world.

They don’t take breaks or holidays because they know that’s not an option. Because injustice doesn’t care what kind of car you drive and that you were just in an accident and need some help. Racism doesn’t care if you are just minding your business and walking back home, or about to start college, or work a good job, or live in a good neighborhood. Oppression can still find you even when you’re wearing a designer suit. Too often, we have to be reminded of these truths the hard way.

But it is also in these unfortunate, uncomfortable times that we can make a choice to join the fight, to push back, to organize, to channel the anger and rage, to teach the children how to be leaders, to vote, to attend a community meeting, to run for political office, to campaign and canvass, to become educated on an issue, to donate money to a cause, to say a prayer for the weary, to provide support to the activists, to start a freedom school or an organization, to continually keep our mind on freedom and liberation for everyone and then work towards that goal.

But we can’t just do it today. It has to get done tomorrow too. And the day after that.",3,74,NA,74(FB)

And if what Howard wrote was a church sermon, the whole congregation would probably say “AMEN”.

Here’s just a snippet of Howard’s piece:

{“There’s a long history of racial tension and misunderstanding in this region,” St. Louis Post-Dispatch columnist Aisha Sultan told me over the phone yesterday. “Especially on the north side.”}<hyperlink=""http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/america-is-not-for-black-people-1620169913"">

This sort of thing—especially on the north side—is what gets glossed over a little too easily when we try to fit a particular incident into a broader narrative. Ferguson is a small town of 21,000, mostly white until the 1960s, when whites fled anywhere but where they were. Today, Ferguson, which is a bit north of St. Louis, is mostly black; Ferguson and St. Louis County police are mostly white. That fits a metropolitan area flanked by two rivers that divide neighborhoods and regions by race, the sixth-most segregated in the United States.

To people, like me, from the coast—I’m from Maryland—St. Louis can seem like a blank in the middle of the country, a place where people and even ideas get stuck on the way to somewhere better, or at least somewhere else. But St. Louis is like New York (the fourth-most segregated metro in America), or Los Angeles, or Miami, or Dallas, or Washington, DC, only more so. Far from a blank, St. Louis is often regarded as the most American of America’s cities.

To even acknowledge this line of debate is to start a larger argument about the worth, the very personhood, of a black man in America. It’s to engage in a cost-benefit analysis, weigh probabilities, and gauge the precise odds that Brown’s life was worth nothing against the threat he posed to the life of the man who killed him. It’s to deny that there are structural reasons why Brown was shot dead while James Eagan Holmes—who on July 20, 2012, walked into a movie theater and fired rounds into an audience, killing 12 and wounding 70 more—was taken alive.

To ascribe this entirely to contempt for black men is to miss an essential variable, though—a very real, American fear of them. They—we—are inexplicably seen as a millions-strong army of potential killers, capable and cold enough that any single one could be a threat to a trained police officer in a bulletproof vest. There are reasons why white gun’s rights activists can walk into a Chipotle restaurant with assault rifles and be seen as gauche nuisances while unarmed black men are killed for reaching for their wallets or cell phones, or carrying children’s toys. Guns aren’t for black people, either.

After reading this article, three times as a matter of fact, I truly wondered…if America isn’t for black people, then what place is?

Tarika Wilson was fatally shot by police officers during a raid-gone-wrong in early January of 2008.  She was likely on her knees and complying with a SWAT team’s orders to get down when she was hit in the neck and chest, two experts testified. A forensic pathologist and firearms expert each said that bullet wounds indicate that Tarika Wilson wasn’t standing or struggling with officers. She was holding her 1-year-old son on her knees when she was shot. The boy was hit and had a finger amputated. This tragedy set off protests and debate about race relations in the city (LIMA, Ohio), where one in four residents are black.",29,275,NA,275(FB)

According to The Huffington Post, the rally attendees congregated outside the Los Angeles Police Department, many of them carrying signs that expressed their indignation over Ford’s death and the seemingly endless incidences of police brutality, especially against unarmed civilians.

Despite the growing tensions, particularly in light of the Ferguson protests, the large rally was devoid of violence, with police officers peacefully escorting the crowd that quickly grew from hundreds to thousands of people marching for justice. One thing the rally didn’t lack was a wide range of protesters from all backgrounds, including Sandra Nunez, a mother who fears for the future of her black teenage son.  She told The Huffington Post:

“I not only fear gang members killing my son, I fear police killing my son. I feel helpless, because I don’t know who will protect him from them.”

Amongst some of the protesters’ demands were a call for police activities to be frequently monitored by civilians and an additional rule that requires police officers to wear body cameras.",6,18,NA,18(FB)
