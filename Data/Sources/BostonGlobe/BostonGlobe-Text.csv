BostonGlobe,globe1,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/08/16/reports-looting-ferguson/CyXjSKLhtfmziMa7ZRMPmJ/story.html,"Protesters, police face off again in Ferguson, Mo.",Alan Blinder,8/16/2014,2/9/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Unrest returned to the streets of this St. Louis suburb early Saturday as hundreds of demonstrators, angered by the shooting death of an unarmed African-American teenager by a police officer, engaged in a standoff with the police that was punctuated by threats and a new round of denunciations of law enforcement practices.

The confrontation, the first serious one since the Missouri State Highway Patrol on Thursday assumed responsibility for security operations here, ended at about 4 a.m. when the authorities, prompted by the gradual dispersal of demonstrators, pulled back to their nearby command post. The Associated Press reported one law enforcement official had been injured overnight.

The unrest capped an extraordinary day of events that has roiled this community since the teenager, Michael Brown, 18, was fatally shot by a police officer last Saturday while walking home from a convenience store with a friend.

On Friday, the police chief of Ferguson, Thomas Jackson, said at a news conference that the officer who shot Brown was Darren Wilson, who has served on the Ferguson force for four years and in another local department for two years and who had no disciplinary charges. Wilson, who is white, has been placed on leave, and his location is unknown.

But the release of his name was overshadowed by the simultaneous announcement that Brown was a suspect in a robbery at a convenience store shortly before his death, leading to questions about timing and motives. Surveillance videotapes released by the Ferguson police appeared to show Brown shoving a store clerk aside as he took a box of cigarillos.

In a later news conference, on Friday afternoon, Jackson said Wilson had not been aware Brown “was a suspect in the case” and instead had stopped him and a companion “because they were walking down the street blocking traffic.”

Brown’s family, their lawyer and others in the community expressed disgust, accusing the police of trying to divert attention from the central issue — the unexplained shooting of an unarmed young man — by releasing the information, which included a 19-page police report on the robbery but no new details about the shooting.

The Highway Patrol officer named to take over security in Ferguson, Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, also expressed his displeasure with how the information had been released. Johnson, who grew up in the area, had been brought in by the governor Thursday to restore peace after days of confrontations between demonstrators and the police in riot gear and military-style vehicles. The captain said he had not been told that the authorities planned to release the video of the robbery along with the name of the officer. But he sought to calm people down, saying, “In our anger, we have to make sure that we don’t burn down our own house.”

Protests on the streets Friday night started peacefully. Cars clogged streets as horns blared and music played. Hundreds of demonstrators clutched signs and chanted slogans, but many others danced to music. On one street, six people danced atop a delivery truck.

Although the police presence was limited, Johnson walked through the community, taking photographs with young children and offering hugs and handshakes.

“I’m pleased with how it’s going,” he said early in the night.

But tensions rose around midnight when the police released a small amount of tear gas as they backed away from the crowd. Some protesters threw rocks and other objects, according to media reports. Some demonstrators fired weapons into the air.

Johnson told The Associated Press that the police backed off to try to ease the tension.

“We had to evaluate the security of the officers there and also the rioters,” he told The AP. “We just felt it was better to move back.”

Using people and vehicles, protesters quickly blocked a major thoroughfare here, prompting the police to return and form a barricade of their own. For a time, the protesters and the police faced off in road. The police urge protesters to go home, and demonstrators, many of them chanting slogans like “We ready for y’all,” approached the officers. Some tossed glass bottles toward the police.

One protester sought to rally others to action through a megaphone, telling them, “You say you’re ready to jam? Let’s jam.”

A police officer repeatedly urged the demonstrators to leave the roadway and avoid coming too close to the police. The official, speaking through an intercom system, warned violators were “subject to arrest and other actions,” and a police helicopter, its spotlight shining, flew over this city of about 21,000.

At times, the police warned, “We don’t want anyone to get hurt.”

Several protesters, as rain occasionally fell, tried to persuade others to stick with their cause amid the warnings.

“It’s going to be a long war,” one young man said to another. “We need to win a few battles.”

As protesters lingered, some stores became targets for looting. Men and women could be seen racing through the aisles of a liquor store and running out with bottles of alcohol.

Many other retailers, though, were left untouched, in part because some demonstrators blocked entrances and windows in a bid to limit looting. Such conduct, they said, diluted the seriousness of the message they were trying to send to the police and the public.

The police took no action to protect the liquor store or apprehend any suspects.

By 4 a.m., the crowd had mostly broken up and the police returned to their command post.

Some journalists covering the event reported being threatened overnight by protesters who thought they might be undercover police officers. In one instance, young men wearing dark bandannas repeatedly struck the windows of a car, ordering a journalist from a church parking lot.

BostonGlobe,globe2,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/08/17/michael-brown-was-shot-times-ferguson-officer-preliminary-autopsy-shows/izi6zze4Z2QebrpaWtG2nI/story.html,"Michael Brown was shot 6 times by Ferguson officer, preliminary autopsy shows",Frances Robles; Julie Bosman,8/18/2014,2/9/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager who was killed by a police officer, sparking protests around the nation, was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, a preliminary private autopsy performed Sunday found.

One of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury, according to Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for New York City, who flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family’s request to conduct the separate autopsy. It was likely the last of bullets to hit him, he said.

Brown, 18, was also shot four times in the right arm, he said, adding that all the bullets were fired into his front.

The bullets did not appear to have been shot from very close range because no gunshot powder was present on his body. However, that determination could change if it turns out that there is gunshot residue on Brown’s clothing, to which Baden did not have access.

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said Sunday that the Justice Department would conduct its own autopsy, in addition to the one performed by local officials and this private one because, a department spokesman said, of “the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family.”

The preliminary autopsy results are the first time that some of the critical information resulting in Brown’s death has been made public. Thousands of protesters demanding information and justice for what was widely viewed as a reckless shooting took to the streets here in rallies that ranged from peaceful to violent.

Brown died last week in a confrontation with a police officer in this suburb of St. Louis. The police department has come under harsh criticism for refusing to clarify the circumstances of the shooting and for responding to protests with military-style operational gear.

“People have been asking: how many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day One,” Baden said in an interview after performing the autopsy. “They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.”

Baden said that while Brown was shot at least six times, only three bullets were recovered from his body. But he has not yet seen the X-rays showing where the bullets were found, which would clarify the autopsy results. Nor has he had access to witness and police statements.

Baden provided a diagram of the entry wounds, and noted that the six shots produced numerous wounds. Some of the bullets entered and exited several times, including one that left at least five wounds.

“This one here looks like his head was bent downward,” he said, indicating the wound at the very top of Brown’s head. “It can be because he’s giving up, or because he’s charging forward at the officer.”

He stressed that his information does not assign blame or justify the shooting.

“We need more information; for example the police should be examining the automobile to see if there is gunshot residue in the police car,” he said.

Baden, 80, is a well-known New York-based medical examiner, who is one of only about 400 board-certified forensic pathologists in the nation. He reviewed the autopsies of John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and has performed more than 20,000 autopsies himself.

He is best known for having hosted the HBO show “Autopsy,” but he rankles when he is called a “celebrity medical examiner,” saying that the vast majority of what he does has nothing to do with celebrities.

Baden said that because of the tremendous attention to the case, he waived his $10,000 fee.

Professor Shawn L. Parcells, a pathologist assistant based in Kansas, assisted Baden.

“You do this for the families,” Parcells said. The two medical experts conducted the four-hour examination Sunday at the Austin A. Layne Mortuary in St. Louis. Benjamin L. Crump, a lawyer for Brown’s family who paid their travel expenses, hired them.

“The sheer number of bullets and the way they were scattered all over his body showed this police officer had a brazen disregard for the very people he was supposed to protect in that community,” Crump said. “We want to make sure people understand what this case is about: this case is about a police officer executing a young unarmed man in broad daylight.”

A spokesman for the Ferguson Police Department, Tim Zoll, said the police had not seen a report of the autopsy and therefore had no comment on it.

Baden said he consulted with the St. Louis County medical examiner before conducting the autopsy.

One of the bullets shattered his right eye, traveled through his face, exited his jaw and re-entered his collarbone. The last two shots in the head would have stopped him in his tracks and were likely the last fired.

Brown, he said, would not have survived the shooting even if he had been taken to a hospital right away. The autopsy indicated that he was otherwise healthy.

He said it was unusual for the federal government to conduct a third autopsy, but dueling examinations often occur when there is so much distrust of the authorities. The county of St. Louis has conducted an autopsy, and the results have not yet been released.

He stressed that his examination was not to determine whether the shooting was justified.

“In my capacity as the forensic examiner for the New York State Police, I would say, ‘You’re not supposed to shoot so many times,’” said Baden, who retired from the state police in 2011. “Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.”

No matter what conclusions can be drawn from Baden’s work, Brown’s death remains marked by shifting and contradictory accounts more than a week after it occurred. The shooting is under investigation by St. Louis County and by the FBI, working with the Justice Department’s civil rights division and Holder’s office.

According to what has emerged so far, on Aug. 9, Brown, along with a companion, Dorian Johnson, was walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a fistful of cigarillos in Brown’s hand, police say, which a videotape shows he stole from a liquor store on West Florissant Avenue.

At 12:01 p.m., they were stopped by Darren Wilson, a police officer, who ordered them off the road and onto the sidewalk, Johnson, who is 22, later said.

The police have said that what happened next was a physical struggle between Brown and Wilson that left Wilson with a swollen face. Johnson and others have said that it was a case of racial profiling and police aggression from a white officer toward a black man. Within minutes, Brown, who was unarmed, was dead of gunshot wounds.

The sequence of events provided by law enforcement officials places Brown and Johnson at Ferguson Market and Liquors, a store several blocks away on West Florissant Avenue, at about 11:50 a.m.

After leaving the store with the stolen cigarillos, the two walked north on West Florissant, a busy commercial thoroughfare, toward Canfield Drive, a clerk reported to police.

Brown was 6-foot-4 and 292 pounds, though his family and friends described him as quiet and shy, a homebody who lived with his grandmother. On the day he died, he was wearing a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap, long khaki shorts and flip-flops with yellow socks.

It is about a 10-minute walk from Ferguson Market to the spot where Wilson, a 28-year-old officer with six years’ experience, approached Brown and Johnson.

The police tell of an officer who was enforcing the minor violation of jaywalking, as Wilson and Johnson ignored the sidewalk and strolled down the middle of the road instead.

The morning after the shooting, Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County police said that Wilson was leaving his police car when Brown “allegedly pushed the police officer back into the car,” where he “physically assaulted the police officer.”

“Within the police car there was a struggle over the officer’s weapon,” Belmar said. “There was at least one shot fired in the car.”

At that point, the police said, Wilson left his vehicle and fatally shot Brown. “More than a few” shell casings were recovered from the scene.

Johnson, who declined to be interviewed, has described the events differently in television interviews. While he and Brown walked, he said, Wilson stopped his vehicle and told them to get on the sidewalk. When they refused, Wilson slammed on his brakes and drove in reverse to get closer.

When the officer opened his door, it hit Brown. With his left hand, Wilson reached out and grabbed Brown by the neck, Johnson said.

“It’s like tug of war,” Johnson said. “He’s trying to pull him in. He’s pulling away, that’s when I heard, ‘I’m gonna shoot you.’”

A neighbor, Tiffany Mitchell, said in an interview with MSNBC that she heard tires squeal, then saw Brown and Wilson “wrestling” through the open car window.

A shot went off from within the car, Johnson said, and the two began to run away from the officer.

According to Mitchell, “The officer gets out of his vehicle,” she said, pursuing Brown, then continued to shoot.

Johnson said that he hid behind a parked car and that Brown was struck by a bullet in his back as he ran away, an account that Baden’s autopsy appears to contradict.

“Michael’s body jerks as if he was hit,” Mitchell said, “and then he put his hands up.”

Brown turned, Johnson said, raised his hands, and said, “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!”

Wilson continued to fire and Brown crumpled to the ground, Johnson said.

Within seconds, confusion and horror swept through Canfield Drive. On that Saturday afternoon, dozens of neighbors were at home and rushed out of their apartments when they heard gunshots.

One person who claimed to witness the shooting began posting frantic messages on Twitter, written hastily with shorthand and grammatical errors, only two minutes after Wilson approached Brown. At 12:03 p.m., the person, identified as @TheePharoah, a St. Louis-area rapper, wrote on Twitter that he had just seen someone die.

That same minute, he wrote, “Im about to hyperventilate.”

At 12:23 p.m., he wrote, “dude was running and the cops just saw him. I saw him die bruh.”

A 10-minute video posted on YouTube appeared to be taken on a cellphone by someone who identified himself as a neighbor. The video, which has collected more than 225,000 views, captures Brown’s body, the yellow police tape that marked off the crime scene and the residents standing behind it.

“They shot that boy cause they wanted to,” said one woman who can be heard on the video.

“They said he had his hands up and everything,” said the man taking the video, speaking to a neighbor.

Brown’s body remained in the street for several hours, a delay that Jackson said last week made him “uncomfortable.” Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who has been active in this case, said on ABC on Sunday that the body had remained in the street for nearly five hours.

At one point, a woman can be heard shouting, “Where is the ambulance? Where is the ambulance?”

The man taking the video, who remained off-camera, said, “God rest his soul. He’s gone.”",14,NA,NA,NA
BostonGlobe,globe3,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/08/17/ferguson-push-for-change/G75yk7uHPi3GHT0PyuSUgN/story.html,Many strive to put violence-torn Ferguson on new course,Akilah Johnson,8/18/2014,2/9/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — On a street corner at the epicenter of the protests, Tommie Dale and her daughters readied voter registration signs as her husband implored passing drivers to “Come get registered to vote.”

Dale, 35, and her family lived in Ferguson for 15 years but left, pushed out by crime and “constant stops by police.” But the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed by a white police officer, compelled her to return.

“It’s the only way we can make a change,” she said standing in front of a boarded-up Chinese restaurant, damaged during a night of violent unrest. “People don’t understand. Looting and rioting aren’t going to get it.”

More than a week after this city erupted in protest over the shooting, the people who live here and those who have traveled here from across the country are looking forward as much as they are remembering the past. They are searching for ways to bring about the change that has often eluded the nation after similar crises such as Los Angeles in 1992, when police officers accused of beating motorist Rodney King were acquitted in court.

For the hundreds of men and women who have turned several blocks of West Florissant Avenue into a protest zone, this is the release of generations of pent-up frustration. Brown’s death had echoes of their own treatment at the hands of a police department they say does not respect black residents, who make up about 70 percent of the population in this small city in northern St. Louis County. Brown’s death resonated with them, tearing open the scars of old injustices and serving as a moment of awakening.

But his death also hit home far from the borders of this city. People have traveled to Ferguson from hundreds of miles away, ready to add their presence to the cause.

How does the community capitalize on its nascent political momentum?

Some demonstrators say they must work within the system to bring about change by voting ineffective elected officials out of office. Others, however, say the system must be torn down and rebuilt.

The path forward starts with justice for Brown, many say, and should wind its way through schools, where police officers should spend more time getting to know students on neutral ground, to eventually to the voting booth on Election Day.

“They are in the process of learning their power,” state Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal said Saturday, motioning to the crowds of young people gathered on West Florissant Avenue. “The young people recognize that at any time, they can be Michael Brown.”

Residents say this has long been a place of simmering racial tensions and disparities. In predominately black Ferguson, the mayor, police chief, and five of its six city councilors are white. Just three of the 53 members of the police force are black.

Those who live here point to traffic stops as the biggest indicators of police intimidation and harassment. According to the state attorney general’s office, in the past 14 years, blacks have been drastically more likely to have been pulled over than whites. Of the 5,384 stops conducted in 2013 for example, blacks made up 4,632, or 86 percent.

On Saturday, a group of eight young men who grew up in the northern part of St. Louis County stood at the Quick Trip gas station and convenience store that was destroyed in a night of unrest, only to reemerge as a communal gathering place where children write messages in sidewalk chalk and people grill free hot dogs for protesters.

Each had a story to tell of being pulled over for alleged taillight violations, not putting on turn signals, or the ubiquitous “fits the description” reason.

Davion Christen, 15, said he and some friends were walking during the school year when a police officer pulled up along side of them and said, “What you got in your book bag?”

Davion told him “nothing. It had school books, notebooks, pens, and pencils in it. The officer, he said, searched it anyway.

“And he’s 15!” Darius Jones, 22, said before adding, “I have never talked to a Ferguson police officer a without it being a question, an interrogation.”

Dale, the mother of three, can relate. She said she was six months pregnant and had her 12-year-old daughter in the car when she was pulled over. “We had guns drawn on us, and I said, ‘Is there a reason why we were pulled over?’ They said, ‘You look suspicious.’ ”

That was five years ago. She and her family moved, something Sharis Gray considered but decided against.

“Sometimes you have to stand and fight. This is my home,” said Gray, 29. She hopes her decision to stay in the area shows her 9-year-old daughter that “you can’t run away from things.”

Gray has returned to West Florissant Avenue every evening after work since Wednesday, saying Brown’s death helped shake her from a malaise.

“I had become numb,” she said. “I think it’s getting to the point where it’s not just petty instances of abuse.”

Brown’s death came on the heels of what many described as a trail of injustice.

“In three weeks we saw a woman pummeled on the freeway in Los Angeles. We saw a man choked to death on video while he said ‘I can’t breathe’ 11 times,’’ the Rev. Al Sharpton said during a Sunday afternoon rally at Greater Grace Church, which was packed beyond capacity. “Then we come to Ferguson.”

Anger and sorrow over Brown’s death have been compounded by the official response that followed. It took officials nearly a week to release the name of Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot and killed Brown, and that release came with video of Brown as the suspect in a convenience store robbery, a robbery that police said Wilson was unaware of when he confronted Brown.

“Enough is enough,” said Ebony West, 38, a member of a motorcycle club that helped to keep the peace over the weekend.

Still, Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, who was appointed by the governor to handle security in Ferguson, told the crowd of protesters Sunday that something positive could nonetheless emerge from the strife.

“Michael is going to make it better for our sons, so they can be better black men so they can be better to our daughters so they can be better black women,” Johnson said. “Better for me so I can be a better black father, and we can make mamas even better than they are now.”",35,NA,NA,NA
BostonGlobe,globe4,https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/08/16/ferguson-raises-concerns-militarization-police-forces/gjA76rEL94nYHwzViJsAdM/story.html,Police defend use of military-style equipment,Milton J. Valencia,8/17/2014,2/10/2016,"The photographs and video images of armored vehicles and billowing tear gas, of explosions, of officers donning gas masks and armed with assault rifles made Ferguson, Mo., look like a battleground.

“This is America, not a war zone,” US Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a tweet, echoing concerns of public officials and civil rights groups from across the country.

The level of firepower that law enforcement officials demonstrated over the last week in response to the protests in Missouri has become a growing concern of civil rights groups, which see it as the militarization of local law enforcement agencies that are supposed to build community partnerships.

“It is similar to what we’re seeing nationwide, that there is an increased militarization of our state and local police officers, in terms of the tactics they’re using and the equipment they’re using,” said Jessie Rossman, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts.

Hundreds of people have stormed the streets of Missouri to protest the questionable police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, and police said they had to quell violent rioting and looting at the onset, but the deployment of military-style equipment has reignited the debate over the arming of state and local police departments.

Local law enforcement officials can obtain surplus military equipment from the Department of Defense, or can seek grants from the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice, among other agencies, to purchase equipment.

Massachusetts State Police Colonel Timothy Alben defended the use of federal programs that transfer surplus military equipment to local departments. He said he could not comment on the police action in Missouri, but said State Police have had access to critical military equipment, such as specialized all-terrain vehicles, for use in search and rescue operations and during natural disasters.

“This is the type of equipment State Police or local agencies would never be able to get their hands on if they had to pay for it,” Alben said. “I think every police department of any size in this country has to have a tactical response capability for any event.”

Civil rights groups argue that local departments have increasingly obtained specialized military equipment for use in day-to-day, localized law enforcement operations such as community policing and in drug arrests. And, the weapons have become more available under terrorism responses since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Rossman said many local communities aren’t even aware of some of the weaponry their departments are obtaining because there is never any public input period.

“I think what we’re seeing is that communities are outraged when they realize they don’t know what’s being done with their tax dollars,” she said.

In Massachusetts alone, 82 police departments and other law enforcement agencies between 1994 and 2009 received more than 1,000 weapons from the Department of Defense, including 486 fully automatic M-16 machine guns and 546 semiautomatic M-14s, according to an ACLU state study released in June. The report, “Our Homes Are Not Battlefields: Reversing the Militarization and Federalization of Local Police in Massachusetts,” recommends several reforms, such as better oversight in the deployment of certain equipment.

The study found that while the State Police received the most weapons, small, suburban communities such as Wellfleet and Duxbury also obtained machine guns.

The town of West Springfield, with a population of just over 28,000 people, received two grenade launchers from the Department of Defense, according to the report. And police departments received “peacekeeper armored vehicles,” hundreds of other military-style vehicles, and large marine craft.

The Metro Law Enforcement Council, a regional SWAT team from the Boston area, maintains its own BearCat armored vehicle, which it used in drug arrests. The agency also applied to the Federal Aviation Administration for a drone license.

The report also documents the application of military-style policing in a neighborhood in Springfield and the militarization of SWAT teams in drug raids, with flash-bang grenades and battering rams. In one tragic example, a heavily armed police officer fatally shot 68-year-old Eurie Stamps, a grandfather, during a drug raid in Framingham in 2011. Stamps was not the target of the raid, and the officer accidentally shot him while subduing him.

The local police chief later disbanded the SWAT team; a review showed that the team lacked certain training.

Alben argued that every local department should have some type of tactical response ability, “whether that be for an event like the Boston Marathon, or the school shootings across this country.”

He also noted the prevalence of high-powered assault rifles and shotguns that police encounter on an increasingly routine basis demonstrates the need for the specialized police raids.

Alben agreed with the need for regular, updated training for the use of the specialized equipment but pointed out that departments participate in regional teams, such as the Metro Law Enforcement Council.

He said each department should be able to determine its own needs but would not say whether small departments have the need for equipment like tear gas.

The Amherst Police Department was criticized last year for the use of tear gas to disrupt college student celebrations after the Red Sox World Series victory.

John Collins, general counsel for the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association, said he could not comment on how police in Missouri handled the protests, but defended the deployment of specialized equipment when needed.

“If you have a situation where it’s appropriate to use that, where things have gotten out of control and you’re putting police officers in harm’s way, a lot of things are appropriate,” he said. “That’s the reason we have training, that’s the reason we have policies.”",29,NA,NA,NA

A distraught community protests the killing at the hands of a white police officer. Violent clashes follow between protesters and police, who use tear gas, rubber bullets, and wooden pellets.

Halfway across the country in Boston, black leaders and residents reacted Thursday with anger and sharp questions about the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in a St. Louis suburb and the aggressive police response to tense, daily protests.

“It’s an outrageous shooting,” said Charles Ogletree Jr., a Harvard Law School professor. “People have just had enough and are not yet over what happened with Trayvon Martin,” an unarmed black youth killed two years ago by a Florida crime watch volunteer.

Ogletree, who is black, called for continued rallies but without the violence of Wednesday night, when protesters hurled Molotov cocktails at heavily armed police in Ferguson, Mo.

“There needs to be a lot of noise — nonviolent but forceful — to make it known that we can’t afford to lose another black child,” Ogletree said.

Echoing concerns in Ferguson, blacks in Boston and around the nation are questioning whether an overwhelmingly white police force is prejudging people of color in a Missouri town where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black.

Ferguson police have said the officer who shot Brown was assaulted in his cruiser and that a struggle ensued for his weapon. A friend of Brown who was there said Brown was shot on the street with his hands raised. Authorities have not identified the officer.

During lunch at Haley House Bakery Cafe in Dudley Square, some patrons said police treat black men with less dignity than others. “There’s this notion that young black folks are criminals, lack morals, don’t have respect in general for law and order,” said Andre Plummer, 52. “So, police departments around the country seem quick to resort to violence.”

Sheila Emerson, a 68-year-old mother of five, said she thought of her children as she saw reports of the tear gas and rubber bullets. Her children have been stopped by police while driving, often for no apparent reason, she said.

“I feel like my people are being picked on all the time, to be honest,” Emerson said.

Edmund Barry Gaither, director and curator of the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists in Boston, expressed concerns with what he called the militarization of police, leaving a “force that looks like ‘Miami Vice’ ” to confront the protesters.

“In a community of that size, there should be a conversation happening without the overwhelming display of police power,” he said.

Boston Police Commissioner William B. Evans said in a statement that “the unfortunate incidents” in Ferguson and one in New York in which a 43-year-old black man died in a police chokehold “remind us of the importance of our obligations to our residents and neighborhoods in the city.”

In Boston, an ongoing dialogue aims to improve relations between the police department and minority communities, said Michael Curry, president of the Boston chapter of the NAACP. The Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts has also been involved in that dialogue, he said.

“They are tough conversations. It’s not always a love fest,” said Superintendent in Chief William Gross, the first African-American in that position. “But at least we’re having conversations before things happen.”

Gross said the department is committed to avoiding the problems in Ferguson.

“Will there be bumps in the road? Yes. Will there be controversial interactions and arrests? Yes. But will the strength of the partnerships hold true?” he asked. “So far, they have.”

Gross would not critique the Ferguson police but did say he was confident that Boston police would find “a peaceful resolution” in such a situation.

Three factors that contributed to the crisis in Ferguson — lack of diversity on the police force, the complaint review process, no sensitivity training for officers — are areas Boston must set right to avoid a similar fate, Curry said.

Only three members of Ferguson’s 53-member police force are black. “When you don’t have diverse perspectives around the table, you get flawed results,” he said. “How do you perceive these young men with braids who are sagging with swag?”

As a college student or a criminal, he wondered.

US Representative James Clyburn, one of the highest ranking blacks in Congress, said Thursday that the situation in Missouri is the result of a growing climate of racial tensions manifesting since President Obama’s election.“It’s clear to me that this is not happening in a vacuum,” he said at a book signing event at Roxbury Community College.

As dusk fell Thursday evening, hundreds gathered on Boston Common and raised their hands in solidarity as they joined in a national moment of silence. They held aloft posters beseeching, “We Are Human Too,” “No Justice No Peace” and “Stop the Brutality.” It mirrored protests across the country.

In the shadow of the State House, Tanisha Milton, 37, sat atop the Common steps.

“I’m out here to let the people in Ferguson know that we’re here,” she said. “The people in Boston care.”

Leondra Hawkesworth wore on her shirt the face of DJ Henry, a Pace University student from Easton who was shot to death in Mount Pleasant, N.Y., by police in 2010.

“It becomes tiring and painful to see so many young black people killed,” said Hawkesworth, 24. “There’s no solution. There’s no justice being served.”

The crowd broke into chants: “Justice! For Mike Brown,” “No Justice! No Peace!” Later on, Alexis Martinez, 28, took the megaphone.

“Don’t come at me today telling that this is not about race,” she said. “That’s . . . exactly what it’s about!”

Near the bottom of the steps, she hugged a friend, asking, “When will it end?”",66,NA,NA,NA

Fox,8/16/2014,2/16/2016,"People marched from Copley Square to Boston police headquarters Saturday to protest the fatal shooting in Missouri of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer and local law enforcement’s subsequent military-style response to demonstrators.

Chanting slogans such as, “Hey hey, ho ho, police brutality has got to go,” the diverse crowd marched peacefully down Dartmouth Street and Columbus Avenue, numbering a little more than 100 initially but swelling to twice that.

Boston police monitored marchers and held traffic for them. “The protest was peaceful in nature, and no arrests were made,” said Officer James Kenneally, a spokesman.

The civil interaction contrasted with relations between police and the public in Missouri and in other incidents cited by protesters.

Chelsea resident Leondra Hawkesworth said she was “fed up” with seeing young black men killed by police.

“It’s got to end somewhere,” said Hawkesworth, 24, who wore a T-shirt remembering D.J. Henry, a Pace University student from Easton fatally shot by a Pleasantville, N.Y., police officer in 2010.

Hawkesworth works with Henry’s family to spread awareness and to plan events in his memory, she said.

“It bothers me mentally to see these families without their family members, and they have the potential to be something great,” she said.

Michael Brown Jr., 18, was shot and killed last Saturday by Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson, Police Chief Thomas Jackson told reporters Friday.

In announcing the officer’s name, Jackson also released documents alleging that shortly before his death Brown had stolen a box of cigars from a convenience store, shoving a clerk on his way out the door.

The timing of the allegation reignited anger within the black community of the St. Louis suburb, where protests again turned violent early Saturday.

Later in the day, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew in Ferguson.

During the Boston march, pedestrians stopped to observe, and many along the route stepped out onto sidewalks to see and photograph the throng.

When marchers with raised hands chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot!” some lifted their open palms in solidarity.

As protesters neared police headquarters in Roxbury, Mission Hill resident Tripp Diaz began the chant, “If we don’t do this every day, these racist pigs won’t go away.”

“I’m just angry because a lot of people feel like this [expletive] doesn’t happen anymore, or they just dismiss it like it doesn’t exist,” Diaz, 24, said in an interview.

The group shared information online about the situation, and some attempted to identify the then-unknown shooter in the case. But while the group got some things right, it got others wrong — including the alleged name of the shooter, now identified by police as Officer Darren Wilson.

On Thursday, The Washington Post spoke to Gabriella Coleman, professor at McGill University in Montreal and perhaps the researcher most plugged in to the Anonymous community, about the different tactics at play in ‘‘OpFerguson.’’ Coleman’s book on the hacker group, ‘‘Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: The Many Faces of Anonymous,’’ is due out this fall. Excerpts:

Q: How do you see Operation Ferguson fitting the pattern of Anonymous related actions?

A: On the one hand, it really follows older patterns in a couple ways. First of all, the way that it came to be... It unfolded the way that often happens with operations. Someone who is involved in the issues or who cares about it outside Anonymous reaches out to Anonymous. In this case it was a local rap artist, Tef Poe. So he reaches out to someone on Twitter and says, ‘‘Hey, this is happening, can you get involved?’’ Then this person on Twitter reaches out to some of the big accounts and says, ‘‘Hey, can you create some viral memes and images and tweet about what’s happening?’’ And boom, that starts the fire.

That process has definitely happened before in many operations. What’s interesting in this case is that then a couple of people who were old-timers decided to come back and get involved. One of the people who got involved is a very talented video maker. He has made well over a hundred videos [on behalf of Anonymous] but had taken a long break. What was interesting was how older relationships teams came into being and became involved.

But I’ve also seen a lot of newcomers get involved in the operation — it’s been a long time since an IRC (internet relay chat) channel has been a kind of hub of activity because people were scared off and were using encrypted channels of communication. But in this case for some reason the IRC channel became extremely important for the operations. That was interesting because it felt very old school. But on the other hand, from a security question it raised eyebrows, as well.

Q: There have been a variety of security-related issues that came up around the OpFerguson situation — including an alleged honeypot where someone set up a fake website for the project and claimed he was going to be collecting IP addresses to hand over to the authorities.

A: Yes, there was someone who disliked Anon quite a bit and was very explicitly trying to harvest IP addresses. And then on top of that, similar to Operation BART [around, in part, the shooting death of Oscar Grant], which has a lot of similarities to this operation, there have been some of the kind of more controversial interventions by Anonymous.

One was when the Twitter account TheAnonMessage said they were going to release the name of the police chief’s daughter. People within Anonymous were kind of aghast at that, asking, ‘‘Is this false flag? What’s going on?’’ And they did retrench and say, ‘‘We’re not going to do that.’’ It’s also very possible that was a stunt, as well.

It was very interesting this morning [Thursday] when the public channel, when they were debating whether to release the name they went ahead and released — because there were some people who were advocating for a little bit more research and time. But then there were others who were saying: ‘‘No, no let’s do this now. Even though the evidence isn’t foolproof, it’s pretty strong, and we’re going to go for it.’’ Of course, then some people say, ‘‘Well is this again false flag operation? Because if this is wrong, it’s going to discredit Anonymous.’’ And then on the other hand there are others who say, ‘‘No, this is just how Anonymous acts — they’re very whimsical, experimental, and often act in the heat of the moment.’’

I think both are completely plausible. It’s definitely the case this morning, when they were debating whether to release the name and a lot of people admitted the evidence was strong but circumstantial — they still favored releasing it because it would force the police department to eventually release the real name.

Q: The police department has confirmed that the name they ID’d was incorrect.

A: I’m not surprised. I was really surprised that they released it — because again as they themselves said [on IRC], the evidence was not foolproof, but circumstantial. I looked through everything, and my assessment was there was a 50 percent chance, which is not very high, that [the shooter was] the very person who they ID’d. There was a very good chance he was at the scene, but very little evidence that he was the one who pulled the trigger. There was much better evidence that he was at the scene.

Q: How often would you say Anonymous is wrong on these things?

A: I would say, actually, more rarely. Amanda Todd is another really good example — a young woman who committed suicide, and some random folks in Anonymous New Jersey identified someone involved and were completely wrong. It would be really interesting to compare the moments and methods from when they are right and they are wrong. I do know with the rape cases [like Steubenville, Ohio] there were really teams in operation who worked with just a handful of people and were in touch with people on the ground. They were also not willing to release things until they were pretty sure about things. It would be interesting to see if it’s that kind of public/private divide combined with a small [group] versus the situation this morning, which was like dozens of people debating, ‘‘What do you guys think? Oh, well my gut says this...’’

It was very different. But generally in a lot of instances, they’ve gotten right — they’ve either ID’d people or accessed information that turned out to be legitimate information, which is slightly different.

It’s not unique that there are different strands at the very same time in conversation and in conflict with each other. I would say it’s particularly intense with this one.

Q: What do you think it says for their credibility when they get things wrong?

A: I think it definitely hurts them, because already it’s a controversial act even when it’s right. So when it’s wrong, it’s doubly controversial. And again, it’s controversial even within Anonymous. There were some people in there saying, ‘‘Can we hold off on this until there’s more research?’’

Q: Can we talk about the mechanics of how they’re going out collecting this kind of information and what sort of vetting process is typically used?

A: With some of the past operations where they have gotten things correct or landed on some important data, such as with Operation Steubenville, where they were able to get screenshots of the evening of the sexual assault, that has proceeded with very small teams in private where people were working with others on the ground — other people on Facebook who went to the same high school as the Steubenville woman, for instance. It happened in a very slow fashion. It’s pretty precise, I would say.

What I saw Thursday morning was in some ways the opposite. It was on a public IRC channel, and people were posting images of the alleged police [shooter] on IRC, posting pictures of his Facebook page and comments. They were comparing this image of him to ... one on the street, and it did look like the same person.

Then the comments were what was used as the ‘‘proof’’: Because this person had changed his name, he was trying to hide — these sort of things they felt were the basis for him being the perpetrator. Again, this was happening on the public channel, and everyone knows there are probably government authorities on the channel, so I found it a little unusual.

It’s not completely out of the ordinary in so far as operations in the past — in 2010 and 2011, [it] would often proceed in this way. But after a lot of the arrests, people became a lot more careful. In this scenario you [either] have something where people have already forgotten and there are enough newcomers that they’ve already forgotten the lessons about security, or something more nefarious is going on.

Q: Something nefarious?

A: I have, of course, no proof of anything. But it is conceivable and very easy to have planted agents on these channels and offering this information to sort of push Anonymous to release incorrect information to discredit the group. That is within the realm of the possible, given what law enforcement does with any activist organization. So why would it be any different with Anonymous?

It’s always difficult, because in some scenarios it’s definitely the case and in others it’s definitely not the case. But it is just something that’s possible. And people do talk about this and think about this. They do so a little bit more privately, but it was very different with Operation BART, which was a big Anonymous operation in August 2011. It had huge support of those in Anonymous and outside, and the first interventions were just to organize protests and publicize the issue. Then a hacker came along and hacked BART and also the police group associated with BART, releasing a bunch of names of both customers and police officers.

This was one of the very first times when people involved were like: ‘‘Is this a false flag? Is this happening to discredit Anonymous?’’ In the end there was actually very little evidence that it was a false flag, and the person who did it wrote this justification about why she went and did it — she claimed to be a 13-year-old French hacker who was hacking for the first time, which I don’t think is quite true. But ever since then, many different operations that are controversial will spur Anonymous to ask that question, understandably.

In Operation BART, I think Anonymous was central in transforming the issue from sort of a regional issue into sort of a national issue. [Ferguson] is one that became national almost right away. But then Anonymous hopped in there and definitely kind of amplified what was going on in terms of the media stories, but wasn’t necessarily essential in transforming it from kind of regional issue to national issue. But in many, many other similar operations they’ve gotten involved with in the past — with Steubenville, with BART — that was their really sort of unique and important role.

Q: Do you think that shift in how and when Anonymous came into this topic influenced who came on board — like the influx of newcomers who may be unfamiliar with their general methodology and security practices?

A: Absolutely. Also, I do think it’s really interesting to see that it’s one of the first times that we’ve seen large African-American populations on Twitter taking notice of Anonymous and starting to debate them. There’ve been some fascinating questions raised about how — because protests on the streets and marches don’t work anymore — not necessarily just in Ferguson, but in general. And of course, other people [were] being critical of what they’re doing, but it’s certainly the case that with something like Anonymous people outside the tech community seem to [notice]. Feminists came across them through the rape cases, and now the African-American population is coming across them through Ferguson. These different population come across Anonymous at very different moments, and their understanding is understandably colored by those specific operations.

Q: Can we talk about the different tactics being used here? It seems like there are almost two distinct, parallel tracks at play — a campaign to provide transparency and accountability, but also reports of people trying to hack the police department.

A: I would say that that has always been a kind of classic bifurcation in Anonymous where the great majority involved are simply wanting to publicize the issue — they’re not wanting to kind of engage in controversial actions that kind of contradict their mantra. So a lot of people in Anonymous are for privacy. But then obviously some people go ahead and hack and release people’s personal information, and that violates privacy, right?

This constantly recurs in Anonymous, where the great majority are for privacy and don’t want to see people’s privacy violated — then someone goes ahead and does that... It’s usually pretty controversial within Anonymous. That being said, I think many people wouldn’t mind having Anonymous release the name of the officer, if they got it right. And the reason for that is that they would say that the public has the right to know: He’s a public official, he did something that has grave political importance, and that name should be public. That would be uncontroversial.

Going ahead and doxing [releasing identifying information about] all sorts of other people... Some people would support that, a minority, for the purposes of getting media attention, period. It’s like, this is a mean that justifies the ends. Then there’s another kind of group that would say that it’s unnecessary — and this all exists within Anonymous. It’s always this cacophonous, discordant group where there’s some consensus on some issues and a lot of dissension on a number of the most controversial issues.

Q: You mentioned there that the great majority are really just interested in publicizing the issue. Can you go a little more into what you think the motivations are?

A: One of the things that’s really interesting and was surprising about my research was that once people started to be unveiled because of arrests and these sorts of things, Anonymous really attracts a diverse number of geeks and hackers whose motivations and political orientations are quite distinct.

For this operation, for example. Some people operating under the banner of Anonymous are classic anti-capitalist anarchists with a huge dislike of the police. Part of their reason for getting involved in this is part of that anarchist sensibility.

Many Anons are not anarchists. They have different political sensibility — from being Democrats and Social Democrats to liberals or progressive, or not identifying with any political orientation offline at all — [and] are involved because they see it as battling injustice and corruption. It’s certainly the case that with Anonymous, if one of their operations gets picked up by the media and it balloons and mushrooms, that alone seems to attract people, as well, to continue to participate in the operation. So there’s sort of a feedback loop, as well.

Q: What’s the general technical level of skill required for some of the hacking exploits being pursued by some in the group?

A: This is another interesting thing about Anonymous: It attracts those with some pretty deep technical skills to those with no technical skills — one can find a place and a home with Anonymous. Historically, and with Ferguson and OpBART and even LulzSec, many of the hacks were not rocket science, as I like to say — it’s more a reflection of the sorry state of security on the Web. That said, definitely a handful of people like Jeremy Hammond and Mustafa Al-Bassam are really, bright hackers — extremely bright. That’s, I think, the interesting thing about Anonymous — you definitely don’t need people with deep, deep skills.",3,NA,NA,NA
BostonGlobe,globe8,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/08/15/ferguson-shooting-victim-was-robbery-suspect-police-say/EnZ3K8bZjMpuhgU18ZlGFN/story.html,"Ferguson police officer didn’t know teen was robbery suspect, chief says",David A. Lieb; Alan Scher Zagier,8/15/2014,2/16/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Police on Friday identified the officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager and released documents alleging the young man had been suspected of stealing a $48.99 box of cigars from a convenience store in a ‘‘strong-arm’’ robbery shortly before he was killed.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know the teen was a robbery suspect at the time of the shooting and stopped Michael Brown and a companion ‘‘because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.’’

Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white officer, has patrolled suburban St. Louis for six years and had no previous complaints filed against him, Jackson said.

Brown’s relatives said no robbery would justify shooting the teen after he put his hands up. Family attorneys said Brown’s parents were blindsided by the allegations and the release of a surveillance video from the store.

‘‘It appears to be him,’’ attorney Daryl Parks said, referring to the footage, which he said was released without any advance notice from police.

The police chief described Wilson as ‘‘a gentle, quiet man’’ who had been ‘‘an excellent officer.’’ He has been on the Ferguson force for four years and served prior to that in the neighboring community of Jennings.

Wilson, who was placed on administrative leave after the Aug. 9 shooting, ‘‘never intended for any of this to happen,’’ Jackson said.

According to police reports released Friday, authorities received a 911 call at 11:51 a.m. on the day of the shooting reporting a robbery at the Ferguson Market. An unidentified officer was dispatched to the store, arriving within three minutes. The officer interviewed an employee and customer, who gave a description of a man who stole the cigars and walked off with another man toward a QuikTrip store.

Descriptions of the suspect were broadcast over the police radio. The officer did not find the suspects either on the street or at the QuikTrip, the reports said.

The robber took a box of Swisher Sweets, a brand of small, inexpensive cigars. The suspects were identified as 18-year-old Michael Brown and 22-year-old Dorian Johnson, according to the reports.

Separately, Wilson had been responding to a nearby call involving a sick 2-month child from 11:48 am until noon, when he left that place. A minute later, he encountered Brown walking down Canfield Drive. The documents contained no description of what happened between Brown and Wilson.

Johnson has told reporters that the officer ordered the pair to move onto the sidewalk, then grabbed his friend’s neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He said Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, noted that police did not release a photo of the officer but released images from the security video that they say show Brown grabbing a man inside the store. Crump said he had not seen the photos.

Police ‘‘are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style’’ killing, said Crump, who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.

The Aug. 9 video appears to show a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store’s door. A police report alleges that Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and ‘‘forcefully pushed him back’’ into a display rack.

Police found evidence of the stolen merchandise on Brown’s body. Authorities determined that Johnson was not involved in the robbery and will not seek charges against him, Jackson said.

Brown’s uncle, Bernard Ewing, said the shooting was unnecessary, even if his nephew was a robbery suspect.

A robbery ‘‘still doesn’t justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,’’ he added. ‘‘You still don’t shoot him in the face.’’

Brown’s death ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. The tension eased Thursday after the governor turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators.

On Friday night, the Rev. Jesse Jackson linked arms with protesters as they marched to the site where Brown was killed. Jackson bent over in front of a memorial cross and candle and sighed deeply. He urged people to ‘‘turn pain into power’’ and to ‘‘fight back, but not self-destruct’’ through violence.

The scene was eclectic Friday night as hundreds gathered for a sixth straight evening. A man on a bullhorn called for a revolution. A young man waved a Bible while citing scripture. Some took selfies in front of a convenience store that had been burned by looters Sunday. Boys tossed a football, and horns and loud music blared.

To Vida Weekly, 51, it was still a somber occasion. She walked through the crowd holding high a sign that read: ‘‘The police killed Michael Brown and now they are trying to kill his character.’’

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer’s weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street.",194,NA,NA,NA
BostonGlobe,globe9,https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/08/18/ferguson-protesters-divided-age-class/KzMCowa0BICnEXPzQeH7hN/story.html,"Ferguson protesters split on tactics, agree life must change",Akilah Johnson,8/19/2014,2/16/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — From afar, it’s easy to mistake the demonstrators in the streets of Ferguson as a monolithic movement. In fact, the men and women protesting the shooting death of Michael Brown by a local police officer are distinct groups with varied points of view — a divide that echoes those in previous generations of civil rights struggles.

There are established community leaders conducting nonviolent marches and meetings.

There are middle-class parents bringing young children to teach them the power of civil protest.

And, seen most often on the TV news, there are younger protesters using violence and looting as a potential means to an end.

“What they failed to realize is you got a bunch of people out here that would rather cause anarchy than go back to business as usual,” Toriano Johnson said as he cut a client’s hair Monday at Primetime Barbershop, which is on West Florissant Avenue, the epicenter of the ongoing unrest. “It’s like a sleeping giant has been woken up.”

And while most protesters largely decry the tactics of those who have resorted to violence, some also say they understand it.

Those who have marched along West Florissant Avenue — regardless of age or class — agree on one thing: They are tired of living under what they consider an unjust system in which African-Americans are mistreated by the police and face inequalities in education and economic opportunity in this suburb of St. Louis. They say they are fighting not just for Brown’s justice but also for their own.

“They are angry, mad, and hurting,” the Rev. Dinah Tatman said Monday afternoon. “Hurt. Hurt. Hurt. I can’t think of another word to replace hurt. They have been devalued, disenfranchised, and disillusioned.”

Tatman, head of the Greater New Vision Ministries, stood on an avenue with scant protesters Monday in a spot where, the night before, thousands of demonstrators crowded the commercial strip.

Sunday night erupted into chaos as some acted out their rage in violence, unleashing a torrent of “premeditated criminal acts designed to damage property, hurt people, provoke a response,” Captain Ron Johnson, of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, said in the wee hours of Monday morning. The police responded to shootings, looting, and vandalism with tear gas and stun grenades.

By Monday afternoon, police had forced people out of the burned-out QuikTrip gas station and convenience store parking lot, which had become a communal gathering spot.

Those protesters who remained were not allowed to assemble for long without being told to move along. So they walked back and forth along several blocks of West Florissant Avenue.

Tatman likened it to being treated like animals, pacing back and forth in a cage.

“It’s going to erupt, that pain, that anger,” she said.

And even if they don’t agree with the violence, some nod their head in approval at the attention it has generated in the nine days since Brown was killed. They say they are grateful that the nation has witnessed what residents describe as a daily occurrence: harassment and intimidation by local police.

Heavily armed police officers in riot gear and using armored vehicles responded to initial protests, which were peaceful, using tear gas and rubber bullets.

“At the end of the day, the people who come out here, they got lives. They got jobs. They got credit. So they don’t have the courage to do what these youngsters will do,” Amir Brandy, who manages a St. Louis law firm, said while helping with crowd control on Saturday. “[The young people] are willing to go all the way.”

Brandy and others now hope the aperture of the nation’s lens will widen beyond sensational images of violence and focus on systemic issues of racial and economic disparities.

Amy Kimbrough, a protester, said people now should be asking why there are no black-owned credit unions or more black-owned businesses in the area.

And those are questions that should be raised in front of City Hall, the police station, and other institutions of power that are located just a couple of miles from West Florissant Avenue, said 25-year-old Nathan Burns.

“I don’t understand why we’re doing this in our neighborhood,” the college student said Monday. “We should go out to those people who don’t understand how we feel. We understand how we feel.”

Protesters say the divergent demonstrations — peaceful and violent — should not be viewed solely through the prism of race. Economics and age play a role, too. Older, better-educated, and better-employed individuals are free of the strain and the stress of being poor.

“That’s the divide, the older and the younger,” said Johnson, the barber. “When you’re young, you can’t get a break from it.”

Then Orlando Phillips chimed in from the barber’s chair: “Then you have the third group, who are out for themselves. Opportunists causing trouble. Trying to make a profit for themselves.”",31,NA,NA,NA
BostonGlobe,globe10,https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/08/18/nightfall-brought-different-feel-streets-ferguson/u1aZIXv9OnJBg8dF07MtXN/story.html,"In Ferguson, police say crowd shifts toward violence",Akilah Johnson,8/18/2014,2/17/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Many who gathered Sunday night along West Florissant Avenue, a commercial strip in Ferguson that has become place of protest since Michael Brown was gunned down last week, were not here to demonstrate against the death of the teen by a police officer, authorities said.

They were here to act out their rage in violence, unleashing a torrent of “premeditated criminal acts designed to damage property, hurt people, provoke a response,” Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said at an early morning news conference.

According to Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, these actions have resulted in the National Guard being called to help restore order.

“These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory, and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served, and to feel safe in their own homes,” Nixon said in a statement.

There were fights among those in the crowd, and there was shooting, looting, and vandalism, Johnson said. Police responded with tear gas and stun grenades. Seven to eight people were arrested and three were injured, according to police. None of the injured were law enforcement, Johnson said.

The night had a markedly different feel to it than the days of protest, when hundreds of men and women gathered along several blocks of West Florissant Avenue to decry Brown’s death and demand answers and change in this small city in northern St. Louis County.

During the day, families walk the street, chanting what has become a common refrain, “Hands up. Don’t shoot.” Witnesses have said Brown had his hands up when a Ferguson police officer with six years of experience killed him on Aug. 9

A different element emerged Sunday night.

On Saturday the community was largely able to police itself with members of motorcycle clubs, the New Black Panther Party, and the Nation of Islam stepping in to do crowd control. That did not appear to be the case Sunday, when the local peacekeeping forces appeared to be few in number.

As Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who has been a constant presence at West Florissant Avenue since Brown’s death, tweeted Sunday, “Not enough adults out here tonight.”

At 8:25 p.m., hours before the midnight curfew, “the situation deteriorated,” Johnson said. Someone was shot at West Florissant and Ferguson avenues.

A minute later, more gunshots. Another minute: a report of someone down. Then came a report of eight people with guns.

Johnson said hundreds of protesters marched toward a shopping center anchored by a Target and serving as the police command post at 8:56 p.m.

“As the crowd approached the shopping center, multiple Molotov cocktails were thrown at police,” Johnson said. “At that time, police deployed tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd.”

Despite the crowd being filled with those who Johnson said were determined to cause violence, there were families present, too. There were women with infants in their arms and strollers. There were senior citizens.

Mothers could be heard screaming at their daughters to “Move!” and “Cover your face!” as plumes of tear gas burned eyes and choked throats. People urged demonstrators to “get out of the street,” hoping that would help stop the barrage of tear gas canisters, several of which landed in the media staging area.

When the gas had dissipated and most of the crowds dispersed, Candice Dotson, 38, stood in the McDonald’s parking lot on West Florissant, stunned and sorrowful. She had brought her 11-year-old son to the area so he could witness the power of collective action, she said.

Instead, he was tear-gassed.

He attended its schools and is raising his family in this place of suburban homes and apartment buildings on the outskirts of a struggling Midwest city. And over time, he has felt his life to be circumscribed by Ferguson’s demographics.

Moore, who is black, talks of how he has felt the wrath of the police here and in surrounding suburbs for years — roughed up during a minor traffic stop and prevented from entering a park when he was wearing St. Louis Cardinals red.

And last week, as he stood at a vigil for an unarmed 18-year-old shot dead by the police — a shooting that provoked renewed street violence and looting early Saturday — Moore heard anger welling and listened to a shout of: “We’re tired of the racist police department.”

“It broke the camel’s back,” Moore said of the killing of the teenager, Michael Brown. Referring to the northern part of St. Louis County, he continued, “The people in North County — not just African-Americans, some of the white people, too — they are tired of the police harassment.”

The origins of the area’s complex social and racial history date to the 19th century when the city of St. Louis and St. Louis County went their separate ways, leading to the formation of dozens of smaller communities outside St. Louis. As blacks moved into the city and whites moved out, real estate agents and city leaders, in a pattern familiar elsewhere in the country, conspired to keep blacks out of the suburbs through the use of zoning ordinances and restrictive covenants.

These days, Ferguson is like many of the suburbs around St. Louis, inner-ring towns that accommodated white flight decades ago but that are now largely black. And yet they retain a white power structure.

Although about two in three Ferguson residents are black, its mayor and five of its six City Council members are white. Only three of the town’s 53 police officers are black.

Turnout for local elections in Ferguson has been poor. The mayor, James W. Knowles III, noted his disappointment with the turnout — about 12 percent — in the most recent mayoral election during a City Council meeting in April. Patricia Bynes, a black woman who is the Democratic committeewoman for the Ferguson area, said the lack of black involvement in local government was partly the result of the black population’s being more transient in small municipalities and less attached to them.

There is also some frustration among blacks who say town government is not attuned to their concerns.

Aliyah Woods, 45, once petitioned Ferguson officials for a sign that would warn drivers that a deaf family lived on that block. But the sign never came. “You get tired,” she said. “You keep asking, you keep asking. Nothing gets done.”

Moore, who recently moved to neighboring Florissant, said he had attended a couple of Ferguson Council meetings to complain that the police should be patrolling the residential streets to try to prevent break-ins rather than lying in wait to catch people for traffic violations.

This year, community members voiced anger after the all-white school board for the Ferguson-Florissant district pushed aside its black superintendent for unrevealed reasons. That spurred several blacks to run for board positions, but only one won a seat.

The St. Louis County Police Department fired a white lieutenant last year for ordering officers to target blacks in shopping areas. That resulted in the department’s enlisting researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, to study whether the department was engaging in racial profiling.

And in recent years, two school districts in North County lost their accreditation. One, Normandy, serves parts of Ferguson. When parents in the mostly black district sought to allow their children to transfer to schools in mostly white districts, they said, they felt a backlash with racial undertones.

Ferguson’s economic shortcomings reflect the struggles of much of the region. Its median household income of about $37,000 is less than the statewide number, and its poverty level of 22 percent outpaces the state’s by seven percentage points.

In Ferguson, residents say most racial tensions have to do with an overzealous police force.

“It is the people in a position of authority in our community that have to come forward,” said Jerome Jenkins, 47, who, with his wife, Cathy, owns Cathy’s Kitchen, a downtown Ferguson restaurant.

“What you are witnessing is our little small government has to conform to the change that we are trying to do,” Jenkins added. “Sometimes things happen for a purpose; maybe we can get it right.”

Ferguson’s police chief, Thomas Jackson, has been working with the Justice Department’s community relations team on improving interaction with residents.

Although experience and statistics suggest that Ferguson’s police force disproportionately targets blacks, it is not as imbalanced as in some neighboring departments in St. Louis County. While blacks are 37 percent more likely to be pulled over compared with their proportion of the population in Ferguson, that is less than the statewide average of 59 percent, according to Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

In fact, Rosenfeld said, Ferguson did not fit the profile of one that would be a spark for civil unrest. The town has “pockets of disadvantage” and middle and upper-middle income families. He said Ferguson had benefited in the last five to 10 years from economic growth in the northern part of the county, such as the expansion of Express Scripts, the Fortune 500 health care giant.

“Ferguson does not stand out as the type of community where you would expect tensions with the police to boil over into violence and looting,” Rosenfeld said.

But the memory of the county’s racial history lingers.

In 1949, a mob of whites showed up to attack blacks who lined up to get into the pool at Fairground Park in north St. Louis after it had been desegregated.

In the 1970s, a court battle over public school inequality led to a settlement that created a desegregation busing program that exists to this day.

A Ferguson city councilman caused a stir in 1970 when he used racially charged language to criticize teenagers from the neighboring town of Kinloch for throwing rocks and bottles at homes in Ferguson. The councilman, Carl Kersting, said, “We should call a black a black, and not be afraid to face up to these people,” according to an article in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.

Eventually blacks broke down the barriers in the inner ring of suburbs, and whites fled farther out. But whites fought hard to protect their turf.

In the mid-1970s, Alyce Herndon, a black woman, moved with her family to what was then the mostly white town of Jennings in St. Louis County. She said some of their white neighbors stuck an Afro pick in their front lawn and set it on fire. Herndon also recalled tensions flaring between black and white students at her school after the television miniseries “Roots” first aired in 1977.

For all its segregation and discrimination, St. Louis did not have the major riots and unrest during the 1960s that was seen across the country.

St. Louis’ black leaders “were able to pressure businesses and schools to open their doors to black people and employers to hire black workers,” Stefan Bradley, the director of African-American studies at St. Louis University, wrote in an email. “These concessions may have been enough to prevent St. Louis from taking what many believed to be the next step toward redress of injustice: violent rebellion.”

But the fatal shooting of Brown has brought submerged tensions to the surface.

“St. Louis never has had its true race moment, where they had to confront this,” said Bynes, the Democratic committeewoman. Without that moment, she added, blacks have been complacent when it comes to local politics. “I’m hoping that this is what it takes to get the pendulum to swing the other way.”

Herndon, 49, said she moved her family to Ferguson in 2003 because she felt it was a good community, safer than the unincorporated portion of the county where they lived previously and with better schools for her children.

The neighborhood, she said, offers everything — places to shop, eat and drink. There is a farmers market on Saturdays. She frequents a wine bar across from a lot where a band plays on Fridays. She has white and Asian neighbors on either side of her, and there are other black families on her block. She has not experienced the racial tensions of her childhood in St. Louis County, she said, but she understands that the younger generation is living a different experience than she is.

“I understand the anger because it’s psychological trauma when you see so many people being shot or people being falsely accused,” said Herndon, who over the past week has avoided the streets that have been filled with tear gas and rubber bullets in clashes between police and protesters.

But now, a population of young black men who often feel forgotten actually feel that people are finally listening.

“If it wasn’t for the looting,” said one man, who declined to give his name, “we wouldn’t get the attention.”

Moore went one step further. He did not condone the violence that erupted during some of the protests. But he understood the frustration, he said. And if he were younger, he said, he probably would have joined them.",5,NA,NA,NA

Fox,8/18/2014,2/17/2016,"Nearly 200 pairs of hands were raised inside Old South Church on Sunday as the clergy and congregation blessed 1,000 delicate origami cranes bound for a Missouri church working to heal a fractured community.

“O God, when we first laid eyes on these cranes, they were prayers for peace in this city crying out for peace,” prayed the Rev. John M. Edgerton. “But you, you have transformed them. . . . We have been audacious enough to pray both for justice and for peace for the people of Boston, and that is our prayer for the people of Ferguson, Missouri.”

The folded paper birds, vividly colored in a wild array of patterns, came to Old South Church last year, after bombs exploded just yards away as runners crossed the Boston Marathon finish line. In the past three years, they have traveled more than 1,100 miles carrying prayers for peace to three communities shaken by violent killings.

A Wisconsin congregation created the cranes, symbolizing peace, for the 10th anniversary of the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, then passed them on to a Chardon, Ohio, church after the February 2012 shootings at Chardon High School.

After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn., that December, the cranes traveled to Newtown Congregational Church, which hand-delivered them to Boston following the Marathon bombings.

Old South Church chose to send the cranes to Christ the King United Church of Christ in Florissant, Mo., following the fatal shooting Aug. 9 in neighboring Ferguson, of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer and ensuing demonstrations that have erupted in violent clashes between protesters and police.

Church leaders hope to have a representative fly with the cranes to Missouri and hand-deliver them to the congregation during next Sunday’s worship service.

Edgerton, 32, said church members feel connected to residents of these St. Louis suburbs in part because, like Bostonians in the aftermath of the bombings, they have been the subject of national and international attention. And much as Boston experienced an outpouring of support following the attacks, he believes Bostonians have an obligation to offer their support.

“The care and the love that really came to Boston from around the country as the result of the Boston Marathon bombings, I think that that was amazing,” he said, “and it puts on us as a city the responsibility to try to be healers in the country.”

The Rev. Traci D. Blackmon, pastor of the Missouri church, said in a phone interview that the gift of the cranes was deeply meaningful for her and the congregation.

“It’s absolutely phenomenal,” Blackmon said. “It’s a constant, tangible reminder that there are others that are praying with you and you’re not alone.”

In the days since Brown’s death, Blackmon said, her church sponsored a community prayer vigil that included leaders from many faiths and denominations and has organized a community forum attended by Ferguson’s mayor and chief of police, Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri, and other elected officials.

“It was a good opportunity for members of the community to be able to hear directly from them and ask questions about things that concerned them,” she said.

As tensions continue to roil the community, she said, the church is gathering signatures on petitions to change local laws and to recall some elected officials. It is also helping to connect mental health counselors and prayer partners with residents who have experienced trauma amid the violence, she said.

“We have to care for the caretakers, because this is going to be a long battle,” Blackmon said. “To be honest with you, if a policeman wants to come get prayer, that’s fine too. . . . There is no us-against-them. This is a right-against-wrong fight.”

At Old South Church, Brookline resident Deb Washington said it was moving to her, as “an African-American person in this congregation . . . that we can send a symbol of healing to a community that is in desperate need of some sort of statement that somebody cares.”

Washington, 62, said violence in Ferguson brought back memories from her youth in Louisiana. “I grew up in the Jim Crow South, so my immediate reflection is, here comes the ’60s again,” she said. “Instead of using firehoses, now we’re using tear gas. . . . It’s just repeated history with different kinds of weapons. But the issues remain the same.”

Flo Charles, 45, said sending the cranes to Missouri was consistent with the theme of Sunday’s sermon: inclusion of all people — regardless of race, nationality, sexual orientation, or gender identity — in the family of God.

“We should pray for the peace of the earth, of the whole world,” said Charles, daughter of a British mother and a West African father. “These cranes are like a symbol of Christ, symbolizing Christ’s message — of love.”",4,NA,NA,NA

BostonGlobe,globe14,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/08/15/tensions-flare-ferguson-response-disclosures/MZchIODfsXrDgqgGul6rDJ/story.html,"Ferguson, Mo., tensions flare following disclosures",Wesley Lowery,8/16/2014,3/8/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Authorities in this restive suburb of St. Louis on Friday began telling their version of the events surrounding the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer, but the halting, contradictory nature of the account revived popular anger here and brought criticism from other law enforcement agencies.

Nearly a week after 18-year-old Michael Brown’s death sparked days of protests, police identified the officer who killed him as Darren Wilson, who has six years of service with no disciplinary record. But they provided virtually no information about the officer, instead focusing on linking Brown to a convenience store robbery that occurred just before the shooting.

At a tense early-morning news conference, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Brown had been the prime suspect in that robbery — in which several boxes of cigars were stolen — and that his description was broadcast over police frequencies just before his encounter with Wilson. Police dramatized the allegation, releasing security camera photos showing a person they identified as Brown towering over and menacing the store clerk, images that were circulated nationwide.

Yet, despite the implication that Brown had been stopped because of the robbery, Jackson later appeared to reverse himself, saying at a second news conference that the confrontation ‘‘was not related to the robbery’’ at all. Instead, he said, Brown was stopped because he and a friend were walking in the street.

Hours later, Jackson returned again to the robbery theme, telling the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the officer saw cigars in Brown’s hand and realized he might be the robber.

The confusion not only did little to calm tensions roiling this community of 21,000 but appeared to further inflame them. Scattered protests continued, and the police actions drew a rebuke from Brown’s family, which accused Jackson of deliberately besmirching the teen’s character.

‘‘The family feels that was strategic,’’ Anthony Gray, a lawyer for Brown’s family, said during a news conference Friday. ‘‘They feel it was aimed at denigrating their son. It was an attempt at character assassination.’’

Added Eric Davis, a cousin of Brown’s mother: ‘‘It infuriated us.’’

There were also signs Friday of a rift among state and local authorities involved in the case, only one day after political and community leaders mounted a renewed effort to tamp down the violence and find ways to prevent future outbreaks while multiple investigations of the shooting proceed.

In an unusual public disagreement, the law enforcement official newly in charge of security in Ferguson appeared to question the decision to name Brown as a robbery suspect. ‘‘I would have liked to have been consulted,’’ Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ronald Johnson said Friday, adding that he would meet with Jackson to discuss ‘‘how that was released.’’

Johnson, who is black and grew up in the Ferguson area, had been put in charge on Thursday by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon when the governor announced that the state highway patrol would take over security operations after days of images of heavily armed police and tear gas in the streets.

Law enforcement officials typically strive to present a united front, yet Nixon’s decision prompted an unusual public attack from St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, who was angered that the move would take control of the scene away from St. Louis County police. ‘‘For Nixon to never talk to the commanders in the field and come in here and take this action is disgraceful,’’ McCulloch told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ‘‘It’s shameful what he did.’’

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley later said he is leading an effort to remove the county prosecutor from the investigation because of bias. McCulloch is the person who will decide whether state charges will be filed against the police officer.

It was not clear Friday whether the evident turf battles would hamper the state investigation of Brown’s shooting. The Justice Department and FBI, which are conducting a parallel investigation to determine whether Brown’s civil rights were violated, are deferring for now to state investigators but are also monitoring them.

The announcements from police identifying the officer and naming Brown as a robbery suspect came after the calmest night in Ferguson since Brown was killed. His death has sparked outrage and protests, with hundreds marching in the streets in the days that followed.

Little information about the shooting has been publicly released, and the media frenzy to learn more about Wilson yielded only scattered bits of information.

A few days ago, Wilson, 28 , who has been placed on administrative leave, left his neighborhood in Crestwood, a city of 11,000 people about 18 miles southwest of Ferguson. Dark blue undercover police cars were parked outside his house on Manda Lane, with a marked police car in the parking lot of a church to the rear of the house.

The sequence of events in Brown’s shooting is unclear. According to a friend who says he witnessed the encounter, Brown was walking on a street when a police officer in a car ordered him to get on the sidewalk. Brown had his hands in the air to show he was unarmed when the officer shot him multiple times, the friend said. The police version is that Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to grab his gun.",51,NA,NA,NA
