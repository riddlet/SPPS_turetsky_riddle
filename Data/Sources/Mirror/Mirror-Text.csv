Crying in pain from tear gas that police used on protesters, I am taken aback as an officer barks: “Walk towards the sound of my voice. Get your hands up. Up. Let me see them.”

He was quickly joined by a dozen other armed police, all shouting similar orders at me before they manhandled me, patting me down in the search for weapons.

Thankfully, their lieutenant stepped in, saying: “He doesn’t look like a looter or a criminal. Common-sense, guys.

“He’s in a suit, for Christ’s sake. How many protest in a suit? Let him go.”

I found myself in this {volatile chaos}<hyperlink=”http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ferguson-riots-police-come-under-4073379”> in the early hours yesterday during the mayhem on the streets of Ferguson.

There have been angry protests in the city in Missouri since unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by a white police officer on August 9.

For nine nights, the crowds – sometimes up to 400 strong – were confronted by police armed with smoke bombs, tear gas, stun grenades, rifles and rubber bullets.The National Guard – America’s part-time civilian army – took to Ferguson’s streets for the first time on Monday night, but rather than calming tensions, there was another torrent of violence.

I had 25 armed officers training their assault rifles on my chest as one of them yelled, “Who the f*** are you?”

But we managed to circumnavigate the armoured barricades to see at first-hand the violence that has erupted.

As gun shots from the protesters pierced the night air – leaving one man suffering serious wounds – we stood a few feet away as more than 300 heavily armed officers kept looters and thugs at bay.

Looking menacingly through his gas mask, holding a gun and a 4ft-long baton, a 6ft 7in officer screamed at me: “I saw a man with a gun down there. Are you f****** stupid? Get out of here now. You understand me? NOW.”

It was quickly apparent why there was such an urgent need to clear the area.

The time was 12.50am on Tuesday and a group of 40 bandanna-clad men had made their way towards the police blockade. The mob held their hands aloft to mimic the pose Michael is said to have adopted before he was shot.

The crowd taunted officers with cries of: “Indict, convict, throw dirty cops in jail! The whole damn system is guilty as hell!” As the crowd edged closer, the order was given for officers in riot gear to put on their protective masks.

What followed was the booming voice of a commanding officer who yelled: “We’re going to go and gas the f*** out of them. Get ready. Get prepared.”Two heavily armoured trucks, with riot police mounted on top, broke free from the blockade to drive at speed towards the crowd. I counted 18 canisters of CS gas being fired among protesters who fled the Maline Creek stronghold close to Cranfield Drive where Michael, 18, was killed.

Within minutes, the smoke filled the air, leaving one officer bent double as he struggled to cope with the pain in his eyes and throat. Quickly, his colleagues came to his aid and poured water on his face. But as we watched on, the tear gas took hold of my colleague and I.The fumes made us almost sick. As we stumbled away, we walked into a another barricade of armed police.

This is when the officer ordered me to put my hands up. Despite the tension in the air, the lieutenant who then pointed out that I was not a looter played down the night’s violence.

He told me: “It was fairly peaceful. This has been the pattern – once it gets dark, the crowd seems to turn over.

“It becomes younger, more rambunctious if you will, more agitated.”

The officer said there were around 300 police on patrol, working 12-hour shifts with all leave cancelled.

“One man was shot tonight and gunfire has been heard throughout the night,” he added as me and my colleague made our way to safety.

In total, two were injured and 31 were arrested during the tense stand-offs.

Police have said Darren Wilson – the 28-year-old officer who shot Michael – was pushed into his car by the teenager before being physically assaulted in a struggle over his weapon.

At least one shot was fired inside the vehicle before the furious altercation spilled on to the street where Michael was blasted six times.Michael’s friend Dorian Johnson, 22, who says he was with the “gentle giant” at the time, claimed the officer had tried to grab Michael while attempting to pull him into his car.

Dorian said that as the teenager escaped from the vehicle, the officer gave chase and kept firing.

News of the killing quickly engulfed the tight-knit community.

Within hours what had been a simmering cauldron of racial tensions in the city boiled over into violence, as looters and vandals robbed and burnt down properties.

Now, standing on these ravaged streets with hundreds of police and soldiers on patrol, this could easily be mistaken for war-torn Iraq or Ukraine.",NA,237,NA,NA
Mirror,mirror2,http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ferguson-riots-police-come-under-4073379,Ferguson riots: Police come under heavy fire as officers arrest journalists and Holocaust survivor,Richard Hartley-Parkinson,08/19/2014,02/17/2016,"Trouble continued for a ninth night following the death of black teenager Michael Brown who was shot by a white police officer. 

Police have come under 'heavy fire' as trouble continued in Ferguson, Missouri, last night, more than a week after a black teenager was shot dead by a white police officer.

As the National Guard was called in to help restore calm, it was also revealed that a photographer and a Holocaust survivor were among {31 people arrested in continuing protests over the incident.}<hyperlink=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/michael-brown-shooting-blacks-twice-4073013"">

""Not a single bullet was fired by officers despite coming under heavy attack,"" State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson told a news conference.

""Our officers came under heavy gunfire,"" in one area, he said, and riot police had confiscated two guns from protesters and what looked like a petrol bomb.

The latest disturbances came at the end of a day in which a pathologist hired by Michael Brown's family said the unarmed {18-year-old suffered a bullet wound to his right arm}<hyperlink=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/michael-brown-shooting-harrowing-video-4072685""> that may indicate his hands were up or his back was turned.

But the pathologist said the team that examined Mr Brown cannot be sure yet exactly how the wounds were inflicted until they have more information.

An independent post-mortem examination determined that Mr Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, the family's lawyers and hired pathologists said.

Witnesses have said the teenager's hands were above his head when he was repeatedly shot by an officer in Ferguson on August 9.

Protesters filled the streets after nightfall, and officers used bullhorns to order them to disperse.

Among those arrested was Getty photographer Scott Olson despite Barrack Obama saying: ""Police should not be arresting journalists for doing their jobs.""

Last week two journalists from Buzzfeed were also detained briefly while filing reports in a McDonalds.

Elsewhere 90-year-old Holocaust survivor Hedy Epstein was arrested during a protest in St Louis after blocking the office of Missouri Governor Jay Nixon.

Police deployed noisemakers and armoured vehicles to push demonstrators back. During one confrontation, officers fired tear gas and flash grenades. There were no reports of serious injuries.

After the streets had been mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave as well, citing the risk from gunfire that had been reported.

Crowd control remained the responsibility of police, with most of the National Guard units that had been summoned by Governor Jay Nixon keeping their distance from the protests and protecting a police staging area.

In Washington, President Barack Obama said the vast majority of protesters in Ferguson were peaceful, but warned that a small minority was undermining justice.

During a brief pause in his summer holiday, Mr Obama said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to ""listen and not just shout"".

The president also weighed in for the first time publicly on the militarisation of some local police departments, saying it would probably be useful to examine how federal grants had been used to allow local police to purchase military-style equipment.

Attorney General Eric Holder was due to travel to Ferguson later this week to meet FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Mr Brown's death.

Mr Obama said he also spoke to Mr Nixon about his deployment of the National Guard in Ferguson and urged the governor to ensure the Guard was used in a limited way. 

Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells, who assisted former New York City chief medical examiner Dr Michael Baden during the private post-mortem, said a bullet grazed Mr Brown's right arm. He said the wound indicated that the teenager may have had his back to the gunman, or he could have been facing the officer with his hands above his head or in a defensive position across his chest or face.

""We don't know,"" Mr Parcells said. ""We still have to look at the other (elements) of this investigation before we start piecing things together.""

A third and final post-mortem examination was performed yesterday for the Justice Department by one of the military's most experienced medical examiners, the attorney general said.

Also yesterday, Governor Nixon lifted the neighbourhood's midnight-to-5am curfew two days after it went into effect when he declared a state of emergency.

He said the National Guard troops would be under the direction of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, which is overseeing security during protests.

Police told protesters yesterday that they could not assemble in a single spot, saying they had to keep moving. In federal court, a judge denied a request from the American Civil Liberties Union for a restraining order that would have prevented authorities from enforcing the rule.

Two men were arrested for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse, police said. A photographer from the Getty photo agency was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released.

Authorities were also establishing a designated protest zone for nightly demonstrations. The plan was announced yesterday by St Louis County police. It was not clear what would happen to those who refuse to use the area along the avenue where the majority of protests have occurred.

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence tomorrow to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged over Mr Brown's death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St Louis County's prosecuting attorney.

The St Louis County medical examiner's post-mortem found that Mr Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said yesterday. But she declined to comment further, saying the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.
 

Family lawyer Benjamin Crump said Mr Brown's parents wanted the additional post-mortem because they feared results of the county's examination could be biased. Mr Crump declined to release copies of the report.""They could not trust what was going to be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child,"" he said during a news conference with Mr Parcells and Dr Baden, who has given evidence in several high-profile cases, including the OJ Simpson murder trial.

The second post-mortem, Mr Crump said, ""verifies that the witness accounts were true: that he was shot multiple times"".

Dr Baden said one of the bullets entered the top of Mr Brown's skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when he suffered that fatal injury. The hired pathologists said the teenager, who also was shot four times in the right arm, could have survived the other bullet wounds.

Dr Baden also said there was no gunpowder residue on Mr Brown's body, indicating he was not shot at close range. However, Dr Baden said he did not have access to the teenager's clothing, and that it was possible the residue could be on the clothing.

Mr Crump also noted that Mr Brown had abrasions on his face from where he fell to the ground, but there was ""otherwise no evidence of a struggle"".",NA,13,NA,NA

According to NewsChannel 5, the today's shooting in St Louis city happened around 12.30pm after a suspect tried to rob a convenience store with a knife.

He was challenged by the shop's owner, who called the cops when the man began ""acting erratically"" and grabbing his waistband. The suspect is then said to have ""brandished a knife"" when police arrived and tried to attack an officer outside the shop.

He was shot and pronounced dead at the scene. Sky News reports the victim was a 23-year-old African-American man.

There have been immediate appeals for calm, with St Louis Alderman Antonio French tweeting: ""We've had an officer involved shooting in St Louis City. Here at the scene to keep the crown calm & find out exactly what happened. #peace""

He added that a crowd had already gathered at the crime scene, and tweeted a short video of those gathered around police as they tried to give an update on the situation.

St Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson tweeted this evening: ""Today St Louis MO Police officers received a call for a subject who appeared agitated & was armed with a knife. Suspect yelled kill me now & approahced.

""Officers gave suspect verbal commands. Officers feared for their safety and both officers fired their weapons. Suspect is deceased.""

""Officers are on administrative duty per department policy. The investigation continues.""

Ferguson Police Department named the officer as tens of thousands of people gathered in protests across the US today.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson announced the name at a press conference held near a QuikTrip convenience store that had been burned amid protests over the shooting of Michael Brown, 18, last Saturday.

Police also released video from a different convenience store where a robbery had taken place on Saturday before the shooting.

He did not say what, if any, link there was between Brown and the robbery. Jackson said he would answer reporters’ questions at another briefing later on Friday. 

""I cannot discuss the investigation about the attempted apprehension of the suspect in the strong-arm robbery,"" he said.

""That goes to the county prosecutor’s office."" Ferguson police had earlier withheld the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing security concerns.

The officer is a six-year veteran on the force with a good record, officials have said. He was placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting.

Police had withheld Wilson’s name because of fears that he could be harmed amid the volatile protests that followed Brown’s death.

It came as tens of thousands of people across America attended protest vigils for the Missouri teenager.

As riot police once again took to the street to quell growing racial tensions, more than 90 cities took part in a National Moment of Silence, days after the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown and the death of a New York man caused by a police officer’s chokehold.

However, the 18-year-old’s family said that {no robbery would justify the shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/shooting""> and slammed the Ferguson Police Department for tarnishing Brown’s reputation.

Hours after the robbery report was released police said the officer had no idea Brown was a robbery suspect, and simply wanted him to move from the sidewalk.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told a news conference: ""He was walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic. That was it.”

Five hours after releasing the robbery incident report Chief Jackson, when prompted, said Wilson did not know about the robbery when he encountered Brown.

The report suggested Wilson had been responding to a nearby call involving a sick child, when descriptions of Brown and another man were broadcast over the police radio as robbery suspects.

Shortly afterwards Wilson came across Brown walking down the street, but the papers contained no description of what happened between the two. 

The decision by the overwhelmingly white police department to release a report on the robbery while keeping details of the shooting secret has added to the frustration felt by many in the St. Louis area.

But as protests entered their sixth night, some of the tension appeared to have died down after local forces were replaced by state police, led by a black captain.

Outside a burned-out building where protesters were shot with rubber bullets two days ago, the scene resembled a summer carnival.

Unarmed Michael, 18, was shot dead by a cop in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, sparking days of civil unrest in the neighbourhood.

A survey of 1,000 adults by the Pew Research Center has found that 80 percent of African-Americans believe the case raises important issues about race compared to 37 percent of whites

The poll also showed that around two-thirds of blacks think the police went too far when responding to the resulting civil unrest compared to one-third of whites.

In an interview on MSNBC's ""Politics Nation,"" McSpadden said Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Michael, should be in custody while the investigation continues.

Referring to the results of the private autopsy, he said: ""If I was to go out there and brutally murder someone and shoot them six times, ask yourself, would I be incarcerated? The answer is yes.

""America is built on people coming together at times like this, and now is the time for my president to step forward,"" he said. ""I want to say this to my president: I voted for you, so you ought to able to meet with me.""

Meanwhile, a video has been revealed apparently showing the moment Wilson paces backwards and forwards near Michael's body as it lays on the ground.

Cop Wilson, 28, can be seen talking to another police officer and pacing close to the dead body of the 18-year-old.

The footage was taken by Piaget Crenshaw who lives in an apartment overlooking the scene in Ferguson, Missouri.

In the upsetting footage, which was taken on a mobile phone, Ms Crenshaw says: 'God bless his soul, police shot this boy outside my apartment.'

Speaking to CNN today, she says she knew something was 'not right' and claims she saw the moment the teenager was shot dead.

'I knew the police shouldn't have been chasing this boy and firing at the same time. And the fact he got shot in his face, something clicked in me and I thought someone else should see this so I recorded.'

Ms Crenshaw said it had appeared as though Wilson had attempted to pull the teenager into a police cruiser in the moments before the shooting.

But she claims Michael managed to get away but after turning around he was shot a number of times.

She added: 'He was running away and when he [Brown] turned around he was shot.'

America’s National Guard has been called in to control mobs that have been causing mayhem since the shooting.

Violence escalated on Sunday night in Ferguson, which has been rocked by protests, looting and arson since Michael was killed.

A 400-strong crowd clashed with police. Rioters fired shots and hurled Molotov cocktails and stones.

Massed-ranks of cops responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and smoke grenades - making the St Louis suburb resemble a war zone. Some involved were just 10.

Rioting has continued for a fourth night as racial tensions grow between police and a community where an unarmed black teenager was shot dead.

Around 350 protesters were faced with tear gas, stun grenades and smoke bombs as officers tried to disperse them last night.

Some demonstrators hurled rocks at police as others scattered down side streets and into cars, while smoke engulfed the area.

An eyewitness saw two young men preparing what appeared to be petrol bombs in a bus-stop shelter, their faces covered by bandanas.

Protesters have gathered every night {since Saturday when 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death}<hyperlink=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mike-brown-shooting-unarmed-teens-4035824""> in the mostly black suburb of St. Louis, during what authorities said was a struggle over a gun in a police car.

Obama, who is vacationing on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, was briefed on Wednesday night about events in Ferguson by senior advisor Valerie Jarrett and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the White House said.

About 40 protesters have been arrested since Saturday.

Police have sent a heavy deployment of camouflage-clad officers in body armor, including one manning a rifle on a tripod atop an armored car, to Ferguson.

""I've had enough of being pushed around because of the color of my skin. I'm sick of this police brutality,"" said one protester who only gave his first name, Terrell, 18.

""I'm going to keep coming back here night after night until we get justice,"" he said.

Police have been slow to release information about the shooting, except to say that it followed a struggle between the unnamed officer and Brown, and that the officer was treated at a hospital for swelling on the side of his face.

One witness who was walking with Brown at the time has said in media interviews that Brown put his hands in the air and was not struggling with the officer. He said the officer fired multiple times into Brown's head and chest.

The witness, Dorian Johnson, was expected to meet on Wednesday with prosecutors and investigators, local media reported. His lawyer, Freeman Bosley, a former St. Louis mayor, did not immediately answer requests for comment.

Another witness, Tiffany Mitchell, told CNN she watched Brown and the officer ""tussling through the window,"" with the officer pulling the teen in as he struggled to get away, and then a ""shot was fired through the window.""

""The kid he finally gets away and he starts running. As he runs, the police get out of his vehicle and he follows behind him shooting,"" Mitchell said, adding that Brown turned around and put his hands in the air.

""And the cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks the concrete.""

Police have declined to release the name of the officer involved in the incident, citing concerns for his safety, a decision that has been criticized by demonstrators. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson told reporters his priority was improving race relations in Ferguson, which has seen a stark demographic shift in recent decades, going from mostly white to mostly black. About two-thirds of the town's 21,000-strong population are black. On a police force of 53, three officers are black.

""This is an opportunity to fix what's wrong,"" he said.

The local Ferguson-Florissant school district meanwhile postponed its first day of classes until Monday, cancelling classes for this Thursday and Friday.

As the protest swelled on Wednesday night, journalists Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of Huffington Post were briefly arrested inside a fast-food restaurant.

Meanwhile, police in California were investigating a separate incident of an officer fatally shooting an unarmed 25-year-old black man in Los Angeles.

On social media, groups claiming to be associated with the Anonymous hacker activist group called for nationwide protests and threatened to reveal personal information about Ferguson police officers.

Massed-ranks of cops responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and smoke grenades - making the St Louis suburb resemble a war zone. Some involved were just 10.

Friends of Brown claim he had his arms in the air.

Also on Sunday supporters of policeman Wilson, now on enforced leave, rallied to support him wearing t-shirts printed with ‘I stand by Darren Wilson’.

Friends of Brown claim he had his arms in the air.

An hour into Sunday’s violence police held an impromptu press conference.

Missouri Highway Patrol captain Ron Johnson, the black officer brought in to take over security, blamed “premeditated criminal acts” intended to provoke the police.

""We had to act to protect lives and property,” he said.

He confirmed his officers had been fired on with their command centre in a shopping mall targeted.

Capt Johnson said shortly before 9pm hundreds of protesters arrived throwing “multiple Molotov cocktails at police.”

He added: “There were shootings, looting, vandalism, and other acts of violence, clearly not spontaneous.”

Police also said a nearby McDonalds had also been seized by the angry mob.

It finally dispersed after being hit by a volley of tear gas.

Barricades set up near a burned-out store were bulldozed by police armoured cars.

Protester Martin McDonald said: “Tear gas - I’ve never seen it escalate to that point. It was unbelievable.”

Later it was announced all schools in the Ferguson-Florissant district are to remain closed until further notice.

Missouri governor Jay Nixon has appealed for calm, saying: “A day of hope, prayers and peaceful protests was marred by the violent criminal acts of an organised and growing number of individuals.”

Deploying the National Guard, a reserve military force, marks a major escalation of the crackdown on unrest.

A midnight to 5am curfew has been imposed.

Also on Sunday supporters of policeman Wilson, now on enforced leave, rallied to support him wearing t-shirts printed with ‘I stand by Darren Wilson’.

Dr Michael Baden concluded one of the gunshot wounds was in the top of the teenager's skull, indicating he may have been bent forward when the bullet hit and killed him in Ferguson, Missouri, last week.

The Justice Department is due to perform its own post mortem examination, following the private autopsy and one carried out by local officials, due to the ""extraordinary circumstances involved in this case"".

The news came overnight as cops fired smoke grenades at at a crowd protesting against the killing of an unarmed black teenager.

The canisters were shot as up to 400 people, including families with children, who had gathered to express their anger at the death of Mr Brown.

The police drove into the protest area in armoured vehicles and shot smoke canisters during a demo that had until then appeared to be peaceful.

The Missouri Highway Patrol said it used the devices to disperse ""aggressors"" who were trying to infiltrate a law enforcement command post.

It added that the armoured vehicles were deployed to ensure public safety.

The unrest followed the earlier introduction of a curfew i in a bid to quell violence following the death of Brown, who was shot dead by white police officer Darren Wilson.

Wilson is currently on administrative leave.

He was critically injured as a mob of around 200 defied the 12am to 5am ban on all movement and overran a restaurant to hold a rooftop protest.

Civil rights leader Al Sharpton called for peace as trouble continued, eight days after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead by Officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri.

He said: ""One person was shot last night, and we don't know if it was related to the protest or not, or who shot them, but we do not need more people hurt to stop the hurt.""

Violence broke out in the St Louis suburb when police stepped in to halt the restaurant siege.

Seven protesters were arrested.

The critically injured man was not believed to have been shot by the police.

At one point a man brandished a handgun at officers who took to armoured cars and warned the mob to disperse.

Scores of reinforcements arrived in body armour, armed with batons.

As they took up position SWAT teams patrolled with rifles.

Facing Molotov cocktails from the rioters, officers put on their gas masks and fired the first of 18 tear gas canisters into the crowd at 1am.

Chants of ""no justice, no curfew"" rang out as a masked rioter threw a smoking canister back at police.

Some protesters simply held their hands up mimicking the pose Brown was said to have adopted just before he was shot dead.

Missouri governor Jay Nixon said yesterday that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow looters to endanger the community of Ferguson.

One local business owner said: ""The police said they would protect us and our livelihoods but so far they have failed.

""Everyone's worried for their safety and if this continues someone else will get killed.

""Already someone is fighting for life after being shot.

""Unless this is stopped it's a matter of time before someone else ends up in the mortuary.""

Tear gas and smoke cannisters were also fired into the crowd of protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, where a curfew has been put in place between midnight and 5am.

Remaining protesters - chanting ""No justice! No curfew!"" - refused to leave the area.

As five armoured tactical vehicles approached the crowd, officers spoke through a loudspeaker: ""You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately. Failure to comply, may result in arrest.""

As officers put on gas masks, a chant from the distant crowd emerged: ""We have the right to assemble peacefully.""

A moment later, police began firing smoke into the crowd of protesters.

Missouri governor Jay Nixon said yesterday that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow looters to endanger the community of Ferguson, where {18-year-old Michael Brown was shot in a street}<hyperlink=“http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/michael-brown-shooting-dramatic-pictures-4058686”>.

""I am committed to making sure the forces of peace and justice prevail,"" Mr Nixon said during a press conference at a church that was interrupted repeatedly by people objecting to the curfew and demanding that the officer who shot Mr Brown be charged with murder.

""We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching,"" Mr Nixon, who also declared a state of emergency, said.

State statute gives the governor broad powers when he or she declares a state of emergency, but Mr Nixon has not indicated that he plans to do anything other than impose the curfew and empower the state highway patrol to enforce it.

The curfew announcement came after tensions again flared in Ferguson. Earlier, local {police identified the officer who shot Mr Brown as Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=“http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ferguson-darren-wilson-named-police-4055735”> and released documents and video footage claiming that Mr Brown had robbed a convenience store just before he was shot.

Police said Officer Wilson was unaware Mr Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking with a friend.

Mr Nixon said the US Department of Justice was stepping up its civil rights investigation of the shooting.

As the curfew approached, New Black Panther Party leader Malik Shabazz roamed the street with a bullhorn, encouraging people to leave for their own safety. Many appeared to follow his suggestion.

Crowds that were in the hundreds dwindled significantly in the final hour, as police with riot gear stood guard.

Missouri State Highway Patrol captain Ron Johnson, who is in charge in Ferguson after state police took over responsibility for security from the local force, said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door in the neighburhood talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting.

Capt Johnson told at the news conference that police would not enforce the curfew with armoured trucks and tear gas but communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave. Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.

""Why is the focus on security and not getting justice? Why is there not an arrest?"" one women yelled.

Mr Brown's death ignited several days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased on Thursday after Mr Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. But Friday night saw a resurgence of unrest.

Yesterday some residents said it appeared the violent acts were being committed by people from other suburbs or states.

""Who would burn down their own back yard?"" said Rebecca McCloud, who works with the Sonshine Baptist Church in St Louis.

Greg Thomas said he had seen new people, younger, more eager for a confrontation with police, on the streets. The 28-year-old former US Marine said he left as quickly as he could when he heard people talking about getting their handguns.

""There's three agendas out there,"" he said. ""People who want to party, people who want to be martyrs and get killed by police, and the people here to protest.""

Capt Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed on Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly and several officers were trapped and injured.

Officer Wilson is a six-year police veteran who has had no previous complaints against him, the local police chief says. Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts and reporters were unable to contact him.

Mike Brown death on Saturday sparked demonstrations yesterday followed by riots and looting in the city of Ferguson, Missouri, USA.

A video uploaded to YouTube shows an interview by local news reporters with the 18-year-old's mother Leslie McSpadden after the tragic shooting.

Asked what police were telling her about his killing, she said: ""They aren't telling me anything. They haven't told me anything. They wouldn't even let me identify my son.

""The only way I knew it was my son was from people out here showing me his picture on their phones and their tablets.

""I learned about it from a guy calling me on the phone. I was able to look at that picture and say yes that's my son. Laying in the street for hours. Hours.""

A day of demonstrations was held in Ferguson yesterday but after dark they descended into looting and rioting.

There is ""a lot of unrest up there, and a lot of rioting going on, and looting,"" Officer Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, said earlier today.

He said the unrest had spread from Ferguson, a largely black St. Louis suburb, to neighbouring communities. About 150 officers in riot gear from throughout St. Louis County had been sent to the area.

Footage from local news station KMOV TV showed a QuikTrip convenience store set on fire after it was looted. A teenage witness told KMOV, ""They destroyed everything.""

Mobs rushed out of other stores, including an AutoZone and a Ross Dress for Less, with armfuls of stolen goods, KMOV and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper reported.

A number of videos of the violence have been posted online, clearly showing men and women, some in masks, breaking into shops and taking what's inside.

Officer Schellman said arrests had been made but had no details of how many. He and three hospitals had no reports of injuries.

Police said Mike was shot after a struggle over a gun in a police car, but it was not immediately clear why the boy was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car.

The officer involved in the shooting has not been identified but has six years on the job.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told a news conference he has been put on administrative leave, but the officer's race has not been revealed.

Brown's mother told TV station KSDK that her son was a ""good child getting ready to go to college"" and that he was visiting his grandmother when the shooting took place.

A Facebook group called {Justice for Mike Brown}<hyperlink=“https://www.facebook.com/JusticeForMikeBrownFerguson/“> has been set up to protest the shooting, shile supporters are using the hashtag Justiceformike to air their views.
