Speak On It inside...

With nearly 9 million Twitter followers and 4 million followers on Instagram, Diddy (who coincidentally has an album with Guy Gerber {dropping}<hyperlink=""http://www.vibe.com/2014/08/download-guy-gerber-puff-daddy-11-11-full-album/""> tomorrow) is calling out POTUS regarding the Michael Brown shooting and Ferguson, MO protests.  

While watching the protests and growing unrest, Diddy flips on his camera and says ""This sh-t ain't right. Obama, get on a plane -- it's serious. These are your people, baby. These are your people.""  He captioned the clip, ""WATCH DIS! DEAR PRESIDENT OBAMA!!!!!! IF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY SEND A VIDEO MESSAGE TO THE PRESIDENT #DEAROBAMA""

We've been seeing plenty of critique of our President when it comes to this situation  But is it fair?

QUESTION:  POTUS has already {dispatched}<hyperlink=""http://theybf.com/2014/08/18/michael-brown-updates-autopsy-reveals-michael-was-shot-6-times-president-obama-says-lets""> Attorney General Eric Holder to Ferguson (he's set to arrive on Wednesday); a federal autopsy, which will be in addition tot he city's autopsy, was approved to be conducted on Michael Brown; and the FBI is conducting an investigation to look at civil rights violations in the shooting. 

While some people might argue for ""more"", there is also a large segment of the American constituency (e.g. The Tea Party) who want the President to stay out of ""state"" affairs.   There's also a good segment of the population who feel it's more beneficial & impactful to hold state and local officials accountable.

Should President Obama be doing more?

Another St. Louis resident Nelly was in his hometown yesterday. He spent three hours talking to Hot 104.1 radio personalities and spoke with fans directly about the shooting death of Michael Brown.

Peep the clips below:

Janelle Monae rounded up her backup dancers and snapped a photo with their hands up.

People have been protesting all over the world, holding their hands in the air, chanting, “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot!”

On Wednesday, Wiz Khalifa made a stop in St. Louis for his “Under The Influence” tour. During his set, he changed into a white tee with the wording, “Don’t Shoot” on the front and ""#RIPMIKEBROWN"" on the back.

Peep a clip from his performance below:

Also on the “Under the Influence” tour...

Before taking the stage, Young Jeezy showed his support by visiting a QuikTrip convenience store in Ferguson, Mo that was burned down during a looting spree on Sunday.

He posted the pic above with the caption, “I had to see it for myself!! The answer is not tearing down our own neighborhoods and communities, the answer is goin to the source of the problem in numbers. So many numbers that they know they don't have a chance.

He also wore a “R.I.P. Mike Brown” t-shirt during his performance and gave him a shoutout. See it below: 

Meanwhile, Michael Brown, Sr. called in to a St. Louis radio station to call for peace....and Cedric The Entertainer spoke about what is going on around his hometown:

In latest updates on the Michael Brown case, there are reports that the teen was involved in alleged ""strong-arm robbery"" before his death. The video footage of what authorities believe is Michael stealing mini-cigars (cigarillos) from a conveince store was released earlier today, coincidentally along with the name of the officer who gunned him down, Darren Wilson. Some believe the person in the video is not Michael. Some believe that after {viewing the video}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1"">, it’s arguably a shoplifting offense at best. 

Political strategist Sophia Nelson breaks down the difference between a robbery and shoplifting:

[tweetbegin 500333310238003201 tweetend]

Ferguson, Mo., Police Chief Thomas Jackson held another news conference and offered a few addition details in the investigation.

But mainly, it's believed the video does not matter to this case regardless.  Because Officer Wilson, according to the Police Chief, and his encounter with Michael Brown was not linked to the alleged robbery.

CNN reports:

""The initial contact between"" Michael Brown and the police officer who fatally shot him was not related to the alleged convenience store robbery committed nearby a short time earlier.

The officer approached Brown not because of the robbery, but ""because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic,"" Jackson said.

It has all resulted in looted businesses, vandalized vehicles and tear-gassed confrontations with police. SPEAK ON IT inside...

Today should have been the day 18-year-old Michael Brown started classes at Vatterott College, but his dreams of owning his own business were cut short over the weekend after he was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis, MO.

According to an account of the shooting by County Police Chief Jon Belmar to {the Associated Press}<hyperlink=""http://www.aol.com/article/2014/08/11/vandalism-looting-after-vigil-for-missouri-man/20944705/"">,

""...(T)he shooting occurred after an officer encountered two people - one of whom was Brown - on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson. Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer. The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known, but ""it was more than just a couple."" He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.""

There are MANY unanswered questions about the shooting (including why the cop approached Michael and his friend in the first place), with some witnesses claiming that Michael was actually surrendering before police shot him several times. The St. Louis County Police Department will have to piece the case together WITHOUT any video footage nor a police cruiser dashboard camera.

It didn't take long for the news of Saturday night's shooting to spread across the city.  By Sunday, a few hundred protesters had gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters with many of them chanting ""Don't shoot me"" while holding their hands in the air. Officers didn't use force.......until later.

Tension erupted Sunday night after a candlelight vigil for Michael was followed by a convenience store, a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store all looted. At some point, officers {moved in with tear gas, riot gear and K-9 units}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html?_r=1"">.

""We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,"" said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.

In addition to the St. Louis County Police Department, the U.S. Justice Department said Attorney General Eric Holder had {instructed}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html?_r=0""> staff to monitor developments.

Watch the POTUS' comments inside and see new interviews from eyewitnesses.

Above, RHOA star Phaedra Parks was seen offering to Desuirea Harris, the grandmother of Michael Brown, during a news conference held earlier this week.  And the lawyer spoke on her social media saying:

During my St. Louis visit, I had the pleasure of meeting #MichaelBrown's mother Lesley McSpadden. Although, we come from different places & backgrounds, we are very much alike-We are both black women & mothers who deeply love our sons. Unfortunately, she is planning her son's funeral while I struggle to make sure my sons never know her son's fate. #fixitjesus #JusticeforMikeBrown #Ferguson #prayforpeace #prayforstlouis #StopPoliceBrutality

Today, President Obama addressed the nation for the first time (on television) regarding {the shooting death of Michael Brown and the protests in Ferguson, MO}<hyperlink=""http://theybf.com/2014/08/11/speak-on-it-hundreds-protest-by-looting-after-unarmed-black-st-louis-teenager-shot-and"">.  This is following {his statement}<hyperlink=""http://theybf.com/2014/08/12/president-obama-issues-statement-on-michael-brown-tragedy-more-updates""> on Tuesday. 

The cops and authorities in Ferguson have been dressed in riot gear, military gear, are rolling around in tanks, and have weapons that are typically used for war. Yet, the citizens are reportedly unarmed. As tensions have escalated with {the unnecessary detainment of several reporters, the arrest of at least 65 protesters,}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html""> {police being accused of excessive force}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/13/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html""> (including rubber bullets, tear gas), and {media outlets shutdown (#mediablackout)}<hyperlink=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2724725/Twitter-users-John-Legend-vent-anger-police-Washington-Post-Huffington-Post-reporters-arrested-TV-crews-fired-covering-Michael-Brown-riots-Ferguson-Missouri.html"">, POTUS had much ground to cover. He said,

“I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images that we’ve seen in the heartland of our country.

“I made clear to the Attorney General that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done,”

“When something like this happens, the local authorities, including the police, have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death and how they are protecting the people in their communities.

There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Also, more eyewitnesses came forward to share their stories about Michael's last moments. 

WITNESSES: Tiffany Mitchell & Piaget Crenshaw:

Original KEY WITNESS: Dorian Johnson

Interestingly, it took police several days {to contact}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/dorian-johnson-michael-brown_n_5676101.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics""> key witness Dorian Johnson.  It is unknown if they have spoken to the two new witnesses.

In case you were wondering, the Ferguson Police Dept still refuses to release the name of the officer who shot and killed Michael.  On Tuesday, Cornell William Brooks, national president the NAACP, {said}<hyperlink=""http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/12/naacp-to-cops-identify-michael-brown-shooter"">, “It seems to me that the most important thing here is to let the facts come out as quickly as possible, sending a signal to the community that the investigation is proceeding and that the investigation will in fact be transparent. I don’t believe, where the name will be known at some point, delaying that for any undue period of time helps the situation.”

For now, Ferguson Police Department Chief Thomas Jackson {refuses to release the name}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-police-cite-safety-risk-in-decision-not-to-name-officer-in-shooting.html?smid=tw-share&_r=1""> of the officer because of potential harm to the officer and his family.  But that hasn't stopped names from coming out.  However, the police claim both names are incorrect.  {DETAILS HERE}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/despite-reports-name-of-officer-in-michael-brown-shooting-still-unknown/?utm_term=.119b2936b3f0"">.

Tonight, all around the country, candlelight vigils and peaceful protests are being held in Michael Brown's honor, and in honor of all unarmed victims slain by police.

Addressing the tensons in Ferguson, POTUS said, “While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police, only disserves to raise tensions and stir chaos, it undermines, rather than advancing justice.”

Let’s seek to heal, rather than to wound each other. I’ve said this before, in too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear.""

Read it inside and the get the latest updates on the case....

While the country is in turmoil over the death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, at the hands of a Ferguson, St. Louis police officer, Presdient Obama has issued an official statement.

Read it below:

The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time. As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed. I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.

Meanwhile, a detailed account of the entire incident, given by Michael Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, who was with him at the time, is {HERE}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri"">. And is a MUST READ.  Johnson has been making his rounds telling his first-hand witness account to mainstream and local media.  And he paints a picture that many feared would be the case--an angry cop approached the boys in a hostile manner, while the boys were doing nothing but walking in an apartment complex to Johnson's home just minutes away.

Michael Brown has been accused of ""reaching for the cop's gun"", something that Johnson vehemently denies.  Michael was shot more than once, from 35 feet away.

Freeman Bosley, Johnson’s attorney, told {MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> today that the police have yet to interview Johnson. In fact, Bosley said in an interview that he offered the police an opportunity to speak with Johnson, but they declined:

“They don’t want the facts. What they want is to justify what happened … what they are trying to do now is justify what happened instead of trying to point out the wrong. Something is wrong here and that’s what it is.”

Sad.

Also, Keke Palmer plans to visit Ferguson, Missouri and responds to the social media backlash she received after voicing her opinion about the hot topic. Deets inside…

This comes as no surprise. In a recent interview, French Montana admits he plans on capitalizing on the newfound fame he has received {since he started “dating” Khloe Kardashian}<hyperlink=""http://theybf.com/2014/07/24/now-it%E2%80%99s-official-french-montana-khloe-kardashian-dish-on-their-relationship-in-first"">. As if we didn’t already have a clue.

During an interview with {Billboard}<hyperlink=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6221629/french-montana-relationship-khloe-kardashian-billboard"">, French spoke on how he plans to make the most of his relationship with the Kardashian click. There has been some {unconfirmed rumors}<hyperlink=""http://www.ibtimes.com.au/articles/562081/20140807/khloe-kardashian-break-up-french-montana-s.htm#.U-vwGUjc17z""> circulating that the two have called it quits. So it's likely the interview could have been conducted before the alleged split...if true. He told the magazine,

""I want to capitalize on it,"" says Montana. ""I’ll get a fan base from everywhere. I just hope I’ll be able to connect with everything that’s going on.""

Makes sense. He has an album, Mac & Cheese 4 (dropping in November), to promote. And since his debut album, Excuse My French, didn’t do that great, what better way to let the masses know what he has cooking up in the studio than dating a chick from one of the most media hungry families.

French also dished on some advice Jay Z offered to him about making music. He revealed,

""Jay Z told me he once made that same mistake too. Your first album you never know what’s going on with the business and labels. The second one you’re like, ‘F— this.’ You get the ball in your own court.""
 

Well alright.

And in another interview...

BET talk show host Keke Palmer (posing it up above during a photoshoot) unleashed a series of videos on her Instagram, voicing her opinions on the shooting death of Mike Brown and the protests that followed. Soon after, followers bashed the young starlet over her comments, calling her naïve and that she doesn’t really know what it’s really like to be an average African-American living in America.

In an interview with the {Huffington Post}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/keke-palmer-ferguson-twitter-backlash_n_5682551.html"">, the “Just Keke” host responded to the social media backlash saying,

“Being naïve is never anything to be ashamed of, because I believe me being naïve is what has allowed me to do all the things that I can because if I believe in and quote what’s realistic then I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing right now. I simply wouldn’t be ‘Cinderella’ on Broadway, I wouldn’t have ‘Just KeKe.’”

She added,

“As far as what’s going on with Mike Brown, I spoke up on that, because unproductive outrage has never gotten us anywhere,” she continued. “Even with MLK and everything that he did for black people...all he spoke about was unity, because throwing hate and being angry, and violence, that doesn’t give us peace and equality. That’s like having sex in order to get your virginity. It’s just the complete opposite thing to do.”

The YBF actress (who is gearing up to star as the {first African-American Cinderella on Broadway}<hyperlink=""http://theybf.com/2014/08/04/ybf-kids-keke-palmer-will-make-herstory-as-broadways-1st-black-cinderella-kanye-north"">) also talked about her plans on making a trip to Ferguson, Missouri and

“I’m very excited to see what can be done and if I can really get involved, and how we can unite one another,” she said during the interview. “That’s what I always believe is the way to go. Uniting us all. Not just black people, but everybody that’s coming to talk the same message. It’s unfortunate when things like this happen, but hopefully it can wake people’s eyes up and let them know that we need to unite as a people.”
