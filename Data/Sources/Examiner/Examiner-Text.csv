The police slaying of the unarmed youth on his knees in the street, Michael Brown, 18, has ignited protests Saturday and Sunday in the St. Louis working-class suburb of about 20,000 residents.

Hundreds of people have been gathering at the scene of the shooting to question the police and light candles for Brown, who was planning to begin college classes on Monday.

Mr. Brownâ€™s stepfather, Louis Head, held a cardboard sign that said, â€œFerguson police just executed my unarmed son.â€ù

â€œThe genesis of this was a physical confrontation,â€ù Chief Belmar told reporters.

Elected officials and advocacy groups have called for a full investigation and questioned the police tactics. Police have acknowledged that Mr. Brown had been unarmed.

Antonio French, a city councilman in St. Louis, was at the scene of Sunday's earlier protests and said over 100 people had gathered, mostly silently standing in groups, some leaving behind teddy bears and balloons to memorialize Mike Brown.

Mr. French said he was unsatisfied with the police departmentâ€™s explanation of the shooting.

â€œI find it hard to believe,â€ù he said, adding that he was disappointed with the police response, that further distressed Ferguson residents, members of Mr. Brownâ€™s family and Anonymous.

An eyewitness, Phenix Daniels, who lives across the street from where the alleged murder occurred, said police shot Mike Brown, 17, â€œat least ten times.â€ù Daniels posted on Facebook a video of the scene shortly after the alleged murder.

â€œThe entire global collective of Anonymous is outraged at this cold blooded murder of a young teen. Not a week goes by that some young person, usually of minority ethnicity â€“ is slaughtered by murderous police in the USA,â€ù the Anonymous statement reads.

DuprÃ© reported earlier Sunday:

â€œThis is the second time in a week that an officer shot dead a black youth.. sending hundreds into the streets to protest and many more expressing their outrage on Twitter in a {#Ferguson hashtag campaign.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Ferguson&src=tyah""> Earlier this week, a {white police officer killed an unarmed black youth in an Ohio Walmart.}<hyperlink=""http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2014/08/war-on-whites-guess-which-of-these-wallmart-shoppers-police-shot-dead-for-getting-air-rifle-off-store-shelf-3008838.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=feed"">""

Multiple witnesses say Michael (Mike) Brown, 18, had no weapon on him, had his hands up in the air, but was shot by authorities multiple times.

Brown was to start college classes Monday.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told KMOV television news reporters at the media conference Sunday morning:

â€œYou took my son away from me. Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many.

Because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they donâ€™t got nothing to live for anyway. â€˜Theyâ€™re going to try to take me out anyway.â€™ â€ù

Anonymous Full Statement

Sunday morning, Anonymous released its statement about this latest police killing of a black youth, as follows:

A little over 24 hours ago in Ferguson, Missouri â€“ USA the Ferguson Police Department shot an un-armed teen 6 times and killed him. His body was left to lie in a pool of blood in the sweltering heat for hours while the police militarized the area against protesters and attempted to concoct a reasonable story as to why they snatched this innocent students life for no reason. The St. Louis County Sheriff Department even sealed the roads leading to Ferguson in a vain attempt to prevent protesters from reaching the city. His name was Mike Brown, he was 17 â€“ and he would have started college next week. Instead, his family is struggling to come up with funeral costs.

The entire global collective of Anonymous is outraged at this cold blooded murder of a young teen. Not a week goes by that some young person, usually of minority ethnicity â€“ is slaughtered by murderous police in the USA. For this reason Anonymous will not be satisfied this time, as we have in the past â€“ with simply obtaining justice for this young man and his family.

Anonymous demands that the Congressional Representatives and Senators from Missouri introduce legislation entitled â€œMike Brownâ€™s Lawâ€ù that will set strict national standards for police conduct in the USA. We further demand that this new law include specific language to grant the victims of police violence the same rights and prerogatives that are already enjoyed nationwide by the victims of other violent criminals. The Equal Protection clause of the US Constitution demands nothing less.

To the good people of Ferguson, take heart â€“ and take your streets. You are not alone, we will support you in every way possible. Occupy every square inch of your city. Open your homes and help in any way you can the protesters who will come to your city from every part of Missouri and the USA. Businesses and householders that are near protest rallies, open your WiFi routers so that live streamers and other independent journalists can use the Internet connections. Feed each other, keep each other safe â€“ and stay in the streets until we are totally victorious in all our demands.

To the Ferguson Police Department and any other jurisdictions who are deployed to the protests: we are watching you very closely. If you abuse, harass â€“ or harm in any way the protesters in Ferguson we will take every web based asset of your departments and governments off line. That is not a threat, it is a promise. If you attack the protesters, we will attack every server and computer you have. We will dox and release the personal information on every single member of the Ferguson Police Department, as well as any other jurisdiction that participates in the abuse. We will seize all your databases and E-Mail spools and dump them on the Internet. This is your only warning.

The time has come for more than simple justice for these atrocities. The time has come to draw a line in the sand and say â€œno more dead kidsâ€ù, no more police killings and beatings. Anonymous is drawing a line in the sand, and that line runs right down the middle of Main Street Ferguson, Missouri. Police impunity ends with the barbaric death of Mike Brown.

High-profile doctor performs Michael Brown preliminary autopsy

â€œPeople have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day 1,â€ù Dr. Michael M. Baden said in an interview after performing the autopsy. â€œThey donâ€™t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.â€ù

Dr. Baden, 80, is a well-known New York-based medical examiner, one of only about 400 board-certified forensic pathologists in the nation. He reviewed the autopsies of President John F. Kennedy and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.. He has performed over 20,000 autopsies.

The â€œextraordinary circumstancesâ€ù surrounding the fatal shooting by police officer Darren Wilson of Michael Brown, 18, and a request by Brownâ€™s family members prompted the order for a federal autopsy, Department of Justice spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement Monday.

According to Dr. Baden's preliminary autopsy report, one bullet entered the top of Brownâ€™s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him, causing a fatal injury.

Baden, former chief medical examiner for the City of New York flew to Missouri on Sunday at the familyâ€™s request to conduct the separate autopsy.

According to Dr. Baden, the shot at the head was likely the last of bullets to hit him that killed him.

Brown was also shot four times in the right arm, he said.

All the bullets were fired into his front, Dr. Baden explained, and some of the bullets entered and exited several times, including one that left at least five different wounds.

Dr. Baden has not had access to: 1) X-rays showing where bullets were found, that would clarify the autopsy results; 2) witness and police statements; or 3) Brown's clothing.

Police did not allow Dr. Baden access to Brownâ€™s clothing. Without those, Baden could only make a preliminary report regarding the distance at which the shooting occurred. He said it appeared as though the shots were not fired at short range. That part of the report could change, however, if and when he is allowed access to the clothing and finds gun powder residue.

â€œThe preliminary autopsy results are the first time that some of the critical information resulting in Mr. Brownâ€™s death has been made public. Thousands of protesters demanding information and justice for what was widely viewed as a reckless shooting took to the streets here in rallies that ranged from peaceful to violent.â€ù (NY Times)

The protests did not begin, however, until last Sunday after police publicly blamed unarmed Brown for his death.

â€œWe need more information,"" Dr. Baden stated. ""For example, the police should be examining the automobile to see if there is gunshot residue in the police car.â€ù

Tensions over the fatal shooting and authorities' management of the case have led to an entire week of violent unrest in the suburban St. Louis community.

Overt Martial Law declared in Ferguson

Saturday, a midnight to 5:00 a.m. curfew in Ferguson was ordered. By early Monday morning, however, Missouri {Governor Jay Nixon ordered the National Guard into Ferguson }<hyperlink=""http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2014/08/ferguson-military-rule-declared-3013380.html"">after militarized police and civilian violence escalated after a large but peaceful civil rights march.

{Human rights}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/human-rights""> and civil rights critics have said the militarized police are out-of-control. Earlier in the week, police shot tear gas at and arrested reporters.

Police again turned on journalists in Ferguson on Sunday night, detaining three more reporters and threatening to shoot and mace others, some at gunpoint. Police {threatened to shoot}<hyperlink=""http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/17/3472290/police-officer-threatens-to-shoot-reporter-live-streaming-protests-in-ferguson/""> Mustafa Hussein, a reporter who was filming for local {Argus Radio}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/argus-radio-ferguson-protests_n_5679149.html"">.

""Get the fuck out of here! You get that light off or you're getting shot with this!"" the police shouted.

Some eyewitnesses {said}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/08/18/officer-appears-to-threaten-cameraman-covering-chaos-ferguson/""> the officer told Hussein he would be ""shelled."" The threat was captured on a livestream and was tweeted widely.

Keshonda James, 35, was driving away from police when police shot a tear gas canister toward her that shattered her windshield. The exploding glass hit her left arm, later bandaged by a fellow protester.

â€œGlass exploded everywhere,"" James said. ""This isnâ€™t cool. Iâ€™m not down here looting.â€ù

Bryan Jones, 23 ran from the heavily armed police. He said afterwards that he felt safer running toward the sound of gunshots than fleeing back toward police.

Jones said he has been harassed by police his entire life, according to USA Today.

â€œItâ€™s horrible that I feel like Iâ€™m better off running away from the tear gas and running toward the people that are busting at the cops,â€ù Jones said.

The National Guard will â€œhelp restore peace and order and to protect the citizens of Ferguson,â€ù the statement said.

Sunday, a planned, large peaceful civil rights march was held.

â€œTonight, a day of hope, prayers, and peaceful protests was marred by the violent criminal acts of an organized and growing number of individuals, many from outside the community and state, whose actions are putting the residents and businesses of Ferguson at risk,â€ù the statement said. â€œThese violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory, and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served, and to feel safe in their own homes.â€ù

Late Sunday, over two hours before a second midnight to 5:00 A.M. curfew was to begin, police fired tear gas at hundreds of angry protesters marching down the townâ€™s main thoroughfare toward a police command center.

â€œBased on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response,â€ù said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is in command in Ferguson. â€œWe had to act to protect lives and property.â€ù

At least two people were injured Sunday. One was shot, according to Johnson. Seven or eight people were arrested and will be charged with failure to obey orders to disperse, police said.

The police captain said the following incidents had occurred Sunday night and early Monday describing specific scenes from the night:

At 8:25 p.m. local time, a person was shot on West Florissant, the street where protesting has centered.

At 8:26 p.m. shots were fired at a nearby location.

At 8:27 p.m. police learned that a â€œsubject was down.â€ù

At 8:28 p.m. police received a report of eight people with guns and tactical teams responded.

By 8:56 p.m. hundreds of protests marched toward the shopping center where police have their command post. In response, police officers lobbed tear gas at the group and asked other local police departments for assistance.

At 9:20 p.m. Johnson said McDonaldâ€™s employees were forced to lock themselves in a storage room after being â€œoverrunâ€ù by protesters.

Officials have employed no evidence-based peaceful methods readily available for {conflict de-escalation.}<hyperlink=""http://www.endesastres.org/files/The_best_way_to_deal_with_violence_is_to_avoid_it_1_.pdf"">

According to Mr. Drew Guest in a 2008 article Martial Arts Magazine, if your goal is to de-escalate, then do not ""TACOS"":

1. Threaten the aggressor
2. Argue or contradict the aggressor
3. Challenge the aggressor
4. Order or command the aggressor
5. Shame or disrespect the aggressor

All this happened in the span of one minute and many locals have questioned the video's validity. An unarmed Brown than allegedly got into an altercation with a police officer who was responding to a robbery call in the neighbor. Brown was than gun-downed and killed. Since then, protests have occurred throughout the country, none getting more attention that what happened in Ferguson on Monday night into Tuesday morning when police began firing tear gas at protesters. It was announced early Tuesday morning from local police that there where 15 arrests made, and two journalists, from the Washington Post and Huffington post, were detained during the night.

""Think about what we have here. We have citizen journalists now which we didn't have before. So instead of the news media being there/ we have people on the streets using their cell phones to film. We have people, filing people filming what is going on in the streets. So it is starting to spiral out of control. I am shocked that the president would get involved with this at this point. I'm not surprised because he has stuck his nose in other local issues. But to Greg's point, there's the right, there's the middle and the left side of this. But there is also the people who are not there, which is most of us. And that is what the Chief of police tried to come out and say. 'Look, the president is not helping the situation out by making comments from the Vineyard today.' I mean, did he get his updates yesterday in between him doing the macarena at the party he was at? I just don't think it help and Dana was absolutely right. The president would have been perfect and pitch with his remarks, but instead his comment about excessive force by the police, the police that have resisted using excessive force on Sunday night, they backed off on Sunday night. It only got worse, to me, the president only inflamed the situation.""

What exactly happened to Michael Brown last Saturday might never come out. It seems to be a rehash of a familiar story of an unarmed African American being unjustly attacked and killed by a police officer who, at the very least, overstepped their boundaries.

The honored officer received the award according to the minutes of a Ferguson City Council meeting on Feb. 11 of this year, says {Yahoo! News}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/photos-ferguson-officer-darren-wilson-received-police-award-earlier-this-year-021255893.html""> on Saturday. The discovery was linked to a Facebook photo and comments posted by Wilsonâ€™s father at the time the honor was received.

With two photos of Darren Wilson, Wilsonâ€™s father John wrote that he is very proud of his son on receiving a Commendation from his Police Department. â€œCongratulations Son,â€ù he wrote. One photo shows 28-year-old Wilson shaking hands with the Ferguson Police Chief, Thomas Jackson, while receiving the award. In the second photograph, Darren Wilson is seen smiling after receiving the award, apparently returning to his seat at the city council meeting where he was honored. He has been with the Ferguson Police Department of four years - and a total of six years as a Missouri officer. Jackson described Wilson, during the news conference regarding the case, as an excellent officer.

In investigating the story, Yahoo! News says that the Facebook page where the photos and comments were discovered has been deactivated. It was taken down shortly after Yahoo! News first published the original story. Yahoo! News also tried to contact the parents by telephone. In so doing, Darren Wilsonâ€™s step-mother Tonya Wilson reportedly answered the phone. Her only comment before hanging up on Yahoo! News was to say that they are not talking to anybody. She concluded by saying, â€œThank you.â€ù A follow-up text requesting the name of Darren Wilsonâ€™s attorney did not receive a response.

It is also reported that John Wilson, the officerâ€™s father, used Facebook to get support for his son â€“ without referring to his son by name. He wrote that his family is in need of prayers to be sent up for a family member. He wrote that circumstances do not allow for them to say anything further. Yet, he asserted, please pray with our family in mind and please put a covering of protection over our family member. Many people offered online encouragement, for which the father was grateful. John Wilsonâ€™s last post quoted a Texas evangelical pastor by stating that when something is out of control it is merely out of your control â€“ not Godâ€™s.

As far as Darren Wilson is concerned, his home has had heavy police presence, according to neighbors in the Crestwood suburb southwest of downtown Ferguson where Wilson lives. He and his family have not been in his home for the past several days, according to the {Washington Post}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/at-darren-wilsons-house-neighbors-say-he-and-his-family-took-off/"">.

The story, as one might expect, took on an instantaneous racial overtone. African Americans within the St. Louis suburb where Brown was shot have now taken their protests to an aggressive level â€“ looting, burning, smashing storefronts and windows of parked cars, even pilfering goods by the armful.

Reports the {USA Today on Aug. 11}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/10/st-louis-teen-police-shooting/13856377/"">: â€œPolice began using tear gas to disperse crowds early Monday morning in suburban St. Louis after multiple stores were {vandalized and looted Sunday}<hyperlink=""http://legacy.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/10/rioting-breaks-out-in-ferguson/13880305/""> night. Crowds became unruly at a vigil for an unarmed black man who was shot and killed by police.â€ù

Killed on Saturday in the town of Ferguson was 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was reportedly unarmed and had his hands raised over his head when he was gunned down by a white officer.

USA Today summarized the story as follows:

It began with an altercation involving two men and the officer around noon Saturday, [St. Louis County Police Chief Jon] Belmar said. One of the men pushed the officer into his patrol car, there was a scuffle inside the car over the officer's gun, and the officer fired one shot inside the cruiser. Seconds later, outside the cruiser, he fired several more shots and 18-year-old Michael Brown lay dead.

A candlelight vigil Sunday night drew a crowd of over a thousand individuals, and the scene took a decidedly violent turn. Angry protestors, taking to the streets to demand answers, shouted: â€œWe want answersâ€ù and â€œNo justice, no peaceâ€ù while a news conference was being conducted. Some men spray painted â€œRIP Michaelâ€ù in the middle of the street. Others walked into the St. Louis police station and shouted, with their hands up: â€œDonâ€™t shoot me!â€ù

Over 60 officers were brought in to quell the riot, including members of the ST. Louis SWAT team. The disturbance lasted into early Monday morning. Tear gas grenades were propelled into the crowds, and over 30 arrests were made.

Brownâ€™s mother Lesley McSpadden, who attended the vigil, said she needs answers, and she wants the officer who killed her son to face the death penalty.

Fergusonâ€™s mayor, James Knowles, denounced the riot and crime spree.

There's nothing productive from thisâ€_ We understand people want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out. We're going to obviously try to urge calm.â€ù

Details surrounding the shooting have not been released, though police have confirmed that Brown was not armed. With the divisive nature of the story, the specifics of the shooting may come out very slowly, if at all. It was not said yet whether the other man with Brown was armed. Itâ€™s also unclear if Brown was the man that struggled with the officer inside of the police cruiser.

The supporters were visibly upset and questioned whether the images and video of Brown in the store was even him, wondering if it was photoshopped by the police.

""We don't know who that fellow is in the video, because clearly that doesn't look like the teenager Mike Brown."" said one Brown supporter. ""Mike Brown was laid on the ground for 3 or 4 hours, uncovered. We clearly see those aren't the same clothes he was wearing. That is incorrect and that's false information"" she continued.

Another woman chimed in, stating that ""I believe that it took so long for them to do that because they photoshopped that."" Lemon asked the crowd if they were that untrustworthy of the police. The entire crowd shouted ""yes.""

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has stated he released the video after massive pressure and requests and has started that he has ""nothing else to give"" you.

These events are all taking place because a white police officer shot dead a black teen in a town that is mostly black. Witnesses say that Michael Brown had his hands in the air, begging to not be shot, before he was killed by the officer in question.

Over the past week, the racism that's erupted on social media since this case can only be compared to the spike in racism during the {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/trayvon-martin""> case. There are, of course, a few parallels between the two cases. Michael Brown was an unarmed 17-year-old young man when he was shot dead; So was Trayvon Martin. The stark and very obvious difference between these two cases is the fact that people who are in ""authority"" are responsible for the death -- and an entire community is angry. No reasonable people appear to be in support of the Ferguson Police Department {who have a history of violence against blacks.}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html""> However, irrational people gather in droves on the internet, and the horrible things they are saying proves just how necessary these protests in Furguson. On Twitter and Facebook, some of the horrible things being said reflect the sentiment of the lowest common denominator of society, but it looks like at leas{t one of those racists is the wife of the Ferguson Chief of Police!}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/AnonyMobLife/status/499718454778142722""> Catherine Nardi reportedly said the following about the black community in Ferguson:

""They are feral and violent. They murder each other. They murder their unborn babies. They murder white people. They hate police officers and murder some of them, even black ones. They destroy neighbors and entire cities with garbage and drugs. They live their lives off the hard-earned tax dollars of other Americans. Yet somehow they are the victims. What insanity is that?""

On Twitter, the sentiment expressed is even more graphic than the words spoken above by the Ferguson Police Chief's wife. The use of the N-Word is rampant, with hateful racist trolls referring to Michael Brown as a ""dumb dead n****r"" among other things. Others are tweeting their happiness that Robin Williams died because ""the death of a white actor will distract people from all the angry n****rs in Missouri.""

The evil-spirited, racist sentiment goes on and on and on, but it's all indicative of something far deeper than just ""trolling"" on the internet. Just like the Trayvon Martin shooting, the racists are swarming the internet in droves under both anonymous handles and their own public profiles to slur and spit the most hateful and offensive things they can in hopes of hurting and offending those who already feel victimized.",NA,53,NA,NAExaminer,exam9,http://www.examiner.com/article/muddy-water-ferguson-missouri-both-sides-should-just-shut-up,"Muddy water in Ferguson, Missouri: Both sides should just 'shut up'",Barbie Crafts,8/15/14,2/19/16,"The presence of the Missouri State Police has stemmed the tide of violence in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police killing of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/michael-brown"">. {MSN.com}<hyperlink=""http://www.msn.com/en-us/news?ocid=ansnews11""> reported Friday that the teargas and riot gear was gone, and state troopers were described as walking peacefully beside the protesters. The facts in the highly-charged case, however, are just as clear as mud. Despite new information released by the {Ferguson Police Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/ferguson-police-department""> Friday, there is still no concise understanding of what happened on Aug. 9.

The police bowed to pressure from protesters and released the name of the officer involved in the shooting death. Darren Wilson, 28, was publicly identified, even though death threats had been levelled against him. Wilson is described as a quiet individual who has been with the force for four years, according to {New York Daily News}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/darren-wilson-identified-killed-18-year-old-michael-brown-article-1.1904539"">, although the police indicated his service was six years.

What would have been helpful, although possibly not feasible at this time, is some exculpatory evidence that would shed light on what really happened. Any footage taken by a dash camera in the police car, any recordings or radio transmissions that would indicate what type of struggle happened inside the squad car would be most enlightening. Forensic reports from the weapon that was fired would also be very important to establishing the timeline.

Instead, the Ferguson Police Department released the above photos from the convenience market where Michael Brown allegedly had stolen a box of cigarillos in the hours before the fatal police encounter. The photo shows him roughing up the much-smaller employee in the process of the theft. MSN.com did report that his friend, Dorian Johnson, confirmed that Brown did take cigarillos from the market. Officer Wilson did not know that the teen was a suspect in the robbery at the time of the encounter that ended in Brownâ€™s death. Protesters have expressed outrage that the police have sullied the reputation of Brown.

The very disconcerting part of a case like this, as was the case with the Trayvon Martin investigation, is that the voices get louder and angrier as the information gets sketchier. Many in the black community immediately assume the officer killed Michael Brown in cold blood because of his race. There are conflicting voices that immediately jump to the defense of the white police officer without knowing any real details of what happened.

A great deal remains to be sorted out about why Officer Darren Wilson claims to have thought it necessary to kill Brown, but in the meantime, a city has been under the boot of martial law, in effect, if not in name.

Surprisingly, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence ({CSGV}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/csgv"">) counts itself among those who believe the brutal suppression of Ferguson is grossly excessive, {according to their press release}<hyperlink=""http://csgv.org/releases/2014/statement-junfolding-situation-ferguson/"">:

The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV) is closely watching the situation in Ferguson, Missouri and we are deeply disturbed by what we see unfolding there. Our hearts go out to the family of Michael Brown, Jr. as they deal with an unimaginable loss.

What makes this surprising is that CSGV has long defended virtually unlimited power of government, to the point of {denying the legitimacy}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/article/forget-gun-control-csgv-represents-genocide-enablement-lobby""> of armed resistance against a government rounding up citizens for the concentration camps.

They [the Ferguson Police] have responded to largely peaceful protests with a heavily militarized force (approximately 70 SWAT members and an armored vehicle) and trained loaded weapons on Ferguson residents, including children.

Hmm . . . ""a heavily militarized force""? That's funny--CSGV's executive director {Josh Horwitz likes to warn us}<hyperlink=""http://www.c-span.org/video/?c3714493/clip-guns-liberty""> to ""not pile too much on the militarization of law enforcement"" (37-second video).

For years, we have differed with the pro-gun movement over the use of coercive force in a democratic society. It is our contention that states with unregulated private militias are rarely, if ever, functional. That said, the governmentâ€™s â€œmonopoly on forceâ€ù must be subject to civilian control, and it comes with tremendous responsibility to adhere to democratic principles of good governance.

The Ferguson PD's actions are under civilian control--the cops (who are ""civilians,"" if heavily militarized ones) didn't pull off a coup d'Ã©tat. They are taking their directions from the government officials above them--just the way CSGV claims government should--must--work.

Now CSGV has decided that this would be a good time to demonize so-called ""{assault weapons}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/assault-weapons-1"">,"" despite none being involved in this situation:

The situation in Ferguson should also be cause for reflection on the continuing arms race between civilians and law enforcement in our country. We must recognize that Ferguson is not the norm. The overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers are good men and women who are legitimately concerned about the type of firepower they are now being confronted with on Americaâ€™s streets. This arms race is making our neighborhoods more dangerous and benefitting only one party: the gun industry, which sees continuing escalation as a business opportunity. We must all come togetherâ€”civilians and law enforcement alikeâ€”to curb the proliferation of military-style firepower in our society.

Whatever the reason is that Wilson killed Brown, it's not because AR-15s are legal for civilians to own (and{ not because Type III body armor is}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/article/congressman-mike-honda-wants-to-be-sure-people-shot-with-rifles-die"">, either, Rep. Honda). CSGV has {made this argument before}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/article/killing-for-gun-control"">: if citizens were more strictly limited in terms of what guns they can own, law enforcement would be less jumpy, and thus less likely to gun down unarmed teenagers. ""Pass some more gun laws, so we can stop killing you,"" is the apparent message. Actually, though, it's not quite true that privately owned so-called ""assault weapons"" are playing no role in Ferguson--they have very likely {prevented the looting}<hyperlink=""http://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2014/08/11/ferguson-riots-north-county-business-owners-some-armed-survey-the-damage""> from being even worse than it has been.

Finally, we acknowledge the comparisons that many are drawing between what is happening in Ferguson and the armed standoff that took place at the Bundy ranch this past April. The dramatic differences in law enforcement response to the two events are difficult to ignore. Why are white pro-gun activists able to point loaded firearms at law enforcement and avoid accountability under the law altogether while unarmed, peaceful African-American citizens are met with a militarized police force and mass arrests?

You want to know why the Bundy ranch guardians were able to make the government back down, while Ferguson residents remain under the government's jackboots, CSGV? It's because at the Bundy ranch, the government knew that they would not enjoy a ""monopoly on force""--that they would pay for their excesses in blood, more of it than they were willing to lose. The Ferguson cops, on the other hand, clearly like their overwhelming edge in firepower.

That's your ""{government monopoly on force}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/government-monopoly-on-force"">,"" CSGV. Own it.

According to a personal source of the victim, I have been advised that Michael was walking in the middle of the street minding his own business when police officers pulled up next to him in their squad car. At one point, an officer opened is driver's door and the next thing people knew, the victim was shot and killed by police. According to my source, the victim did not have a weapon of any kind. The 2 officers involved in the incident reported that the victim was reaching for one of the officer's gun but this has been called into question because the officer was sitting in the vehicle beginning to stand up with his gun in a holster to his right side and the officer being right handed. The gun would have been out of reach and the only justification for firing their weapons would be if either police officer felt threatened by bodily harm. The officer could have simply turned his waist away from the victim if this were the case or closed his door. Either way, there seems to be holes in the officers' accounts of what exactly led to the shooting of an unarmed teenager. Also, although reported as 18 by KMOV, according to my source, the victim was 17 just shy of his 18th birthday.

The shooting occurred Saturday and by Sunday night around 8pm, there was a candlelight vigil for the victim. However, at some point between the civil mannered vigil, a riot broke out in the city of Ferguson. Reportedly, there were over 30 individuals arrested from the altercation and within moments of the rioting, over 300 police officers from over a dozen police departments were on the scene. There were break-ins and vandalism of many business buildings and a local Quick Trip Gas Station was burned to the ground. Several officers were also injured during the riot with one officer injured by a brick thrown at him. Others were injured by broken glass from nearby stores.

Apparently, there were a group of people in a yellow pickup truck that opened fire at police officers in a Walmart parking lot but at the time, the truck escaped capture. Also, some people fired shots into the air at news and police helicopters. In addition, police were called to nearby houses and apartment buildings due to reports of rioting and vandalism. Another groups of people attempted to steal an ATM structure while others stole merchandise from local retailers. Tear gas was used to breakup the riot.

Less than 24 hours later, many people from the community took to the streets to protest and on top of that, the mischievous cyber terrorists known as 'Anonymous"" took responsibility for hacking the city of Ferguson's government's database and accessing police and government officials' emails and other electronic files. In a public statement to {CNN}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html?hpt=hp_c2"">, they claimed that they were holding access to the database as long as the police do not interfere with the protestors.

At approximately, 2 pm today, President Obama arrived in Saint Louis and then at the Ferguson Police Department. The two police officers involved in the shooting death of Michael Brown have been suspended with pay pending an investigation.

Author's Thoughts

Between the riots and protests, I am worried that this will be like Rodney King. Those who know me, know that I am in no way racist so please do not think that I am coming from that side because of the color of my skin. For what it's worth, I do believe that the officers profiled the victim and acted without thinking and made the wrong decision. If, the victim truly did reach for the officer's weapon as reported, then all the officers needed to do was step back, raise their guns and order the victim to lay down on the ground. Obviously, there was no weapon found on the victim so simple verbal commands were all they needed to do. But, then again I was not there. I would ask other questions such as was this possibly the result of Suicide-By-Cop where people are suicidal but cannot harm themselves so they act in ways to cause an officer to shoot and kill a person for them. I am interested in the autopsy report to find out if the victim was on any type of medications (prescribed or illegal) that could have led to his behaviors? But, in the end if, the victim was simply minding his own business and no medications were affecting his body chemistry, then yes; the police have some explaining to do.

That said, I do agree with the protesting but I cannot get behind the rioting and mayham. I realise that I am disagreeing here with many people including my source who is related to the victim but personally; I just do not believe that we (as a community) need to resort to violence and destruction to get our point across. This type of activity makes the community no better than the officers who have no idea what racial profiling is. I do stand behind the protesting if it is to place the Ferguson Police Department under federal review to investigate for any police officers with prejudice biases against specific races and ethnicities and then to terminate said police officers. At the same time, the city of Ferguson is a fraction in size of most of the municipalities in Saint Louis County. The police department itself needs to be enforced by Saint Louis County Police instead.

There is a local video that has been going viral in Facebook by 3 brave young men pleading for the community to turn away from the violent outrage and find peace if only a 'cease fire' while the investigation into the Michael Brown's shooting is concluded and even then to remain civil about it. I urge people to watch this video. I have personally reached out to one the men, Jeremi Farrar who has given me permission to attach their video to this article. To avoid any negative backlash to these men, I will not be linking their Facebook page to this article, only the video.

If God created everyone in his image, then Dr. Martin Luther King took a leap of faith to remind 'all of us' that we are all created by that same design.

Alleged witness accounts by the friend of Michael Brown, Dorian Johnson, 22, who was with him during the incident by the police officers

{VIDEO CLICK HERE}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/video/Raw-Michael-Browns-friend-speaks-of-shooting--270791691.html"">

I have a couple of questions about the validity of this man's statements.

1) The news has reported that the victim was about 6' tall and about 300 pounds. So, from a sitting down position, how could the officer quickly reach the victim's necks and pull him in closer?

2) Unless a felony has been committed, there are procedures about shooting fleeing suspects and the officer could have called for backup. But, of course the blood trail will be drawn into evidence during the investigation.

3) How far away was the friend? Farther enough away not to get strangled or man handled by the officers, so farther enough not to hear anything? How is this man a witness; if involved in the alleged actions by the police officers, then why wasn't he arrested as person of interest?

4) other witness accounts suggest that michael brown egged on the cops and charged at him. At one point supposedly egging on the cops and also charging the cop and punching him multiple times until one eye was left sw poo llem shut.

5) if the police are shooting and you (the friend) did nothing wrong then why run?

Some of his choice of words seemed coached. Look I am not saying this didn't happen, only that it seems a bit far fetched to me. According to this witness, who was involved in the incident directly, he and Michael were walking down the middle of the street minding their own business when the police driving by them stopped and pulled in reverse and then blocked traffic in both directions. Next, the officer supposedly stated to both men to; ""Get the F. on the sidewalk."" While I suspect that there was some truth to that, I wonder if the officers asked them why they were walking in the middle of the street and not along the sidewalk but that is just more speculation. I do not understand the blocking of traffic in both directions. He stated that he advised the officer that they were about a minute from their 'destination.' The use of the word destination sounds a bit coached. I suspect that they stated to the officer that they were close to home or a friends, etc. NO matter; according to the man when the officer pulled his patrol car in reverse, it was in a manner in which it almost hit them. Well, first of all, if they were not in the middle of the street, this would not be the case; yet I have to wonder which way the two men were facing for the officer to turn his vehicle to block traffic and almost hit them?

And, this is where the witnesses accounts do not make sense. Michael Brown was said to be about 6 foot tall and about 300 pounds, yet according to Johnson, the officer went to open up his door but because Michael was standing so close to the police car, apparently the door ricochet back at the officer which only upset the officer. At which point, from a sitting position, the officer supposedly reached through his door window and grabbed Michael's door and then proceeded to choke him. By these accounts, the police officer would have needed to climb out through the car window when instead, he could have just backed up the police car. Nevertheless, apparently the officer reached only his arm through the window upwards to grab the neck of a 6 foot something, 300 pound individual and because Michael was struggling to get free, the officer supposedly attempted to drag Michael by his arm into the car through the window. At which point, Michael continued to struggle and then the officer pulled out his weapon and said, ""I'll shoot you or I'm gonna shoot and in the same moment, the first shot went off and we looked at him and he was shot and there was blood coming from him and we took off running."" Now, I am not denying that a shot was fired because there is evidence of this but by Johnson's accounts, the officer would have shot Michael through the car window. I would think that if a shot was fired and someone is injured by the shot, they would stop what they are doing and wait for EMS -- but to runaway is only going to aggravate the situation on both sides. According to Johnson, as they were running, the officer was attempting to get out of the car which suggests that yes; the officer shot through the car window.

Next, Johnson stated that the officer ran in pursuit of both men with the officer's gun drawn but that the officer did not see any weapons pointed at him. If this was the case, I do not understand why the police officer did not call for backup because typically there are rules against shooting fleeing suspects involved in a misdemeanor. There was no assault on the officer according to Johnson which meant no felony and the initial stop was for jaywalking which is a misdemeanor. By these accounts the officer took it to the next level. But again, I see many holes in Johnson's accounts. Also, he stated that after Michael was shot a second time, he put his hands in the air and kneeled down to surrender but then the police officer shot him several more times killing Michael. Johnson said that the officer fired his gun 7 times.

According to the news reports from multiple news outlets, there were two officers involved in the shooting, so where was the second police officer during this incident?

Whether true or not, I read that other witnesses in nearby homes also witnessed the incident but many claimed that Michael refused to listen to the police and then charged at the officer, and went for the officer's gun; while others stated that Michael charged at the officer and beat on the officer until his eye was swollen shut and the officer shot Michael out of fear for his life. Again, this is all speculation until the FBI's investigation and autopsy is completed. I am not suggesting that the officer's initial stop of the two men was not racially motivated which it could have been but I do have many questions about Johnson's testimony. Today, civil rights activist, {Al Sharpton}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Sharpton-plans-visit-following-deadly-shooting-in-Ferguson--270682651.html""> was in Saint Louis to defend Michael Brown's honor by painting him to be an angel, ""Gentle Giant."" This may be true of Michael Brown but is did he really know the victim to depict him as this or is he merely basing this information based on the word of the victims friends and family members?

I also retract Question #1 of my questioning of Johnson's witness testimony of how the officer allegedly reached through the car window from a sitting down position with the victim's height and weight of approximately 6', 300 pounds. It has come to my attention that all of the Ferguson Police patrol vehicles are trucks or SUVs. I am still interested in the autopsy report as to whether there were any drugs or prescription medication in the victim's system that could have altered his behavior that led to the initial incident. However, I would like to reiterate that police are not supposed to shoot at fleeing suspects during the commission of a misdemeanor which if the case for the initial law violation was in fact jaywalking. Even with resisting arrest, if this was the case, should not have come down to shooting the suspect. If indeed, the victim surrendered after fleeing and kneeled down on the ground with his hands up in the air, then the officer should have at the very least handcuffed Michael Brown. It is my expert opinion that the police officer executed the victim based on the validity of the following video and witness accounts.

Breaking News: The police releases the name of the police officer involved in the shooting and video evidence leading up to the events of the shooting.

Please refer to News Day's editorial for information by {clicking here [X]}<hyperlink=""http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/darren-wilson-identified-as-ferguson-police-officer-who-fatally-shot-michael-brown-1.9067980"">

Once again, I would like to point out the many holes in Johnson's eye witness testimony of his accounts of what allegedly transpired between Brown and the officer. Brown claimed that both Michael Brown and he were walking along the street minding their own business and were basically doing nothing wrong. Yet, the surveillance video in which both Brown and Johnson were identified by the employee of a gas station where Brown was accused of stealing a case of cigars suggests that they were not as innocent as Johnson initially reported. In fact, in the video, it appears that Michael Brown grabbed the neck or shirt of the employee and then forcefully pushed him out of the way as they exited the store with the stolen merchandise. However, the police are not charging Johnson with a crime at this time.

I have to wonder whether or not the officer did in fact grab Brown by the neck and attempt to choke him or if this was Johnson merely recalling a memory (of Michael Brown grabbing the neck of the gas station employee) and to look innocent, he turned it around and stated that the police officer was the one who grabbed the victim by the neck.

According to the news report, the victim's uncle, Bernard Eqing questioned the validity of his nephew's involvement with the gas station robbery and the police officer's response to the initial call.

""If he's a robbery suspect, they would have had the lights on,"" Ewing said. ""If you rob somebody, you would tell them, 'Get on the ground' or something, not, 'Get off the sidewalk.'""

-- Bernard Ewing, Michael Brown' uncle

Once again, we are interpreting these alleged sidewalk commands by the police officer through Johnson's testimony which may or may not be accurate reporting. With all of that said, I still feel that regardless of why the officer came into contact with Brown and Johnson supposedly based on a the robbery suspect's description and I still suspect that Brown resisted arrest and may have even charged at the officer causing the officer a swollen eye as previously reported by other witnesses; however, I still feel there could have been some racial tension by the officer and I completely believe that the officer executed the victim with excessive force and that the officer should be charged with some degree of murder.

The police officer involved in the shooting, Darren Wilson has worked for the Ferguson police department for 6-years and according to the police chief, the officer has never been reprimanded for disciplinary measures.

{Update as of 1:00 p.m., 8/17/14}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/16/ferguson-state-of-emergency_n_5684739.html"">

Missouri Governor, Jay Nixon declared a State of Emergency and has issued a Curfew for the city of Ferguson from Midnight -- 5 a.m. The tension between the protestors and the police have subsided slightly since the State Police were brought in to take charge of the security on the front lines. Some of the protesters have thanked members of the Missouri Troopers for their civil attempt to invoke communication more than a tactical presence. On the other hand, nearby store owners are in outrage because the police stood there and watched as they were continuously robbed. According to one State Trooper, ""Sure, food and liquor have been stolen but no innocent lives were lost which could have been the result had they intervened. As curfew approached every night, the police warn protesters to vacate the streets or else they will be arrested.

Still, I have to wonder about the so called friend, Johnson, who was with Brown during the shooting incident that led to this explosive outcries. According to Johnson, they were minding their own business and had been doing nothing wrong which was a lie considering that they had just stolen a case of cigars from a nearby merchant. I also love how Johnson stated that the officer reached up to Brown, grabbed him by the neck and then tried to choke him and while there could be some truth to this testimony, I feel that Johnson mentioned the attempted choking incident because it was fresh in his memory from what Brown had done to the store clerk when he stole the merchandise. In the video, Brown is seen grabbing the neck/shirt of the store clerk as he tries to stop Brown from leaving with the stolen merchandise and then, Brown is seen pushing the clerk back by his neck/shirt with the appearance of, ""He better not follow us!""

Also, now; the community and the family of Michael Brown and their attorney claim that the police released this video in an attempt to assassinate the victim's character when in reality, they had been asking for any and all evidence to be released. The truth is that yes; it does smear Brown's character but it also shows the type of person he was not described as by Rev. Al Sharpton; 'A gentle man.' There are rumors that Brown taunted the police officer and charged at him and then beat on the officer until his eye was swollen shut. This goes to motive that Johnson's witness accounts of them not doing anything wrong leading up to the events as pure conjecture. However, I do believe that the officer should have stopped and went from shooting mode to arrest mode the moment Brown stopped and raise his arms up. Although, now I wonder if he actually put his hands up and surrendered or if he slowed down running due to his gunshots and the officer was still chasing and shooting? Honestly, I am not sure at this point who to believe.

Saint Louis County Police Dispatcher: Video provided by the Cyber Hacker group known as ""Anonymous""

The following is the radio calls by Saint Louis County Dispatch in follow up to 911 calls by bystanders.

The footage shows what strongly appears to be Michael Brown in a convenience store not long before his death. In the footage he appears to be leaving the store without paying. When the store clerk tries to stop him, the young man in the video turns on the clerk with a physically threatening stance. The young man then leaves the store. It was just moments after this that Michael Brown was shot to death by a police officer.

These new details draw a line of separation between this case and the shooting death of {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/trayvon-martin""> -- even though people are broadly comparing the two high profile cases. It's true that Trayvon was also an unarmed teen when he was gunned down, but he was also not caught on surveillance robbing a convenience store or committing any other crimes. He was walking home with tea and candy that he legally purchased, presumably minding his own business, before George Zimmerman began following him. Michael Brown, on the other hand, appeared to be in the middle of committing a petty crime of theft, and was acting extremely aggressively in the video (if the man in the video is in fact Michael).

Even though Michael Brown was no Trayvon Martin, he did not deserve to be shot dead by a white officer in a town that has a history of {racism}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/racism""> against the black community (which happens to be the majority in Ferguson). {This brand new report shares that the teen was shot at least six times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html""> in a  scatter pattern, showing that the officer who shot him did so almost recklessly -- and the lack of gunpowder residue on Michael's body indicates that he was not up close to the officer when he was shot (unless his clothing tells a different story, but that's not being released yet). An attorney representing Brown's family said the following about the autopsy report:

""The sheer number of bullets and the way they were scattered all over his body showed this police officer had a brazen disregard for the very people he was supposed to protect in that community. We want to make sure people understand what this case is about: This case is about a police officer executing a young unarmed man in broad daylight.""

It's hard not to agree with attorney Benjamin L. Crump, but to play devil's advocate for a moment, it's also easy to believe that the scattered pattern of Michael's gunshot wounds would indicate that the cop was in a panic -- perhaps even fearful for his own well being. That still does not 100% justify the ""spray-and-pray"" shooting of an unarmed black teen, especially since as a police officer this man should have been trained in taking down a perp through nonviolent means (i.e. pepper spray or tazers).",1,43,NA,NAExaminer,exam13,http://www.examiner.com/article/december-12th-movement-hosts-rally-harlem-to-support-ferguson-mo-uprising,"December 12th Movement hosts rally in Harlem to support Ferguson, Mo.

Protesting Brown's death and police reactions to protests in Ferguson, Mo., marchers chanted slogans such as ""In the streets, we got your back,"" ""I love St. Louis!""

Other organizations present at the rally included the Party for Socialism and Liberation and People's Organization for Progress.

On Saturday afternoon, a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, USA Today {reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/"">. This comes after the death of Staten Island resident Eric Garner last month, who died while police officers arrested him for selling loose cigarettes. His death was {ruled a homicide}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/article/eric-garner-s-death-ruled-homicide-as-thousands-post-new-video-i-can-t-breathe""> by the medical examiner's office, stating that neck compression from a choke-hold killed him.

On Thursday, the Missouri Highway Patrol took control of Ferguson, taking law enforcement authority away from local police after four days of clashes between officers in riot gear and protesters peacefully protesting Brown's death, Star Tribune {reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.startribune.com/missouri-highway-patrol-takes-control-of-ferguson/271187501/"">.

Omowale Clay, one of the leading members of the Brooklyn chapter of the December 12th Movement, said that the rally sought to acknowledge and support the St. Louis uprising.

â€œI think itâ€™s fitting that itâ€™s in some place we didnâ€™t know, that we see the conditions there are similar to the conditions our people face across the country,â€ù Clay said. â€œThe purpose of the rally was to say, unequivocally, that we support the uprising and weâ€™re very clear about defining it as an uprising.â€ù

The marchers stopped on 125th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd. and Frederick Douglass Boulevard where Clay; Frank Graham and Constance Malcolm, parents of slain teen Ramarley Graham, whom police officers shot to death without a warrant in front of his grandmother and 6-year-old brother in his home in the Bronx in 2012; and Councilwoman {Inez Barron}<hyperlink=""http://council.nyc.gov/d42/html/members/home.shtml"">, who represents East New York, and her husband, former Councilman Charles Barron, addressed the marchers. They then marched back to 125th Street and Malcolm X Blvd.

Frank Graham said that people need to be more vocal about the injustices that the African-American community has experienced.

â€œI donâ€™t think weâ€™re angry enough because if we were, we wouldnâ€™t allow this to keep happening to our kids, our family, our neighbors, our loved ones,â€ù Graham said. â€œIt happens too often to us. They move on from one to another.â€ù

The rally took on a more political tone as Inez Barron and her husband Charles Barron criticized the appointment of New York City {Police Commissioner Bill Bratton}<hyperlink=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/headquarters_co.shtml""> â€” in particular, his ""broken windows"" policy, which Inez Barron said targets African-American children, criminalizing them for minor violations.

â€œWe have a policy here where as a continuation of stop-and-frisk, police officers are giving violations and summonses and arresting people for simple acts such as spitting on the street, walking violations or whatever else they think is not something that should be happening,â€ù she said.

One of the marchers, Cleatress Brown, 38, of Queens, said that simply marching is not enough. People have to present a unified front against what she said is the constant oppression of African-Americans, she said.

â€œWe have to come together,â€ù Brown said. â€œWe have to be united and we have to collectively stand together to say what weâ€™re not going to stand for anymore.â€ù",1,NA,NA,"just an article with a gallery, no content.

Tempers were high and answers were demanded to account for such an inexplicable and unspeakable calamity.

For nearly five hours, the body of 18-year-old Michael Brown lay, exposed, in the street where he had been slain by Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson. Wilson, it was alleged by{Dorian Johnson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2014/08/12/sot-dorian-johnson-michael-brown-shooting.kmov""> â€” a friend of Michael Brown's who had been with him August 9, the night of the fatal shooting â€” shot the teen who had been walking home from his grandparents' home. Both he and the victim had been unarmed when Wilson drew a gun, sitting in the patrol squad, and began firing, hitting Brown in the upper chest. At this point, the teens fled; Wilson got out his car and pursued them. Johnson hid; Brown kept running. Wilson shot, again; Brown stopped, turned around, fell to his knees with his hands in the air; Wilson approached and continued to shoot, hitting Brown at least four more times as he stood over the teen, killing him. Johnson said he, then, got up and ran, as fast as he could, home.

Although Dorian Johnson was an eyewitness and directly involved in the incident, Ferguson Police Department gave no credence to his account, preferring not to issue a public statement nor identify the police officer who shot the unarmed teen, claimed they were conducting an investigation into the incident. Residents of {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/12/us/5-things-ferguson-missouri/index.html?iid=article_sidebar""> â€” 67% of Ferguson's community is black; 29% is white â€” took to the streets in peaceful protest, demanding that the name of the officer be released. Of the 53 officers on the police force, only three are African American. The disproportionate ratio of racial composition of the force that is expected to serve and protect is one of the primary factors in the mistrust from the predominately African American suburban Missouri community. The addition of the disrespect of the body of the unarmed teen and the accusations levied against the victim, while the man accused of his murder remains free, and the recent release of two of three autopsy reports, has caused an atmosphere of chaos to hover over the community.

Monday, August 18, the federal government ordered a third {autopsy on Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/michael-brown-shot-times-autopsy-shows/story?id=25017247"">. It has been disclosed that 6 foot-4 inch Michael had been shot at least six times, two of those shots were to his head. One of those head shots is being called â€œ{the kill shot}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/michael-brown-survived-shots-shot-killed/story?id=25017247"">â€ù â€” meaning that Michael would not have survived nor moved after that head shot.

The Truth: Michael Brown was a 18 year old man, towering at 6'4"" and weighing 292 pounds. He did not have a criminal record, however, minutes before he was killed, he allegedly {robbed}<hyperlink=""http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-say-michael-brown-fit-description-strong-arm-robbery-suspect.html""> a local convenience store and assaulted a much smaller employee. He stole {Swisher Sweet}<hyperlink=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=swisher""> cigars popularly used for smoking marijuana. He recently graduated high school, but not in the traditional four years but needed an extra summer to complete his work. It is said that he was heading to {Vatterot College}<hyperlink=""http://www.vatterott.edu/""> within days the shooting. Yet, the university, in a very carefully worded {statement}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/15/was-michael-brown-enrolled-in-college/"">, would not confirm nor deny his enrollment. He was not a role model kid, no matter how many times his family and supporters state that he was. Still, he was well liked in his community and deeply loved by many.

There is great danger in putting Michael Brown's life and character on such a high pedestal. Just because he wasn't a ""good kid"" doesn't make him a bad kid and a menace to society. Yet, every time that we learn information contrary to the ""good boy"" image, the focus shifts from the killing of an unarmed young man to his faults and indiscretions. I predict that over the next few weeks we will learn many more facts about Brown that don't coincide with the ""good boy"" story.

Case in Point: The {video released}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/ferguson-police-release-surveillance-video-related-to-michael-brown-shooting/""> last week showing a young man, who strongly resembles Brown, committing a robbery, flew in the face of all those touting Brown as a good, {gentle giant}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/11/339509078/st-louis-area-rally-for-teen-killed-by-police-turns-violent"">. Instantly, the credibility of Brown's family was in question, and many began to ponder whether in fact, the police version of events, that Brown reached into Officer {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/darren-wilson"">'s police car and attempted to take his weapon, could be true. Someone in the Brown camp should have stated from the outset, ""Michael Brown was a young man who made foolish choices like many teenagers, but he was not a delinquent who would assault a police officer and try to steal his weapon.""

Brown's character will play a huge part should Officer Wilson face a trial for murder or manslaughter. Character assassination is a purposeful and effective tool used by either, and sometimes, both sides in many trials. The strategy very succinctly: the more heinous a person Michael Brown was, the more likely that he assaulted the officer and attempted to take his gun. Therefore, the defense will argue, Wilson had the legal right to use deadly force. Understanding this reality, the truth about Brown should be shared by his team and thus take the sting and ""shock value"" away from those who want to shift the focus from Wilson's actions.

In an ideal world (in which we do not live), Brown's character should have little to do with the crust of the matter. The sole point of contention is whether Officer Wilson had a legal right to use deadly force, thus shooting and killing Brown. There are many facts in reasonable dispute like: Was Brown and his friend blocking traffic? Were Brown's hands in the police car or outside of the police car on the door? Did Officer Wilson grab Brown by the neck? Did Brown assault Wilson by pushing him back inside his police vehicle? Did Brown tussle with Wilson over the gun? Did the gun first go off inside the police car? Was Brown running from the officer? Was Brown shot in the back? Was Brown shot repeatedly after he turned to face Officer Wilson? Did Brown have his hands in the air? Did Officer Wilson sustain injuries caused by Brown?

{Forensics}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/forensics""> will provide definitive answers to many of these questions and thus, supporting the claims of the {Ferguson Police Chief}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/ferguson-police-chief""> Thomas Jackson, or it will show that the police department's assertions are false. It is important to note: the public, nor the media, have been given access to Officer Wilson's statement of facts. Therefore, should forensics not support the {facts}<hyperlink=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/police-name-darren-wilson-as-officer-in-ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-shooting-1408108371""> repeatedly stated by the Police Chief, Wilson's team will undoubtedly provide a scenario that will mesh with the forensic findings.

After taking a week to ingest and digest all of the information surrounding this shooting, and giving Officer Wilson the benefit of every doubt, it appears that Wilson used excessive force in shooting and killing Brown. In fact, the most compelling eyewitness testimony comes in the form of a {live-tweet}<hyperlink=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/man-may-have-live-tweeted-michael-brown-death.html""> detailing the shooting as it took place, a picture of Michael Brown dead on the concrete, and the aftermath. From all that I have read, watched and listened to, the killing of Brown appears unnecessary and criminal.

It is true that in the entire state of Missouri, police officers may use {deadly force}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/blog/2014/08/15/missouris-standard-for-use-of-deadly-for""> if the officer's life is in jeopardy or the life of someone else is. However, the Supreme Court in {Tennessee v. Garner}<hyperlink=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/471/1/case.html"">, 471 U.S. 1 (1985), held under the Fourth Amendment,

When a law enforcement officer is pursuing a fleeing suspect, he or she may use deadly force to prevent escape only if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.
There seems to be no eyewitness testimony, nor statements from police representatives to suggest that Brown posed a ""significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others"" as he was fleeing.

Absent compelling evidence to the contrary, justice for Brown is possible. Therefore, the strength of Michael Brown's character is not needed to bolster the case against Officer Darren Wilson. The witness testimonies, ballistics and forensics are all that's needed.",NA,30,NA,one of the sources linked wasnt still upExaminer,exam16,http://www.examiner.com/article/gun-crime-continues-to-soar-chicago-as-media-focus-on-ferguson-mo-shooting,"Gun Crime continues to soar in Chicago as media focus on Ferguson, MO Shooting",Winston Dorian,8/18/14,2/24/16,"The Ferguson, MO media FRENZY is really no surprise because the media can't capitalize on a shooting or any crime where it's black on black crime.

Sadly this is ALL Black on Black crime but you will never see Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton showing up to turn the tragedy into a Media Circus like Ferguson, MO. What's really clear is that Chicago is a city where Gun Control laws are very strict. Clearly the fact remains that just having gun laws on the books has not reduced gun violence and gun crimes. Drugs play a huge role in the violence!! Until we can reduce the demand for illegal drugs there will continue to be needless and senseless violence and killing.

The gun violence and killing on the streets of Chicago are getting so much attention that the current Mayor Rahm Emmanuel may loose his job over the level of violence. A recent article in the Huffington Post addresses this topic:

{Gun Violence May Cost America's Most Famous Mayor His Job}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/25/rahm-emanuel-gun-violence_n_5618310.html"">

Two polls this month show Emanuel's approval far below potential challengers. The headlines practically wrote themselves: ""Rahmbo"" is in trouble.

It really is time for the liberals who talk a good game but can't make a difference in the cities that they manage to pay a political price. Where is the accountability? Where is the standard for public officials? Rahm Emmanuel has been no friend of law abiding gun owners and never will be. He's a gun grabbing anti-{2nd Amendment}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/2nd-amendment""> politician on par with the likes of Diane Feinstein, Mayor Bloomberg, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and the whole gang of liberals who support taking your rights away as a law abiding gun owner. If all the existing Gun Control laws and restrictions on the books aren't enough to control the killing then nothing will short of ""Confiscation"" and even then the thugs will still get and have access to guns leaving law abiding citizens even more vulnerable. One can't help to think that that is exactly what many and most on the left really want a completely vulnerable and dependent class of citizens fearing for their safety & well being.....sound familiar? The Democratic Party can't survive without a permanent class of dependents! They need dependents on Welfare, Food Stamps, Housing assistance, and yes dependents for Public Safety too.

As many armed citizens are learning was the case just this week in Ferguson, MO many areas were NOT patrolled or covered by the police... so what will people do? How will people protect their lives and property when just like this week the Ferguson police dept. made a conscious and deliberate decision to not patrol or cover certain areas of town?

The reality is that regardless of your views on guns and gun violence when the real Chaos occurs the Police Dept. is NOT going to be there to support or protect your property or your life. Personal protection is a personal responsibility and many in Ferguson, MO are learning this fact first hand the hard way.

As for the Gun violence in Chicago, the liberal Democrats who run that city should look in the mirror and admit that their policies, strategies and tactics are clearly not working to reduce crime. Doing the same thing over & over and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.

One of the bullets entered the top of Brown's skull, the Times said, indicating that his head was bent down when the bullet struck him.

According to reports, Brown was shot when he allegedly rushed Darren Wilson, the officer involved in the shooting. At least two people have said Brown turned and rushed Wilson.

Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump said he didn't know anything about marijuana being found in Brown's body.

The topic of comparison was the shooting death of the unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, by a {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/ferguson"">, Missouri police officer.

While {Twitter}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/twitter""> was spitting out second-by-second updates, Facebook seemed to be falling farther and farther behind. Facebook users would be watching their CNN live news coverage of officers threatening tear gas into faceless crowds of Ferguson protesters and national news reporters while their Facebook feeds were posting news updates stating that everything was â€œrelatively peaceful.â€ù

Or worse, no Ferguson coverage at all was making it to millions of Facebook news feeds, simply because of the usersâ€™ past news preferences of Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber updates.

A Washington Post editorial from the same day, August 19, 2014, tries to explain why this might have happened. According to the writer of the editorial, Alexandra Petri, the problem may simply be the standard {Facebook â€œlikeâ€ù button}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2014/08/18/twitter-facebook-and-ferguson-our-awareness-problem/"">. It is sometimes very difficult for a Facebook user, even in the privacy of their own homes, to click the â€œlikeâ€ù button on such a terrible and appalling news story. No human being with any sense of decency LIKES what is going on in Ferguson, so we are more reluctant to click the â€œlikeâ€ù button.

And since Facebook uses algorithms to control the information and news feeds that we see, algorithms that are manipulated and influenced by our â€œlikesâ€ù and â€œshares,â€ù the quality of the news feeds that we receive is often negatively affected as a result.

Twitter does not use these same algorithms, but there are algorithms used nonetheless. The interactions on the Twitter feeds are instantaneous and uncompromised by the Twitter administration. As one Twitter user put it rather eloquently,

When it comes to breaking news like #ferguson, @Twitter has proved its power. @Facebook has been great for showing ice bucket videos.

But both Facebook and Twitter have their share of problems. Neither platform of social media offers fair and balanced news coverage, regardless of the topic at hand. Of course, the same can now be said of our television news reports, as well. The algorithms used on Twitter were a bit slow to react to the national importance of the Ferguson controversy. The story trended locally very quickly, but it took some time to catch on to the national trend.

Like it or not, we now live in a digital age of choices. We can now â€œchooseâ€ù the news we want to see and from what media resource we want to see it. Perhaps there is no one-size-fits-all solution, but that is part of the beauty of living in the ever-changing world of the Internet.

To the reader:

Let there be no misunderstanding or misinterpretation of this articleâ€™s commentary.

Unequivocally and unapologetically the intention of this commentary is to pull back the â€œvelvet curtainâ€ù and unveil to the world the â€œugly sideâ€ù of living in America as it pertains to millions of African-Americans who are constantly being underestimated, undervalued and marginalized {Thank you Joe Madison for driving the bus} by Negrophobic yahoos who feel threatened by â€œThe browning of Americaâ€ù.

The truth is the far majority of Americans could care less about their neighborâ€™s and co-workerâ€™s skin color, however, it would be foolish NOT to believe that a nefarious coven of losers who pretend to be American patriots and defenders of the U.S. Constitution, have (while we politically slept) infiltrated our local, state and federal governments.

Their political victories have ushered in the passing of legislation / policies that have a long-lasting and negative impact on Black, Brown and poor White communities throughout the United States.

The only way to defeat the sons and daughters of the confederacy and the sons and daughters of the John Birch Society is to organize and vote them out of office, beginning with local elections.

Never be afraid to ask a political candidate what they specifically represent and what their vision for your community / America looks like.

Itâ€™s imperative for our future and the future of our children that we register to vote and cast our ballot. The Fall senatorial and congressional elections are rapidly approaching, donâ€™t fall for the conservative â€œOakie Dokeâ€ù that lulls you into believing that your vote does not count and has little effect on your life. In reality your vote is priceless.

Question: How is it possible that Blacks who comprise nearly 70% of Ferguson, {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/missouri"">â€™s population are grossly underrepresented as members of the cityâ€™s police force, the city council, and school board?

Answer: A large percentage of Blacks in Ferguson have been hoodwinked and bamboozled into believing their vote does not count AND adding â€œinsult to injuryâ€ù, not enough â€œpreachersâ€ù are emphasizing the need for their parishioners to be active in local politics .

The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truthâ€_so help me God

In the United States it doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re from the affluent and gated communities of Beverly Hills, California or if youâ€™re from the poverty stricken Lower 9th Ward located in New Orleans, Louisiana, â€_if youâ€™re Black or Brown-skinned living in America and a White police officer / deputy sheriff / state trooper stops you for ANY reason, itâ€™s not outrageous to say with ardent conviction that statistically you only have a few seconds to make that White â€œofficer-of-the-lawâ€ù feel â€œtotally comfortableâ€ù before your life expectancy begins to significantly diminish.

To the naysayers who vehemently disagree that in the year 2014 a large segment of African Americans are STILL being targeted for extinction and enslavement by an evil consortium of Neo-Confederate Whites, corrupted courts, a penal system thatâ€™s resupplied by a â€œschool-yard to prison-yardâ€ù pipeline and last but not least, a multitude of racist police departments that view â€œconfrontationalâ€ù African Americans as â€œanimalsâ€ùâ€_ let the record reflect that itâ€™s because of people like YOU that a small but nevertheless despicable element of Negrophobic White Americans are allowed to literally get away with murder and mayhem that literally threatens the security and future of our nation.

To the fake residents of Ferguson, Missouri who burn and loot the very neighborhoods that must sustain the citizens of Ferguson long after the â€œsmoke clearsâ€ù and the â€œwheels of justiceâ€ù begin to turn in order to render closure for the murder of Michael Brown, â€œYouâ€™re a disgrace and a bunch of punk bitc@!!â€ù. (expletive) Only a coward vandalizes and burns down his / her own neighborhood. If you want to impress the world with your â€œcourageâ€ù and â€œcommitmentâ€ù go and vandalize / burn down the Ferguson, Missouri Police Station. If you do, I guarantee lyricists and poets will one day write songs about you.

To the countless law-abiding citizens of Ferguson, Missouri who stood defiantly between would-be looters and the stores they protected, a sincere, â€œThank Youâ€ù.

To Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, â€œStand up like a man and show moral courage by firing St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch, heâ€™s biased and in addition to having absolutely no appetite to indict Michaelâ€™s Brownâ€™s murderer, heâ€™s no friend to the residents of Ferguson, Missouriâ€ù.

â€œA coward dies a thousand deaths, but a soldier only dies once.â€ù â€“ 2PAC

In the News

Over the last 8 days connoisseurs of â€œU.S. and World Newsâ€ù have hypnotically tuned in to their favorite cable / satellite News station(s) and in amazement witnessed the small city of Ferguson, Missouri, a municipality thatâ€™s approximately 18 miles from St. Louis, Missouri, erupt in anger and despair over the senseless murder of an unarmed local 18 year-old Black youth named Michael Brown by a White Ferguson police officer who from every witness account, lawlessly used his authority as a police officer to callously end the life of Michael Brown.

According to multiple witnesses, police officer Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran, after allegedly stopping Michael Brown and Dorian Johnson for â€œwalking in the streetâ€ù, soon thereafter for unclear reason(s), gave chase to both Michael and Dorian, shooting at them and ultimately hitting Michael Brown at least once.

Statements from at least three eye-witnesses confirm that Michael Brown who appeared to be wounded by officer Wilsonâ€™s gunfire, after initially running from the officer, soon fell to his knees while simultaneously holding his arms and hands upwards in the â€œuniversally acceptedâ€ù gesture of â€œI submit / I surrenderâ€ù.

Incredulously as if from a scene in a gangster-movie, Officer Wilson in broad daylight shoots an unarmed and capitulating Michael Brown several times, killing him cold bloodedly in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri.

Question 1: â€œDoes a police officerâ€™s solemn oath to â€œServe and Protectâ€ù the public mean something totally different in Ferguson, or St. Louis, or New York City or New Orleans, or Los Angeles or Miami or anywhere Black, Brown and poor White folk reside in Americaâ€ù?

Question 2: â€œDoes statistical data / evidence exist that prove that the Ferguson Police Department has a history of wrongfully discriminating against its Black and Brown citizens?â€ù

Question 3: â€œWhy was Michael Brownâ€™s body left in the streets for hours before it is removed?â€ù Is it a wonder that the world has now begun to ask, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with the Ferguson Police Department and with state government in Missouriâ€ù?

Of important note

Over the last few decades due to school integration and â€œWhite-Flightâ€ù, Ferguson like many cities in the United States has evolved demographically from being predominantly White to now having a majority Black population. Of important note, during the early 1970s, Ferguson was 99% White; however in 2014, Blacks now comprise nearly 70% of the municipalityâ€™s population.

Incredulously in a small city that is predominately Black and Brown, only 3 out of 53 police officers in Ferguson, Missouri are Black. Police Chief Thomas Jackson who is also White completes the totally lopsided / unbalanced â€œscale of justiceâ€ù that oversees and over shadows police activities in this small city thatâ€™s only twenty minutes outside of St. Louis, Missouri.

From the beginning, the murder of Michael Brown has incited nation-wide anger over what appears to be the strong return of â€œJim Crow-Justiceâ€ù throughout the United States.

From the moment Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson decided to inject intimidation into the psyche of local residents who protested Michael Brownâ€™s murder by deploying approximately 75 military-garbed and military-equipped police officers near â€œground zeroâ€ù, the â€œfuseâ€ù was lit to detonate an angry explosion of rhetoric between the community of Ferguson and police.

What cannot go unnoticed or unreported is the beautiful bond / solidarity that exists between the Black, Brown and White citizens of Ferguson. Ferguson is a thriving and growing metropolis that deserves better voter participation and better leadership.

Seeing Ferguson policemen wearing military garb while brandishing military assault-like weapons while standing next to vehicles whose design were made to withstand the blasts of bombs and the bombardment of bullets, conjure images of confrontation between Palestinians and the Israeli army and of Alabamaâ€™s infamous Commissioner of Safety, Theophilus Eugene â€œBullâ€ù Connors who ruthlessly ordered Birmingham police officers and firemen to use physical violence , water cannons and attack dogs against Black and White protestors of Alabamaâ€™s Jim Crow laws in 1963.

Police Chief Jackson is not only a disgrace to the uniform he wears for inciting violence in the same city that he has sworn to protect and serve, but heâ€™s also incapable of managing a major crisis. Again, who elected him?

The two brightest glimmers of hope shining through â€œdarkened Ferguson skiesâ€ù have been the establishing of Captain Ron Johnson from the Missouri Highway Patrol as â€œHead of Securityâ€ù and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. Captain Johnson, who is both an African-American and grew up in Ferguson, Missouri, is everything in a leader that Chief Jackson is not. His genuine love for Ferguson and its residents is well received by the people who call Ferguson, Missouri home. With the aid of local organizations that stood guard over local stores and helped calm down angry protestors, Captain Johnson and his Highway Patrolmen have restored a fragment of â€œpolice trustâ€ù in Ferguson.

In regard to the other glimmer of hope, Eric Holderâ€™s U.S. Attorney Generalâ€™s Office has dispatched dozens of federal agents to investigate Michael Brownâ€™s untimely demise and the Ferguson Police Department. The citizens of Ferguson are rightâ€_.why hasnâ€™t police officer Darren Wilson been arrested / indicted for the murder of Michael Brown? Why hasnâ€™t St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch indicted Darren Wilson? Are not eye-witnesses from Ferguson who saw officer Wilson execute Michael Brown in the streets credible enough for McCulloch?

In closing, the far majority of Americans are â€œhipâ€ù to played-out â€œGood old boys tricksâ€ù that involve sullying the name and character of the victim. Michael Brownâ€™s possible involvement with stealing cigarillos from a local store has absolutely nothing to do with him being gunned down in the streets by an officer of the law. Since when is it legal for a police officer to anoint their self as our judge, jury and executioner? Michael Brown was unarmed and had surrendered to officer Wilson...to be shot dead in the streets like a rabid animal is not only wrong, itâ€™s immoral. Governor Nixon â€œhas it twistedâ€ù, itâ€™s not the looters who are the greatest threat to the citizens of Ferguson, Missouri, itâ€™s the Ferguson Police Department.

Our deepest prayers go out to the family and friends of Michael Brown. To Michael Brownâ€™s mother and father, â€œThe world knows that your son was murdered by a policemanâ€_the world is watchingâ€ù. â€œHands up donâ€™t shoot.â€ù

As always, the New Orleans Examiner is interested in what you think. Why hasnâ€™t police officer Darren Wilson been arrested for the murder of Michael Brown and why hasnâ€™t St. Louis County DA Robert McCulloch indicted officer Wilson as well? Inquiring minds wanna know.

Until next time, Good day, God bless and Good fishing.",6,1200,NA,NAExaminer,exam20,http://www.examiner.com/article/obama-s-statement-on-the-killing-of-michael-brown-fbi-investigates,"Obama's statement on the killing of Michael Brown, FBI investigates",Mona Austin,8/14/14,2/24/16,"On August 10, 2014, Michael Brown was returning from a convenience store, walking down a street in Ferguson, a Suburb of St. Louis with his friend Dorian Johnson.

This week the 18-year-old planned to step into his future by entering a tech school his mother said. But Brown never made the journey to pursue a higher education because he would never take another step in that Ferguson neighborhood.

The officer and Brown scuffled, according to the police report, leaving the officer with a swollen jaw.

Moments later shots were fired and Michael Brown took his last breath. Bang. Bang. Bang, Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Eight bullet holes were reportedly found in the teen's body.

Citizens in the predominately Black suburb Ferguson were on edge, unable to understand what had taken place.

Bedlam erupted after conflicting reports about what led to the teen's death at was expected to be a peaceful prayer vigil. Days later tensions continued to boil over. Tanks and soldiers armed with heavier artillery than the local police carry arrived in Ferguson. In. The. United. States. Of. America.

The initial police report says Brown reached for the officer's gun during a scuffle. Johnson, an eye-witness has completely refuted the officer's account alleging they were confronted without cause and his friend's arms were raised above his head, when the officer fired again and again, leaving Brown on the ground with eight holes in his body.

Brown's death is the fourth police killing of an unarmed Black man in the last month that has made national headlines.

While vacationing at Martha's Vineyard President Obama called for calm in a statement on the matter, following its entirety.

Statement by the President on the Passing of Michael Brown:

The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time.

It took more than a week before Ferguson police released the name of the officer that shot Brown. He is currently in hiding. On Sunday August 17, protesters marched the streets of Ferguson in a peaceful manner, however that evening the peaceful demonstrations turned violent well before the midnight curfew. According to reports people in crowds fired off gun shots and Molotov cocktails were hurled at police. At one point a police command post was overrun forcing the use of tear gas and rubber bullets to regain control of the site. It was a move that authorities had hoped to avoid. Captain Johnson told reporters,

Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of response.

During Sunday nightâ€™s chaos, it was reported that two people were shot, but not by police. The two wounded were shot by other civilians in the crowd. Seven people are reported to have been arrested Sunday night.

It was on Thursday that Missouri Governor Jay Nixon put Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson in charge of maintaining peace in Ferguson; in effect relieving the Ferguson Police Department of their responsibilities. It was a decision that was met with praise by members of the community. Captain Johnson expressed his desire to not have to use force in enforcing the midnight curfew ordered by the Governor. With the violent clashes intensifying in consecutive nights in Ferguson the Governor has called in the National Guard to help maintain order and fully enforce the midnight curfew.

The community has been quick to criticize the police's use of the military style equipment that's visible on the streets of Ferguson. From night vision goggles, armored vehicles and assault weapons, the police look very similar to a special operations unit in combat. Residents are also skeptical of the use of the National Guard.

On Monday afternoon, retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen.

The Second Autopsy

The family of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/michael-brown""> had pleaded with authorities last week for a federal autopsy to be performed. Attorneys for the family of Michael Brown were able to retain the services of famed forensic pathologist Dr. Michael M. Baden. One of the reasons the family was so anxious for a second autopsy by their own pathologist and or the Federal Government is the lack of transparency that the St. Louis Medical Examinerâ€™s office has shown since they conduct the first autopsy of Michael Brown. The familyâ€™s basic questions have until now remained unanswered. Dr. Baden has released preliminary results of his examination. His results indicate that Brown was struck by six bullets, four in his arms and shoulder and two in the head.

According to Dr. Baden in a press conference on Monday August 18, five of the six shots were not fatal. However the shot to the head located on the apex of Brownâ€™s head was the fatal shot. Dr. Badenâ€™s examination found no signs that Brown was involved in a physical struggle and that their examination could not determine the order of the shots. He did however say that some of the injuries could be consistent with some of the eye witness statements. However, Dr. Baden was reserved with making a definite conclusion until he was cable to confer with the first autopsy findings.

In a very professional and diplomatic style, Dr. Baden said that in cases like the shooting of Michael Brown where the community has an interest in finding out what really happened, its best to get the information out that as fast as possible. He did say that when a Medical Examiner finishes their report it may not be released if the prosecutor feels that the release of the information my damage their investigation. However from the start he said that the family were entitled to the very basic information of Brownâ€™s death such as how many times he was shot and if he suffered. Dr. Baden concluded that Brown did not suffer.",NA,3,NA,"showed one photo but if clicked on it would go to a gallery, not sure if it should be included or not but I included it as a gallery"Examiner,exam22,http://www.examiner.com/article/calls-for-death-erupt-on-twitter-after-police-name-officer-ferguson-shooting,Calls for death erupt on Twitter after police name officer in Ferguson shooting,Joe Newby,8/15/14,2/24/16,"On Friday, police {identified}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/police-release-officer-fatal-shooting-ferguson-missouri/story?id=24992945""> {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/darren-wilson""> as the officer who shot 18-year-old {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/michael-brown"">, sparking days of violent protests.

Jackson did not name the suspect in that robbery. Police have said that Brown was shot during a struggle for the officer's gun, but others said Brown's arms were raised when he was shot.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told ABC he believes releasing Wilson's name would help in the healing process. It also meets a key demand set by activists with the New Black Panther Party and others.

""I was pleased to hear the chief indicate this would be a day in which, finally, that initial name would come out, and weâ€™ll work to make sure that his family [is safe] and thereâ€™s security around that,"" he told ABC News. ""I think those kinds of concrete steps of transparency leading to justice are vitally important now to heal the old wounds that have been made a fresh by this difficult and horrific situation.""

Police in Ferguson, Missouri, once charged a man with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms while four of them allegedly beat him.

â€œOn and/or about the 20th day of Sept. 20, 2009 at or near 222 S. Florissant within the corporate limits of Ferguson, Missouri, the ... defendant did then and there unlawfully commit the offense of â€˜property damageâ€™ to wit did transfer blood to the uniform,â€ù reads the charge sheet.

Henry Davis, the man in question, was arrested for an outstanding warrant that proved to actually be for another man of the same surname, but a different middle name and Social Security number.

The booking officer had no other reason to hold Davis, who ended up in Ferguson only because he missed the exit for St. Charles and then pulled off the highway because the rain was so heavy he could not see to drive. The cop who had pulled up behind him must have run his license plate and assumed he was that other Henry Davis. Davis said the cop approached his vehicle, grabbed his cellphone from his hand, cuffed him and placed him in the back seat of the patrol car, without a word of explanation.

But the booking officer was not ready just to let Davis go, and proceeded to escort him to a one-man cell that already had a man in it asleep on the lone bunk. Davis says that he asked the officer if he could at least have one of the sleeping mats that were stacked nearby.

It gets worse. From the {Mail Online}<hyperlink=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2726727/Ferguson-police-mistakenly-arrested-innocent-man-viciously-beating-charging-bleeding-THEIR-uniforms.html"">:

Davis was placed in a one-man cell, which already had one man asleep on the only single bed.

Being early morning and cold, he asked for a sleeping mat from a nearby pile, but was refused.

Some time later, Davis said in a lawsuit file thereafter, the booking officer returned to the cell with three other officers.

He said he was slammed against the back wall by one of them and told to lay down with his hands behind his back.

Davis was straddled by a female officer, he said, and cuffed.

There is no mention in either article of whether Davis won his lawsuit. Luckily, {George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley has the answer at his blog}<hyperlink=""https://jonathanturley.org/2014/08/16/bleed-on-a-ferguson-police-officer-get-charged-with-destruction-of-public-property-oh-my/"">:

Davis sued the city for civil rights violations, but late last year Magistrate Judge Nannette A. Baker ruled in favor the city. His attorneys filed a notice of appeal in March, and the case is currently slated to be considered later this year by the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals.

The question now becomes what bearing, if any, this case has on the Brown case. The argument will be made that this demonstrates a pattern of systematic abuse. But does it?

The Davis case is one isolated example of bad cops that occurred five years ago. None of the sources I consulted provided the names or whereabouts of the officers involved.

They also played their trump card in the case. Brown allegedly stole cigars from a convenience store approximately 15 minutes before he was fatally shot (murdered?) by Officer Darren Wilson. For some, this ""smoking gun"" will be the justification for accepting the status quo. Now we can blame the victim for doing something he ought not have done. Now we have a legitimate reason for the officer to have stopped Brown and his friend in the first place. We can understand why the physical altercation occurred. We can call Mike Brown a bad guy, and rest well knowing the cop was the good guy.

Only... that doesn't sit well with me. Hopefully, it doesn't sit well with you either. If you're on the fence, I hope I'll be able to sway your opinion in the following paragraphs.

We can start with the most obvious difficulty. Mr. Brown allegedly stole cigars from the store. He allegedly assaulted a police officer. He allegedly disobeyed an instruction from the police. In America, allegations of criminal wrongdoing are decided by judges. Police are not judges. Their job is to apprehend suspects and get them safely to the judge. You know... protecting... and all that.

If we assume the worst -- that Mr. Brown was guilty of all the alleged offenses, what ought to have happened to him? Well, in Missouri, stealing the cigars as a first offense {is a misdemeanor}<hyperlink=""http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/crime-penalties/petty-theft-missouri-penalties-defense"">, punishable by no more than a year in jail and no more than a thousand dollar fine. What about assaulting an officer? Well, {that's a Class A misdemeanor}<hyperlink=""http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/misdemeanor-assault-missouri.htm"">, too Remember that in America, we don't do ""cruel and unusual"" punishment? In the worst imaginable scenario, Mr. Brown ought to have spent a year or two in jail. And this assumes he was guilty. We don't know that. Because... judge.

But some may object that Mr. Brown was a big scary man, and he had proven himself violent by (allegedly) attacking the officer in his car and trying to get his gun. Again, let's assume the worst. Mr. Brown did not get the gun, and he ran away after the officer (allegedly) shot him from inside the car. So far, we can work with this. If the officer was in danger of losing his gun to an assailant, we can probably justify him firing his weapon. But Mr. Brown was killed outside the vehicle, while the officer had every reason to believe he was unarmed. If witness reports are to be believed, whatever remaining shots were fired {resembled an execution}<hyperlink=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/08/14/1321564/-New-witness-steps-forward-in-Michael-Brown-shooting-provides-new-video?detail=email"">, not an officer fearing for his life. According to the {latest reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/ferguson-police-officer-shooting-id-110049"">, at the time of the fatal shooting, there was another officer on the scene. Fleeing unarmed suspect? Two armed officers? As trump cards go, the Ferguson PD doesn't seem to have much. We can wait and see what else they may have, but really, what kind of evidence would justify killing an unarmed man with multiple rounds? What could Mr. Brown possibly have done outside the vehicle -- after already being shot -- that would give the officer the right to end his life?

(Oh, and if you are finding yourself still siding with the police on this, {think carefully about which allies you're courting...}<hyperlink=""http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2014/08/ferguson-kkk-reward-money-for-hero-police-killer-of-unarmed-youth-3011514.html"">)

Even if we give the police every benefit of every possible doubt in this case, we still have a much bigger problem to deal with. Before this incident, the nation was still reeling from the murder of an unarmed black man in New York by a police officer who suspected him of selling hot cigarettes. There were two other stories that didn't make national headlines, last month. That's 4 unarmed black men dead in a month. This is surely symptomatic of a much larger problem, right?

In a word, yes. There is a big problem with police murdering people in the U.S., and being black is a big risk on that count. Over a seven year period ending in 2012, white police killed {approximately two black men a week}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/police-killings-data/14060357/"">. No, that's not a typo. Two a week. If that number upsets you, you'll really hate this one. The ""two a week"" number was derived from the 750 agencies who reported such things. There are 17,000 agencies. Only 4% of the police departments in the U.S reported for this study. So let's just say it: It's more than two a week. Even if we're being improbably conservative in estimating the rate of all 17,000 agencies, we must assume that the problem is much bigger than what's being reported. A grassroots anti-racist organization {conducted their own study}<hyperlink=""https://mxgm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Operation-Ghetto-Storm.pdf"">, and estimated that one black person is killed by police or security guards every 28 hours. Depending on which report you believe, between 44% and 71% of the victims were unarmed. Oh, and for folks who are thinking maybe cops are in a war zone, dying left and right at the hands of gang bangers? Not precisely. In 2013, {105 police died in the line of duty}<hyperlink=""http://www.odmp.org/search/year?year=2013"">. That's all deaths, including traffic accidents, heart attacks, training accidents, and even drowning. Only 30 were from gunfire. And yes, that's all the agencies reporting. Not 4%. Oh, and it includes Puerto Rico, too.

Unfortunately, this is just the tip of the iceberg for black people and law enforcement. Pick a metric -- any metric -- and the numbers will bear out gross racism. Black people are profiled, stopped by police, arrested by police, and sentenced far more often than white people, and receive longer sentences to boot. These facts are absolutely undeniable, and the racist pleas of ""black people shoot each other more often"" ring hollow. Yes, urban areas with majority black populations are often dangerous places, but good social scientists will tell you that factoring poverty and social networks into the equation {levels the racial playing field}<hyperlink=""http://www.medicaldaily.com/persons-social-network-predicts-gun-homicides-more-race-gang-affiliation-and-poverty-262840"">. No, it's not black people's fault. It's just not. {Black people are victims of gross, inexcusable racism at the hands of law enforcement}<hyperlink=""http://www.civilrights.org/publications/justice-on-trial/"">. It is systematic. It's not being reported, and police officers are not being punished. We cannot predict how the case of Michael Brown will end up, but if the past is an indicator of the future, the best guess is it will end with another dead black man and a narrative of regret from the police, but no action against the killer.",2,138,NA,NAExaminer,exam25,http://www.examiner.com/article/kansas-city-policeman-creates-ferguson-facebook-controversy,Kansas City policeman creates Ferguson-Facebook controversy,Matt Rowland,8/19/14,2/25/16,"Matt RowlandOn August 19, 2014, the New York Daily News ran a story about a Kansas City policeman named Marc Catron who allegedly shared a misleading image of a young man who looked very much like the deceased teenager {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/michael-brown""> of the {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/ferguson"">, Missouri outrage. Above the picture was a rather abrupt comment that was considered offense by many in the {Facebook}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/facebook""> community.

The post soon went viral, with many on social media immediately began calling for a Kansas City {police}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/police""> investigation into the matter along with an official reprimand of Officer Catron. The young man in the Facebook image was shown pointing a handgun directly into the camera with a bottle of alcohol on the table and a wad of cash in his mouth. The young man in the photo was not Ferguson's Michael Brown. It was a picture of {Joda Cain, an Oregon murder suspect}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/kansas-city-review-posting-fake-michael-brown-pic-facebook-report-article-1.1909021""> accused of killing his very own great-grandmother.

The fact that a police officer could have made this kind of mistake by accident is part of the reason for the Facebook uproar. Many believe that the Cain photo was intentionally used to create shock value to support the rather sarcastic comment written above.

Iâ€™m sure young Michael Brown is innocent and just misunderstood. Iâ€™m sure he is a pillar of the Ferguson community.

Should a professional law enforcement officer be making such hurtful comments about an unarmed teen who was recently shot and killed by a fellow policeman in Ferguson, Missouri? Perhaps not. {A spokesman for the Kansas City Police Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.knoe.com/story/26316786/kansas-city-police-officer-controversy-in-the-michael-brown-shooting""> is stating that Catronâ€™s actions are being regarded as a personnel issue that will be addressed.

Jay Nixonâ€™s imposition yesterday of a curfew.

What appears to have been lost in the past weekâ€™s violence is that all of this unrest was precipitated by two things. First, there was a strong-arm robbery, captured on security cameras, allegedly committed by 18-year-old Michael Brown. Then there was Brown walking up the middle of a street and getting involved in some sort of confrontation with officer Darren Wilson. One of several images published by the {Daily Mail}<hyperlink=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2726609/Stores-looted-including-one-slain-teen-Michael-Brown-allegedly-stole-cigars-sixth-night-confrontation-Ferguson-St-Louis-police-ordered-stand-Highway-Patrol.html""> shows a walkway just steps away from where Brownâ€™s body was laying on the pavement.

In a {YouTube video}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdIHFM27IhM"">, a man wonders why police didnâ€™t shoot the looters who took advantage of the tragedy and the protests to steal. An investigation will determine whether the shooting of Brown was justified, but that incident cannot be used as an excuse to pillage private businesses and steal. Peaceful protest is one thing; looting and property damage are quite another.

There is something else emerging from the events in Ferguson, a community most of America was happily ignorant of prior to Aug. 9. Conflicting press reports about the incident have confused people.

Yesterday, the {Seattle Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/timeline-of-fatal-police-shooting-of-michael-brown/""> and Fox News both ran an {Associated Press}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/associated-press""> report that said this: â€œ12:01 p.m.: Wilson encounters Michael Brown walking in the street, and the shooting follows. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said Friday that Wilson did not know about the robbery at the convenience store when he encountered Brown.â€ù

However, {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/robbery-report-could-have-made-ferguson-officer-more-wary/article_2e863e1b-11ce-5cc3-9098-3075c105d596.html""> reporter Robert Patrick yesterday reported this: â€œThe circumstances faced by Officer Darren Wilson contained both elements, according to a description Friday by Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson.

â€œHe said Wilson was aware there had been a robbery involving cigars,â€ù Patrick wrote, â€œbut did not realize when he ordered two young men to stop walking in the street that they were suspects. Wilson made the connection when he noticed cigars in Brownâ€™s hand, Jackson said.â€ù

Which is it? Did Chief Jackson misstate the facts at some point, thus contradicting himself? Did the Associated Press get it wrong, or did the Post-Dispatch?

As soon as the name of Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson Police Department was released as the police officer who shot Brown, Internet sleuths began their research of Google Images to turn up potential photos of the man to determine if he indeed a black man.

â€œFerguson Cop: Heâ€™s Bla-ack,â€ù screamed the {headline of an article on the website}<hyperlink=""http://theblacksphere.net/2014/8/ferguson-cop-is-black-plus#lkxUTfckibxvsAIT.99""> called The Blacksphere, which enjoyed more than 6,200 Facebook likes, 1,300 Facebook shares and several other shares on social networking sites. Alas, the black man pictured is reportedly not Darren Wilson. â€œWe are removing this story, since we are told that this is NOT the same Darren Wilson. Efforts are being made to find the correct Darren Wilson.

""That said, I still believe this cop is black,â€ù wrote author Kevin Jackson, whose article is still live as of this writing. The name certainly sounds as if it could be of African-American origin, which is no doubt why Google Trends is filled with searches for any image related to Darren Wilson of the Ferguson police.

Indeed, the release of a multitude of surveillance photos showing an overweight suspect robbing a convenience store of cigars have brought questions from some in the general public over why the information wasnâ€™t released earlier, despite the objections of the DOJ. The nation seems at odds over the purported image of complete innocence initially released to the public surrounding the aura of the unarmed black teenager contrasted against the violent, threatening robbery images, while others are calling the news that came in the wake of the videoâ€™s release a smear campaign.

And yet, the Googling public also still tries to uncover the true photos of the cop to determine if he is black or white.

As with the tragedy of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown's death has become symbolic of the disparaging treatment to many young black men in America.

Most of the parking spots in the lot and along nearby blocks were off limits to parking by private citizens. The meters had red bags over them with something about Reserved for Emergency Vehicles. I did managed to drive through the metered courthouse parking lot, only to be stopped by a police officer in all black riotgear asking what my business was there today. I stated that I was looking for parking to gain access to the courthouse. He told me to move along. After being nearly run over by emerging cars scrambling for parking spots as if their lives depended on it, I drove off. I ended up finding a metered parking spot on the other side of the St. Louis County Police Headquarters where ironically, nobody was protesting. Although, my advice to anyone going to the St. Louis County Courthouse or IRS building next door to the courthouse, allow yourself about 45 minutes to find adequate parking which could very well be about 3-4 blocks away. Several of the nearby streets alongs S. Central Ave where the courthouse and Justice building are located were blocked off by police barricades.

As soon as I approached the entrance to the courthouse, I could hear that chanting by protesters:

""What do we want?""

""Justice!""

""Who do you protect?""

""Who do you serve?""

""Hands up, don't shoot!""

I was aware that there were protesters in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/ferguson""> and in parts of Saint Louis County but I did not expect to witness this site in Clayton today. Well, at least from what I witnessed today, the crowd remained civil; however, by the sight of police in riot gear and carrying around assault rifles and military grade kevlar it was clear the police were ready to take action if needed.

Between all of the civil rights violations, racial profiling, the war zone going on about 20 minutes from my home, and the not so civil protesters, the rioting, and now the National Guard patrolling the streets of Ferguson and Saint Louis County, there is one song that I am reminded of and honestly, if you read between the lines of the lyrics, the song pretty much speaks volume. {CLICK HERE FOR THE VIDEO OF CIVIL WAR BY GUNS 'N ROSES [X]

I love how Civil Rights Activist, {Al Sharpton}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/al-sharpton""> has been in Saint Louis and was quick to defend Michael Brown. While I am not staking an opinion just yet that the victim was a perpetrator that led to his death, I am merely suggesting to wait for all of the evidence and witness testimony to speak the truth rather than simply makings snap judgements about Michael Brown's character based on character witnesses by friends and family members. Al Sharpton has stirred up just as much hostility as has many of the protesters and a good many of them do not care about Michael Brown's death but rather a crime of opportunity to steal merchandise from store owners and burn down a QT gas station. I mean seriously, How does stealing and burning down stores make those people any better than the police officer who probably shot an unarmed kid for nothing more than his own prejudice and empowerment? I doubt very seriously that Michael Brown's parents and extended family members are behind the rioting and mayhem. There is a civil way of seeking justice for Michael Brown's death and it is certainly not by committing multiple felonies of theft and egging on the police with more violence.

Change needs to come from both sides of the law but in this case, there are 3 sides: (1) The police department, (2) the private citizens, (3) the criminals. However, these days it tends to be somewhat difficult reading between the lines of who is who. First thing they should be doing is, terminate the Police Chief of Ferguson for his poor tactics and the way he allowed the police to handle the shooting of Michael Brown in the first place. A first responder whether police or EMS should NEVER leave the scene of a shooting especially where there is a fatality unless the first responder's life has potentially life threatening wounds. The police officer Wilson should have done many things differently that day but the one thing he should have done was called for backup the moment a single shot was fired.

Nonetheless, here it is about 50 something years later and we still have yet to get the war on civil rights resolved amicably. I am a Civil Rights Activist which is why I always try to right from both sides and voice my opinion afterwards but I truly believe that Rev. Al Sharpton has only added to the violence in the streets of Ferguson and Saint Louis County, If Civil Rights Activists, {Malcolm X}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/malcolm-x""> and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or even Rosa Parks were alive today, one they would be so ashamed by reactions on both sides but also by the need to remind everyone what it means to come together during a time like this. Sure, there was at least one bad apple in the police force; one who killed an unarmed man and no matter who it is spawn with; Michael Brown charged at the police officer or he had his hands up and begged the officer not to shoot him, let alone kill him; I have to wonder now whether Ferguson police officers carry Taser guns which probably would have left this victim alive and talking rather than executed as if to shut him up.

No matter, I am reminded of some famous quotes that I feel need to be restated today:

""The future belongs to those who prepare for it today."" -- Malcolm X

""We must learn to live together as brothers, or we will perish together as fools."" -- Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

""If you cannot fly, then run. If you cannot run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl. But, whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward."" -- Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

The situation may have been out of control before the infamous Swisher Sweets were stolen from the QuikTrip convenience store. The Ferguson {Riots}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/riots""> very well may be the perfect example of what happens when equal parts of apathy, the entitlement mentality and arrogance meet.

Pigeon-holed by the Washington Post to their {Monkey Cage}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/15/how-ferguson-exposes-the-racial-bias-in-local-elections/""> category (their words, not mine), the good folks at the WaPo don't exactly pull their punches with an article entitled ""How Ferguson exposes the racial bias in local elections."" Little is left to the imagination as to why the town's mayor as well as five out of six city council members are all white in a city that's almost 70 percent black - it's all a plot by white folks designed to keep the black folks down. At least that's how I take the WaPo's manipulation of dubious charts and alleged facts.

Now just to make sure I understand things correctly, more than a few are asking why the Ferguson Police Department, as well as the aforementioned elected officials, are overwhelmingly of the Caucasian persuasion. Especially in a city where blacks have been in the majority of the population for over two decades, why isn't there a greater representation on the FPD than a measly 6 percent? In all honesty, that's a fair question.

Yet according to the Washington Post the problem lies in local elections being held during odd years, as well as the elections are defined as non-partisan (where party affiliation doesn't appear on the ballot). Or as the wisened writers for the Post tell us, when the equation involves odd numbered years and candidates not telling us if they're Democrats or Republicans, the inevitable result is that the losers are ""people with less education and less income."" Ummm... isn't it just a wee bit prejudiced to automatically insinuate that the blacks are the ones who are stupid and poor? That's just how I read the Post's strong suggestion thereof.

Again, I just to make sure I understand things correctly - There's no poll tax in effect in Ferguson nor are there any Jim Crow laws or any literacy requirements on the books. If the oppressed blacks of Ferguson, Missouri want change in the complexion of their police department (instead of making sure the best cops available are hired), then why don't they demand such of their local officials?

As the Post pointed out, black residents of Ferguson essentially stayed home during the April 2013 municipal elections. Despite whites being roughly a third of citizenry, whites showed up to the polls greater than blacks by a 3-1 average. Now if it's due to odd years and no party affiliation being the reason, then why does Memphis, Philadelphia and Jacksonville all have black mayors? Why does Los Angeles and El Paso have Latino mayors? All those cities also happen to have their elections on odd numbered years.

What's happening in Ferguson now is exactly what happens when We The People just don't care anymore. But now that someone's been killed, the tear gas is flying, and agitators of all colors take take to the streets, are we suppose to throw out a slew of legitimate and transparent elections because of the threat of mob violence? That's not the way we do things in America.

If those so interested in burning down their own neighborhood because they don't like the way things are, now want immediate gratification in the wake of Michael Brown's killing, then maybe if they were more interested in voting instead of throwing Molotov Cocktails, maybe ... just maybe Michael Brown would still be alive right now.

On the morning of Aug. 10, Brown was shot and killed by a St. Louis County police officer after engaging in a physical altercation with him.

Brown, an African-American resident from Ferguson, was unarmed at the time of the shooting, so his family and many local community members were extremely upset he was killed, even though it was confirmed that he tussled with the officer in the moments prior to the shooting. It hasn't been confirmed that Brown was going for the officer's gun during the altercation, which made the shooting even more controversial. Shortly after Brown was shot and killed, a candlelight vigil was held for people to pay their final respects to Brown.

Unfortunately, several businesses in Ferguson were vandalized and looted after the vigil turned violent. Over a dozen people were arrested in the first night of looting, and the situation got even more intense on Aug. 11. Schools were cancelled on the morning of Aug. 11 because student safety became an issue, as hundreds of people gathered outside the Ferguson Police Department to demand justice for Brown's death.

That night, police used tear gas to break up crowds that didn't protest peacefully, and some key media members were arrested during the chaos. Tensions rose between protesters and police for the next two nights, as dozens more were arrested. By Aug. 14, President Obama got involved, urging calm and patience in the wake of the Ferguson shooting.

The shooting death of 18 year old Michael Brown is tragic. Reports say that Brown struggled with the officer, blackened the officerâ€™s eyes, and then tried to get the policemanâ€™s gun. It was during this struggle that the young man was shot and killed.

The Ferguson, Florissant, and Dellwood communities are understandably concerned. However, the destruction of property and subsequent looting of local businesses are difficult for residents to connect to the untimely death of Michael Brown. People in the St. Louis area wonder what one really has to do with the other.

During the evening hours Monday, August 11, police from surrounding municipalities were sent to assist Ferguson police in containing the crowds. Within their own municipalities, police guarded and patrolled local businesses as the looters branched out to neighboring communities. Twelve miles from Ferguson, fighting broke out at the St. Louis Galleria in Richmond Heights, Mo, resulting in {two arrests}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Reports-St-Louis-Galleria-evacuated-following--270826041.html"">.

""St. Louis County Police Chief, in 2011, on visiting Israel to learn about police tactics from the Israelis,"" Greenwald {tweeted}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/statuses/499919889428385792"">. He linked to a document posted Thursday morning by Trita Parsi, founder and current president of the National Iranian American Council.

""Wondering why the excessive police violence?"" Parsi asked. ""Here's a guess: #Ferguson police chief got training in Israel."" The implication is clear: Israel is somehow to blame for what happened in Ferguson after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot.

There's only one problem. As Dunetz noted, Tim Fitch is no longer the St. Louis County police chief, having announced his retirement {last December}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2013/12/13/st-louis-county-police-chief-tim-fitch-set-to-retire-in-2014/"">. Moreover, Parsi was incorrect when he claimed the Ferguson police chief was in Israel. Apparently, facts don't seem to matter when there's a left-wing agenda to advance.

A number of people took Greenwald to task for his attempt to link the situation in Ferguson to Israel. Many saw the tweet as anti-Semitic and a pathetic attempt to attack the Jews.

""Visited Israel: Mother Teresa, Gandhi, Dalai Lama, Einstein, & @BarackObama,"" one person said. ""Guess they learned their tactics from Israel, too.""

""Everything in the world is not Israel's fault,"" another person said. ""Hamas isn't even Israel's fault. Stop blaming ISRAEL!!!""

Dunetz said it's not the first time Greenwald has exhibited anti-Semitism. According to Dunetz, Greenwald has promoted the idea that Jews control the government while questioning the loyalty of Jewish-Americans. In 2010, for example, he called former Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., an ""Israel-Firster"" for saying the U.S. should stand up for Israel. Dunetz also posted excerpts from two other articles he said shows Greenwald's anti-Semitism.

In the midst of all the disruptions was a Fox News reporter who found himself in an angry, on-air confrontation with a protester on national television. At one point the protest can be heard cursing out the reporter telling him ""Say that sh*t. No say that sh*t."" A video of the interaction, {via Mediate}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzl2rBXvZ78"">, can be seen above, with a summary below.

What appears to have the protester was the following comment from Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan,

This is right now a media event, pure and simple. This is people running towards tear gas, running away from it. The dignified protesters went home at dusk. This is just child's play right now.""

Harrigan's comment painted all the demonstrators present as children who were only interested in media attention rather than peace and justice.

The protester, clearly upset, then thrust himself into Harrigan live shot saying, ""Say that sh*t. No say that sh*t.""

Harrigan attempted to get the man stop by telling him that he was on live television. The protester quickly noted that he did not care whether he was on television or not, and told Harrigan that facing tear gas and rubber bullets is no child's play.

Fox News host Shepherd Smith appears to blame the situation on the ""bright lights"" of the media, saying the situation has devolved into a show.

To his credit, Harrigan stands down and allows the protester to yell at him before engaging the man in a calmer conversation about the frustration and anger which has been built up among the protesters.

The tragic death of Mike Brown has resonated throughout the nation and it has become a moment for deep reflection. To better understand the societal disconnect and racial strife in Ferguson, the history of the region and why it has become so politically shattered must be examined.

â€œThe Great Divorceâ€ù

I live in a city about 10 miles west of Ferguson, one of 90 tiny-to-smallish municipalities that make up St. Louis County. Home to a million people, St. Louis County is often considered the â€œeconomic engineâ€ù of Missouri providing 34% of state income tax revenue, 20% of the stateâ€™s jobs, and the larger St. Louis region covering 51% of federal income tax paid in Missouri. The countyâ€™s racial makeup is about 70% white and 23% African-American with varying concentrations and clusters spread out among the 90 different municipalities, with 35 of those each having a population of 2000 or less.

The City of St. Louis, home to 320,000, is famous for not being included in the county because of â€œThe Great Divorceâ€ùâ€”a decision made in 1876 by city residents to politically separate from the county. At the time, the county was sparsely populated farmland. The city folk didnâ€™t want to pay for farmers out in the hinterland, and being only a decade after the Civil War, significant cultural animosities still existed between abolitionist St. Louisans, and secessionist, rural Missourians. For the burgeoning Mississippi port city it seemed like a good choice and the resultant 61 square mile jurisdiction appeared more than ample for any future expansion. However, â€œThe Great Divorceâ€ù turned out to be a horrible policy and a prescription for decline. Extricating the city from the county has only fractured the region; it has hampered growth and development, and created a metropolitan area that stands as one of the most segregated in America. Attempts have been made for consolidation, for reunification, but all have failed.

As myriad St. Louis County municipalities began incorporating in the late 1800s and early 1900s, population continued to grow in both the city and county, but with governance separate and {independent}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/independent"">, the city and county were often at odds with one another. This parochial attitude promoted a â€œcircle the wagonsâ€ù mentality and was not only confined to city/county dynamics, but also pervaded the many competing municipalities emerging in St. Louis County, as MSNBCâ€™s Chris Hayes remarked, â€œ[St. Louis] is sort of like a municipal Game of Thrones.â€ù

One of the key umbilicals attaching county residents to the city was severed during the â€œGreat American Streetcar scandalâ€ù which, beginning in the 1930s, had General Motors forming artificial holding companies with investors such as Standard Oil (gas) and Firestone (tires) systematically purchasing and dismantling electric mass transportation in 45 cities including St. Louis. Initiatives like this only further contributed to {urban decay}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/urban-decay"">. Walls of separation were being built, and again, were only echoed by competing parochial interests between county municipal fiefdoms.

Starting in the 1950s and 60s, St. Louis has had one of the most extreme cases of â€œwhite flightâ€ù in the nation with a massive migration into surrounding areas. Urban decay has also driven residents away. City population peaked in 1950 with 850,000, but by 1970, it dropped precipitously to 620,000, with the countyâ€™s population ballooning at 950,000. The last 40 years has seen the exodus continue. As of the 2010 census, the city population dropped to its lowest point since the 19th century (320,000) and the countyâ€™s population dropped for the first time since its inception. This has summoned new calls for political consolidation which would save an estimated $10-40M per year by eliminating waste, in addition to presenting a more holistic case for economic development by attracting new businesses and jobs to the area.

Ferguson, as an inner core city in St. Louis County, has had a particularly pronounced case of â€œwhite flightâ€ù which has amplified racial inequities in the local government. In 1980, 85 percent of Ferguson was white and 14 percent blackâ€”30 years later it is 29 percent white and 69 percent black. And although federal and state legislators covering the Ferguson area are African-American (U.S. House Rep. William Lacy Clay, State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, and State Reps Sharon Pace, Courtney Allen Curtis, and Rochelle Walton Gray), the local municipal leaders are almost all whiteâ€”the mayor, police chief, five of six City Council seats, and six of seven school board members. This racial imbalance promotes the feeling of â€œblacks being under occupation,â€ù as Rev. Jesse Jackson intoned yesterday on CNN. These dynamics of racial and economic segregationâ€”coupled with detached and disconnected local representationâ€”are prevalent in many of Americaâ€™s urban areas, Rust Belt cities in particular. And this environment has all contributed to the civil strife surrounding the death of Mike Brown. Ferguson rage is not only about a police shootingâ€”itâ€™s about a segment of our population that feels left behind and hopeless. On a deeper level, itâ€™s about white privilege and echoes from the Civil War.

â€œHave, Hope, Help, Healâ€ù

On August 18th, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ordered the National Guard to Ferguson to prevent further destruction of property and to protect the police staging area. It's important to note the National Guard has not been deployed to quell civil unrest in the region since at least World War II. For those in the St. Louis Metropolitan area, Ferguson is a wake-up call and should inspire a profound moment of introspection. The community is fractured and bleeding and the worldâ€™s eyes are on St. Louisâ€”we need to heal and to come together. A dear friend of mine, artist Seth Kaufman, in the wake of the Rodney King riots in LA, crafted a sublime statement for a community wracked with shock and loss: â€œHave Hope Help Heal.â€ù Those four words were emblazoned on a prominent billboard in the middle of Sunset Blvdâ€”â€œHave Hope Help Heal.â€ù And to me, they are absolutely instructiveâ€”urging us to press in and bring healing, understanding, and compassion for those suffering from a sense of hopeless and disenfranchised injustice. Ferguson is the kind of pivotal event that insinuates that change is not only possible, but necessary.

How can we have hope and help heal?

There are tracts within our community that are destitute and in many ways this is the result of decisions made in the aftermath of the Civil War. We should reject those past mistakes and work to correct them. A â€œcircle the wagonsâ€ù mentality no longer serves us. The fractured cityscape, with municipal fiefdoms littering the county, are all aspects of past wounds, injustices, and are born from an obsolete, shortsighted worldview. Connecting our communities and breaking down the old walls of separation would help, but itâ€™s a difficult political task to accomplish.

Former Missouri State Senator Jeff Smith, in an {op-ed}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/opinion/in-ferguson-black-town-white-power.html?_r=1""> for the New York Times stated:

â€œIn shrinking cities, politics is often a nasty, zero-sum game. But consolidation could create economies of scale, increase borrowing capacity to expand economic opportunity, reduce economic pressures that inflame racial tensionâ€_â€ù

We should stop thinking about me, me, me, and start thinking about how we, as a community, can help those in need, and in so doing elevate the collective prospects for our cityâ€”if the City of St. Louis is allowed to further descend economically, we will all sink, because we are all passengers on the same boat. On the other hand, should we examine our hearts and decide that itâ€™s better to come together as a result of this crisisâ€”rather than building more walls of separationâ€”we could surmount this challenge and begin to build the kind of world class city St. Louis could be and should be. Likewise, political consolidation and accommodation between neighboring municipalities in the county could create a framework where increased equity and opportunity would thrive. In a {piece}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/the-platform/editorial-unify-st-louis-and-stop-the-slow-drain-of/article_4dc0cd99-d57c-52a9-9c37-88b741eeb6eb.html""> last February from the Post-Dispatch editorial board, they state, â€œUnification, we believe, can put a stopper in the slow drain of our region's economic power,â€ù and that, â€œunification is about investing our entire region in the proposition that a greater St. Louis is possible only if its core regains vitality.â€ù

What Will You Do While the World Watches Ferguson 24/7?

We will all be processing Ferguson for many, many months with HLN, CNN, FOX, MSNBC and 24-hour news coverage reminiscent of the media frenzy surrounding the shooting of Trayvon Martin or the O.J. Simpson trial. The justice pursued will largely be a function of perception, with a polarized narrative between two accounts of the shooting that are in dispute. Like millions of people, Mike Brownâ€™s father said he doesnâ€™t believe the system has worked so far, but that â€œeventually, justice will prevail.â€ù As I marched in Ferguson on Saturday, one week following the tragic shooting, the words I heard among protesters were bouncing around in my head: â€œkeep hope aliveâ€ù â€œwe are all equalâ€ù â€œI am somebodyâ€ùâ€”phrases given to the crowd by Rev. Jesse Jackson in call and answer.

A sign held by one protester had a quote from author Cornell West: â€œNever forget that justice is what love looks like in public.â€ù

But, to me, justice in the big picture would be the nation receiving a â€œheads-upâ€ù from the Ferguson moment to prevent unnecessary killings; justice would be law enforcement professionals receiving needed anti-bias training; justice would be a new era of political engagement to reinvigorate our democracy; justice would be the St. Louis region coming together for healing, and galvanizing as a result of this tragedy; justiceâ€”real justiceâ€”would be confining obsolete policies and worldviews born of fear of â€œthe otherâ€ù to the dustbin of history to allow our children a greater inheritance and a legacy to be proud of. Ferguson, to me, shows us this possibility, that to overcome the flames threatening to burn down our house, we can, and must come together as a region, as a nation, as a people.",NA,56,NA,NAExaminer,exam42,http://www.examiner.com/article/new-black-panther-leader-barack-obama-a-mau-mau-from-kenya,New Black Panther leader: Barack Obama a 'Mau Mau' from Kenya,Joe Newby,8/15/14,3/7/16,"After taking over a police press conference in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/ferguson"">, Missouri, on Thursday, {New Black Panther Party}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/new-black-panther-party""> leader Hashim Nzinga went on a rant attacking {Barack Obama}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/barack-obama"">, {The Blaze}<hyperlink=""http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/14/raw-video-new-black-panther-party-protesters-take-over-ferguson-police-chiefs-news-conference/""> reported.

According to the Census, Warner Robins has a 50 percent non-white population --37 percent African-American and seven percent Hispanic. In Ferguson, the overall population is approximately 22,000 and two-thirds or 67 percent is African-American.

It is well documented that Ferguson city {government}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/government""> is exclusively white despite the town being two-thirds black. On a side note, there are only four black officers on Ferguson's fifty-eight (58) member police force.

Due to at-large districts, there are no African-Americans represented on the Houston County Commission and out of six council seats in Houston's largest city --Warner Robins--there is is only one African-American.

WGXA-TV {reported the following}<hyperlink=""http://wgxa.tv/story/central-georgia-pastors-discuss-ferguson-and-race-regulations-20140819#axzz3Asujx3mt"">:

Several say race has got to be extracted from the equation and there needs to be more focus on the main problem.

""The focus has been shifted from Michael Brown to the race, the rioting, the looting, the fighting and we got to get back to the issue and I think that's us coming together,"" said Pastor Troy Wynn.

The pastors suggest working with government officials and their police departments as a joint effort for communication and looking beyond racial lines.

""All police are not bad, all black men are not bad but we have these images that are incarcerating us,"" said Wynn.

The top priority is educating youth on how to deal and approach situations with law enforcement.

Warner Robins' Chief Brett Evans was asked by WMAZ-TV about the number of African-Americans on the police force, but declined about the diversity numbers.

From the Warner Robins Police Department website, Chief Evans provides a message to the community: â€œThe Warner Robins Police Department is committed to fairness, compassion and excellence; providing police services in accordance with the law, while being sensitive to the needs of the public we serve. We are truly committed to community partnerships through which we can address crime and public safety concerns.""

In April 2010, Houston Countyâ€™s NAACP President Larry Holmes addressed the lack of diversity inside the Warner Robins Police Department at a City Council meeting.

Holmes used statistical data to make his case to the Warner Robins City Council that something needs to be done to address the lack of diversity within the Warner Robins Police Department and among the different departments throughout the city and county.

The Houston NAACP leader revealed in April 2010 that African-Americans only make up approximately five percent of the Warner Robins police force. However, African-Americans make up close to one-third of Warner Robins population.

Very bluntly, Mr. Holmes said, ""I see a problem with that and something needs to be done about it.""

The {NY Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/if-they-gunned-me-down-protest-on-twitter.html?_r=1""> reports that Brown was shot and killed on Saturday, Aug. 9, 2014, by a police officer in Ferguson, a mostly black suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. The situation is still being investigated and details of the shooting are at the center of a major dispute.

There are reports stating that Brown, who was to start college next week, was unarmed and wrongfully shot this past weekend.

Anger has spewed across Twitter and Facebook and thus gave birth to the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown, but there is one big reason in particular for it.

Some news stories used a photo in the story of Brown's death, and it showed the teenager with his fingers extended high. A number of people have looked at the symbol as one of peace, but others are looking at his hand signals as ""gang signs.""

Thousands upon thousands of African-American men and woman have tweeted photos of themselves in response to these disputes.

The pictures are side-by-sides with one showing the user in normal, everyday life. The other image shows them as the stereotypical thug or gangster. Included with the tweets and images was the hashtag stating #IfTheyGunnedMeDown.

Why then would a town of this small size need to have all the {paramilitary equipment}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary""> that has been seen lately on the TV.

Rioting and looting has been taking place since the shooting. Most of the time though the protests have been peaceful. The police have been using tear gas and rubber bullets to try and break up the crowds. The police have been arresting anybody who doesn't move quickly enough when they are told to disperse. Two reporters and an Alderman were arrested when they didn't move quickly enough for the police the other night.

The force that this small police has been using is reminiscent of what the {Gestapo}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo""> of the 1930's {Nazi Germany}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany"">  used on its own people. Has the {United States of America}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/united-states-of-america""> begun to use the tactics of the Nazis.

The idea that is being used is that the citizenry of the United States are just as armed as the police. Which is a falsehood that most of this country would deny.

Should the people of Ferguson be out and about destroying public property no they shouldn't. The family of the young man Michael Brown have called for no violence but that seems to be falling on deaf ears.

The country has taken up the cause to protest as among some 90 other cities have taken to the streets in protest of the police shooting.

From referring to Justin Timberlake as a ""{basic cable Caucasian}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/NIGNORAMUS/status/500798787368288257"">"" to lecturing him about being ""{too rich to be this stupid}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/tiabia/status/500793426900955137"">,"" J.T. realized his ""black pass"" was about to be revoked quicker than when he went AWOL after the Janet Jackson Super Bowl controversy. This was coming from the J.T. that soul singers loved to love, not the one egging homes and getting caught making racist jokes on camera. Some Twitter users just weren't vibing with the idea of him calling someone a ""ninja,"" a less commonly used alternative to the n-word.

The most popular reaction to his tweet seemed to be a matter of bad timing. As one {Twitter user said}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/RantingOwl/status/500793027468996608"">, ""Justin Timberlake chose *this* week to call Madonna 'my ninja'? I just can't.""

With emotions at their highest since the {Trayvon Martin case}<hyperlink=""https://www.pinterest.com/maroonsista/trayvon-martin-gz-trial/"">, Twitter users are monitoring any and all news about Michael Brown, the unarmed teenager who was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. This is in addition to police officers shooting down Ezell Ford from South Los Angeles, California, who was also surrendering to cops, and the choking death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York City. Now whether his tweet would've gone over better if people weren't relentlessly monitoring three racially based cases at the same time is anybody's guess.

But maybe his tweet was much more innocent than it seemed. Another {Twitter user}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/chwhiterose222/status/501000123250671616""> tried to put it all into perspective by associating the term with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film: ""For the record @jtimberlake was talking bout raphael u know #TMNTmovie just came out. So he picked it up. They call raphael chucking ninja.""

The problem isn't just people's opinion of whether black people are being too sensitive about the n-word or the too-close-for-comfort term ""ninja,"" but Madonna's own reputation for using the n-word with her son, Rocco Ritchie.

In an {Instagram post}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/passantino/madonna-calls-her-son-the-n-word-on-instagram-deletes-commen#.ee76RZa0dG""> of Rocco boxing, her caption read: ""No one messes with Dirty Soap. Mama said knock you out! #disnigga.""

So even if J.T. was referring to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, it's difficult to rationalize that with someone who is so comfortable using the n-word to describe her own son.

Of course others feel like there are more important things going on in the world than J.T. referring to the pop singer as a ""ninja"" and then deleting the tweet. The one-dimensional crowd that believes others can only take on one issue at a time are spamming comment boards all over Facebook. No matter what the post is about, if it's not about what they're concerned about, the comment section is ridiculing publications for talking about any other entertainment, local or national news.

Strange enough, this same group doesn't seem to be too thrilled with the idea of just ignoring those unrelated posts and moving on to an online or print publication talking about what they want to discuss. And J.T. is at the bottom of the totem pole for what their current interests are. Fair enough. But it doesn't change the merit of discussion on the ongoing n-word debate. No one's emotions are more important than another's.

Contrary to popular belief, not all African-American people embrace the n-word, specifically the older generations. However, there are some in the Generation X and Y group, usually more savvy when it comes to African-American history, who just aren't feeling the idea of anybody using the n-word or variations of it. But still others adamantly argue that words only hold the power that they are given, and regardless of the past definition of it, a simple change in spelling somehow magically erases all of the word's history.

J.T. chose to try to avoid the argument he'd have gotten into had he left the tweet up. But as with many celebrities with ""oops"" moments, the damage is done. He may still get the ""pass"" he's always gotten in the R&B world for being incredibly talented. His vocal opposition to the {Donald Sterling controversy}<hyperlink=""http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/justin-timberlake-celebrates-donald-sterling-ouster-at-staples-center-los-angeles-081614""> certainly helps his fans defend him.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson commented on the racially charged protests and the struggle that officers are having with maintaining peace â€“ this despite calls by both Michael Brownâ€™s father and President Obama for peaceful remonstration. Jackson also confirmed that hackers attempted to burrow into the police database to reveal the name of the officer, but were unsuccessful.

â€œUnfortunately, an undertow (of racial unrest) has bubbled to the surface,â€ù Jackson said.

Brown was unarmed, and the story, as one might expect, took on an instantaneous racial overtone. African Americans within the St. Louis suburb where Brown died took to the streets, and a candlelight vigil held Sunday night turned into an out-of-control evening of aggressive looting, burning, smashing storefronts and windows of parked cars; goods were carried out of broken stores by the armful.

{Multiple YouTube videos captured mostly black males}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=st+louis+riots"">, many of whom had handkerchiefs or other articles of clothing covering their faces, smashing and grabbing items from destroyed storefronts.

Police were forced to use tear gas rounds in order to quell the crowd. Over 30 arrests were made when the night was over. Multiple officers were injured after rocks were thrown at the police; one officer was struck with a brick.

Monday night, the rioting continued. Reports USA Today:

Police Chief Tom Jackson said members of the crowd threw rocks at police and gunfire came from the crowd, so officers used tear gas and shot ""beanbag rounds"" meant to stun them. Jackson said police blocked off the area where most of the looting and vandalism occurred the previous night out of concern that cars passing by might hit demonstrators in the street.

Brown was reportedly unarmed and had his hands raised over his head when he was gunned down by what appears to be a white officer. A scuffle occurred inside of the police patrol car; an officer was reportedly shoved into the car and a struggle for the officerâ€™s sidearm ensued. One round was fired in the car. The altercation then spilled out into the street, and Brown was thereafter shot.

Details of the scuffle, and what exactly Brownâ€™s role was, remain unclear and under investigation. At least one other person was with Brown at the time.

Sunday night, the vigil for Brown drew a crowd of over a thousand individuals, with the scene taking a decidedly violent turn. Angry protestors demanding answers shouted: â€œWe want answer,â€ù and â€œNo justice, no peace,â€ù while a news conference was being conducted. Some men spray painted â€œRIP Michaelâ€ù in the middle of the street. Others walked into the St. Louis police station and shouted, with their hands up: â€œDonâ€™t shoot me!â€ù

Brownâ€™s mother Lesley McSpadden, who attended the vigil, said she needs answers, and she wants the officer who killed her son to face the death penalty.

â€œI would like to see him fired,â€ù McSpadden said. â€œI would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty. My son just turned 18 and graduated from high school, and he donâ€™t bother nobody. They told me how many times my son was shot. Eight.â€ù

Various pics of Brown have been circulated on social media. One picture, showing a somber-faced teen in a red tank top, throwing up a gang sign, contrasted with another â€“ a younger picture of a smiling Brown in an arcade. MSN News commented on the war raging in the court of public opinion: {Black shooting victims face trial by social media}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/black-shooting-victims-face-trial-social-media"">
St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said there were at least five arrests and no reports of looting. He said police using loudspeakers were urging people to go home.

Brown's family, in conjunction with the NAACP, has retained Benjamin Crump, the attorney best known for representing the family of Trayvon Martin, another unarmed black teen who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman.

â€œI don't want to sugarcoat it, their baby was executed in broad daylight,â€ù exclaimed Crump while flanked by Michaelâ€™s parents. â€œWe want to know and see exactly what happened because this family rejects what the police authorities said at their press conference.â€ù

Says USA Today: â€œDemonstrators expressed similar frustrations with many saying Brown's death is the latest example of black life not being valued by police officers who see youth of color as dangerous. Several on Twitter using the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown expressed their anger over Brown's death.â€ù",NA,1,NA,"No images, just a video"Examiner,exam52,http://www.examiner.com/article/st-louis-riots-rioting-over-black-teen-s-death-by-cop-lingers-another-man-shot?cid=db_articles,"St Louis riots: Rioting over black teen's death by cop lingers, another man shot",Evelyn Bennell,8/13/14,3/10/16,"{Riots}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/riots""> in St. Louis over the shooting death of 18-year-old {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/michael-brown""> have entered a third day.

They encountered multiple suspects running, one of whom pulled a gun on an officer, who fired at him.â€ù

The {USA Today on Aug. 12}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/11/st-louis-teen-police-shooting/13884695/""> said the FBI had opened a civil rights investigation. The teen was shot multiple times after being confronted by an officer in Ferguson, a suburb of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black. Of the 53 police officers on the cityâ€™s payroll however, only three are black.

While Brownâ€™s shooter remains nameless (and raceless), USA Today wrote that ""Phillip Walker [a witness to the incident] said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.""

The altercation then spilled out into the street, and Brown was thereafter shot.

Groups of individuals in the largely black St. Louis suburb have been causing nightly mayhem. Over 50 individuals have been arrested thus far this week. This despite President Barack Obama issuing a call for reflection, not violence.

â€œI know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but â€_ I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,â€ù Obama said in a statement.

Flanked by the Rev. Al Sharpton, Brownâ€™s father Michael Brown Sr. even called for peace Tuesday night at a church vigil.

â€œI need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,â€ù said Brown Sr. â€œNo violence.â€ù

Says the NY Post: â€œSeveral hundred protesters appeared to heed the calls for non-violence late Tuesday, chanting â€˜Hands up, donâ€™t shootâ€™ and â€˜No justice, no peaceâ€™ during a tense but ultimately peaceful stand-off with police clad in riot gear and flanked by armored vehicles near the site of Brownâ€™s death.â€ù

Brown was described by Sharpton as a â€œgentle giant.â€ù Some media outlets are reporting that Brown had an extensive criminal record. Although he had a juvenile record, Brownâ€™s arrest record, should he have one, has not been released.

â€œTo become violent in Michael Brownâ€™s name is to betray the gentle giant that he was,â€ù Sharpton said.

Police have refused to disclose the race of the officer, despite saying they would do so on Tuesday. Citing fear of retaliation by the protestors demanding his identity be released, police withdrew the information.",NA,9,NA,"No images, just a video"Examiner,exam53,http://www.examiner.com/list/michael-brown-does-the-media-use-inflammatory-pics-to-send-a-racist-message?cid=db_articles,Michael Brown: Does the media use inflammatory pics to send a racist message?,Evelyn Bennell,8/16/14,3/10/16,"On August 9, 18-year-old black teen {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/michael-brown""> was gunned down by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri â€“ a small community with a 70 percent black populace but only a 5 percent black police force. The shooting has sparked week-long protests; peaceful demonstrations have been offset by hoodie-wearing blacks engaging in violent looting. Blacks and whites marching the streets demanding impartial justice, demanding deserved answers have been counterbalanced by handkerchief-hidden faceless shoplifters carrying stolen wares out of broken storefront windows by the armful.

These are the facts. But then there is also a subjective judgment one can be persuaded into believing. It can be accomplished with something as simple as a picture. Michael Brown, grim gangbanger? Michael Brown, ingenuous adolescent?

The verdict is in the eye that beholds, but when the eye-patched media trots out a pic of a baggy-jean wearing Brown with a red Nike wifebeater, hard-faced and chunking up a two-fingered deuce sign to his homies, well, we naturally draw another conclusion â€“ itâ€™s predisposed and bigoted, but thatâ€™s what the media wants.

The circumstances surrounding Brownâ€™s death have yet to be revealed. We may never know exactly what happened. Did Michael Brown assault the convenience store clerk and walk out with a $50 box of cigars? Did 6-year city of Ferguson cop Darren Wilson stop Brown simply because he was walking in the street, as Wilson asserts? What happened in the patrol car? Was Brown the one struggling to grab Wilsonâ€™s pistol, or was it Brownâ€™s friend, 22-year-old Dorian Johnson? Reports are that Brown had his hands up â€“ a universal sign of capitulation â€“ when he was shot multiple times. Did he?

The unanswered questions are troublesome. But even some of the facts presented are scheming and deleterious. For example, the long awaited press packet handed out by Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, which was supposed to provide details about what went down between Brown and Wilson, instead implicated Brown in a â€œstrong arm robberyâ€ù of the convenience store. And shortly thereafter, police released video of the theft. Both touched off a {fresh round of violence and looting}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/article/ferguson-police-officers-clash-with-looters-violence-after-cops-release-info"">.

The renewed violence came just a few days after Missouri police Capt. Ron Johnson, a 27-year veteran of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, was appointed by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon as chief of security operations in the riot-driven Ferguson. Johnson, who was seen {leading a crowd of peaceful protesters Thursday night}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/article/captain-ron-johnson-missouri-cop-marches-with-protestors-speaks-about-rioting?cid=db_articles"">, said a â€œnew approachâ€ù was needed to deal with the continued unrest and looting. Nixon said he was outraged over the â€œheavy-handed tacticsâ€ù of police, and turned matters over to Ferguson and his troopers.

Brownâ€™s grieving family spoke out. Through their attorney, they {released a statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s44se5"">, accusing the cops in Ferguson of â€œassassinating the characterâ€ù of Brown by releasing the robbery details and video at the same time they released the name of the white cop that shot him dead.

What is known is this â€“ Right or wrong, comparisons have been drawn between Brown and others, such as {Jordan Davis}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/15/michael-dunn-verdict_n_4796068.html""> and {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/15/trayvon-martin-protests_n_3593469.html"">.

Writes {The Associated Press}<hyperlink=""http://www.msn.com/en-us/news?gt1=51501""> via MSN News on Aug. 15: â€œAnger spurred by the death of a black teenager at the hands of a white police officer boiled over again when protesters stormed into a Missouri convenience store â€” the same one {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/michael-brown""> was accused of robbing.â€ù

The AP report says that 200 protestors took to the streets late Friday night and early this morning, enraged by the information released yesterday by Missouri Police Chief Tom Jackson. While Jackson released the identity of Michael Brownâ€™s killer â€“ a white, six-year officer named {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/darren-wilson""> â€“ Jackson also indicated that when Wilson stopped Brown for questioning, the officer had no clue about the convenience store robbery.

That admission, coupled with what Brownâ€™s family is calling a scheming and unprompted release of video that supposedly shows Brown being involved in the robbery, led to yet another night of looting, violence and more arrests.

Michael Brown, 18, was shot and killed last Saturday after a scuffle involving Brown and another man, 22-year-old Dorian Johnson, occurred inside of a Ferguson patrol car. Brown, who was reportedly unarmed, was shot after the confrontation continued outside of the police car. The shooting â€” and the initial decision by police to withhold the officer's name â€” had sparked week long protests and violent {riots}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/riots""> and looting.

Friday night, looters broke into Ferguson Market & Liquor â€“ the same store that police accuse Michael Brown of stealing a $50 box of cigars from. Police in riot gear stepped in; a skirmish line of police and squad cars was set up nearby, and rioters began to chuck rocks and other objects.

The renewed violence comes just a few days after Missouri police Capt. Ron Johnson, a 27-year veteran of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, was appointed by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon as chief of security operations in the riot-driven Ferguson. Johnson, who was {seen leading a crowd of peaceful protesters Thursday night}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/article/captain-ron-johnson-missouri-cop-marches-with-protestors-speaks-about-rioting?cid=db_articles"">, said a â€œnew approachâ€ù was needed to deal with the continued unrest and looting. Nixon said he was outraged over the â€œheavy-handed tacticsâ€ù of police, and turned matters over to Ferguson and his troopers.

The AP report cites Johnson saying he believed other stores were hit by looters, and says a â€œcrowd that had surrounded the convenience store dispersed but continued north. Two men in white undershirts threw debris through the windows of a liquor store and could be seen walking through the store as an alarm wailed.â€ù

Surveillance video released by the police at the same time they named Brownâ€™s killer was condemned by the mostly black community â€“ both for its content and the timing of the release.

â€œ[The police] have attempted to taint the investigation,â€ù U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay said via a bullhorn last night. â€œThey are trying to influence a jury pool by the stunt they pulled today.â€ù

The video shows a man matching Brownâ€™s description grabbing and shoving a store clerk back and into a display rack. Brown and another man are accused of walking out with a box of cigars.

Writes the AP:

Family attorney Daryl Parks acknowledged the man in the footage ""appears to be"" Brown. But he and others said Brown's family was blindsided by the allegations and release of the footage. They said that even if it was Brown, the crime didn't justify the shooting after Brown put up his hands in surrender, as witnesses describe.

Anthony Gray, who is representing the Brown family, released a statement that said: â€œThere is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.â€ù",NA,1,NA,"No images, just a video"Examiner,exam55,http://www.examiner.com/article/twitter-suspends-anonymous-hackers-name-wrong-cop-st-louis-pd-to-release-name?cid=db_articles,"Twitter suspends Anonymous: Hackers name wrong cop, St. Louis PD to release name",Evelyn Bennell,8/15/14,3/10/16,"The hacker group Anonymous saw their Twitter account suspended this week after the international network of hacktivists, known for their publicity stunts and cyber attacks on government, religious, and corporate websites, implicated the wrong cop in the St. Louis shooting of 18-year-old black teen {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/michael-brown"">.

Ferguson police have reversed their earlier decision to keep the cop nameless (and raceless), and said they will make the details of the killer known today. Writes {USA Today on Aug.15}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/"">: â€œThe Ferguson, Mo., police department on Friday will identify the officer who shot Michael Brown, whose death spurred violent protests and unrest in the St. Louis suburb over the past week. Ferguson, Mo., Police Chief Thomas Jackson said he would like to release the name by 9 a.m. ET Friday.â€ù

Details as to Brownâ€™s death are yet unclear. Brown was with another man, identified as 22-year-old Dorian Johnson, who {spoke about watching Brown getting shot}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri"">. A scuffle occurred inside of the police patrol car last weekend; an officer was reportedly shoved into the car and a struggle for the officerâ€™s sidearm ensued. One round was fired in the car. The altercation then spilled out into the street, and Brown was thereafter shot.

The incident has touched off a week of violent protests and riots.

The president said that the {police}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/police""> shooting death of the unarmed Missouri teen was heartbreaking. Additionally, Obama has urged the many persons who are upset with the police incident to stay calm. Following the incident which occurred on Saturday, citizens have taken to rioting and looting along with their protests.

Michael Brown was an African American who was shot a number of times on Saturday in Ferguson by a police officer even though he was unarmed. He died from the gunshots. Since Saturdayâ€™s occurrence, many of the citizens of the community have been engaged in a tense standoff with the police. Looting, in particular, was rampant in the aftermath of the deadly event.

Obama said that the death of Brown is heartbreaking and that he and the First Lady send their deepest condolences to the deceased young manâ€™s family and his community at this very difficult time. The president continued by saying that he knows the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, he urges everyone in Ferguson and across the country to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. He said that we should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals â€“ not in a way that wounds. â€œAlong with our prayers, thatâ€™s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve,â€ù he said.

Part of the discontent with the community and supporters of Brown is that they doubt the sincerity of a promised FBI investigation into the shooting. Therefore, the president emphasized that Eric Holder, the nationâ€™s Attorney General, and the Department of Justice will be investigating the shooting alongside local police authorities in St. Louis County. According to {KMOV-TV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/President-Obama-releases-statement-on-death-of-Michael-Brown-270966801.html""> in St. Louis, the St. Louis County NAACP has already begun its own investigation as well.

Since there have been death threats made against the officer involved in the shooting, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson is not identifying the officer to the general public due to safety concerns. Brownâ€™s father wants the officerâ€™s name released. The father said, â€œThis personâ€™s got to pay for this.â€ù The father has received support for his plea from the likes of the Rev. Al Sharpton and Benjamin Crump, the Brown familyâ€™s attorney.

Separate protests â€” planned against {Israel}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/israel"">'s occupation of Gaza and the militarized police response to the uprising in Ferguson â€” converged into a single demonstration outside the Statehouse in Columbus.

Several hundred demonstrators from Dayton, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus gathered to highlight parallels between Ferguson, a two-thirds African American Missouri suburb policed by a nearly all-white police force, and the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories. ""We're here not just for Palestine,"" said organizer Bilal El-Yousseph. ""We're here for Ferguson.

""The same tear gas they're using on protesters in Missouri is being used in Gaza,"" El-Yousseph said. He led the crowd in a chant: ""Occupation is a crime, from Ferguson to Palestine!""

""The current war on Gaza is completely unjustified, disproportionate, and a violation of international law,"" said Connie Hammond of the Progressive Peace Coalition in Columbus. ""We are outraged at the blatant violation of human rights that are perpetrated by Israel on a regular basis, including the confiscation of land in the occupied territories, house demolitions, and detention and abuse of Palestinian children. We ask that the international community demand that Israel complies with all international laws and come into compliance with international humanitarian standards.""

""There's unity in the struggle,"" said Tammy Alsaada of Columbus.""It's not about religion, it's not about where you stand politically. It's about humanity. We are all human beings and deserve the right to freedom and justice.""

""The U.S. government sends $3.1 billion annually to the Israeli government,"" said Sami Idries, president of the Committee for Justice in Palestine at the Ohio State University. ""This is a significant amount of our tax money that is being used to fund heinous crimes committed by the Israeli military. As American citizens, we are obligated to condemn these horrifying acts and demand that our government, as well as Israel's, are held accountable.""

OSU professor Pranav Jani spoke about Steven Salaita, who has {received widespread support}<hyperlink=""http://socialistworker.org/2014/08/19/support-floods-in-for-steven-salaita""> since being fired from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for posting pro-Palestinian comments on Twitter. ""Where is academic freedom?"" Jani asked. ""Where is free speech? What country are we living in? Aren't we supposed to have the right to talk about basic issues, even if they're controversial?""

""The Israeli assault on Gaza is a reminder of the everyday terror that Palestinians live under,"" said Ben Stockwell of the Cincinnati International Socialist Organization. ""When they aren't fleeing from bombs, they are living without adequate water, food, shelter, medical care and basic human rights. To be silent in the face of such atrocities is to be on the wrong side of history and humanity.""

Even though Smith's statements are, somewhat, expected from a man that craves attention to the extremes that he does, it's still frightening to know that not even something as volatile and scary as the situation in Ferguson is out-of-play for him. And while it seems unfathomable to think that Smith could do something even more outlandish than use the Missouri protests to promote his own show, I guess we will all just have to tune into MadDog Radio on Sirius XM on Sept. 2 to find out what he does next.",NA,1,NA,NAExaminer,exam59,http://www.examiner.com/article/constitutional-rights-trampled-by-police-state-ferguson,Constitutional rights trampled by police state in Ferguson,Ben Marquis,8/19/14,3/15/16,"Allow me to preface this by saying that I am well aware that not everyone in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/ferguson""> is an innocent protestor. Likewise, not everyone is a criminal looter causing destruction. There are outside influences at work within the city, and both good people and bad people working towards opposite goals.

I am all in favor of law enforcement catching and punishing the opportunistic and criminal element that is wreaking havoc. But I maintain that such a goal can be accomplished without a violent crackdown on the majority of good people who are simply exercising their rights.

All human beings are born with natural and inherent rights, most basically the rights to enjoy and defend oneâ€™s life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. All of oneâ€™s rights, whether enumerated or not, fall under these categories.

The Founders of our nation recognized these pre-existing rights as they crafted our government, and determined that the government shall never be able to infringe upon them. They set down and codified many of these rights as the first ten amendments to our {Constitution}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/constitution"">, known collectively as the {Bill of Rights}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/bill-of-rights"">.

Unfortunately, due to the events that are taking place in Ferguson, Missouri, namely protests, riots, and looting, followed by a heavy-handed response by militarized law enforcement, those Constitutionally protected rights have been trampled under the boots and tires of armed and armored policemen and their vehicles.

The First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees that the government cannot abridge the freedom of speech, or of the press, or of the right of the people to peaceably assemble, or to seek a redress of grievances from their government. The right to travel freely has also been construed as protected by this amendment as well.

The militarized police force of Ferguson, and all of the many various other jurisdictions and municipalities that have sent forces to assist the Ferguson PD, have indeed abridged all of those rights. In forcing crowds of protestors to disperse, using violent means like rubber bullets and tear gas, as well as brute force, their freedom of speech is being curtailed, as is their right of assembly. The new tactic of forcing protestors to continuously march, without allowing them to rest or congregate also violates their assembly right.

The press has been particularly put upon as well, and almost treated as the enemy, forced into â€œFirst Amendment Zonesâ€ù or â€œDesignated Media Areasâ€ù. They have been compelled by threats of force to stop recording police actions or arrests, which is illegal, and they have been deliberately fired upon with rubber bullets and tear gas. Some have been harassed and even arrested.

People are no longer allowed to travel freely about the town of Ferguson, as the police continue to set up roadblocks in various locations, preventing entry or exit of certain areas, and requiring â€œcredentialsâ€ù for some people to enter some areas that should normally be open to all.

The Fourth Amendment guarantees people the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. But reports from Ferguson show that some people have been snatched out of the crowd by the police, although they did nothing wrong. Others have been detained and searched for little or no reason. Of course, all of this is done without a warrant, or even probable cause in some cases.

There have also been multiple reports, although difficult to verify, that Monday nightâ€™s shooting incident led to several SWAT teams moving through the immediate neighborhoods, looking for the shooter, searching through the peopleâ€™s yards and homes, ala the Boston Marathon bombing aftermath, again, obviously without a warrant.

The Fifth Amendment has been violated as some people have been deprived of their life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. The aforementioned detainment of individual protestors or journalists would fall under this category.

The Eight Amendment prohibits the government from using cruel or unusual punishments on the people. I would submit that rubber bullets, which are exceptionally painful and can cause serious injury, internal damage, and even death at close range, are cruel, as is tear gas, which is a chemical weapon. The Long Range Acoustical Device, LRAD, is a sound cannon that produces sounds near 150 decibels, designed to deter and disperse the crowds of people, that should also be classified as cruel and unusual, given that permanent hearing loss can occur at decibels higher than 130.

Any other natural rights not specifically listed in the Bill of Rights are covered by the Ninth Amendment, and although some such rights are often debatable, the oppressive nature of the police actions have no doubt contributed to some unspecified rights being denied or disparaged by the government forces.

The Department of Justice is sending â€œadvisorsâ€ù to Ferguson, and Attorney General Eric Holder is inserting himself into the situation. Should the DOJ, or DHS, assert control over the situation, that will be a blatant violation of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves rights to the states that arenâ€™t specifically delegated to the government, such as dealing with local matters. Thus far, the events in Ferguson are a decidedly local matter, best handled by the local authorities, with help from the state. Of course, should the state request it, federal assistance should be granted, but by no means should the feds be allowed to take control.

Many people are fearful that the {Martial Law}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/martial-law""> that has descended upon Ferguson will ultimately present a threat to their Second Amendment protected right to keep and bear arms. We have already heard reports of some people taking shots at the police, which is likely to incite them into opening fire on an almost entirely unarmed crowd. The big worry is, following such an escalation of the event, efforts will be undertaken to begin disarming people and confiscating firearms in certain areas, and eventually the entire town, in order to guarantee the â€œsafetyâ€ù of the people and officers, of course. We saw this exact same thing happen in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

Furthermore, recent comments on the situation by President Obama, where he equated carrying guns with looting and attacking police, and who is known for having a decidedly anti-gun agenda, contributes to this worry.

As of yet, the Third Amendment hasnâ€™t been violated, that we know of. But would anyone really be all that surprised if militarized police officers began forcing their way into homes and using them as temporary â€œquartersâ€ù, seeking respite from the protestors and riots, or to achieve some sort of a tactical advantage? We have seen SWAT teams do such things in other cities around the country in a handful of instances.

With a heavily armed and armored police force, now backed up by National Guard personnel, there is little use denying that Martial Law has effectively been implemented in Ferguson. We now have the domestic â€œstanding armyâ€ù that the Founders worried so much about.

The Governor has declared an official State of Emergency for the town and surrounding area. The government works under the false assumption that a declaration of a state of emergency trumps Constitutional rights, but that just isnâ€™t so, regardless of what any court may have said. Our rights are natural and inherent, and pre-existed the government.

As such, our rights are not privileges that can be granted or taken away at a whim. They are retained completely by the people at all times, in all situations, no matter what. Donâ€™t allow anyone to trick you into believing that your rights have been suspended, just because some government official or their enforcers deem it so.",NA,6,NA,NAExaminer,exam60,http://www.examiner.com/article/new-head-of-security-demonstrators-march-together-towards-peace-ferguson,"New head of security, demonstrators, march together towards peace in Ferguson",Steven Neville ,8/14/14,3/15/16,"When Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol took over security detail of the Ferguson, Missouri, demonstrations today, Thursday, Aug. 14, {he promised things would be different under his command}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/meet-the-missouri-highway-state-patrol-captain-who-is-taking-over-in-ferguson/"">.

â€œWe are going to have a different approach and have the approach that weâ€™re in this together,â€ù Johnson told the press. â€œI understand the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling, and our officers will respect both of those.â€ù

But no one probably expected {that video would surface}<hyperlink=""https://www.instagram.com/p/rsk0_jkQdU/"">, just hours into his duty, of Johnson and a protester embracing while the two marched together down the streets of the captain's hometown.

Many of the media, and those on social media, became worried that situation would not get better any time soon.

Or worse, escalate.

Fortunately, the addition of Johnson to head of security, and his calm and cool approach to dealing with the demonstrators has appeared to have shifted the tide of the protests {towards the better}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%20ron%20johnson&src=typd"">.

This sentiment emphasized by a photo of {Johnson leading protesters marching down a street in Ferguson that went viral and statement on Twitter from Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://twitpic.com/ea4js9""> Alderman, Antonio French; a man who has been on the front lines of the protests since they began.

""Leadership matters,"" tweeted French. ""Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson's impact already being felt.""

While most people have found the police's new approach to watching over the protests a blessing, some are still worried as to how the captain will react when faced with his first situation of adversity or violence from the crowd. But, for now, most agree that this new, albeit possibly temporary, peace between the police and demonstrators is a welcome breath of relief and hope that peace in the streets can come.

While no one knows for sure whether or not this peaceful understanding between police and protesters will continue into the night and early morning hours, Johnson has assured protesters that there will be no more curfew; their officers will not be wearing gas masks, and the protesters are free to stay as long as they like.

What Mitchell apparently failed to understand is that Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly was also detained at about the same time. Reilly is white. Both reporters say officers approached them while they were in a McDonaldâ€™s restaurant. Both claimed they were roughed up, thrown in the back of a van and taken to a station, where they were later detained. They were later released with no charges and no explanation. Mitchell, however, chose to focus on the skin color of only one reporter.

Becket Adams {called}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/this-tweet-from-one-of-nbcs-top-news-personalities-is-outrageously-irresponsible/article/2552015""> Mitchell's tweet ""outrageously irresponsible,"" and later referred to it as ""trash."" While the encounter with authorities may raise questions, Mitchell's tweet made the situation worse by suggesting race played a role, Adams said.

""Itâ€™s the sort of garbage youâ€™d expect from one of her lesser colleagues, from one of MSNBC's late night carnival barkers,"" Adams wrote. ""Itâ€™s not the sort of thing that youâ€™d expect from NBC Newsâ€™ chief foreign affairs correspondent.""

Adams, however, might have been a bit too generous. Mitchell, as we have previously reported, is not above tossing the race card with no evidence or engaging in biased reporting. While reporting on the Iowa caucus in January 2012, for example, she claimed the state doesn't represent the rest of the country because it's {too white, too evangelical, too rural}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/article/nbc-news-andrea-mitchell-iowa-too-white-too-evangelical-too-rural"">.""

It turns out Romney was comparing the government to the private sector, observing how difficult it was for a optometrist to change his address through the post office versus ordering a hoagie at Wawa.

James Wright, founding member of the group, expounds on the group's new single ""Love"" in an interview Monday, Aug. 18.

Typically love is most often thought of as the romantic type of love known as Eros. The euphoria of butterflies in the pit of the stomach, the feeling of walking on ""cloud 9"", and that person always being top of mind are just some of the traits. Spiritual love or selfless love that is true or authentic, also known as Agape, is used interchangeably with the creator, God.

James Wright reflects on the violence that has happened recently in Ferguson, MO., and the many other accounts that have taken place throughout world. The outcry against police brutality and the destruction within the inner-cities have reached an all time high. What the world is crying out for is love. Love that is displayed in the choice for God to send His son, Christ Jesus,to die for the sins of the world (John 3:16). What type of love could this possibly be? It's only the love of God. ""Judgement and holding people, telling them they're going to hell because they've done wrong. That's not all that's in the Bible,"" expresses James.

""[Love] is a song that everybody's gonna be able to sing. Whether you're saved or not. And it's not where we've sugar coated our message. We actually didn't. We talk about God. We didn't take that out at all,"" James clarifies. In the Bible, God proclaimed through Jeremiah that the remnant of Israel would have rest and restoration, ""...saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee."" (Jeremiah 31:3 KJV)

Sensere's new single, ""Love"", from their forthcoming sophomore project, ""Soul of Future Worship Vol. 2"", due out the first quarter of 2015, is apart of a catalog of songs that tackle everyday issues of life. There have been leaks of a couple of the other songs from the project titled ""Not Hopeless"" and ""Hard Times"".

Much of the gear - ranging from battlefield-grade rifles to armored personnel vehicles - has been passed along to local police departments across the country through the {Department of Defense Excess Property Program}<hyperlink=""http://www.minnesotanationalguard.org/counterdrug/equipment/1033/assets/LEA%20MOA.pdf"">. That program transfers excess military property to local law enforcement agencies, often at little or no cost.

In Minnesota, the program is administered by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety's {Homeland Security and Emergency Management}<hyperlink=""https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/hsem/homeland-security/Pages/mn-leso.aspx""> (HSEM) office. According to its web site, Minnesota's Law Enforcement Support Office (LISO) has provided more than $25 million worth of equipment since the program began in 1993. Minnesota law enforcement agencies (LEOs) receiving equipment have included the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), the Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) Enforcement Division, along with 85 county sheriff's offices and approximately 325 local police agencies.

The video included in this story comes from LISO and it awkwardly describes the type of equipment available through the program. While some of the equipment is mundane, agencies can also apply for Humvees, personnel carriers shielded to resist bombs, various types of boats as well as drones and helicopters. Weapons such as M-14 and M-16 rifles are available at a discount.

It's not clear how much of this equipment has been ordered in the past few years. The video quotes an HSEM official as stating in June 2012 that $1,000,000 worth of equipment had been delivered in the previous six months, with another $500,000 having been ordered but not yet delivered.

Local law enforcement agencies are also able to buy equipment directly using grants provided through federal block grants. Not surprisingly, when a police department has the ability to acquire sophisticated high-tech equipment for little or no cost, they're going to take advantage of the opportunity. In 2011, the Center For Investigative Reporting estimated that {more than $34 billion worth of federal block grants}<hyperlink=""http://cironline.org/reports/local-police-stockpile-high-tech-combat-ready-gear-2913""> had been provided since 2001.

It's difficult to estimate exactly how much equipment has been provided to Minnesota LEOs through either program. I contacted more than a dozen agencies on Wednesday and none was willing to discuss program specifics. The tracking is especially challenging with the block grant program, which even the federal government admits has only loose record keeping.

But it doesn't take long to search local Minnesota media outlets before you find plenty of examples of law enforcement agencies touting their latest acquisition to the press. In November 2011, Washington County Sheriff Bill Hutton proudly showed off a new 9-ton, $237,000 bullet-resistant Bearcat armored vehicle that was bought with a grant from the federal government. {The Star-Tribune article}<hyperlink=""http://www.startribune.com/local/east/133572598.html""> noted that the agency was also receiving a $226,000 mobile command post and a $70,000 robot.

The BearCat is manufactured by {Lenco Armored Vehicles}<hyperlink=""http://www.lencoarmor.com/"">, which suggests the vehicle ""may be used as a S.W.A.T. or Military Counter Attack and Rescue Vehicle and is often used in hostile Urban Environments or as a Patrol/Reaction Vehicle on a Military Base.""

There are at least seven BearCats in use in Minnesota, although it's unlikely any of the areas could be described as a potential ""hostile urban environment."" In July, 2013, the Minnesota Valley Regional Tactical Response Team acquired its Bearcat, Dakota County acquired one in 2008 and the {Roseville Police Department got its Bearcat}<hyperlink=""http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/02/09/roseville-polices-new-256k-law-enforcement-machine/""> in 2012.

Law enforcement officials and the equipment manufacturers defend the increase of military-grade equipment at the local level, citing an increase in societal violence and the possibility of a terrorist attack. Defense manufacturer {Oshkosh Defense sells a ""tactical protector vehicle""}<hyperlink=""http://www.oshkosh-tacticalprotector.com/""> to law enforcement agencies, which can be purchased with a federal block grant. On its web site, Oshkosh suggests the vehicle helps police address a more dangerous world:

""As criminal organizations are increasingly armed with military-style weapons, law enforcement operations require the same level of field-tested and combat-proven protection used by soldiers and Marines in Iraq, Afghanistan and other high-risk locations.""

But critics of the militarization of local law enforcement cite is as a factor in building additional walls between police and the people they are hired to protect. They note that local agencies don't have the training to use sophisticated equipment properly. They also argue that the more military-style equipment an agency owns, the more likely it is to be used, often inappropriately.

Norm Stamper was the police chief of Seattle in 1999 and he supervised an infamous crackdown on protesters during a World Trade Organization meeting. {He told The Nation that he}<hyperlink=""http://www.thenation.com/article/paramilitary-policing-seattle-occupy-wall-street/""> now regrets the military-like response from his department:

""My support for a militaristic solution caused all hell to break loose. Rocks, bottles and newspaper racks went flying. Windows were smashed, stores were looted, fires lighted; and more gas filled the streets, with some cops clearly overreacting, escalating and prolonging the conflict.

Though published twenty years ago, the book and the new film adaptation are still relevant to audiences today.

{â€œThe Giverâ€ù}<hyperlink=""https://thegiverfilm.com/""> follows Jonas (Brenton Thwaites), who is aged up a few years in the movie, as he is trained to become the new â€œreceiver of memoryâ€ù with a man known as the Giver (Jeff Bridges). The story takes place in a seemingly utopian community, but as Jonas learns more about the truth of his world, he discovers that while his society may be spared pain and loss, it is also lacking emotion, color, and meaning.

In a world rife with agony, itâ€™s easy to see the appeal of a community built on â€œsamenessâ€ù â€“ where everyone is peaceful, happy, and equal. But this sort of idyllic life comes with a price â€“ one which Jonas determines is not worth paying.

Take, for instance, the lack of choice. As Meryl Streep so ominously states in the trailer for â€œThe Giver,â€ù â€œWhen people are given the freedom to choose, they choose wrong.â€ù

Donâ€™t many of us feel this way about people who choose differently than us? Just look at how heated political debates have gotten between Democrats and Republicans these days. Each side is certain they are â€œrightâ€ù and the other is â€œwrong.â€ù Wouldnâ€™t it be so much easier if the choice was already made for us?

And yet, think of what freedoms weâ€™d be sacrificing for the sake of eliminating these disagreements. â€œThe Giverâ€ù reminds us to recognize and celebrate our differences â€“ even if it leads to discourse and disagreements. In â€œThe Giver,â€ù society ignores any differences and seeks to promote â€œsamenessâ€ù â€“ but at the cost of their own betterment.

Likewise, {â€œThe Giverâ€ù is a celebration of memory}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/article/the-giver-serves-as-a-reminder-about-the-importance-of-memory"">. As school children, we are told that it is important to learn our history so as not to repeat it. And in â€œThe Giver,â€ù that is ultimately the role of Bridgesâ€™ character. As the â€œreceiver of memory,â€ù he is the lone person who can advise on whether a decision is good or bad based on his memories of the past.

Beyond societal impact, think of who we would be without our memories. As individuals, we are shaped by our past and by our memories. The society of â€œThe Giverâ€ù erases memories to eliminate pain â€“ but in doing so, they have eliminated true joy and happiness, as well. They have eliminated the capacity to love, truly and completely.

In a world filled with pain, itâ€™s important to consider the lessons of â€œThe Giver.â€ù Itâ€™s easy to look at the news and see violence and loss: the death of Robin Williams; the protests in Ferguson, Missouri; on-going violent conflict in the Middle East. Have we forgotten what books like ""The Giver"" taught us?

We live in a world today filled with anger and hurt and violence. Perhaps reflecting on â€œThe Giverâ€ù can give us all pause to consider what really matters, and refocus our energy on creating a better world that embraces love and learns from pain and loss.

The political situation which was merely untenable when he left, has become positively apocalyptic. Experts from every position on the political prism agree the leader of the free world really ought to be in the {White House}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/white-house""> during this tumultuous times. Truth is, though, the Obamas were just having an awful time.

The whole trip started poorly, and just got worse from there. The first family spent the first part of their vacation sitting on the South Lawn, for two excruciating hours, while the Marine One flight crew struggled to locate certain essentials:

We understand everyone was anxious to get going, but the President of these United States simply does not travel without a full compliment of lemon-soaked paper napkins.

-Rob Nabors, White House Deputy Chief of Staff

The problems didn't end upon take off, in fact they were just beginning. Five minutes into the flight, Cass Sunstein, the Director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, emerged blithely from the the aircraft lavatory. Sunstein, regularly called upon to care for Bo and Sunny, the Obama's Portuguese Water Dogs, while the family takes vacation, was not aware the animals were not invited on this particular trip, and, thus, neither was he. The following hour was described as a feverish, as the Obamas searched desperately for a DC-area neighbor they could trust, who had not already flown back to their own home state.

Matters, as well as tensions between Sunstein and the family, worsened considerably upon arrival on Martha's Vineyard. Significant portions of the First Luggage apparently had not made it onto the aircraft, and the car reserved to transport the group to their hotel was too small by half. Transportation Secretary, Anthony Foxx, was blamed for the mishap and left to fend for himself.

""Despite the sobriquet, the role of the Transportation Secretary does not involve securing shuttle service from the airport. I had nothing to do with this."" said a frustrated Foxx, stranded alone at the terminal taxi stand.

Meanwhile, international events had reached a boiling point. Hamas, to the surprise of no one broke the most recent ceasefire. Ebola continued its steady dissemination throughout the globe. The Russians again invaded Ukraine with trucks of weapons-grade humanitarian aid. ISIS besieged an entire race of helpless civilians in one of Iraq's more forbidding mountain ranges. And a riot broke out in Missouri after another kid got shot.

The President, according to {Valerie Jarrett}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/valerie-jarrett"">'s {twitter account}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/disney4grownups"">, had all these matters well in hand. The Obama's despite significant setbacks, were then just settling down to enjoy a much needed respite, when they realized the rooms next to theirs were occupied by a delegation from the New England Sewing Machine Collectors' Society.

Now I'm prepared, in my line of work, to put up with a lot of hooey. But a hundred octogenarians, clacking away on about a thousand sewing machines, essentially in my bedroom? No freaking way!

Missouri Police Chief Tom Jackson has just named the shooter of 18-year-old Michael Brown. His killer is {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/darren-wilson"">, a 6-year veteran officer. Jackson made his announcement earlier today in front of a convenience mart that was burned down by protestors. Wilson, who has been on administrative leave since the {shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/topic/shooting"">, has no history of disciplinary action on his record.

Jackson, who struggled at times to keep his composure, did not name Wilsonâ€™s race, despite shouts for more information.

Michael Brown, 18, was shot and killed last Saturday after a scuffle involving Brown and another man, 22-year-old Dorian Johnson, occurred inside of a Ferguson patrol car. Brown, who was reportedly unarmed, was shot after the confrontation continued outside of the police car. The shooting â€” and the decision by police to withhold the officer's name â€” has sparked week long protests and violent riots and looting.

The {USA Today on Aug. 12}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/11/st-louis-teen-police-shooting/13884695/""> reported that a witness said Brownâ€™s killer was white:

Phillip Walker [a witness to the incident] said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street,

Ferguson's police force has 53 officers; three are black.

â€œWe need to get justice in this case,â€ù Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said before police released the name. â€œItâ€™s good news that after a great deal of prodding theyâ€™re going to release the name of this officer.â€ù

Nixon stepped in to oversee the state of affairs in Ferguson after uprisings, which started last Sunday night, led to several evenings of protestors clashing with police. By Thursday, a relative calm was restored to the streets of Ferguson, a community of 21,000 with a 70 percent black population.

â€œWe saw an acceleration in the tone and the armor and knew it was time to make a change,â€ù Nixon said. â€œFolks felt like they were under siege. When police forces work best, theyâ€™re part of the community, not a separate force to control that community.â€ù

Writes the {NY Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/us/darren-wilson-identified-as-officer-in-fatal-shooting-in-ferguson-missouri.html?_r=1""> today:

Chief Jackson said Mr. Wilson had been alerted to a robbery at a convenience store shortly before the encounter with the teenager, Michael Brown, 18, who was walking home from a store on Saturday when he was shot.

Itâ€™s unclear if Brown had anything to do with the robbery, or if police had stopped him because he matched a description of the potential suspect.

The hacker group Anonymous saw their Twitter account suspended this week after the international network of hacktivists, known for their publicity stunts and cyber attacks on government, religious, and corporate websites, implicated the wrong cop in the St. Louis shooting of Michael Brown.

The group has since claimed that their {action to release the incorrect name was what prompted St. Louis police}<hyperlink=""http://www.examiner.com/article/twitter-suspends-anonymous-hackers-name-wrong-cop-st-louis-pd-to-release-name""> to finally reveal the shooter's identify today.

The shooting touched off a week of violent protests and riots.

Multiple {YouTube videos captured mostly black males}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=st+louis+riots"">, many of whom had handkerchiefs or other articles of clothing covering their faces, smashing and grabbing items from destroyed storefronts. Police were forced to use tear gas rounds in order to quell the crowd.

Groups of individuals in the largely black St. Louis suburb have been causing nightly mayhem. Over 50 individuals were arrested this week. President Barack Obama issued a call for reflection, not violence.

â€œI know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but â€_ I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,â€ù Obama said in a statement earlier in the week.

Flanked by the Rev. Al Sharpton, Brownâ€™s father Michael Brown Sr. even called for peace Tuesday night at a church vigil.

â€œI need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,â€ù said Brown Sr. â€œNo violence.â€ù
