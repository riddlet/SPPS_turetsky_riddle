Shinkman ,08/14/2014,02/09/2016,"An image of a camouflaged man in Ferguson, Missouri, training a sniper rifle on a group of protesters with their hands up has forced Americans to ask themselves what kind of protection they’re willing to tolerate. The growing militarization of domestic police forces has been a concern at home for years, but has risen to the forefront of national debate this week as shocking footage emerges from Ferguson. The St. Louis suburb remains the site of clashes and heated racial tensions between protesters, angered by the shooting death of unarmed teen over the weekend, and the police forces they believe have a history of abusive practices.

At the root of the problem is a country coming home from war, forced over a decade to design and deploy a literal army of 21st-century weapons to fight insurgent masses during protracted Middle East wars. A program that first took off in the early 1990s allows the Department of Defense, yet again downsizing, to reissue billions of dollars of this equipment to domestic security forces, particularly SWAT and other elite units that have traditionally needed tactical gear for high-risk jobs.

“Have no doubt, police in the United States are militarizing, and in many communities, particularly those of color, the message is being received loud and clear: ‘You are the enemy,’” writes Tom Nolan, a 27-year veteran of the Boston Police Department and professor at SUNY Plattsburgh, in an op-ed that appeared in {Defense One}<hyperlink=”http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2014/06/stop-arming-police-military/87163/?oref=defenseone_today_n”l> in June, more than a month before the Ferguson riots.

Police forces are increasingly turning away from developing trust – which he considers the key tool for beat cops to fight crime – and opting instead for arsenals of assault rifles, concussion grenades and the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, or MRAPs, that have become ubiquitous to the U.S. military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“Many communities now look upon police as an occupying army, their streets more reminiscent of Baghdad or Kabul than a city in America,” Nolan continued. “This besieged mentality created by the militarization of police has driven a pernicious wedge into the significant gains made under community- and problem-oriented policing initiatives dating from the late 1980s.”

The {1033 Program}<hyperlink=”http://dps.mo.gov/dir/programs/cjle/dod.asp”>, named for a section of the National Defense Authorization Act, has provided congressional approval for upward of $4.3 billion in military equipment to flow to police forces throughout the country, according to an analysis from {Newsweek}<hyperlink=”http://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537”>. The program was originally designed to help outgunned law enforcement officers fight the drug trade, and quickly gained popularity among police chiefs for the high fire power and low costs. Some police forces in communities such as Watertown, Connecticut, have purchased MRAPS, originally priced over $700,000 each, for as little as $2,800, according to the magazine.

The evolution of this program has prompted some in Congress to call for its repeal. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., distributed a letter to his congressional colleagues Thursday saying he plans to introduce the “Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act,” which would further monitor, limit or eliminate such sales.

“Americans should therefore be concerned, unless they want their main streets patrolled in ways that mirror a war zone,” he wrote with Michael Shank in an op-ed {in USA Today}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/03/10/america-police-military-weapons-column/5789445/”>. “We recognized that we're not in Kansas anymore, but are MRAPs really needed in small-town America? Are improvised explosive devices, grenade attacks, mines, shelling and other war-typical attacks really happening in Roanoke Rapids, a town of 16,000 people? No.”

Johnson’s legislation would add layers of accountability over these sales and outright ban the sales of MRAPs, armored personnel carriers, drones and other aircraft, and assault weapons, according to the letter.

“Militarizing America's main streets won't make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent,” he wrote.

A {New York Times feature}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=2”> published in June documents the stockpiling of advanced military weapons by police across the country. More than 500 military grade aircraft are now owned and operated, along with 432 MRAPs, 44,900 night vision devices and 93,763 assault weapons. The number of SWAT forces themselves has also skyrocketed during this time.

Despite public criticism, spurred on by police action in Ferguson, the Pentagon stands by the arms sales and says it serves a purpose. 

“This is a useful program that allows for the reuse of military equipment that would otherwise be disposed of, that could be used by law enforcement agencies to serve their citizens,” said Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby. 

“That said, it is up to law enforcement agencies to speak to how and what they gain through this system,” he said, adding,“I’m not going to inject the Pentagon into that discussion.”

The military surplus the Department of Defense sells includes gear, arms, ammunition and vehicles, Kirby said. He declined to comment on the congressional criticism over the program.

The citizens of Ferguson had a problem with ""Driving (or Walking) While Black"" long before the killing of an unarmed black teenager by police officers catapulted its racial tensions to the national stage. 

Michael Brown's killing at the hands of a still unnamed police officer wasn't the only potential civil rights violation of the mostly while police force against the mostly black town population, data show. 

The Missouri Attorney General's Office has compiled statistics for police forces and racial profiling since 2000 and Ferguson has consistently scored poorly. With no solution, the potential for problems has only escalated in the past decade as the town has become more black. The now majority black town only has a handful of black officers on the police force, furthering tensions.

According to the attorney general's numbers, blacks are stopped by police way more often than their fellow white citizens. 

These numbers become even more staggering after controlling for population. While whites and Hispanics are stopped less than we would expect given their share of the population, blacks are stopped by police far more. 

And the numbers aren't just unequal for police stops. Blacks are also searched and arrested more often after being stopped than their white counterparts, even though the data show whites are more likely to be caught with contraband if searched. This is likely because police have a higher threshold for stopping whites. So, while a black citizen can be stopped for ""Driving While Black,"" a white person is stopped for actual suspicious activity. Thus, a white stop and the resulting search is more likely to turn up contraband.

Given the changing town makeup and the attorney general's attention to racial profiling, one would think lowering rates of racial profiling would be a priority for the Ferguson Police Department. The data show otherwise. While the general trend (indicated by the dotted line) is downward, rates for searches, arrests and disparities in stops are still disproportionately racially biased in Ferguson, and haven't seen much improvement in the last decade.

In the early morning hours on Monday, the Ferguson-Florissant School District announced schools would remain closed due to safety concerns. The district had previously said school would begin Monday, after originally pushing back the start of school from August 14. 

""Due to continuing unrest in some areas of Ferguson, and in the interest of the safety of students and families, all schools in the Ferguson-Florissant School District will be closed Monday, August 18,"" the district said in an announcement on its website. ""While our teachers, principals and administration are eager to welcome our students back to school and to begin the 2014-2015 school year, the safety of students is our primary concern.""

expressing their {disappointment}<hyperlink=”https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152639729679931”>. Many worried delaying the start of school would not only harm students academically, but that it would also cause a struggle for the nearly two-thirds of students in the district who are enrolled in free and reduced price lunch programs. Others thanked the district for keeping safety in mind, while some offered educational alternatives while children remain out of school.

Overall, the school district enrolls just more than 12,000 students in its 23 public schools. Of those students, 7,994 were enrolled in free or reduced price lunch programs during the 2011-12 school year, according to federal data. That's much higher than the number of students enrolled in such programs throughout St. Louis County, and across the state of Missouri.

By comparison, 42,586 students in St. Louis County participated in free and reduced price lunch programs during the 2011-12 school year – about 29.5 percent of the entire county's student population. In Missouri as a whole, nearly 412,000 students participated in the programs in 2011-12. The percent of students statewide in those programs has hovered between 43 and 45 percent for the last three years.

Noticing that the longer summer break could leave many families struggling, public school teacher Julianna Mendelsohn teamed up with the St. Louis Area Foodbank to solicit donations to provide meals for children in Ferguson. As of Monday afternoon, more than 2,200 individuals have donated $60,534.

""When I found out school had been canceled for several days as a result of the civil unrest, I immediately became worried for the students in households with food instability,"" Mendelsohn wrote on the {funding page}<hyperlink=”https://fundly.com/feed-the-students-of-ferguson”>. ""Many children in the U.S. eat their only meals of the day, breakfast and lunch, at school. With school out, kids are undoubtedly going hungry.""

While research has shown that attendance matters for student achievement, and that additional instruction time can benefit students, there are conflicting opinions on how school-wide closures or delays tie in. One study from Harvard University showed that school closures – due to inclement weather or other reasons – do not harm student achievement because the time can be made up. Individual student absences, on the other hand, were shown to be negative because teachers have to dedicate more time to helping a few students catch up. 

""They need to consider the downside when deciding not to declare a snow day during a storm – the fact that many kids will miss school regardless either because of transportation issues or parental discretion,"" said Joshua Goodman, an assistant professor at Harvard, in a statement. ""And because those absences typically aren't made up in the school calendar, those kids can fall behind."" 

However, Goodman tells U.S. News the situation may be different in Ferguson due to the emotionally challenging nature of the protests. 

""[Weather-related closures] are pretty easy to deal with because all you have to do when a school closes is push your lesson plans back by a day,"" Goodman says. ""It would be hard for me to imagine [the circumstances in Ferguson] would not affect students and interfere with the usual educational process."" 

""That's not to say the schools delaying their openings is a bad idea,"" he adds. ""It may be that given the circumstances, that's the best way to get kids calm and give people extra time to prepare. I can't imagine lives are not being seriously disrupted by this.""

In an August 11 letter to families in the school district, acting Superintendent Lawrence Larrew said the outbursts of violence throughout the St. Louis suburb were ""heartbreaking."" 

""The tragic events of recent days in the city of Ferguson and the surrounding areas are a concern to us as we are sure they are to all of you,"" Larrew said. ""We believe as educators that restoring normalcy and welcoming our students back to school is one of the most effective things that we can do to advance the healing and rebuilding process.""",NA,NA,early two-thirds of students in the Ferguson school district participate in free or reduced meal plans.,"hyperlink→tweet, and Microsoft Word"
USNews,usn4,http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/08/14/cruz-paul-warren-weigh-in-on-ferguson,Potential Presidential Candidates Find Common Ground on Ferguson,David Catanese ,08/14/2014,02/17/2016,"Amid the ongoing unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, there's been an early sign of political consensus between major leaders in both parties on the tactics being employed by law enforcement.

The political community had been markedly quiet in the aftermath of the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer after an altercation over the weekend. President Barack Obama had not even remarked on the matter until Tuesday. The racial, socioeconomical and legal land mines of the developing story were clearly evident to every politician, on the left and the right.

But as the standoff between militarized police and bands of angry and frightened protesters stretched on and saturated cable television, the stark silence began to break.

Early Thursday, two senators on polar opposites of the political spectrum were among the first to speak forcefully on the matter.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, sent a tweet that expressed her dismay with how law enforcement was attempting to diffuse the chaos.

[tweetbegin 499904279961149440 tweetend] Almost around the same time, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took to Facebook to lament the arrests of reporters on the ground covering the situation.

""Reporters should never be detained – a free press is too important – simply for doing their jobs,"" Cruz said in part. ""Civil liberties must be protected, but violence is not the answer. Once the unrest is brought to an end, we should examine carefully what happened to ensure that justice is served.
Neither of these musings on social media included specific policy proposals, and Cruz notably began his message with the point that police officers ""risk their lives every day to keep us safe."" 
But taken together, the two distinctly different ideological warriors – and oft-mentioned potential presidential contenders – wanted to convey that they thought police in Ferguson were overstepping their boundaries.

For the media, the most anticipated reaction was that of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has made a {concerted effort}<hyperlink=”http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/the-run-2016/where-rand-paul-connected-at-howard”> to make inroads with African-Americans on issues like drug sentencing and {education reform}<hyperlink=” http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/04/22/rand-pauls-latest-stop-to-expand-the-gop-brand”>.

Paul ended up issuing the most extensive comments on the situation of any potential 2016 White House candidate, through an op-ed published by {Time}<hyperlink=” http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”>.

Like Cruz, Paul made sure to note that police had a right to keep the peace, but also squarely stated that ""there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.""

""The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action,"" he wrote. He slid into a more ideological frame by diagnosing the militarization of police as a product of ""big government."" Since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, Washington has sent millions of dollars to local municipalities to bulk up their weaponry, producing what Paul referred to as ""small armies"" in the name of homeland security. This was Paul's fairly direct pitch to conservatives that his argument for a police force with a lighter, less aggressive footprint is something they can sign on to.
But the core of Paul's message seemed to align with Warren, who said Ferguson looked like ""a war zone.""

""When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury – national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture – we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands,"" Paul wrote, broadening his argument.

His specific policy prescription appeared to be a call to roll back federal funding for advanced weaponry more suited for the streets of Baghdad, not for a suburb of St. Louis.

This will undoubtedly meet resistance from some Capitol Hill lawmakers, many of whom remain sensitive to local security needs in their states.

But perhaps Paul's first ally in the endeavor could be Warren, another leader with a large megaphone who sits far across the aisle.",NA,NA,"When it comes to police tactics used in Missouri, even Elizabeth Warren and Rand Paul appear to agree.","Not sure if the gallery was necessary, Word"
USNews,usn5,http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/08/13/ferguson-missouri-police-shoot-black-teen-michael-brown-pundits-react,Views You Can Use: War In Ferguson,Rachel Brody,08/13/2014,02/17/2016,"Tension is mounting in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black man was shot and killed by police on Saturday. The death of 18-year-old Michael Brown has sparked outrage in the St. Louis suburb, prompting protests, looting and violence.

Early Wednesday morning, an armed man was shot and critically wounded by police near the site of the demonstrations. Local police have also used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters, and the Federal Aviation Administration has issued a no-fly zone over Ferguson, after police reported gunfire aimed at their helicopters.

President Barack Obama released a statement Tuesday, calling for an end to the violence in Ferguson. “We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals,” said Obama, “not in a way that wounds.”

While Brown’s family members have also urged peace, they and the NAACP are calling on officials to {release the name of the policeman}<hyperlink=” http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/12/naacp-to-cops-identify-michael-brown-shooter”> (now on paid leave) who shot Michael. Police Chief Thomas Jackson reneged Tuesday on a plan to make the officer’s name public, saying the department received online death threats. “The situation, the social media situation is so volatile that it’s probably going to be delayed for a little while,” Jackson {told NBC}<hyperlink=” http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-brown-protesters-cops-face-ferguson-missouri-n179346”>.

Much of the tension surrounding Brown’s death is due to the conflicting accounts from police and eyewitnesses. Police say Brown assaulted an officer and a struggle for the officer’s weapon ensued; police acknowledge a shot was fired in the officers' car but offered no details on what followed, despite saying Brown was “shot more than just a couple of times.”

But Dorian Johnson, a friend who was walking with Brown, say things happened differently. After telling the boys to get off the street and onto the sidewalk, the officer opened his squad car door, where it “ricocheted” off the pair, angering the policeman. The officer then reached out from his squad car, grabbing Brown by the neck and then arm to pull him inside. Johnson says the officer drew his weapon in the car, saying he would shoot Brown and then did. Brown and Johnson then fled, the officer shot again, and Brown turned around with his hands overhead. The police then fired “several more shots,” says Johnson, “and my friend died.”

“Michael Brown was black and tall,” wrote the {New Yorker’s Amy Davidson}<hyperlink=” http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/michael-brown-die-ferguson”>. “[W]as it his body that the police officer thought was dangerous enough?” Davidson says Brown’s shooting echoes the death of another black teen, Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, who then pleaded self-defense. “One way or the other, this happens too often to young men who look like Brown, or like Trayvon Martin, or, as President Obama once put it, like a son he might have had,” wrote Davidson.

{Deadspin’s Greg Howard}<hyperlink=” http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/america-is-not-for-black-people-1620169913”> said Brown’s death serves as a sobering reminder that “The United States of America is not for black people."" Police officers are given the power and the tools — guns, armor, planes, military-like training — to “patrol” America’s streets, argues Howard.

If officers are soldiers, it follows that the neighborhoods they patrol are battlefields. And if they're working battlefields, it follows that the population is the enemy. And because of correlations, rooted in historical injustice, between crime and income and income and race, the enemy population will consist largely of people of color, and especially of black men.

The Justice Department has called on the FBI to launch an independent investigation of the shooting, but the real problem is an “insidious cycle” embedded within the legal system itself, said {CNN’s Mark O’Mara}<hyperlink=” http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/13/opinion/omara-michael-brown-police-shooting-racial-injustice/”>. “If you want to say the cop's at fault because he's the adult with training, you are right. And if you want to say the young man is at fault for disrespect or mistrust of a cop's authority, you are right,” O’Mara argued. Both sides are stuck firmly in their camps, much to the detriment of relations between minorities and the police.

Regardless, said O’Mara, the responsibility lies with police to make this first step toward bettering the system: “Police officers are in the position of authority, and they have the power to send a message that when they serve a community, they serve all the people of the community equally, regardless of race.”",NA,NA,Conflicting reports over the death of a young black man have ignited outrage in Missouri.,"“If officers” quote from link, but larger and slightly grey"

Police had been withholding Wilson’s name in fear of retaliation against him. On Friday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson named Wilson while speaking outside of a QuikTrip gas station that had been burned to the ground during riots this week.

Wilson was reportedly responding to a sick call before encountering Brown. Jackson alluded to a “strong-armed robbery” that took place that day, but did not immediately connect Brown to the incident. 

A {police report}<hyperlink=”http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2014/images/08/15/ferguson.police.documents.pdf”> released later Friday morning named Brown as a suspect in a convenience store robbery that occurred on Saturday, the day he was shot, according to {CNN}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html”>.

But Wilson was reportedly unaware that Brown was a robbery suspect at the time, Jackson said, according to {The Associated Press}<hyperlink=”http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2014/08/15/turmoil-tear-gas-give-way-to-hope-in-ferguson”>.

Brown and another person were stopped ""because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic,"" Jackson said.

Dorian Johnson, who said he was with Brown when the teenager first encountered Wilson, is also named as a suspect, according to the report. A box of Swisher Sweets cigars valued at $48.99 was reportedly stolen from the convenience store, according to {Fox News}<hyperlink=”http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-say-michael-brown-fit-description-strong-arm-robbery-suspect.html”> and {The Associated Press}<hyperlink=”http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2014/08/15/turmoil-tear-gas-give-way-to-hope-in-ferguson?src=usn_tw”>.

Images from the convenience store's security cameras were released Friday that show a confrontation in the store between two men, one larger than the other. The police documents indicate that Brown matched the description of the robbery suspect when Wilson confronted him Aug. 9.

[tweetbegin 500311153583853570 tweetend]""It still doesn't justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,"" said Bernard Ewing, Brown's uncle, noting Johnson's report that Brown had his hands raised over his head during the shooting. 

Jackson said Wilson had already shot Brown by the time a second police officer arrived minutes later.

Wilson’s identification comes a day after President Barack Obama called for more transparency from law enforcement following a spate of heated protests in Ferguson.
 “Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those in positions of authority,” 

Obama said Thursday from Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. “When something like this happens, the local authorities, including the police, have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death and how they are protecting the people in their communities.""
Obama said Thursday that the FBI and the Department of Justice would both investigate the circumstances behind Brown’s death. Local law enforcement officers have been criticized for using excessive force – involving rubber bullets, tear gas and smoke bombs – in responding to protests, according to {Fox News}<hyperlink=”http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/14/police-clash-with-michael-brown-shooting-protesters-in-ferguson-two-reporters.html”> and {The Christian Science Monitor}<hyperlink=”http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0814/Police-in-Ferguson-Mo.-break-up-protests-with-tear-gas-again”>.

Mingling with Ferguson protesters Thursday was Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, who was that day placed in charge of maintaining peace in Ferguson by Missouri Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon.

“We are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we’re in this together,” Johnson said Thursday, according to CNN and {PIX11}<hyperlink=”http://pix11.com/2014/08/14/governor-of-missouri-puts-state-troopers-in-charge/”>.

[tweetbegin 500277751270879232 tweetend] Johnson’s first day in charge of Ferguson security was markedly different from the days prior. SWAT gear and tear gas were cast aside as Johnson hugged, kissed and laughed with protesters, according to Elahe Izadi and Wesley Lowery of {The Washington Post}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/meet-the-missouri-highway-state-patrol-captain-who-is-taking-over-in-ferguson/”>. Lowery was one of two journalists detained by police Wednesday inside a McDonald's restaurant.

Johnson's treatment of protesters seemed to elicit a calmer response from citizens.

“When I see a young lady cry because of fear of this uniform, that’s a problem,” Johnson said Thursday, according to the Post. “I’m not afraid to be in this crowd.”

Several officers were also seen mingling among the protesters, according to {Reuters}<hyperlink=”http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-missouri-shooting-idUSKBN0GF0LP20140815”>.

Nixon and Johnson held a press conference Friday asking for civility and cooperation as the Brown investigation unfolds.

""Nothing should deter figuring out how and why Michael Brown was killed,"" Nixon said. ""There are a lot of steps between now and when justice is served. There are going to be a lot of other bounces along the way. And there will be a lot of tension at various times.""
""In our anger, we have to make sure that we don't burn down our own houses and we don't go down there and vandalize our own buildings,"" Johnson said, referring to looting and vandalism that has marked some of the past week's protests. ""That does not prove a point. That does not solve the issue.""

Johnson is African-American. But only three of Ferguson's 53 police officers are black, according to Reuters.

“This is not a black and white issue, because we all have sons and daughters,” Johnson said. “It’s time to stop saying it’s an old wound and close it for good.”

“The suspect, who right now is described as a 23-year-old African-American, was acting erratically – walking back and forth up and down the street,” St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said, according to. “As officers arrived, the suspect turned toward the officers and started to walk toward them clutching his waistband. He then pulled out a knife … and told the officers, ‘Shoot me now. Kill me now.”

The man was accused of taking two energy drinks and a package of pastries from a store without paying before encountering St. Louis police officers, according to {ABC News}<hyperlink=” http://abcnews.go.com/US/ferguson-chants-heard-st-louis-cops-shoot-suspect/story?id=25041218”>. Dotson said officers repeatedly told the man to put his knife down as he approached. The suspect reportedly came within feet of one of the officers before he was shot in what Dotson described as a ""suicide by cop,"" according to ABC News.

 “If you’re the family of a police officer and somebody approaches you within three feet with a knife, I think you have the right to defend yourself and protect yourself,” Dotson said. “I think it certainly is reasonable that an officer has an expectation to go home at the end of the night.”

Tuesday’s shooting continued the chaos that has engulfed the area around Ferguson, Missouri, where unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed Aug. 9 by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

The FBI, Justice Department and local authorities are investigating Brown’s death. An autopsy conducted for the family by medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden was released Sunday, revealing that Brown had been shot six times in his altercation with Wilson – twice in the head.

Brown’s death sparked days of looting, protesting and violence as Ferguson security forces struggled to maintain order. A brief window of peaceful protests last week gave the community a reprieve from consecutive nights of violence following Brown’s death, according to {CNN}<hyperlink=” http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html”>.

That calm dissolved over the weekend as violence prompted police officers this week to bring tear gas and riot gear back into the fray.

Officers “came under heavy gunfire” Monday night but did reportedly did not fire back at the rioters.
“This was not an act of protesters. This was an act of violent criminals,” Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said Tuesday. “Protesters are peaceful and respectful. They don’t clash with police. They don’t throw Molotov cocktails.”

At least 31 people were arrested Monday night into Tuesday morning, according to {The Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-overnight-unrest-20140818-story.html”>. Some of those taken into custody were reportedly from California and New York.

Ferguson residents have claimed that some protesters not native to Ferguson have created trouble for the actual residents of the St. Louis suburb.

“Who would burn down their own backyard?” Ferguson resident Rebecca McCloud asked Sunday, according to {Fox News}<hyperlink=”http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/17/police-try-to-disperse-protesters-defying-ferguson-curfew.html”>. “These people aren’t from here. They came to burn down our city and leave.”

The Missouri National Guard was called into Ferguson Monday to help maintain order. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has said that the Guard will primarily oversee the protection of Ferguson police forces’ command center, according to {The New York Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html?_r=0”>.

“With these additional resources in place … the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard,” Nixon said Monday.

Attorney General Eric Holder is scheduled to travel to Ferguson Wednesday.

“Ours is a nation of laws: of citizens who live under them and for the citizens who enforce them,” President Barack Obama said in a press conference Monday. “Let me call once again for us to seek some understanding rather than simply holler at each other.

First, a small Southern town burning over race – that’s a story we know by heart. American history and literature foretell it over and over: the South is the South is the South.

What's new to our eyes is the extent to which police forces have become militarized against the citizenry. Why we should tolerate police officers on tanks, looking like warriors, wielding heavy artillery, is beyond me. It’s another outrageous gift from the presidency of George W. Bush, who founded the Department of “Homeland Security.” The word “homeland” was not even in American usage before 2001. Now with military surplus hardware going out to law enforcement, the face of policing at home has changed to become more hostile in a post-9/11 posture. Violence on civilians is thus more likely to happen. 

Because of Ferguson, black anger and grief at white power and force is now in starker relief than the nation has witnessed in years. As our collective conscience registers the death of an unarmed youth by a police officer, this is a good time – a crisis – to look back as well as forward. Michael Brown was slain, shot several times, caught in the crossfire on a summer night, like many other young black men before him. Emmett Till, a Chicago youth of 14, died a brutal death in the oppressive heat of Mississippi in 1955. All they did to deserve dying was nothing.

Missouri has always been contested ground, a border state with Southern slavery and culture, much like Maryland. It's the setting of the greatest American novel, all about the crucible of race. Mark Twain, a son of Missouri, wrote in ""Huckleberry Finn"" about runaway Huck and fugitive slave Jim seeking freedom, rafting on the Mississippi River, away from the slave state Missouri. How stark is that imagery in our shared memory? If you've ever seen Hannibal, the riverfront town that was Twain's boyhood home, you can breathe that languorous Southern air that keeps people in their place. Missouri is far from the self-reliant Midwest in origins and character, contrary to reputation. It’s more Southern, not so much heartland.

One thing I will say in Missouri's favor is that President Harry Truman, a native son, desegregated the armed forces soon after World War II. Good for Harry.

Missouri was a slave state in antebellum America and the focus of festering debate in Congress during the bitter divide between North and South. The ""Missouri Compromise"" of 1820 was just the first skirmish. In the 150 years since the Civil War, in the 50 years since the landmark civil rights acts, we are still prisoners of the past. Reconciliation is far from complete. Racial relations still smolder in the former slave states – known as ""the Slave power,"" among the abolitionists who resisted it. Philadelphia Quakers and Bostonian Unitarians shone as anti-slavery leaders from the 1830s to the 1850s. These decades were our darkest historical hours.

We still have an unspoken fault line, descended from the Mason-Dixon Line that separated freedom and slavery. Not all states were created equal, let's be honest. The leading states standing against slavery were Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New York. That's just the truth. But old Missouri still has the weight of slavery hanging over it, our own American ""peculiar institution."" It remains somewhere under the sun, painfully re-enacted in variations to this day.

By contrast, whites, by 47% to 37%, say the issue of race is getting more attention than it deserves.”

 “The most interesting data point in the new Pew poll though,” wrote {Aaron Blake for the Fix}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/08/18/racial-reactions-to-ferguson-even-stronger-than-to-trayvon-martin/”>, “is that even at this very early juncture, Americans as a whole see the shooting of Brown as more of a racial issue than the shooting of [Florida teen Trayvon] Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.”

Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, doesn’t see high black political participation because the Democratic institutions that mobilize voters in the city haven’t been established yet in the suburbs, where blacks have flocked only in the last 15 years, wrote {Jeff Smith for the New York Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/opinion/in-ferguson-black-town-white-power.html”>. “That helps explain why majority-black Ferguson has a virtually all-white power structure: a white mayor; a school board with six white members and one Hispanic, which recently suspended a highly regarded young black superintendent who then resigned; a City Council with just one black member; and a 6 percent black police force,"" Smith wrote.

The racial disparities in public representation in Ferguson are also caused by “the fact that municipal elections in Ferguson are held not just in off-years, but in April instead of November. While turnout among whites and blacks in the 2012 presidential election was identical, whites turned out for Ferguson’s April 2013 municipal election at a rate nearly three times that of blacks,” wrote {Paul Waldman for the Washington Post}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/18/what-libertarians-and-conservatives-get-wrong-about-ferguson/”>. “That disparity then has consequences that incorporate law enforcement, economics, and people’s daily interactions with authority.”

Those authorities have had a difficult time containing violence in the wake of the shooting death, resulting in Gov. Jay Nixon ordering the Missouri National Guard to Ferguson. No one should be encouraging more protests, wrote {Gary Younge for the Guardian}<hyperlink=”http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/18/ferguson-violence-martin-luther-king-michael-brown”>, and no one wants more unarmed black teens shot, either. “And those two things – the violence of the state and the violence of the street – are connected,” Younge wrote. “The people on the streets don’t donate thousands of dollars to anyone’s campaign. They don’t get a seat at any table where decisions are made or have the ear of the powerful. But with four black men killed by the police in the country in the last four weeks, they have a lot to say, and precious few avenues through which to say it. The question now is who’s listening.”",NA,NA,Americans have different reactions to the shooting based upon their own race.,NA

Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of street in a St. Louis suburb, drawing the attention of a local cop who ended up shooting and killing the unarmed Brown. An “investigative stop” by police resulted in the death of Ezell Ford, a Los Angeles man, {who witnesses}<hyperlink=”http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/”> say was shot three times while he was already compliantly lying on the ground.

Taken together, the instances of unarmed, black men getting shot and killed under debatable circumstances have put new scrutiny on a police tactic known as “broken windows,” in which law enforcement officers focus on rooting out minor disorder as a way to prevent more serious crime. Critics say the tactic unfairly targets minority and poor communities and fosters a culture of police brutality.

 “The death of Michael Brown strikes me as the latest, sad chapter in an ongoing national narrative about a form of policing, broken windows policing, that is simply not right for the country,” says Cornell William Brooks, national president of the NAACP. “We have a number of incidents where we have young people who are at worst suspected of underwhelming, minor offenses who meet an overwhelming, major – sometimes lethal – use of force that leads to tragedy.”

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., along with five fellow members of the New York congressional delegation, {have called on}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/nyregion/six-members-of-congress-ask-holder-to-open-federal-inquiry-in-chokehold-case.html”> Attorney General Eric Holder to intervene in the investigation of Garner’s death as well as examine more broadly the broken windows policing strategy.

“Racially selective law enforcement that focuses heavily on communities of color runs a serious risk of violating the constitution and federal civil rights laws,” Jeffries says. “Minor offenses are either subject to enforcement or they are not. But they cannot be offenses that are enforced in some communities while being ignored in other communities when the dividing line is race.”

Broken windows gets its name from {an Atlantic article}<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/?single_page=true”> written by the theory’s authors, criminologists George Kelling and James Wilson , introducing their approach in 1982. A building with one broken window is likely to be continually vandalized if left unrepaired, the theory goes, and thus by cracking down on minor infractions, communities can ward off more serious crimes.

""If the neighborhood cannot keep a bothersome panhandler from annoying passers-by, the thief may reason, it is even less likely to call the police to identify a potential mugger or to interfere if the mugging actually takes place,” Kelling and Wilson wrote.

The article and further scholarship that accompanied it were hugely influential in shaping policing protocols in the 1980s and 1990s. The vast majority of police departments incorporate the model in their approaches, according to John Firman, director of research at the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which represents 18,000 state and local law enforcement agencies nationwide.

“Police around the country have embraced the concept almost universally, because it is so elegant,” he says.

However, questions continue about whether in practice the theory works as neatly as it sounds.

The way it was originally described by Kelling and Wilson, broken windows strategy could include a variety of solutions and interpretations, not all of them having to do with traditional policing. For instance to address a rampant graffiti problem, officials could instruct cops to more harshly punish those caught doing graffiti, or hire more sanitation crews to diligently clean up the vandalism.

In effect, ""broken windows"" has become a kind of catchall phrase for all sorts of policing approaches it inspired, including what is known as “community-oriented policing” or “problem-solving policing.” Some cities, namely New York, continue to embrace the broken windows approach explicitly, as New York Police Commissioner William Bratton considers Kelling {his intellectual mentor}<hyperlink=”http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=249074812”>. In other cities, it has manifested itself in efforts like a 1990s Chicago ordinance that allowed police to arrest people for loitering under the suspicion that they were gang members; a measure {ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/11/us/loitering-law-aimed-at-gangs-is-struck-down-by-high-court.html”>.

In its decades of use, broken windows policing proponents have pointed to research, including {that of Wesley Skogan}<hyperlink=”https://books.google.com/books/about/Disorder_and_Decline.html?id=ASrAMJh7LngC&hl=en”>, which has shown an empirical connection between disorder in a community (i.e. the minor infractions targeted by broken window policing) and overall crime rates.

However, other studies, particularly the {work done by Bernard Harcourt}<hyperlink=”https://books.google.com/books?id=mSWDy1kGUGAC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=broken+windows+policing+wesley+skogan&source=bl&ots=zmK92_86ot&sig=tEFuKzNV6SzaXByYgeIhrUa7gjQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ctbsU5i4H6nlsASysoDIDQ&sqi=2&ved=0CGsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=broken%20windows%20policing%20wesley%20skogan&f=false”>, shed doubt on Skogan’s analysis as well as the effectiveness of broken windows policing as a whole.

“It turns out that a lot of ways broken windows policing defines orderliness is not always in tune with the community’s norms,” Harcourt says. “Broken windows policing would define disorderliness as a group of neighbors sitting on a stoop. Well it turns out that in some neighborhoods, that’s a form of control of a neighborhood ordering itself by knowing who is coming in and out of the neighborhood.”

It is a theory that often relies too much on discretion, critics say, and that discretion, in turn, can lead to racial and class bias.

“What has proven to be true in these interactions – sometimes resulting in police violence, otherwise resulting in simple abuse of authority and hurt feelings – is that these officers tend not to respect poor black and brown people,” says Khalil Gibran Muhammad, author of “The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime and the Making of Modern Urban America.”


Such tactics, critics say, foster an environment where black and Hispanic communities harbor deep mistrust of the institutions ostensibly in charge of protecting them, particularly when the authorities they're dealing with are mostly white. Long-term, underlying policing issues in Ferguson prompted Jerryl Christmas, a defense attorney and former St. Louis prosecutor, {to call the town}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html#page=”> “a racial powder keg.” The explosiveness of police-community relations in Ferguson were on full display with Wednesday evening’s crackdown on local protesters involving {a police response akin to a military action}<hyperlink=”http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-and-the-shocking-nature-of-us-police-militarization”>.

Kelling, now a senior fellow at the conservative think-tank the Manhattan Institute, continues to defend broken windows policing. He tells U.S. News he didn't see how broken windows was related to the controversies over Garner’s and Brown’s death.

“When people don’t obey the law, the police are going to intervene,” he says. “What happened in New York​​​​​... ​had tragic outcomes and sadly that happened and we don’t know the details. But the idea of that just because police are enforcing the law, that we expect that because there is a risk of something bad happening, that police should not enforce the law? There’s a demand out there that people do things about particular problems.” 
To the racial disparities in how it is enforced, he says, “Who are the victims of crime and where are people victimized? It turns out they’re in minority and poor neighborhoods. To put police where crimes are and where victims are, they’re going to be running into those minority and those poor citizens. That is just a basic reality.”

Kelling does, however, concede:​ “There are times that in the name of broken windows, bad policing has taken place.”

“It’s a highly discretionary activity and for the most part I’ve encouraged police to educate, to warn and only use arrest as a last resort. Arrest is a powerful tool as well and should only be used sparingly,” he says.

{A New York Daily News report}<hyperlink=”http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/summons-broken-windows-racial-disparity-garner-article-1.1890567”> on the enforcement of broken windows in New York found the policy resulted annually in hundreds of thousand of low-level violations, court summons and arrests over the last decade or so. In a vast majority of violations – 81 percent – those punished were black and Hispanic, and summons were mostly issued in black and Hispanic majority communities.

Likewise in Ferguson, there {have been reports}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2”> of long-standing tensions between the largely white police force and the 67 percent black community. For instance, 86 percent of drivers pulled over by police were black and, when those stops ended in arrest, 92 percent of those arrested were black, according to {The Washington Post}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/the-breaking-point-for-ferguson/”>.

""We have people who have warrants because of traffic tickets and are effectively imprisoned in their homes,” Malik Ahmed, the CEO of Better Family Life, a St. Louis community development organization, {told The New Yorker}<hyperlink=”http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/saw-ferguson”>. ""They can’t go outside because they’ll be arrested. In some cases people actually have jobs but decide the threat of arrest makes it not worth trying to commute outside their neighborhood.”

Garner's Staten Island and Brown's Ferguson are very different places, but both share a lower-income, minority community that faces heavy punishments for minor offenses.

“Conceptually, to the extent broken windows is an enforcement strategy that is applied equally in every community throughout America, there is no constitutional problem,” Rep. Jeffries says. “But what we see in practice is that the broken windows strategy is largely deployed in black and Latino communities,that is why we’ve requested the Department of Justice to look into the manner in which the strategy has been applied.”

The Department of Justice​ is conducting a broad review of police tactics across the country, {USA Today reported}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/12/police-force-panel/13951033/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&dlvrit=206567”> Wednesday. The agency did not respond to U.S. News requests for comment as to whether this review would include broken windows policing​. However Holder has signaled that, at least in Ferguson, the priority is on cooling the long-boiling frustrations that predated Brown's death.

Lieb; Alan Scher Zagier,08/15/2014,02/22/2016,"Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson made the announcement after initially declining to the release the name, saying the officer had received numerous death threats. The officer has been on administrative leave since the shooting Saturday of 18-year-old Michael Brown, whose death has sparked several days of clashes with furious protesters.

But on Thursday, county police in riot gear and armored tanks gave way to state troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of peaceful protesters. The dramatic shift came after Gov. Jay Nixon assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol, stripping that authority from the St. Louis County Police Department.

""All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,"" Pedro Smith, who has participated in the nightly protests, said Thursday. ""This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect.""

The more tolerant response came as President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting — and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

Obama said there was ""no excuse"" for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.

Tensions boiled over after a candlelight vigil Sunday night, as looters smashed and burned businesses in the neighborhood, where police have repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times, according to police.

But a much different story has been told by Dorian Johnson, who says he was walking down the street with Brown when he was shot. He has said the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening. But the latest protests had a light, almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd, more akin to a parade or block party.

The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell — the point at which previous protests have grown tense — no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.

""You can feel it. You can see it,"" protester Cleo Willis said of the change. ""Now it's up to us to ride that feeling.""

Nixon appointed Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, to lead the police effort. Johnson, who grew up near Ferguson and commands a region that includes St. Louis County, marched alongside protesters Thursday, joined by other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol as well as the county department. The marchers also had a police escort.

""We're here to serve and protect,"" Johnson said. ""We're not here to instill fear.""

Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control — a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police had taken over the investigation of Brown's shooting and security at the request of Ferguson.

Nixon vowed that ""Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it."" The governor was joined at a news conference by the white mayor of St. Louis and the region's four state representatives and the county executive, all of whom are black.

Rand Paul wrote (a pointed response}<hyperlink” http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”> to the crisis developing in Ferguson, Missouri: “If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.” He went on to criticize the militarization of the police and the racial injustices of the American legal system. As Paul put it, “Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention.”

Coming from a libertarian Republican who is considered a frontrunner for the 2016 nomination, Paul’s comments were much anticipated. For a few days after Michael Brown was killed, libertarian leader {remained fairly quiet}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/13/why-arent-libertarians-talking-about-ferguson/”>, uncertain whether Brown’s death would be a matter of civil rights or civil liberties. It may sound like a small difference, but it’s an important one. When it comes to issues framed in terms of civil rights, libertarians tend to opt out. They led the charge against national ID cards but not voter ID laws, against Transportation Security Administration body scans but not TSA racial profiling.

In Ferguson, libertarian leaders have a chance to change this, to defend not only civil liberties but civil rights. To do so, however, will require rethinking some of their core assumptions about government power.

The crisis in Ferguson meets at the intersection of civil liberties and civil rights. The two terms, though quite similar, point in opposite directions. “Civil liberties” suggests the encroachment of a too-powerful state. “Civil rights,” on the other hand, typically applies to issues of discrimination and inequality that require the federal government to intervene. Libertarians thus harbor suspicions toward the federal government, while civil rights activists look to it for support.

These opposing impulses have historically pitted libertarians against civil rights activists. Barry Goldwater in 1964 declared his opposition to the Civil Rights Act in libertarian terms. While believing racial discrimination was abhorrent, Goldwater insisted the federal government had neither the authority nor the ability to legislate it away.

It is a position many libertarians have clung to in the decades since. Rep. Ron Paul declared his opposition to the Civil Rights Act in 2004, a position his son Rand Paul seemed to defend in {a 2010 interview}<hyperlink=”http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2010/05/19/98217/paul-civil-rights/”>  in which he said, among other things, “I think it’s a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant — but, at the same time, I do believe in private ownership.”


That apparent defense of his father’s position did not go over well, and in May 2013 {Paul came out firmly in favor}<hyperlink”https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/rand-pauls-rewriting-of-his-own-remarks-on-the-civil-rights-act/2013/04/10/5b8d91c4-a235-11e2-82bc-511538ae90a4_blog.html”> of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, telling Wolf Blitzer, “There was an overriding problem in the south so big that it did require federal intervention” and thus he would have voted for the bill. In making those comments, Paul abandoned what had been libertarian orthodoxy: choosing a philosophical opposition to federal power over the actual protection of individual freedoms.

This tendency to support libertarian means over libertarian ends has been a major problem for the movement, which is why political observers were so keen to hear how libertarians would respond to the crisis in Ferguson. The militarization of the police, so clearly on display in Ferguson, has been an important topic for libertarian thinkers like {Radley Balko}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/radley-balko”>. But what was happening in Ferguson was also an issue of civil rights, raising questions of racial profiling, residential segregation and economic inequality.

Paul offered a resolution that squared the circle: blaming the federal government for the crisis. “Washington,” he wrote, shifting his gaze from local law enforcement to distant D.C., “has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies.”

He’s right: First through the War on Drugs and then the War on Terror, federal initiatives have vested local law enforcement and criminal justice authorities with unprecedented power. As we’ve learned in the past week, cops in Keene, New Hampshire, safeguard the town’s 23,000 citizens with armored personnel carriers and officers in Doraville, Georgia (pop: 8,500) are kitted out with tanks and camouflage.

Prosecutors, meanwhile, have the power to pile on charges so that criminal trials are no longer worth the risk. As of 2009, 97 percent of federal cases and 94 percent of state cases {ended in plea bargains}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/us/stronger-hand-for-judges-after-rulings-on-plea-deals.html”>. The overwhelming power of the state tilts the scales of justice throughout the legal system, and minorities are often the ones most affected.

Still, it’s hard to imagine a long-term partnership between libertarians and civil rights activists. For the last 150 years, the protection of minority civil rights has required a strong federal state: to end slavery, to protect freed people, to dismantle Jim Crow, to safeguard the ballot box. For nearly a century, local law enforcement terrorized black southerners. The federal government was the only level of government that would help (and even it had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the fight). Given a choice between Bull Connor and Bobby Kennedy, is it any wonder black southerners preferred far-off feds to close-at-hand cops?

That history informs the crisis unfolding in Ferguson, where there is little evidence that black residents agree with Paul’s argument that “big government has been at the heart of the problem.” They are, understandably, far more likely to trust Attorney General Eric Holder, who arrives in Ferguson on Wednesday, than officers in the Ferguson Police Department, some of whom in 2009 {assaulted a black man}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/us/stronger-hand-for-judges-after-rulings-on-plea-deals.html”> in their custody, then charged him with destruction of property for getting blood on their uniforms.

Ferguson, then, presents a challenge as well as an opportunity for libertarians. Yes, they can make tactical alliances with civil rights leaders. But that alliance will be short-lived if libertarians remain rigid in their insistence that a strong government endangers rather than engenders liberty. If libertarians like Paul can embrace a more nuanced understanding of government power, they can advance not only civil liberties, but civil rights as well.",NA,NA,The crisis in Missouri provides libertarians with a chance to support civil liberties and civil rights.,NA
USNews,usn14,http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/15/dont-rush-to-prosecute-ferguson-cop-darren-wilson-george-zimmerman-lawyer-says,"Don't Rush to Prosecute Ferguson Cop, George Zimmerman Lawyer Says",Steven Nelson ,08/15/2014,02/22/2016,"After nearly a week of protests, police in Ferguson, Missouri, on Friday identified the officer who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Darren Wilson, the triggerman, is a four-year employee of the Ferguson Police Department and was responding to a nearby robbery, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said. The chief said Wilson was treated for physical injuries after the Saturday incident.

The case has many similarities to the Trayvon Martin shooting and subsequent media whirlwind. Martin, 17, was shot dead in February 2012 by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who was charged with murder after an intense public pressure campaign featuring protests in Sanford, Florida, and wall-to-wall media coverage. A jury found Zimmerman not guilty in July 2013.

Zimmerman successfully argued that he defended himself when Martin, who was unarmed, attacked. The public face of his defense team, attorney Mark O’Mara, tells U.S. News prosecutors in Missouri should resist calls to promptly file charges against Wilson.

Many facts about the Brown case are unknown. For example, authorities haven’t said how many shots were fired by the policeman. It’s also unclear what injuries the officer allegedly suffered.

“I said in Zimmerman and I have to echo it here today, we know so little about what led up to this, what happened between them,” O’Mara says. 

Any decision about charges should be presented to a grand jury, he says, rather than made unilaterally by a prosecutor, as was done in the Martin case.

O’Mara says it will be important to look at evidence and witness statements in their entirety. In the Zimmerman case, for example, it wasn’t immediately known to the public that the shooter suffered a gash to the back of his head, which became a key piece of the case.

“A swollen cheek, will that be relevant? Sure,” O’Mara says. “Every fact is going to be relevant: Every eyewitness, the movement of the car, the injuries, the injuries to Michael Brown – but what we don’t want to do is take one snippet and say, ‘Aha, here’s the answer,' because that’s exactly what happened in Zimmerman. The emergency call came out and it was interpreted, misinterpreted by most, and then they let out this and then they let out a medical record and then they let out a 12-year-old photo of Trayvon – and all of this information fell into this vacuum of information and most of it was at least incomplete if not inaccurate.”

He says authorities should also withhold key details about the case before completing their investigation.

“If you let out one piece of information, some other witness customizes or re-remembers their testimony to take into consideration that piece of evidence and now you’ve infected the testimony,” he says.

O’Mara isn’t exactly leaping to the defense of local cops, who battled protesters in Ferguson with tear gas and rubber bullets throughout the week. He doesn’t like the {militarized}<hyperlink=”http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-and-the-shocking-nature-of-us-police-militarization”> reaction, though he also dislikes locals’ looting spree.

O’Mara says the ultimate fate of Wilson will come down to a careful second-by-second analysis of his actions.

“You have to look at it almost moment to moment,” he says. “If at the time the officer shot his weapon, he was protecting himself from what he perceived to be grave bodily injury, that’s self-defense. If the second shot was also under the same conditions, that’s self-defense. If it wasn’t, that’s not.”

Protesters in Ferguson and around the country allege that Brown was shot with his hands in the air.

Dorian Johnson, 22, {told MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”> earlier this week the officer now identified as Wilson grabbed Brown around the neck and then shot him as Brown pulled away. Johnson said Brown then ran away and was shot a second time, in the back. Brown then said, ""I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!"" according to his friend, but was shot several more times.

Police released images of the robbery on Friday. No video or photos of the shooting have surfaced, but accounts thus far agree Brown was unarmed.

USNews,usn15,http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/14/michael-brown-eric-garner-deaths-add-scrutiny-to-broken-windows-policing,"From Ferguson to Staten Island, Questions About Broken Window Policing",Tierney Sneed,08/14/2014,02/22/2016,"Eric Garner was accused of selling untaxed cigarettes in Staten Island when a police officer put him in the illegal choke hold that killed him. Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of street in a St. Louis suburb, drawing the attention of a local cop who ended up shooting and killing the unarmed Brown. An “investigative stop” by police resulted in the death of Ezell Ford, a Los Angeles man, {who witnesses}<hyperlink=”http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/”> say was shot three times while he was already compliantly lying on the ground.

Taken together, the instances of unarmed, black men getting shot and killed under debatable circumstances have put new scrutiny on a police tactic known as “broken windows,” in which law enforcement officers focus on rooting out minor disorder as a way to prevent more serious crime. Critics say the tactic unfairly targets minority and poor communities and fosters a culture of police brutality.

 “The death of Michael Brown strikes me as the latest, sad chapter in an ongoing national narrative about a form of policing, broken windows policing, that is simply not right for the country,” says Cornell William Brooks, national president of the NAACP. “We have a number of incidents where we have young people who are at worst suspected of underwhelming, minor offenses who meet an overwhelming, major – sometimes lethal – use of force that leads to tragedy.”

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., along with five fellow members of the New York congressional delegation, {have called on}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/nyregion/six-members-of-congress-ask-holder-to-open-federal-inquiry-in-chokehold-case.html”> Attorney General Eric Holder to intervene in the investigation of Garner’s death as well as examine more broadly the broken windows policing strategy.

“Racially selective law enforcement that focuses heavily on communities of color runs a serious risk of violating the constitution and federal civil rights laws,” Jeffries says. “Minor offenses are either subject to enforcement or they are not. But they cannot be offenses that are enforced in some communities while being ignored in other communities when the dividing line is race.”

Broken windows gets its name from {an Atlantic article}<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/?single_page=true”> written by the theory’s authors, criminologists George Kelling and James Wilson , introducing their approach in 1982. A building with one broken window is likely to be continually vandalized if left unrepaired, the theory goes, and thus by cracking down on minor infractions, communities can ward off more serious crimes.

""If the neighborhood cannot keep a bothersome panhandler from annoying passers-by, the thief may reason, it is even less likely to call the police to identify a potential mugger or to interfere if the mugging actually takes place,” Kelling and Wilson wrote.

The article and further scholarship that accompanied it were hugely influential in shaping policing protocols in the 1980s and 1990s. The vast majority of police departments incorporate the model in their approaches, according to John Firman, director of research at the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which represents 18,000 state and local law enforcement agencies nationwide.

“Police around the country have embraced the concept almost universally, because it is so elegant,” he says.

However, questions continue about whether in practice the theory works as neatly as it sounds.

The way it was originally described by Kelling and Wilson, broken windows strategy could include a variety of solutions and interpretations, not all of them having to do with traditional policing. For instance to address a rampant graffiti problem, officials could instruct cops to more harshly punish those caught doing graffiti, or hire more sanitation crews to diligently clean up the vandalism.

In effect, ""broken windows"" has become a kind of catchall phrase for all sorts of policing approaches it inspired, including what is known as “community-oriented policing” or “problem-solving policing.” Some cities, namely New York, continue to embrace the broken windows approach explicitly, as New York Police Commissioner William Bratton considers Kelling {his intellectual mentor}<hyperlink=”http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=249074812”>. In other cities, it has manifested itself in efforts like a 1990s Chicago ordinance that allowed police to arrest people for loitering under the suspicion that they were gang members; a measure {ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/11/us/loitering-law-aimed-at-gangs-is-struck-down-by-high-court.html”>.

In its decades of use, broken windows policing proponents have pointed to research, including {that of Wesley Skogan}<hyperlink=”https://books.google.com/books/about/Disorder_and_Decline.html?id=ASrAMJh7LngC&hl=en”>, which has shown an empirical connection between disorder in a community (i.e. the minor infractions targeted by broken window policing) and overall crime rates.

However, other studies, particularly the {work done by Bernard Harcourt}<hyperlink=”https://books.google.com/books?id=mSWDy1kGUGAC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=broken+windows+policing+wesley+skogan&source=bl&ots=zmK92_86ot&sig=tEFuKzNV6SzaXByYgeIhrUa7gjQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ctbsU5i4H6nlsASysoDIDQ&sqi=2&ved=0CGsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=broken%20windows%20policing%20wesley%20skogan&f=false”>, shed doubt on Skogan’s analysis as well as the effectiveness of broken windows policing as a whole.

“It turns out that a lot of ways broken windows policing defines orderliness is not always in tune with the community’s norms,” Harcourt says. “Broken windows policing would define disorderliness as a group of neighbors sitting on a stoop. Well it turns out that in some neighborhoods, that’s a form of control of a neighborhood ordering itself by knowing who is coming in and out of the neighborhood.”

It is a theory that often relies too much on discretion, critics say, and that discretion, in turn, can lead to racial and class bias.

“What has proven to be true in these interactions – sometimes resulting in police violence, otherwise resulting in simple abuse of authority and hurt feelings – is that these officers tend not to respect poor black and brown people,” says Khalil Gibran Muhammad, author of “The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime and the Making of Modern Urban America.”

Such tactics, critics say, foster an environment where black and Hispanic communities harbor deep mistrust of the institutions ostensibly in charge of protecting them, particularly when the authorities they're dealing with are mostly white. Long-term, underlying policing issues in Ferguson prompted Jerryl Christmas, a defense attorney and former St. Louis prosecutor, {to call the town}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html#page=”> “a racial powder keg.” The explosiveness of police-community relations in Ferguson were on full display with Wednesday evening’s crackdown on local protesters involving {a police response akin to a military action}<hyperlink=”http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-and-the-shocking-nature-of-us-police-militarization”>.

Kelling, now a senior fellow at the conservative think-tank the Manhattan Institute, continues to defend broken windows policing. He tells U.S. News he didn't see how broken windows was related to the controversies over Garner’s and Brown’s death.

“When people don’t obey the law, the police are going to intervene,” he says. “What happened in New York​​​​​... ​had tragic outcomes and sadly that happened and we don’t know the details. But the idea of that just because police are enforcing the law, that we expect that because there is a risk of something bad happening, that police should not enforce the law? There’s a demand out there that people do things about particular problems.” 
To the racial disparities in how it is enforced, he says, “Who are the victims of crime and where are people victimized? It turns out they’re in minority and poor neighborhoods. To put police where crimes are and where victims are, they’re going to be running into those minority and those poor citizens. That is just a basic reality.”

Kelling does, however, concede:​ “There are times that in the name of broken windows, bad policing has taken place.”

“It’s a highly discretionary activity and for the most part I’ve encouraged police to educate, to warn and only use arrest as a last resort. Arrest is a powerful tool as well and should only be used sparingly,” he says.

{A New York Daily News report}<hyperlink=”http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/summons-broken-windows-racial-disparity-garner-article-1.1890567”> on the enforcement of broken windows in New York found the policy resulted annually in hundreds of thousand of low-level violations, court summons and arrests over the last decade or so. In a vast majority of violations – 81 percent – those punished were black and Hispanic, and summons were mostly issued in black and Hispanic majority communities.

Likewise in Ferguson, there {have been reports}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2”> of long-standing tensions between the largely white police force and the 67 percent black community. For instance, 86 percent of drivers pulled over by police were black and, when those stops ended in arrest, 92 percent of those arrested were black, according to {The Washington Post}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/the-breaking-point-for-ferguson/”>.

""We have people who have warrants because of traffic tickets and are effectively imprisoned in their homes,” Malik Ahmed, the CEO of Better Family Life, a St. Louis community development organization, {told The New Yorker}<hyperlink=”http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/saw-ferguson”>. ""They can’t go outside because they’ll be arrested. In some cases people actually have jobs but decide the threat of arrest makes it not worth trying to commute outside their neighborhood.”

Garner's Staten Island and Brown's Ferguson are very different places, but both share a lower-income, minority community that faces heavy punishments for minor offenses.

“Conceptually, to the extent broken windows is an enforcement strategy that is applied equally in every community throughout America, there is no constitutional problem,” Rep. Jeffries says. “But what we see in practice is that the broken windows strategy is largely deployed in black and Latino communities,that is why we’ve requested the Department of Justice to look into the manner in which the strategy has been applied.”

The Department of Justice​ is conducting a broad review of police tactics across the country, {USA Today reported}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/12/police-force-panel/13951033/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&dlvrit=206567”> Wednesday. The agency did not respond to U.S. News requests for comment as to whether this review would include broken windows policing​. However Holder has signaled that, at least in Ferguson, the priority is on cooling the long-boiling frustrations that predated Brown's death.

“Department officials from the Community Relations Service are also on the ground in Missouri to help convene law enforcement officials and civic and faith leaders to plot out steps to reduce tensions in the community,"" Holder said in a {press release}<hyperlink=”http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-eric-holder-latest-developments-ferguson-missouri”> Thursday. ""The latest such meeting was convened in Ferguson as recently as this morning. Over time, these conversations should consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities. All the while, the federal civil rights investigation into the shooting incident itself continues, in parallel with the local investigation into state law violations.""",NA,NA,"Critics say heavy-handed, racially biased tactics to blame for the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.",NA

Jay Nixon ordered the National Guard to Ferguson, where police and civilians have clashed following the August 9 killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old.

Citing “conditions of distress and hazard” to city residents and property, Nixon deployed troops early Monday morning. “Tonight, a day of hope, prayers, and peaceful protests was marred by the violent criminal acts of an organized and growing number of individuals, many from outside the community and state, whose actions are putting the residents and businesses of Ferguson at risk,” Nixon said in {a statement}<hypertext=”https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/following-coordinated-attacks-civilians-and-law-enforcement-governor-nixon-signs”>.

As violent protesters, armed with Molotov cocktails and bottles, moved toward the police command center Sunday night, officers launched tear gas canisters at the crowd. “Based on these conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response,” Johnson said.

Brown was shot six times during a confrontation with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9.

“The attorney general himself will be traveling to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with the FBI agents and [Department of Justice] personnel conducting the federal criminal investigation,” Obama said during a news conference. Obama is in Washington briefly from his two-week vacation on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. 

 “[Holder] will also be meeting with other leaders in the community whose support is so critical to bringing about peace and calm in Ferguson,” Obama said.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon deployed the National Guard in Ferguson after a weekend of protests turned violent. Despite hopes that the violence had dissipated last week after Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson assumed control of Ferguson’s security efforts from local authorities, tear gas and riot gear returned to the suburb’s streets as riots broke out.


“It’s clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting. What’s also clear is that a small minority of individuals is not,” Obama said. “While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police, only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos.”

Protests, both peaceful and violent, have erupted in Ferguson since Brown’s death. A brief period of calm last week was broken over the weekend, when at least two people were injured in shootings, according to {The Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-michael-brown-autopsy-20140818-story.html#page=1”>. Police were also reportedly fired upon.

Obama on Monday urged the Ferguson community to tone down violent protesting to allow justice to run its course. He called on citizens to “build, and not tear down,” to “listen, and not just shout,” and to “seek some understanding, rather than simply holler at each other.”

[tweetbegin 501465461008375808 tweetend] “We’ve got to make sure that we are able to distinguish between peaceful protesters who may have some legitimate grievances, and maybe long-standing grievances, and those who are using this tragic death as an excuse to engage in criminal behavior and tossing Molotov cocktails or looting stores,” Obama said. “They are damaging the cause. They are not advancing it.”

Bubbling racial tension has exacerbated the Ferguson situation. The 53-member Ferguson police force contains only three African-American officers, according to {CBS News}<hyperlink=”http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2014/08/13/ferguson-mayor-the-african-american-community-has-something-against-law-enforcement-in-many-ways/”>.

Obama on Monday addressed racial inequality in Ferguson and, more broadly, across the U.S. He said anyone those who commit crimes “need to be prosecuted, because every community has an interest in public safety.”

But he said there is a disproportionate number of African-American men brought before the country’s judicial system.

Obama said he thinks part of his job is “to get at those root causes.”

“We can argue about why that happens, because of the poverty they were born into, or the lack of opportunity, or the school systems that failed them, or what have you. But if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted,” Obama said. “Part of that process is also looking at our criminal justice system to make sure that it is upholding the basic principle of: ‘Everybody’s equal before the law.’”

“Where we can make progress in building up more confidence, more trust, making sure that our criminal justice system is acutely aware of the possibilities of disparities in treatment … All those things can make a difference,” he said.",NA,NA,The attorney general will visit area torn by racial tension.,NA

Walsh,08/19/2014,02/25/2016,"President Barack Obama is avoiding an emotional response and is taking an even-handed, low-key approach to the racial violence in Ferguson, Missouri.

""It's clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting,"" Obama said in his lengthiest comments on the tragedy to date. ""What's also clear is that a small minority of individuals is not. While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police, only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos."" He called on all sides to ""build and not tear down,"" to ""listen and not just shout,"" and to ""seek some understanding rather than simply holler at each other.""

The violence was triggered by the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, by white policeman Darren Wilson Aug. 9. Brown was shot six times, and much of the predominantly African-American community of Ferguson is angry that the policeman has not been charged with a crime. Obama is sending Attorney General Eric Holder to Ferguson later this week to help determine what happened and assess how the federal government should respond.

""There are young black men that commit crime,"" the president told reporters Monday. ""We can argue about why that happened--because [of] the poverty they were born into, or the school systems that failed them, or what have you--but if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted, because every community has an interest in public safety.""

The latest Pew Research Center poll finds that 65 percent of African-Americans say the police in Ferguson have gone too far in responding to the shooting, while whites are more divided. Thirty-three percent of whites say the police have gone too far; 32 percent say the police response has been about right, while 35 percent give no opinion. Seventy-six percent of blacks have little or no confidence in the official investigations into the shooting, while 52 percent of whites have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in the investigations, according to the poll.

A year ago, Obama was much more emotional when he reacted to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer, in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, in Florida. The president said at the time that most African-American men experienced racial profiling--and he was one of them. When Martin was killed in February 2012, Obama also had an emotional reaction, saying, ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon....When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.""

Obama has generally been reluctant to publicly discuss racial matters, even though black activists have urged him to speak out more forcefully about the racial discrimination that still exists in the United States. But Obama wants to be known as the president of all Americans, not just the first African American president, White House advisers say. Obama also made these points to me in an interview for my book, ""Family of Freedom: Presidents and African Americans in the White House.""

Capt. Ronald S. Johnson took over Ferguson security efforts Thursday. Riots involving nonlethal bullets, tear gas and smoke bombs have since subsided. But Ferguson residents want answers. They have called for details behind Michael Brown's fatal shooting on Aug. 9, and for the identity of the police officer involved.

USNews,usn21,http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/18/police-attorneys-michael-brown-head-wounds-not-fatal-to-officers-defense,Police Attorneys: Brown Head Wounds Not Fatal to Officer's Defense, Steven Nelson,08/18/2014,02/25/2016,"Following a week of angry street protests, forensic pathologists working with Michael Brown’s family released independent autopsy results on Monday that show Brown was shot at least six times by Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson.

Lawyers representing the unarmed 18-year-old’s family said at a press conference the results show Wilson unlawfully killed Brown on Aug. 9, and called for the officer’s arrest.

But defense attorneys who have represented police officers in other high-profile shootings of unarmed civilians say the latest findings don’t necessarily doom Wilson.

Pathologists said they found a bullet wound at the apex of the 6-foot-4 Brown’s head and what appeared to be a bullet entry above his right eye that continued downward into his jaw and then shoulder. The wounds appear to show Brown was not standing upright at the time he was shot.

“Just because he was shot somewhere near the top of his head, I don't think that’s indicative of anything at this point,"" says New Orleans attorney Eric Hessler, who defended officers involved in the 2005 post-Hurricane Katrina shooting deaths of two people on the Danziger Bridge and another person outside a convention center. 

""There are scenarios that I can envision where a police officer would be justified in using deadly force in that situation,"" Hessler says of the Brown case. “It depends on what the individual was doing while he was shot.""

Several officers were convicted of crimes in the post-Katrina cases, but the bridge shooting verdicts were vacated and the case is not resolved.

Attorney James Culleton, who defended New York City police officers who shot and killed unarmed black men Amadou Diallo in 1999 and Sean Bell in 2006, agrees with Hessler that the bullet trajectory isn’t necessarily game-changing.


“If the person is facing you, he’s charging at you, he could have put down his head,” Culleton says. “His head could have just slumped like he was falling forward. It doesn't mean it’s devastating [evidence].”

Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea, was shot at 41 times by four officers who believed his wallet was a gun. Officers fired 50 bullets at Bell when they thought they were in danger. The policemen were found innocent of murder in the Diallo case, and officers in the Bell case were acquitted of manslaughter and other charges.

“The officers reasonably believed in Diallo that he pulled out a gun and in the Sean Bell case that shots were being fired from inside the car,” Culleton says. “You have to believe that deadly force is being used or is about to be used against you.”

Accounts of events leading to Brown's death, which would either confirm or refute Wilson's legal authority to shoot, differ vastly.


Witness Dorian Johnson {says}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”> Brown was grabbed by the policeman, then fled and ultimately put his hands in the air to surrender before his death. Police, however, say Wilson was attacked while inside his squad car by Brown, who attempted to grab the officer’s gun before a second confrontation outside the car. A woman identifying herself as a friend of the officer {said}<hyperlink=”http://danaloeschradio.com/alleged-friend-of-officer-darren-wilson-offers-his-side/”> Brown then “bum-rushed” Wilson, according to the officer, before the fatal shots. 

“As I understand it there was a violent altercation in the car,” Hessler says. “I’m sure [Wilson] at least experienced some of this individual’s aggression and strength and those are some of the things he had to consider in the second encounter. And one of the things he couldn't consider is simply not engaging him. … If an individual is violently rushing you and you believe that individual if he encounters you can disarm you, you're going to have a problem.""

Bullets can be fired very quickly, Culleton says, meaning the number of shots fired at Brown may not be legally significant.

“We had 50 bullets being fired in the Sean Bell case and my client shot 31 times. He actually reloaded his gun. We showed through expert testimony that it took 10 seconds for that to happen,” he says. “When we’re talking five or six shots here, I’m sure that could have happened in a second and a half.”

Hessler, who worked 17 years as a city cop, says, ""It’s the officer that shoots once that I have initial suspicion about.""

Culleton and Hessler stress that there are many unknown facts, and that it's important to consider further evidence, witness statements and Wilson's account.

""We have numerous cases where police officers have shot unarmed persons and have been found to be completely justified based on the circumstances they believed existed at the time, and it’s the reasonableness of those beliefs that's ultimately going to come into question,"" Hessler says.

Culleton, whose clients were the subject of media firestorms and protests, says he hopes Ferguson residents will accept the ultimate legal outcome of the Brown case, should it go to trial.

“I would hope that once a jury speaks – or a judge if he's trying the case without a jury – that people accept the verdict because that's what our system’s all about,"" he says. ""I would certainly hope that there would be no more rioting or anything along those lines. “",NA,NA,"Bullet trajectory and the number of shots fired may not sink the officer who shot the teen, defense attorneys say.",NA

Police forces in Ferguson have kept details of Brown’s shooting under wraps, only on Friday revealing the name of the officer involved in the conflict, despite pleas from Brown's family and the public.

“In a situation like this, facts become very important. Evidence becomes very important. And it is so important that the facts in this case really get out,” attorney Daryl Parks, who is among Brown’s family’s legal team, said during a press conference Monday. “This case has suffered from a lack of transparency.”

A preliminary autopsy released Sunday, independent of one conducted by local authorities, indicates that at least one of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, according to {The New York Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html”>.

 “Why would he be shot at the very top of his head, a 6-foot-4 man? It makes no sense,” Parks said Monday. “We believe that, given those kinds of facts, this officer should have been arrested.”

Dr. Michael Baden, former New York City chief medical examiner, was hired by Brown’s family lawyer to conduct a private investigation. Baden said the bullet’s trajectory indicates that Brown’s head was bowed when he was shot. 

“It can be because he’s giving up, or because he’s charging forward at the officer,” Baden said of the bullet, according to the Times.

Brown was suspected of stealing a box of cigars from a convenience store at the time of his shooting, according to {The Associated Press}<hyperlink=”http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2014/08/15/turmoil-tear-gas-give-way-to-hope-in-ferguson”>. But Wilson was unaware of that when he first encountered Brown.

Authorities have said that a struggle ensued after Wilson and Brown crossed paths at 12:01 p.m. August 9, according to the AP. But Dorian Johnson, who was reportedly with Brown at the time of the shooting, has said that Brown had his hands raised in the air when he was fired upon. 

Baden said Monday that his preliminary investigation has not found any sign of a struggle between Brown and Wilson.

Brown's family has expressed distrust of how the local authorities have handled the shooting's investigation, after they delayed release of the officer's name and any information surrounding their own autopsy. When authorities did reveal Brown's shooter's name on Friday, they also revealed that Brown was suspected of stealing a box of cigars from a convenience store at the time at released store security footage of the incident. They later revealed Wilson was unaware of that when he first encountered Brown.

Assisting Baden’s investigation is Shawn Parcells, a pathologist assistant based in Kansas, according to {CBS News}<hyperlink=”http://www.cbsnews.com/news/preliminary-autopsy-shows-michael-brown-shot-six-times/”>. Parcells said Monday graze wounds on Brown’s arm indicate that he could have had his hands raised in a defensive posture.

Baden and Parcells found that four bullets entered Brown’s right arm. All had entered from the front and none was reportedly fired at “very close range,” according to the Times.

“People have been asking: ‘How many times was he shot?’ This information could have been released on Day One,” Baden said, according to the Times. “[Local authorities] don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.”

A third autopsy will be conducted by a federal medical examiner, Attorney General Eric Holder announced Sunday. A department spokesperson said the third examination is a result of “the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family,” according to the Times.

“The sheer number of bullets and the way they were scattered all over his body showed this police officer had a brazen disregard for the very people he was supposed to protect in that community,” said attorney Benjamin Crump, a member of the Brown family’s legal team, according to the Times. “We want to make sure people understand what this case is about: This case is about a police officer executing a young unarmed man in broad daylight.”

The Ferguson community has been incensed by the shooting and the mystery surrounding it. Looting, riots, fires and violence erupted in the St. Louis suburb as citizens lashed out at law enforcement. Their violence was met with riot gear, tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs.

Gov. Jay Nixon said the atmosphere was “a little bit more like a war zone” before placing Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson in charge of Ferguson’s security, according to {The Chicago Tribune }<hyperlink=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-missouri-police-shooting-20140813-story.html>.

Johnson initially managed to encourage peaceful protests during the first few days of his appointment.

Shinkman ,08/19/2014,02/25/2016,"President Barack Obama has had little time to celebrate the destruction of some of Syria's most deadly chemical weapons, as spikes in violence both at home and abroad drowned out what the administration has touted as a milestone achievement in regional peace.

A team of engineers and specialists aboard {the Cape Ray}<hyperlink=”http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/03/inside-the-ship-that-will-destroy-assads-chemical-weapons”>, a U.S. Maritime Administration industrial ship, completed their weekslong work of neutralizing roughly 600 tons of chemical weapons substances such as mustard gas and a precursor used to make sarin on Monday. The weapons had been on board since early July, following a drawn-out process in which the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad succumbed to international pressure, rounded up the weapons and shipped them to the Syrian coast through an active war zone.
The White House would likely have been able to spend more time touting the accomplishment if it hadn’t been for growing civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, and the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq – two issues that completely dominated a press conference the president held Monday afternoon.

“This is a major milestone in the international community’s efforts under the leadership of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to rid the Syrian regime of its chemical weapons,” Obama said in a statement late Monday. “It further advances our collective goal to ensure that the Assad regime cannot use its chemical arsenal against the Syrian people and sends a clear message that the use of these abhorrent weapons has consequences and will not be tolerated by the international community.”

Secretary of State John Kerry echoed Obama's sentiments, citing the mid-August 2013 chemical attack blamed on the Assad regime that, according to U.S. estimates, killed more than 1,000 Syrian civilians and kicked off an international initiative to eradicate the weapons.

“The images of children suffering at the hands of a monster’s illicit arsenal reminded all the world why these weapons have long been shunned by the civilized world and revealed for any who still doubted the true face of Assad,” Kerry said in a separate statement.

The OPCW and participating countries, however, must further address discrepancies and omissions related to Assad’s chemical stockpiles and the facilities where they are produced and housed, Kerry said. He cited concerning “reports of systematic use of chlorine gas in opposition areas” by the regime, per a fact-finding mission from the OPCW.

The U.S. will likely have to continue working with Assad despite assertions that he has lost legitimacy as a leader. Following three and a half years of fighting, Assad’s army and increasingly fractured opposition forces have reached a stalemate without any indication the autocrat plans to step down from power.

Obama considered removing Assad’s chemical weapons stores a critical issue last September, when he {called on Congress}<hyperlink=”https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/09/10/remarks-president-address-nation-syria”> to consider a military response if Assad didn’t comply with international pressure to remove the arsenal.

“If we fail to act, the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons,” he said at the time, adding that allowing such attacks could embolden terrorists and later endanger U.S. troops abroad.

“If fighting spills beyond Syria’s borders, these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan, and Israel,” Obama said. “And a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction, and embolden Assad’s ally, Iran, which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon, or to take a more peaceful path.”

However the details about the incident leading up to Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson, Missouri, remain murky – in part because of a refusal by local authorities to release information, including the name of the officer involved in the shooting.

 “It seems to me that the most important thing here is to let the facts come out as quickly as possible, sending a signal to the community that the investigation is proceeding and that the investigation will in fact be transparent,” says Cornell William Brooks, national president the NAACP. “I don’t believe, where the name will be known at some point, delaying that for any undue period of time helps the situation.”

Ferguson Police Department Chief Thomas Jackson backtracked on an earlier statement that he would release the name once he notified the officer, saying Tuesday the department no longer plans on publicly identifying the shooter.

“The value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family,” Jackson said, {according to The New York Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-police-cite-safety-risk-in-decision-not-to-name-officer-in-shooting.html?smid=tw-share”>, referring to threats made against the police on social media. Anti-police rhetoric has undergirded many of the protests following Brown’s death. Furthermore, the group of web hackers known as Anonymous have even threatened to hack into the police department website and make public private information about the officers and their families.

But activists argue that authorities’ reluctance to give more details about their investigations is making the situation worse, not better, as the uproar over Brown's death – a culmination of long-standing tensions between the largely white police force and the majority black Ferguson community – continues.

“The police department owes a duty of safety to the police officer, but there is a duty owed to the community in terms of the accountability,” Brooks, who has been on the ground in Ferguson, says. “It’s safe to say that people are unsatisfied with their response so far.”

The American public at large is split in their opinions of the shooting and its aftermath, {a survey released Monday by the Pew Research Center finds}<hyperlink=”http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/”>, with responses largely falling along racial lines.

Americans are in disagreement – 44 percent to 40 percent – as to whether the case raises important issues about race or if race is getting too much attention. When those responses were broken down by respondents' race, 80 percent of the African-Americans said race was an issue to be raised, while only 37 percent of whites felt this way. Meanwhile, 47 percent of whites surveyed said race is getting more attention than it deserves in light of the shooting.

Furthermore, when asked about the police response to the shooting – which {has featured the use of military tactics}<hyperlink=”http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-and-the-shocking-nature-of-us-police-militarization”> to face off with protesters, who have occasionally turned to looting or violence – 65 percent of blacks said the police in Ferguson have gone too far, compared to 33 percent whites.

Likewise, black respondents showed far less confidence in the police’s ability to investigate the shooting. More than three-fourths, or 76 percent, of African-Americans said they have not much or no confidence in the ongoing investigation. A majority of the whites surveyed, 52 percent, said they had a fair to great amount of confidence in the police’s investigation.

“Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground,” Obama said in a televised press conference around noon.

“Journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told,” Holder added in a statement.

On Wednesday, reporters from The Huffington Post and The Washington Post were arrested inside a McDonald’s restaurant while covering protests against the Saturday shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, by police in Ferguson, Missouri. They were released without charges.

Ironically, a large coalition of press freedom organizations gathered at about the same time as Obama’s statement for a preplanned National Press Club rally asking the Obama administration to drop its pursuit of Risen’s testimony about a confidential source.

Risen says he would rather go to jail than comply. The fight has dragged on for years, and in June the Supreme Court {declined}<hyperlink=”http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/06/02/james-risen-supreme-court-reporters-privilege-case”> to hear an appeal from Risen’s lawyers seeking a constitutional or common law reporter's privilege.

Obama’s request that police in Missouri not harass reporters “certainly is hypocritical,” vintage TV personality Phil Donahue, who appeared on a panel of Risen supporters, tells U.S. News.

 “It’s very bewildering,” Donahue says. “I just don’t get it, especially from a constitutional lawyer.”

Representatives of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, Reporters Without Borders, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, the Government Accountability Project and the Committee to Protect Journalists took turns asking Holder and Obama to back off Risen.

“The Democratic Party has given hope a bad name,” said RootsAction co-founder Norman Solomon, whose group delivered to the Department of Justice a pro-Risen petition with more than 125,000 signatures. “This is inherently a political case.”

Risen said he was grateful for the support and said Holder and Obama “turned this [case] into a showdown over the First Amendment.”

The award-winning New York Times reporter said the roughing up of journalists by Missouri cops was part of a larger post-9/11 struggle confronting reporters. “It’s all part of the same issue,” he said.

Federal prosecutors want Risen to testify at the trial of Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA employee who allegedly informed Risen about an embarrassingly mismanaged operation to supply Iran with flawed nuclear weapon designs. 

The CIA operation – detailed in Risen's 2006 book, ""State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration"" – fell apart when the Russian scientist hired to deliver the bomb blueprints noticed the flaws and tipped off the Iranians.

It’s unclear what the Department of Justice has in mind for Risen. Earlier this year, Holder and one of his deputies hinted they would not seek jail time, but they have not explicitly ruled out the option.",NA,NA,Press activists rally against the possible jailing of a Pulitzer Prize winner.,NA

The protests followed the shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, who was killed by a white police officer on Aug. 9.

The racial tensions in the community are bubbling up after years of misunderstanding and lack of respect between the community and the police. The Ferguson Police Department and the St. Louis County Department, the unit in charge of the investigation, both have a history of racial profiling (like many police units in the United States).

The police obtained the military-type equipment used on protesters through the {Department of Defense's 1033 Program}<hyperlink=”http://dps.mo.gov/dir/programs/cjle/dod.asp”>. The program provides surplus military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies. The equipment is often used in SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams. Originally meant to be used in hostage situations, terrorists attacks, active shooter situations and other extreme circumstances, the SWAT teams now use the equipment largely for ""no knock"" search warrants, often those concerning a small amount of drugs. Race appears to be a factor in the deployment of SWAT teams, according to a report from the {American Civil Liberties Union}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/”>.

For the report, the ACLU sent records requests to 260 law enforcement agencies for incident reports and all other records documenting the deployment of SWAT teams in 2011 and 2012. The researchers received 3,844 records in response to their requests for use in the report.

SWAT team deployment for hostage, barricade or active shooter situations only accounted for 7 percent of cases studied. The vast majority of cases, 79 percent, were for a search of someone's home, mostly for low-level drug investigations.


SWAT teams are often used to carry out the war on drugs, which {past research}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/files/FilesPDFs/ACF4F34.pdf”> has shown affects blacks more. Even though blacks and whites use marijuana at roughly the same rates, black Americans are four times more likely to be arrested on a possession charge than their white counterparts, according to {The New York Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/us/marijuana-arrests-four-times-as-likely-for-blacks.html?_r=0”>.

SWAT teams were more likely to be deployed on blacks and Latinos than on whites according to the report. Often, these SWAT encounters use excessive violence, knocking down doors with battering rams, throwing flashbang grenades and sometimes injuring the people inside, shooting their dogs or destroying property.

The deployments are supposed to be for ""high-risk"" situations, but there aren't comprehensive guidelines for what constitutes ""high-risk."" The ACLU found that both the danger and the search results are often overestimated by police before they bust down doors.",NA,NA,A report from the ACLU shows blacks come into contact with police militarization more than whites.,NA

In fact, Lt. David Tiefenbrunn of the St. Charles County Sheriff’s Department tells U.S. News members of his department actually rescued the crew from a dangerous situation.

Footage posted online Thursday shows reporters from Al Jazeera America on a dark street fleeing as a cloud of tear gas envelops their camera and lighting gear.

A tactical SWAT vehicle from the St. Charles County Sheriff’s Department is seen driving up to the crew's equipment after the reporters fled, with law enforcement officers then lowering cameras and lights.

The footage made headlines shortly after news that two reporters, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post, were arrested inside a McDonald’s restaurant and detained Wednesday while covering protests against the Saturday shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Lowery and Reilly were released without charges.

In a Thursday {statement}<hyperlink=”http://america.aljazeera.com/tools/pressreleases/statement.html”>, Al Jazeera America President Kate O’Brian called the tear gas incident an “egregious assault on freedom of the press that was clearly intended to have a chilling effect on our ability to cover this important story.”

“They were easily identifiable as a working television crew,” O’Brian said. “As they were setting up their camera for a live report, tear gas canisters landed in their proximity and police fired rubber bullets in their direction. Police continued to shoot after crew members clearly and repeatedly shouted ‘Press.'”

Tiefenbrunn, who spoke with members of the SWAT team that responded after the crew was gassed, says that’s not what happened.


“From my understanding, there was crowds in the area, approaching the area, and that's why the tear gas was deployed – to keep the area clear,” he says. “We were responding up that street because there was some bright lights that were being lit up on the officers and was causing them not to be able to see up the street to see if there was a disturbance going on.”

Tiefenbrunn says officers weren't aware the lights were from a TV crew when the gas was fired and calls descriptions of the incident being an attack on the press ""totally incorrect.""

The four members of the Al Jazeera crew were collected by members of his department, taken to their gear and then taken to safety, Tiefenbrunn says. “They took it as more of a rescue as opposed to what was portrayed on [TV], that we were actually firing tear gas at the media.""

The spokesman says his department didn't fire the tear gas and that he's not sure who did.

“I have no idea, there are so many agencies out there, with the noise and things that go on out there it’s hard to keep track of who’s firing what and where the orders are coming from,” he says. 

A statement provided to U.S. News by a member of the Al Jazeera America crew – via spokeswoman Jocelyn Austin – confirms uncertainty about who fired the tear gas and the warm feelings the crew felt for the responding SWAT team.

“There were multiple police departments involved in this whole incident,” the member of the crew said. “One of these departments, finding out our team’s predicament, came to our aid.”",NA,NA,"Al Jazeera America's boss was outraged, but a police spokesman says the crew 'took it as more of a rescue.'",NA
