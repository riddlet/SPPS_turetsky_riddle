Witnesses {told KMOV that unarmed 18-year-old}<hyperlink=”http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html”> Michael Brown had his hands in the air when he was shot several times by a Ferguson police officer. A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department, which is currently investigating the shooting, {confirmed to the AP}<hyperlink=”http://bigstory.ap.org/article/missouri-crowd-after-shooting-kill-police”> that a Ferguson police officer shot Brown, but did not give the reason for, or any other details surrounding, the shooting. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's, {told KMOV that he was}<hyperlink=”http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html”> with him at the time of the incident:

""He (the officer) shot again and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air. ... He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""

After the shooting, hundreds of Ferguson residents reportedly took to the street to protest. From {CNN}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/10/justice/missouri-police-involved-shooting/index.html”>:

At the peak of the spontaneous street protest, up to 1,000 people turned up, some very angry, [Police Chief Thomas] Jackson said.

""We had what probably bordered on riot conditions,"" he said.

Officers heard gunfire at the protests, and it took them hours to secure the scene for county homicide detectives to get evidence safely before removing Brown's body, according to Jackson.

The St. Louis County NAACP is launching their own investigation into the shooting, {according to CNN}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/10/justice/missouri-police-involved-shooting/index.html”>. Local chapter President Esther Haywood released a statement saying:

""We plan to do everything within our power to ensure that the Ferguson Police Department as well as the St. Louis County Police Department releases all details pertinent to the shooting. We strongly encourage residents to stay away from the crime scene so that no additional citizens are injured.""

Update 12:35 p.m.: Police Department Chief Jon Belmar {confirmed at a news conference}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/10/justice/missouri-police-involved-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t2”> that all shell casings collected at the scene were from the officer's gun, and that a medical examiner would determine how many times Brown was shot. He notes ""it was more than just a couple.""

Update 11:39 a.m.: {CNN reports}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/10/justice/missouri-police-involved-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t2”> that St. Louis County Police Department Chief Jon Belmar said that before being fatally shot, Brown ""pushed a police officer back into the car, where he physically assaulted the police officer"" and attempted to take his weapon.

Anonymous Operation Ferguson - Press Release

Sunday - August 10, 2014 1:30 PM CST USA

A little over 24 hours ago in Ferguson, Missouri - USA the Ferguson Police Department shot an un-armed teen 6 times and killed him. His body was left to lie in a pool of blood in the sweltering heat for hours while the police militarized the area against protesters and attempted to concoct a reasonable story as to why they snatched this innocent students life for no reason. The St. Louis County Sheriff Department even sealed the roads leading to Ferguson in a vain attempt to prevent protesters from reaching the city. His name was Mike Brown, he was 17 - and he would have started college next week. Instead, his family is struggling to come up with funeral costs.

The entire global collective of Anonymous is outraged at this cold blooded murder of a young teen. Not a week goes by that some young person, usually of minority ethnicity - is slaughtered by murderous police in the USA. For this reason Anonymous will not be satisfied this time, as we have in the past - with simply obtaining justice for this young man and his family. Anonymous demands that the Congressional Representatives and Senators from Missouri introduce legislation entitled ""Mike Brown's Law"" that will set strict national standards for police conduct in the USA. We further demand that this new law include specific language to grant the victims of police violence the same rights and prerogatives that are already enjoyed nationwide by the victims of other violent criminals. The Equal Protection clause of the US Constitution demands nothing less.

To the good people of Ferguson, take heart - and take your streets. You are not alone, we will support you in every way possible. Occupy every square inch of your city. Open your homes and help in any way you can the protesters who will come to your city from every part of Missouri and the USA. Businesses and householders that are near protest rallies, open your WiFi routers so that live streamers and other independent journalists can use the Internet connections. Feed each other, keep each other safe - and stay in the streets until we are totally victorious in all our demands.

To the Ferguson Police Department and any other jurisdictions who are deployed to the protests: we are watching you very closely. If you abuse, harass - or harm in any way the protesters in Ferguson we will take every web based asset of your departments and governments off line. That is not a threat, it is a promise. If you attack the protesters, we will attack every server and computer you have. We will dox and release the personal information on every single member of the Ferguson Police Department, as well as any other jurisdiction that participates in the abuse. We will seize all your databases and E-Mail spools and dump them on the Internet. This is your only warning.

The time has come for more than simple justice for these atrocities. The time has come to draw a line in the sand and say ""no more dead kids"", no more police killings and beatings. Anonymous is drawing a line in the sand, and that line runs right down the middle of Main Street Ferguson, Missouri. Police impunity ends with the barbaric death of Mike Brown.

We Are Anonymous - We Are Legion - We Will Not Forgive - We Will Not Forget

EXPECT JUSTICE - DEMAND CHANGE

Details of Saturday's shooting remain disputed: Brown was walking home from a convenience store with a friend when they were allegedly ordered to stop by the officer. Dorian Johnson, who claims to have been with Brown at the time of the shooting, contends that when the two kept walking, the officer drew his weapon.

""He (the officer) shot again and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air,"" Johnson {told KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html"">.

The {New York Times, citing police, reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/us/looting-and-unrest-follows-vigil-for-st-louis-teenager.html?_r=0""> that the officer who engaged Brown and Johnson was ""physically assaulted"" before he fired, with an alleged struggle for the officer's gun ensuing.

The St. Louis County Police Department, {USA Today reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/11/st-louis-teen-police-shooting/13884695/"">, has yet to comment on Johnson's version of events, but have announced their own narrative:

But on Sunday, Chief Jon Belmar said the incident started when a Ferguson officer encountered Brown and another male on the street near an apartment complex. One male pushed the officer into his police vehicle, Belmar said.

The men had a struggle inside the car, Belmar said, and at some point a man — it was unclear whether it was Brown — reached for the officer's weapon. One shot was fired inside the vehicle.

The fight moved outside the squad car and Brown suffered fatal gunshot wounds about 35 feet from the vehicle, Belmar said. The second person has not been arrested, and police are not sure whether he was armed.

""I understand that the public has a right to be skeptical, and I appreciate that and I would expect that the public be skeptical oftentimes of government or some forms of it,"" Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police said at press conference today.

""I saw the barrel of the gun pointed at my friend,"" Johnson, 22, said. ""Then I saw the fire come out of the barrel.""

Johnson {told MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> that he had spotted Brown walking home and joined him, about 20 minutes before a police car drove up and the shooting began. Here's how he claims the incident started:

The officer demanded that the two ""get the f—k on the sidewalk,"" Johnson says. ""His exact words were get the f—k on the sidewalk.""

After telling the officer that they were almost at their destination, Johnson's house, the two continued walking. But as they did, Johnson says the officer slammed his brakes and threw his truck in reverse, nearly hitting them.

Now, in line with the officer's driver's side door, they could see the officer's face. They heard him say something to the effect of, ""what'd you say?"" At the same time, Johnson says the officer attempted to thrust his door open but the door slammed into Brown and bounced closed. Johnson says the officer, with his left hand, grabbed Brown by the neck.

The whole time, Johnson told MSNBC, he was within arm's reach of Brown and the officer.

“They’re not wrestling so much as his arm went from his throat to now clenched on his shirt,” Johnson said. “It’s like tug of war. He’s trying to pull him in. He’s pulling away, that’s when I heard, ‘I’m gonna shoot you.’”

After the officer allegedly fired the first shot, hitting Brown, the two started running. Johnson said he ducked behind a car. He says Brown continued running, telling him, ""Keep running, bro!"" That's when Johnson says Brown was shot by the officer again.

“I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!” Johnson recalled Brown saying with his hands in the air. Johnson said the officer then fired several more shots.

St. Louis County Police Department's account of the shooting has been murky, only going so far to claim Brown assaulted the officer before the shooting took place and that an investigation is ongoing. The department has also {reneged on its plan}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/Lussenpop/status/499190392261066754""> to release the officer's name today.

Freeman Bosley, Johnson's attorney and a former mayor of St. Louis, told MSNBC that police refuse to hear Johnson's testimony.

“They don’t want the facts,"" Bosley said. ""What they want is to justify what happened..what they are trying to do now is justify what happened instead of trying to point out the wrong. Something is wrong here and that’s what it is.”

But a specific Anonymous threat against county Police Chief Jon Belmar this afternoon backfired in a big way.

Amid street unrest and massive police action in Ferguson today, Anonymous' #OpFerguson campaign took a serious turn when the hacktivists addressed the police department's reluctance to swiftly identify the specific police officer who had shot Brown, 18, repeatedly as he held his arms up in the middle of a Ferguson street.

Media outlets, activists, and the Brown family's attorneys immediately called foul on the police department for not identifying that shooter, who could face civil or criminal action for his role in Brown's death. In solidarity, one Anonymous account made a specific threat tied to the release of that information:

Jon Belmar, if you dont release the officer's name, we're releasing your daughter's info. You have one hour. {#Ferguson}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ferguson?src=hash"">

Ford was unarmed, and a man who identified himself as a witness {told local news outlet KTLA}<hyperlink=""http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/""> that cops shot Ford multiple times in the back while he laid down on the sidewalk.

According to the same man, who told KTLA he was Ford's cousin but did not give his name, Ford had ""mental complications"" that local police officers should have known about:

""They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division, knows that — that this child has mental problems,"" the man said.

""The excessive force … there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in the back while he's laying down? No. Then when the mom comes, they don't try to console her … they pull the billy clubs out.""

The LAPD's story sharply differs. According to the department, officers ""conducted an investigative stop,"" after which a ""struggle ensued."" KTLA reports that the department is investigating to find whether the officer's weapon may have been involved in the alleged struggle. The officer involved was reportedly placed on paid leave.

Tritobia Ford, Ezell's mother, said she was pushed to the ground and denied information about her son's hospitalization when she arrived at the scene, the latter of which claims the LAPD also disputes.

The news comes just days after the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager who was {shot and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/eyewitness-michael-brown-pleaded-i-don-t-have-a-gun-1620094720""> last week.

Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, called for LAPD Chief Charlie Beck to meet with community leaders. From KTLA:

""The killing of Ezell Ford — coming on the heels of the Michael Brown killing in Ferguson, Missouri — again raises the issue and problem of tense police-community relations,"" Hutchinson said in a statement. ""This is the sole reason we have called for a meeting … to get all the facts in the shooting and for assurances that the shooting will be subject to the most rigorous review to determine if there was any wrongdoing in Ford's death.""",481,28500,NA,NA

We disagree. We believe Brown's family, and the public at large, have the right to know the name of the man who killed their son. For this reason, we're asking readers who know the identity of the officer to share it with us, either below this post or {over email}<hyperlink=""mailto:jason.parham@gawker.com"">. If we can confirm a name, we will publish it ourselves. We are looking for legitimate information and tips, not jokes or false names.

We want to publish the officer's name because we believe that transparency is the price of power, and that trust is earned and not demanded. The people of Ferguson have been asked to trust the chief's decision not to release the officer's name, but why should they? The Ferguson police department has not earned the trust of the citizens in whose name it operates and with whose power it is invested. Mike Brown was asked to trust the police, and he was utterly failed. For trust to exist—for it to be built—there must be absolute accountability. Every bullet must be explicable; every life must be answerable.

The name of one officer has already circulated on social media, over the protestations of Ferguson police. If this is the wrong name, the solution is to provide the right one—not to put down a visor, hold up a shield, and retreat further into silence and concealment.

Forget that Michael Brown should have begun coursework at Vatterott College this week. Forget that he was known for his kind heart and gentle spirit—Big Mike, they called him. Forget that he was unarmed and pleaded, hands above his head, for the officer not to shoot him. Forget that his body lay in the street surrounded by police for hours, as family and community members stood helpless. Forget that we have been here before. That we have mourned and fought and cried our eyes red for our very humanity. Forget, too, that we will be here again. Forget all of this. A teenager is dead—gunned down in broad daylight by a man employed to protect him. That alone should be enough.

""There is power in naming racism for what it is,"" Jesmyn Ward wrote in the {New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/a-cold-current/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0"">, power in ""shining a bright light, brighter than any torch or flashlight. A thing as simple as naming it allows us to root it out of the darkness and hushed conversation where it likes to breed like roaches. It makes us acknowledge it. Confront it. And in confronting it, we rob it of some of its dark pull. Its senseless, cold drag. When we speak, we assert our human dignity. That is the worth of a word.""

The Ferguson police department, clad in armor and rolling in military vehicles, is terrified of the people it serves. Gunning down an unarmed, fleeing teen, and then hiding the name of the triggerman, are the acts of an institution that is afraid. Its cops believe they are victims; that Michael Brown's death is an incident that happened to them. They have made it clear that the officer who killed him is one of them, a representative of how the department acts in the world.

Gawker,gawk12,http://gawker.com/elegies-for-mercy-michael-brown-and-ferguson-mo-1620457694,Elegies for Mercy: Michael Brown and Ferguson ,Josie Duffy ,08/13/14,02/22/16,"Were the ground not saturated with city, St. Louis would be pseudo-prairie—no dry season but chock-full of grasslands. Rivers run wily underground, so mosquitoes seem to sprout from the earth just to greet you. High noon in August is a stagnant heat, the kind that weighs heavy on your shoulders. A thousand miles from either ocean makes the Midwest relentless like that. The breeze trickles in lazily, if at all.

Without wind gunshots echo louder. He puts his hands up after the first one, but they keep coming.

Imagine this. You are eighteen and tomorrow you are going to college. You are attempting, perhaps reluctantly, to piece together some haphazard picture of a grown-up life. You have family scattered throughout your town, you have friends and a grandmother whom you are going to visit, your new school is nearby. And who knows exactly what you are going to do, but already you've made the kind of choices that tell us something. You like home. You know the importance of living securely, of having a trade. You might not be a household name, and that's just fine.

It is not enough that you are a teenager. Their bullets don't care how young you are, and if you happen to be a boy, they will call you a man anyway.

It's not enough not to be arrogant. This was not a strategic precautionary measure. It is not enough to be unassuming, to walk humbly and with God, to stay out of people's way. You don't have to be Che or Lumumba to be shot and killed in the middle of the road on a summer afternoon.

It is not enough that you are afraid.

These are pieces of the stories they tell: altercation, clenched fists, the deceased lunged for my weapon, physical assault, resisting, aggressive. In Ferguson the police chief wipes his forehead, says things like, ""assaulted a police officer,"" ""struggled over the officer's gun."" As if—completely unprovoked—an unarmed teenager, outnumbered by officers, tried to steal a gun in a cop car. And as if that justifies murder.

To dehumanize a person, all you have to do is to paint him as incapable of fear. Even the strongest humans are afraid sometimes—it's an innate instinct, can be controlled but never defeated. Even superheroes, the ultimate pillars of bravery, are willing to act despite their apprehension. Only monsters are truly incapable of being afraid.

They're saying, ""We were scared of your son because your son was not scared of us.""

But this is not the truth. A boy just headed to his grandmother's house, a kid who had never even been in a fight. In those few minutes before his petrified heart slowed down and gave out completely, it must have pounded loud with terror.

The other stuff is irrelevant. Your capacity for violence, or lack thereof. Your history of drug abuse or lack thereof. Your absent father or the one sitting at home on your couch waiting for you to walk through the door. The rap music drifting out of your headphones as you walk down the street. The college degree that may or may not be hanging on the wall in your mother's home. The time of day, the season. Your hoodie. None of it really matters.

When someone is shot in the movies there's string music and the scene slows down. But here everything happens fast, and, other than the bullets, there's a strange silence.

Hands in the air—can you see his hands? Shaking? He has one bullet already in his body. His shirt already pooling with blood. Mike Brown, eighteen, falls to his knees.

Here he is. Kneeling. Hands up. More bullets greet him.

If they want you, they will get you. It is not enough to surrender. This is not that kind of war.

Elegies for boys who never thought they'd be household names. Who valued the simple dignity of a humble existence. Elegies for the unarmed. For men whose last moments were filled with panic, desperation, for boys who cried out for their mother. A child starts running in fear in Sanford; a man crying ""I can't breathe!"" on the sidewalk pavement in Queens; shot in the back while handcuffed and kneeling in an Oakland subway station—""I have a four year old daughter"" were his last words. Plainclothed and shot by two of his own in Harlem; seventy-years-old and shot in his kitchen by an officer who calls him a nigger; shot in San Clemente, his daughters watching from the car window; soaking wet, begging for help in North Carolina and shot ten times; shot in Wal-Mart for holding a toy gun; shot, cornered and unarmed, in his Bronx apartment bathroom; shot in Ferguson Missouri, from thirty-five feet away, the August sun on his face, fear lodged under his sternum, his hands in the air.

I imagine he wasn't thinking about Trayvon, Eric Garner, Oscar Grant, Omar Edwards, Kenneth Chamberlain, Darius Simmons, Manuel Loggins, Jonathan Ferrell, John Crawford, Ramarley Graham. I imagine he was thinking just one thing over and over—""Please. Please. Please.""

Elegies for boys who wanted mercy.

But it is too late for mercy. Mike Brown is dead now. His body went cold all alone out there in the road, and the sun turned noon into evening.

We want justice. I want only the guttural sense of unfairness that you reserve for the worst things. I want to hold his hand as he lies in the street. I want to tell him: Listen. You didn't fight, but we will. We will fight. They will know your name. I promise.

Both were eventually released without being charged.

According to reports, Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post reporter Ryan J. Reilly were both arrested, handcuffed and booked. Once word of their arrests began circulating on social media, they were immediately released.

Lowery and Reilly were both apparently working from a Ferguson McDonalds when a SWAT team entered the restaurant. After posting initial tweets about the encounter, both reporters went offline just before 5 pm.

Lowery, who says he was slammed into a fountain soda machine during his arrest, wrote on Twitter that he was ""Detained, booked, given answers to no questions. Then just let out...

When Pearce questioned the directive, one officer apparently told him that if they called 911, no one would answer.

The officers later told Lowery and Pearce that they'd have to stop filming and leave the McDonalds. Lowery says he was given conflicting instructions and when he stopped to adjust his bag, they arrested him.

Multiple officers grabbed me. I tried to turn my back to them to assist them in arresting me. I dropped the things from my hands.

""My hands are behind my back,"" I said. ""I'm not resisting. I'm not resisting."" At which point one officer said: ""You're resisting. Stop resisting.""

That was when I was most afraid — more afraid than of the tear gas and rubber bullets.

As they took me into custody, the officers slammed me into a soda machine, at one point setting off the Coke dispenser. They put plastic cuffs on me, then they led me out the door.

Lowery and Pearce were then loaded into a police van, where Lowery says a large man with breathing problems pleaded for a medic to no avail.

The reporters were then transported to a local police station, processed, and jailed. When they asked for the cause of their arrest, a cop reportedly told them they were trespassing in the McDonalds.",823,133400,NA,NA

They chanted, ""Hands up, don't shoot"" as they marched through the predominantly black city.

Late Wednesday and in the early morning hours of Thursday, Ferguson police—clad in armor and armed with rifles—fired tear gas, stun grenades, smoke bombs, and rubber bullets on these protesters and news teams on the scene.

Lowery and Reilly were arrested for not leaving a McDonald's ""fast enough"" yesterday. Scarborough says: That seems fair. He explains:

There is a lot of unanswered questions here, but I do know this. When a police officer asks you to pick up—I've been in places where police officers said, ""All right, you know what? This is cordoned off, you guys need to move along."" You know what I do? I go, ""Yes, sir,"" or ""Yes, ma'am."" I don't sit there and have a debate and film the police officer, unless I want to get on TV and have people talk about me the next day.

Hmm. Here's {Lowery's account}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/tear-gas-grenades-and-arrests-on-fourth-night-of-unre-1621469863""> of his arrest:

Multiple officers grabbed me. I tried to turn my back to them to assist them in arresting me. I dropped the things from my hands.

""My hands are behind my back,"" I said. ""I'm not resisting. I'm not resisting."" At which point one officer said: ""You're resisting. Stop resisting.""

Lowery rightfully unloaded on Scarborough on CNN in response, inviting him to ""come down to Ferguson and get out of 30 Rock where he's sitting and sipping his Starbucks smugly."" {He continued}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/joe-scarborough-reporters-arrested-ferguson"">, ""I invite him to come and talk to the residents of Ferguson, where I've been since Monday afternoon having tear gas shot at me, having rubber bullets shot at me ... I would invite Joe Scarborough down here to do some reporting on the ground, then maybe we can have an educated conversation about what's happening here.""

Scarborough at least has an idea of what's going on. ""I know it's bad out there,"" he helpfully offered later in the morning's segment.",294,20600,NA,NA

Let's investigate:

The story goes, Michael Brown was doing hood rat shit with his friends, walking down the middle of the street. The officers warned him to get on the sidewalk, Michael refused. Here is where the story gets bizarre, he was shot 25 or 35 (I forget) feet away from the Officer, yet the Officer claimed there was a struggle for his gun. Not sure if this is like the JFK magic bullet theory or even really what happened. The only people who knows are shot or a cop.

Yes. Yes, it is.

Rogers goes on to take ""looters"" to task for mourning improperly. He notes, ""You cannot find Jordans, rims, weaves or Quick Trips in Ferguson, MO."" Never does he mention which rap video Ferguson reminds him of, because that would require an actual engagement with black art and not stereotypical notions in his head. ({Rogers previously expressed that he is not much impressed with Kanye West}<hyperlink=""http://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/08/mark-twain-is-the-kanye-west-of-literature-annoying-and-overrated/"">.)

Rogers writes, ""Not 100% certain what any of this solved or how it was useful."" That sounds like meta-commentary on his own work, but it is not.

Previously this week, Thought Catalog ran an essay by Gavin McInnes called ""Transphobia Is Perfectly Natural."" I'll save you the trouble of looking it up: It's bigoted trolling.

At the same time that the Ferguson Police Department was {terrorizing its own citizens last night}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/here-is-an-archived-live-stream-of-cops-and-protesters-1621336140"">, something interesting and important happened on cable news: Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson reiterated to Sean Hannity that Michael Brown struggled with his killer inside the cop's vehicle, while at the same time two new eyewitnesses told CNN that they saw no such thing.

The above video juxtaposes the crucial moments of each interview, which aired on Fox News and CNN, respectively, within roughly 20 minutes of each other late Wednesday night.

First, Hannity—who, to his credit, grilled the Ferguson police chief over the course of a five minute interview—asked Jackson if he knew ""for a fact"" that the purported ""struggle"" between Brown and the policeman who killed him resulted in a shot being fired inside the cop's vehicle. Jackson's response was ""It was, yes."" Here is a transcript of that moment:

Hannity: You said, in fact, the officer was injured, had a facial wound of some kind, and that, in fact, a struggle ensued over the officer's weapon, and a shot was actually fired inside the car. Why is there such a dramatically different story being told here?

Jackson: Well Sean, unfortunately we're going to have to wait until all the witnesses have been interviewed and all the forensic evidence has been examined before we're going to have a real, true picture of what happened that day.

Hannity: It... well, either a shot was fired inside the police officer's car, or it was not. Do we know for a fact, do you know for a fact—

Jackson: It was, yes.

Hannity: That is a fact, then. So, there was a struggle for the gun—

Jackson: That is a fact.

About 20 minutes later, Tiffany Mitchell and Piaget Crenshaw, two new witnesses to Brown's murder, were interviewed on CNN by Don Lemon and Aliysn Camerota. Lemon and Camerota carefully asked Mitchell and Crenshaw if they saw Brown struggle with the officer inside the car, as Jackson claimed. They responded with affirmative denials.

Camerota: Did you ever see a moment where Michael was in the police car?

Crenshaw: No, ma'am.

Don Lemon: Because that's what police are saying, that they were in the police car and there was a tussle... inside the police car. And at no time—and I know that you weren't there from the very beginning, Piaget or Tiffany—but at no time did you see Michael Brown in the car?

Both: No, not at all.

The assertion by Crenshaw and Mitchell that they witnessed no struggle between Brown and his killer inside the cop's vehicle {echoes the initial statement given by Dorian Johnson}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri"">, the only other witness to speak to the press, who was with Brown from the moment the cop first pulled up until he was murdered. This detail has remained in dispute from the beginning, but last night—as his police force launched tear gas at Ferguson's citizens and arrested journalists—Jackson doubled-down on his side of the story at nearly the exact time that a second and third eyewitness refuted it on national television.

You can see the narratives calcifying here, regardless of what the investigation, now being handled by the St. Louis Police Department, reveals. Ferguson's police will maintain that a round went off in the cop's car because Brown reached for the man's weapon, and thus his death was justified. Multiple witnesses will have faced America and said that, no, the first round went off because the officer had pinned Brown to his car and attempted to shoot him then.

At some point, some people somewhere—a police department or a district attorney's office or a jury—will decide who was right, and if we know one truth here it's that history is not on the side of the witnesses.",710,74400,NA,NA

As far as the violence happening on the streets of Ferguson right now, Obama refused to pick sides. ""There's no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests,"" he offered. Police should ""not be bullying or arresting journalists just trying to do their jobs."" But also, ""There is never an excuse for violence against police"" or ""looting"" in the wake of tragedy.

Like most tropes, it holds a grain of truth, but it's off-base in one critical respect: The U.S. armed forces exercise more discipline and compassion than these cops.

Multiple law enforcement agencies have flooded Ferguson with SWAT teams and emergency services units. {Armored vehicles with small-arms mounts}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/your-local-cops-are-probably-out-buying-ex-iraq-death-t-1471309402""> are ubiquitous, as are rubber and wooden bullets. Tear gas and smoke canisters have been popped in quantities that would evoke jealousy in a Marine colonel girding his unit for practice maneuvers on a North Carolina beach. There are enough AR-15s in the St. Louis suburbs this week to arm a Contra army.

Some of the police vehicles in Ferguson even carry LRADs—multidirectional transmitters meant to debilitate a target with a blast of sound. As a lowly midshipman on summer training, I saw them being tested at Marine Corps Base Quantico, along with other experimental field gadgets. I never imagined I'd see them on a street in the United States. I am not alone:

[tweetbegin 499739976708657152 tweetend]

Police are clad not merely in traditional riot gear, but in more tactical gadgetry and armor than an invading infantry captain:

[tweetbegin 499728733830676480 tweetend]

So there's a fair basis for the trope. Radley Balko—a Washington Post reporter with whom I have serious disagreements on many other issues—recently {wrote a gripping and definitive book on cops playing army}<hyperlink=""http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323848804578608040780519904"">, and {Glenn Greenwald's analysis today}<hyperlink=""https://theintercept.com/2014/08/14/militarization-u-s-police-dragged-light-horrors-ferguson/""> is especially poignant.

How, then can anyone say that the police in St. Louis County, and all over America, are not militarized? Because the cops aren't acting like soldiers. They're acting like extras in a Michael Bay movie playing soldiers.

How, then can anyone say that the police in St. Louis County, and all over America, are not militarized? Because the cops aren't acting like soldiers. They're acting like extras in a Michael Bay movie playing soldiers.

Despite their expensive costuming, the police in Ferguson are putting on an unsophisticated, unscripted performance, a copy without an original. If these cops were to take a page out of {the Army's book on crowd control}<hyperlink=""http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/atp3_39x33.pdf"">, it would be an improvement. But they seem to be making up tactics to go with the gear they've acquired.

It goes without saying that the American military is not benign or without defect. Its primary job—and the orientation of its training and equipping—is to defeat violent threats with superior firepower and maneuver. It an inherently violent mission. The military is an inherently violent institution.

But U.S. military development of nonlethal weaponry and crowd-control tactics has happened haltingly over the last half-century, and new doctrine has come with it. Here are several salient passages that literally come from {the first page of the Army's field manual on civil disturbances}<hyperlink=""http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/atp3_39x33.pdf"">:

During unified action, U.S. forces should never violate basic civil or human rights. Most protesters are law-abiding citizens who intend to keep their protests nonviolent, but some protest planners insist that the event involve violence. Often in the media, protesters can gain sympathy for their cause by prompting authorities to take physical action against them...

Inciting a crowd to violence or a greater intensity of violence by using severe enforcement tactics must be avoided...

Community unrest results in urban conflicts that arise from highly emotional social and economic issues. Economically deprived residents may feel that they are treated unjustly or ignored by people in power and authority. Tensions can build quickly in a community over a variety of issues, such as hunger, poor employment opportunities, inadequate community services, poor housing, and labor issues. Tensions in these areas create the potential for violence. When tensions are high, it takes a small (seemingly minor) incident, rumor, or perceived act of injustice to ignite groups within a crowd to riot and act violently. This is particularly true if community relations with authorities are strained.

Lest you think nobody really goes by that book, check out {this collection of tweets from military veterans}<hyperlink=""https://storify.com/AthertonKD/veterans-on-ferguson""> reflecting on the events in Ferguson. At least these vets understand, from their training and experience, that crowd control is not for winning hearts and minds—it's for acknowledging you've lost them. That it's not enough to just show restraint—you must also show that you're showing restraint. That even if you care about nothing else, you should care about optics.

For all that, the military still has plenty of ethical disasters, its My Lais and Hadithas. But it also has clearer lines of accountability in place for when such things happen. Who's responsible for each granular part of an operation, who's in command, what the overall objective is, where complaints go, even who pays when soldiers fuck up: All of these aspects are considered and concisely drawn for each arm of the organization.

Above all, the military has learned that even its best planning and organization can't win a war for hearts and minds. Iraq and Afghanistan have proven that.

But {imagine if the military didn't even try to perform these tasks well}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html"">. Imagine if there was no clear command and control. If a force's response to the involvement of one of its own in the {shooting death of a civilian}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/5894188/staff-sgt-robert-bales-identified-as-shooter-in-afghanistan-rampage""> was to say nothing and to lock down on the entire community. If members of that force didn't feel the need to identify themselves to the populace they aim to govern. If they mocked the populace and arrested civilians without charges as a mere matter of course, with no fear of punishment from their superiors. You begin to get a picture of how badly the police in Missouri are failing.

It's not that the police could simply do better with all this military gear if they were given more training on it or had improved protocols. Practically and ethically, the police just don't need this equipment. It is not conducive to protecting and serving a civilian population that enjoys freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.

In the military, these weapons and vehicles exist on the lower end of a spectrum of force. Getting hit by an LRAD or being water-hosed is preferable to seeing the business end of a .50-caliber belt-fed machine gun or an M203 grenade launcher. But in police departments, this gear is on the upper end of the force spectrum. It's a far, far cry from community policing.

So how did we get here? It's partly due to the easy availability of {surplus armed forces gear}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/as-wars-wind-down--small-town-cops-inherit-armored-vehicles-233505138.html"">. We have a plump security industrial complex and a demobilizing military. Politicians have tight asses and {loose budgets}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter""> post-9/11. Law enforcement leaders want {""cool tools,""}<hyperlink=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a1077/paramilitary-police-force-ferguson/?click=main_sr""> and they want to use them.

But none of those material factors actually account for cops' proven willingness to use this gear on American citizens. That comes only with a citadel mentality, what I call Fortress America: a belief that ""we"" are under siege from ""them."" It comes from a society that establishes poverty and privation as a matter of course for some citizens, then criminalizes those citizens, then dehumanizes the criminal class. Only after we have constructed someone as an internal enemy does it then make sense to target him thus:

[tweetbegin 499757333212573696 tweetend]

And to justify the spectacle as law and order.

[tweetbegin 499763618146050049 tweetend]

So no, it's not fair to the military to say America's constabulary has been militarized. But there's no question a lot of Americans—cops and civilians—are digging deep foxholes. Until we tackle that mentality, and take away the toys that enhance it, ""cops and robbers"" will continue to look like Full Metal Jacket.",570,78900,NA,NA

Police Chief Thomas Jackson addressed the days of violent protests that have roiled in the city and escalated Wednesday evening, when police officers reportedly fired tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters and journalists. ""What's happening now is not what any of us want,"" Jackson said. ""We need to get everyone to calm down, bring some peace to this.""

Jackson said that he has spoken with leaders from the local NAACP chapter and from the Justice Department on how to move forward with future protests.

""We want everybody to be able to protest, we know they're going to protest, we want to facilitate their ability to protest—because it's a constitutional right—so we're working with these leaders to try and put this together,"" he said. 

When asked about officers' militarized approach to policing protesters, Jackson told reporters, ""There is gunfire, there is firebombs being thrown at the police. I understand that what it looks like—is not good."" He went on, saying, ""The whole situation is not good at this point. That's why there's several meetings going on right now to evaluate tactics, how we approach this.""

Jackson called on protesters to ""stop the violence"" and that police ""don't want to have any violence"" on their part. ""We want this to be peaceful,"" he said.

""It's going to be a long process,"" Jackson said. ""We need to have everybody to tone it down.""

Reports from Wednesday night's protest have said that police initiated violence with some protesters. Jackson did not directly respond to a reporter's request for an explanation or a rebuttal.

""We have a basic obligation to allow people to get to their homes and businesses and to drive up and down the roadways,"" he said.

And despite multiple reports from the scene last night, Jackson seemingly denied that any of the protesters (or journalists) were harmed. ""We can only have a part of town be closed down for so long before we have to open it back up, without physically hurting anybody. And that's why we're using these less lethal tactics,"" he said.

But after being asked whether he felt satisfied with the police response to protests, he attempted to walk back his answers.

""What I'm satisfied with is that we haven't hurt anybody—nobody's got injured or killed. One police officer did get hit with a brick and actually broke his ankle and one other officer was injured,"" Jackson said. ""But in general, I mean, with the chaos that's going on right now, I'm at least happy nobody's gotten seriously injured.""

Reilly {were arrested by police last night}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html"">; an Al Jazeera crew was hit with a tear gas can and rubber bullets in an area away from protesters.

""Why is the media becoming a target?"" one reporter asked.

""The media's not a target,"" Jackson answered.

Jackson closed the press conference by describing the situation in Ferguson as ""a powderkeg,"" saying, ""That's why we're going to try to facilitate the protest tonight and we hope that the protesters will recognize that we are trying to facilitate, to help everybody bring this down—bring all the tensions down.""

""When a police officer comes to the decision that it's time to arrest someone, that individual is obligated to submit to arrest,"" de Blasio {said at an event marking the expansion of an anti-gun initiative}<hyperlink=""http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/mayor_bill_de_blasio_suspects.html"">. ""They will then have every opportunity for due process in our court system.""

The mayor, the New York Post notes, was commenting on a remark police commissioner Bill Bratton made on The Brian Lehrer Show earlier this week: ""What we're seeing . . . over the last several months [is] a number of individuals just failing to understand that you must submit to an arrest, that you cannot resist it. The place to argue your case is in court, not in the middle of the street.""

The drum gets beaten whenever there's a high-profile case of police violence: Let the cops do their job, and everything will be OK. Mike Brown struggled with cops, police in Ferguson, Missouri say, and maybe he'd be alive today if he hadn't. ({Witnesses tell a different story.}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/watch-conflicting-statements-about-mike-browns-murder-p-1621414491"">) The LAPD claims that Ezell Ford, the latest black man to be gunned down by the cops, was resisting too.

But this line of argument places blame for police violence on its victims, not its perpetrators. If Eric Garner had only owned up to the loosies he was allegedly selling and put his hands behind his back, it says, he wouldn't have died. But what about the mentally ill man EMTs said they had to physically {protect from Brooklyn cops who were beating him senseless}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/emts-we-stopped-nypd-cops-from-beating-handcuffed-ment-1616824015""> as he lie handcuffed to a stretcher, physically incapable of resistance?

Or Ehud Halevi, a homeless man who was {brutally beaten, nightsticked, and pepper-sprayed}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/5951955/homeless-man-charged-with-assault-after-nypd-is-taped-beating-him-up"">—then charged with assaulting a police officer—for sleeping in a Crown Heights cultural center where he'd been given permission to sleep?

What about Ramarley Graham, the unarmed teenager who NYPD cops shot and killed in front of his grandmother, inside of his own house?

Every one of these men, save Ehud Halevi, is black. ""Stop resisting. Due process will be served,"" as if a black person in New York, or Ferguson, or Los Angeles, has any reason to believe that it will be. As if an arrest is a walk in the park, and if you're innocent, {you'll be able to laugh it off like Nate Silver did.}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/nate-silver-inspired-by-events-in-ferguson-tells-idio-1621363315"">

Is it in your best interests to resist arrest? Almost never. Should you do it? Probably not. But for de Blasio and Bratton to issue a call like this, at a time like this—after Garner's death, as cops tear-gas journalists and initiate violence with protesters 1,000 miles away in Ferguson—displays a certain tone-deafness and unwillingness to engage with the real issue.

After Bratton and Al Sharpton gave vastly different public remarks regarding Garner's death, veteran New York police reporter Murray Weiss {published an anonymously-sourced report}<hyperlink=""https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140812/civic-center/de-blasio-would-dump-bratton-showdown-with-sharpton-sources-say""> claiming de Blasio would rather remove Bratton from his position as commissioner than lose Sharpton's support, and by extension, that of the ""constituency that catapulted him into City Hall.""

This is what she found:

Kathie Warnack, 48, started quietly crying when she learned that Anonymous had released the name of her stepson.

The St. Louis resident said her stepson is a 32-year-old police dispatcher in St. Ann, Mo., and before that a manager at a dollar store. He has never worked as a police officer — not in Ferguson or anywhere else, she said.

Her stepson also doesn't live at the address released by the group and rarely comes over, Warnack said.

""Wow, this is not good,"" said Warnack, as she began to cry on the steps of her home, which sits along a busy road.

""I guess I'm going to have to sleep with my gun and put cameras on the house,"" she said. ""Now I have to defend myself and I didn't do anything wrong.""

Warnack is disabled by a birth defect that means she has an artificial left leg and less than five misshapen fingers on each hand.
As pointed out on Twitter by Adrian Chen, another Anonymous member revealed that @TheAnonMessage was not sure if the name he eventually released was the actual identity of Brown's killer but decided to do so anyway.

The report alleges that Brown (accompanied {by Dorian Johnson}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/eyewitness-michael-brown-pleaded-i-don-t-have-a-gun-1620094720"">) stole a box of cigarettes and got into a brief altercation with the store's clerk before leaving.

The report, citing security footage, states Brown ""aggressively"" grabbed the store clerk attempting to lock the store's doors to prevent Brown from leaving with the stolen cigarettes and pushed him into a display. After Johnson leaves the store, Brown also turns to leave, but pauses just before reaching the door. He apparently turned around and approached the clerk again, ""towers over"" him, ""appearing to intimidate.""

This incident report appears to dispute {part of Dorian Johnson's account}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/eyewitness-michael-brown-pleaded-i-don-t-have-a-gun-1620094720"">, in which he claimed to have met up with Brown after he left the convenience store and made no mention of the alleged robbery.

The only incident report released to press today was of the alleged robbery, and not the confrontation between Brown and Wilson. From the report: ""It is worth mentioning that this incident is related to another incident....in that incident Brown was fatally wounded involving an officer of this department.""

You can see video of the press conference above.

Evidently this crime made Brown, 18, a fugitive in the small town, and the force had its radar out for the young man when an officer came across him and a friend walking the streets of Ferguson that same day. We all know what happened next: A brief confrontation ended with Brown's dead body lying prostrate in the middle of a street for four hours.

The incident report, made public after days of civil unrest in the town and shortly after Thomas Jackson, Ferguson's police chief, {revealed the name}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/ferguson-police-release-name-of-officer-who-killed-mich-1622033925""> of the officer who shot and killed Brown, would appear to shed light on the events that led to Brown's death, and cast the police in a more forgiving manner. ""See, we're not so bad!"" Its revelation says. ""We were hunting a bad guy. He stole. Our work is justified.""

But petty theft should never end in death. And the murderer in this case, Darren Wilson, remains protected by the police. Where's the report of his actions on Aug. 9? Jackson has thus far only given scant details about what happened between Brown and Wilson, reasoning that anything more could prejudice witness testimony. (Jackson {has clarified}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/cop-who-killed-mike-brown-wasnt-aware-he-was-a-suspect-1622381365""> that Wilson did not know Brown was a suspect in the robbery.)

But the well is already poisoned. Michael Brown is dead. The solution, when a community is in crisis, is always more information, fewer obfuscations. More facts, less one-sided bullshit. But those answers seem a long time in coming. Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, has said that a full investigation into the matter could take months. ""The timeline on this is that there is no timeline.""

And that lack of urgency, the absence of truth, lets the narrative set in. As Marc Lamont Hill put it on {Twitter}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/marclamonthill/status/500283178662514688"">: ""There is a longstanding tradition of demonizing victims in this country. This unarmed teenager was killed by police. That's what matters... They wanted you to believe that Trayvon was a bad kid, Eric Garner was a criminal, Renisha McBride was a thief. This is the pattern.""

To the police, these people are the enemies. And their deaths, in the end, are just incidents.

So, another man told me to get in my car and turn the air and put my face in front of the vents, so that's what I did.

Lemon: So were you arrested? What happened?

Woman: No, I wasn't arrested. When I got in my car and turned the air on and put my face in front of the vent. Wilson made me get out of the car and sit on the concrete and he took all my information and ran my name. And I was still trying to pour the milk in my eyes because I couldn't see, and he's telling me to 'shut the F up' and 'sit the f down' and I was looking at his name tag and I was telling myself that I would never forget who he was and what he did to me. And I prayed on it and I asked God to get revenge on him and I'm sorry this is the way it happened, but what's done in the dark always come to the light, and I saw the news this morning—

Gawker,gawk40,http://gawker.com/the-price-of-blackness-1622972582,The Price of Blackness ,Lanre Akinsiku ,08/17/14,04/15/16,"In undergrad, I drove a '92 Ford Taurus that just hulked, tank-like, up and down the streets of Berkeley. The thing was conspicuous, an ocean liner. I was pulled over all the time, once or twice a week at one point. Often I'd see a squad car following me and just pull to the curb to get it over with. An officer would walk up to the car, one hand on that little button that secures the strap over his gun. He'd ask for my license and registration. Some inner voice would remind me that this was the time to point out I'd done nothing wrong; I'd ask for a badge number, I'd take a stand. But black boys are supposed to know better.

So what I would do was: I would slip my college ID over my driver's license. The officer's eyes would light up. Not your college ID, he would say, amused. Then he would go back to his car and dally a little, pretending to check on things, before handing my license back with some mock-heroic advice about staying out of trouble. The story ends right there. I remember feeling vague anger afterwards, although I was probably feeling something a lot closer to despair.

–––

Every time I used the college ID trick, it bred in me a kind of survivor's guilt, a guilt about a life that feels as if it's being protected weakly, through cowardice. Because what I was really doing was saying, Yes, some of us deserve to be shot in the street, but this ID proves that I'm not one of them. I used the little plastic card to secure my status as One Of The Good Ones {[1]}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/#_ftn1"">, and I always drove away ashamed, always. At best, I was reducing my humanity—my right to not get shot by a police officer—to a giveaway received during freshman orientation. At worst, I was just delaying what is now starting to feel inevitable.

–––

Mentally-speaking, what happens when you hear about another unarmed black teen killed by police/police-like officers? For me, it goes something like this: First, anger, a kind of 360-degree, completely unfocused, completely diffuse anger; but since anger is a fairly cheap emotion it fades, and sadness settles in; and then I get that familiar helpless feeling you get when you realize what you're doing is utterly rote, almost Pavlovian, but you don't know how else to deal. To put it another way: For reasons I'm still trying to parse out, I've realized that simply mourning the deaths of other young black men isn't good enough any more.

I don't mean for this to sound melodramatic, because my emotions don't really matter; or, they matter less than a murdered black boy whose body was left in the street. But what I'm trying to describe here is something real, a sinking-in-quicksand feeling familiar to anyone who is tired of the terror—which is the only really truly appropriate term—police officers exact on young black men. When an unarmed black boy is killed by a police officer, again, and some loud-talking reporter is interviewing the boy's mother, again, and you can see his mother's shoulders slumped until they can't slump any more, and she's been crying so much she's gotten to the point of simply not bothering to wipe the tears away, and you watch her as she tries to look into every camera and speak into every microphone, and watch her as she suddenly gets the spectacle of all of this, and starts listing all of the good things her boy ever was, so that everyone can remember him the way she's remembering him right then, in that moment—when will we decide this is not okay?

–––

This is probably a good time to backtrack a little and talk about fear. To be black and interact with the police is a scary thing. The fear doesn't have to come from any kind of historical antagonism, which, trust me, would be enough; it can also come from many data points of personal experience, collected over time. Almost all black men have these close-call-style stories, and we collect and mostly keep them to ourselves until one of us is killed. You know how the stories go: I was pulled over one day and the cop drew his gun as he approached my window; I was stopped on the street, handcuffed and made to sit on the sidewalk because the cop said I looked like a suspect; I had four squad cars pull up on me for jaywalking. We trade them like currency. And it almost goes without saying that these stops are de facto violent, because even when the officer doesn't physically harm you, you can feel that you've been robbed of something. The thing to remember is that each of these experiences compounds the last, like interest, so that at a certain point just seeing a police officer becomes nauseating. That feeling is fear.

–––

We all know there's nothing necessarily wrong with fear, since it's just a really effective survival mechanism, and there sure as hell isn't anything wrong with surviving. Legitimate fear can save your life; it makes sense that many of us are scared of heights and rattlesnakes. But a constant state of fear, being afraid, makes you a special kind of tired, in the same way a bully or bad boss makes you tired. This is no real way to live.

___

OK: Imagine you know of a guy who occasionally walks around your neighborhood with a gun. Imagine you don't really know this guy, so you don't know how he feels about you, whether he sees you as friend or foe. You do know that he holds his gun a little tighter when he walks past your house. You also know that if he shoots you, there's a good chance he'll get away with it.

That's how all of this feels.

––

What I've seen of the Ferguson Police Department and their tanks, AR15's, flash-bang grenades, tear gas, laser sights, helicopters, and military-style detachment makes me believe Michael Brown was tired. Maybe he'd been harassed by a police officer before, maybe he was tired of being tired. So when Darren Wilson tried to bully him, Michael Brown said no. And maybe it was the ""no"" of someone who's been pushed around, which is a more beautiful ""no,"" since it is so clear and absolute. That a police officer then shot him dead and left his body in the street is, historically, the kind of thing police officers do when black men stand up for themselves.

And so for the last week I've been feeling that helpless feeling. All that's left after helplessness is fatigue, right? Aren't we all tired yet? We know that what happened to Michael Brown was not a unique incident but part of a larger phenomenon—and that it will happen again, soon. Which means we know an even deeper truth: that to be black in this country means constantly paying a tax on your life. Some of us pay in dignity, some of us pay in blood. What I'm trying to say is this: Never again will I pay with my dignity.",1100,261000,NA,NA

All six shots were fired into the front of Brown.

According to the autopsy, Brown was shot at least three times in the face. At least two of those shots ""would have stopped him in his tracks and were likely the last fired.""

According to the New York Times, Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner in New York, found a gunshot wound at the top of Brown's skull ""suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury.""

""This one here looks like his head was bent downward,"" he explained to the Times. ""It can be because he's giving up, or because he's charging forward at the officer.""

Baden—who conducted the autopsy at the family's request and was not allowed to examine Brown's clothing—said no gunpowder was found on Brown's body, suggesting he was not shot at close range.

Baden told reporters Brown—who was not given medical attention—likely would not have survived the shooting.

Today, the New York Daily News published an {analysis of data}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/the-nypd-keeps-coming-up-with-ways-to-arrest-poor-peopl-1623216862""> that detailed the increase in arrests for fare-beating busts made by officers. In the last five years, turnstile jumping apprehensions have ballooned by 69 percent—24,747 arrests were made last year as opposed to 14,681 in 2008 —and will likely increase in 2014.

But the Daily News report also reveals a far more troubling fact: Broken windows policing is not working.

""These numbers illustrate, once again, the failure of broken windows policing,"" Justine Olderman, a managing director at Bronx Defenders, told the Daily News. ""The NYPD trots out this justification that they're arresting people for minor infractions as a way of keeping violent crime down, and yet there is no evidence to show that there's any correlation between turnstile jumping and violence.""

In December of 2013, when New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio announced Bill Bratton as his pick for police chief, the two held a press conference dedicated to reassuring New Yorkers that the NYPD was about to begin a new chapter.

""I don't want to do it all over again the same way,"" {Bratton said}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Bill-Bratton-New-NYPD-Police-Commissioner-de-Blasio-232838251.html?akmobile=o"">. ""[I want to work] together in a collaboration where there is mutual respect and there is mutual trust.""

After years of New York's communities of color being under siege from aggressive policing tactics like stop-and-frisk, promoted heavily by de Blasio's predecessor Michael Bloomberg and his police chief Ray Kelly, Bratton's new message of change brought hope to city residents.

But last week seemed to confirm the worst fears of many that de Blasio and Bratton are just as out of touch as their predecessors.

On same day that police violently assaulted peaceful protesters in Ferguson, Mo., and after weeks of police misconduct in New York, de Blasio gave a passionate defense of the NYPD.

""When a police officer comes to the decision that it's time to arrest someone, that individual is obligated to submit to arrest,"" {he said}<hyperlink=""http://gothamist.com/2014/08/14/dont_f_the_police.php"">.

Statements like that, coming so soon after a slew of incidents involving police brutality, most notably the death of Staten Island resident Eric Garner—allegedly choked to death by a police officer who was trying to restrain him—have many rethinking their optimistic assessment of New York's leaders.

The first seven months of the de Blasio administration may have proved that stop-and-frisk was just the tip of the iceberg of a larger problem in New York City: Broken windows policing, which involves cracking down on minor infractions in hopes of preventing major crimes.

Community-rights advocates have said the death of Garner was just the most visible sign that broken windows policing is inherently racist and classist, and if the NYPD wants to gain back the trust of New Yorkers, it may not be a question of reform but a total rethinking of what policing means.

""Broken windows is not an issue you just tinker with,"" said Khary Lazarre-White, the director of The Brotherhood/Sister Sol, a Harlem-based organization that works with at-risk youth to prevent violence in the community. ""It needs a massive response. There's no one way to do it, but the change has to come from the top. The Mayor has to say, ""This is no longer the way we do business.'""

Some weeks ago, Caleb Dorsainvil, a 23-year old Brooklyn resident, was taking a half-hour break from his job at a Walgreens in Fort Greene when an unmarked cop car pulled up. Three white police officers stepped out. One officer accused Dorsainvil of throwing a joint on the ground, something Dorsainvil denies. The officers surrounded him, searched his pockets and felt up his clothes, telling him they just had to make sure he wasn't carrying drugs.

""Usually I would talk back,"" Dorsainvil said. ""But they choked a guy to death. I made sure to get out of there alive.""

Dorsainvil's encounter was one of hundreds of thousands black and Hispanic New Yorkers experience each year: cops stopping, searching, and sometimes arresting people for seemingly little to no reason. Some of those encounters, like Dorsainvil's, end in silence. Others end in death.

On July 17, a video emerged online of police officers confronting Garner, a 43-year-old Staten Island father, for allegedly selling cigarettes on the street. In the video, Garner says he hasn't done anything wrong and asks the police to leave him alone. But the officers persist, wrestling him to the ground and placing him in a chokehold. Garner repeatedly screams, ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe."" Gasping for air, Garner goes into cardiac arrest and dies. Two officers involved in the incident—Justin Damico and Daniel Pantaleo—were stripped of their gun and badge days later, and the {medical examiner has ruled the death a homicide}<hyperlink=http://gawker.com/eric-garners-nypd-chokehold-death-ruled-homicide-by-med-1614734969"">.

The video sparked outrage across the city, with vigils and protests drawing hundreds.

""We saw the inhumanity that was caught on that video and we say that it ends today,"" one New York Councilwoman {said at a vigil}<hyperlink=""http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/vigil_for_eric_garner_draws_hu.html""> held for Garner on Staten Island.

But the Garner video was followed by several others. One video showed a pregnant woman in East New York {being confronted by an officer for illegally grilling}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/pregnant-woman-gets-apparent-nypd-chokehold-after-grill-1612156571""> on the sidewalk. The woman was eventually pushed forward and placed in a chokehold as well, a tactic not permitted by the NYPD. Another video {showed a man in East Harlem}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYPD-Chokehold-Video-Subway-Farebeater-Police-Custody-268379742.html""> being tackled and placed in a chokehold for allegedly failing to pay his subway fare. Another showed NYPD officers {dragging a half-naked woman out of her apartment and tackling her}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/nypds-brutal-arrest-of-half-naked-woman-captured-on-vid-1615047977"">.

These videos, according to activists and experts, are not just documents of isolated incidents of police brutality, but signs of an inherent flaw in New York's policing strategy.

Broken windows has no precise definition, but most criminal justice experts agree that at its core the strategy is about taking low-level crimes like turnstile jumping or selling small amounts of weed very seriously, with the theory that stopping these small crimes will prevent more serious ones. The strategy, {popularized in the 1980s}<hyperlink=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/"">, gets its name from the idea that a neighborhood with lots of broken windows is more attractive to criminals than one kept in pristine condition.

The idea came under intense scrutiny during Mayor Bloomberg's administration, as tens of thousands of black and Hispanic men were stopped, frisked, and often detained for seemingly no reason other than being outside and not white.

Bill de Blasio campaigned on the idea that that kind of blatantly racist policing would end. But, so far it hasn't.

Experts admit that community relations could worsen even as de Blasio's and Bratton's curtailing of stop-and-frisk proves that stop-and-frisk was just a symptom of the NYPD's problem with poor communities of color.

""The primary premise [of broken windows], whether spoken or unspoken, is about policing the poor,"" said Delores Jones-Brown, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""The people who live in a neighborhood with a broken window and can't afford to fix that window.""

In other words, if the NYPD is policing crimes that might have more to do with circumstance than malintent—selling weed because it's a way to make money in an unfair economy, {squeegeeing windows to afford a meal}<hyperlink=""http://nypost.com/2014/08/07/squeegee-men-are-back-and-terrorizing-city-streets/""> —then the agency is essentially criminalizing the behavior of New York's most marginalized and disadvantaged communities.

Bill Bratton is one of the strategy's biggest champions, and turned New York into the world's largest broken windows experiment when he was appointed Commissioner under Rudolph Giuliani in 1994.

The controversies were the same then as they are now. Bratton came under fire for being hostile to the poor, saying in the early 90s that squeegee men should, ""{get off their asses and get jobs}<hyperlink=""http://articles.philly.com/1996-03-27/news/25639303_1_william-j-bratton-fight-against-urban-crime-drug-dealers"">."" He was even {booed at a community meeting}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/bratton-blows-top-article-1.700652""> because of his outwardly hostile attitude towards parents whose kids had been victims of police brutality.


But Bratton also pioneered community-focused approaches to policing as the chief of Los Angeles' department in the early 2000s, giving pastors, non-profit mediators, and other leaders of neighborhoods a voice in how their streets were policed.

His tenure in Southern California gave the critics of the Bloomberg and Kelly years hope that New York's relationship with its police force could change for the better once Bratton was selected as commissioner under de Blasio.

But now there's a palpable sense in New York—whether it's cops allegedly {beating a handcuffed mentally ill man}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/emts-we-stopped-nypd-cops-from-beating-handcuffed-ment-1616824015"">, or {arresting the man that filmed Garner's death}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/man-who-recorded-the-eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-video-a-1615716615"">—that the city is only experiencing the aggressive side of Bratton's theories.

""We have no evidence that the most troubling policies are any different under the new administration,"" said Linda Sarsour, the director of the Arab American Association of New York, one of dozens of community groups that opposed stop-and-frisk under Bloomberg. ""In the community, people are angry. They're outraged because they feel nothing has changed.""

{A new report from the Police Reform Organizing Project}<hyperlink=""http://www.policereformorganizingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Broken-Windows-Policing-A-True-Tale-of-Two-Cities.pdf""> (PROP) based on NYPD data shows the feeling on the streets might be right: Misdemeanor arrests have remained largely level from Bloomberg to de Blasio, with 94,243 arrests made in the first five months of 2013, and 97,487 made in the first five months of 2014. The racial breakdown is equally unequal under de Blasio as well: 86.8 percent of people charged with misdemeanors during de Blasio's first five months in office were people of color, compared with 86 percent during the same period last year.

The PROP report also compiled select stories of arrests from court documents: officers arresting a woman with a license to sell flowers because two of the flowers on her cart were artificial; an officer arresting a man for having his backpack on an adjacent seat on in a subway car; officers stopping a 14-year-old girl on her way to school, and arresting her for truancy when she questioned why she was being stopped.

The statistics and anecdotes from PROP, seen alongside the string of troubling videos released in the past few weeks, paint a troubling picture of broken windows policing. Community advocates say if that style of policing can't work under a mayor like de Blasio, it's obvious it can't work at all.

""Stop-and-frisk and arresting people for selling loose cigarettes are both just expressions of a kind of invasive policing based on broken windows,"" said Alex Vitale, a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College and prominent advocate for police reform. ""Once you engage in that kind of mass criminalization then you're going to have problems inevitably. You're going to have a breakdown of perceived police legitimacy, and you're going to have acts of resistance that lead to (police) brutality.""

There are other ways of policing—ones that value intense engagement with communities over intense policing of them. And many say the last few months show it's high time that New York City consider them.

In 1996, as youth violence skyrocketed in many major metropolises, Boston's police implemented a program called Operation Ceasefire. The program used community-based policing methods for gangs in the city's highest crime areas: Police would talk directly to gang members and warn them of the consequences of violence, and church leaders and community groups would intervene in gang disputes in an attempt to quell violence before it started. The community-level effort was coupled with an ""all-levers"" approach to justice for repeat offenders—using every tool and the maximum punishments available to get those who committed the majority of violent crimes off the streets. The program resulted 64 percent reduction in youth homicides in five years, {according to researchers at Harvard University}<hyperlink=""https://www.hks.harvard.edu/programs/criminaljustice/research-publications/gangs-guns-urban-violence/operation-ceasefire-boston-gun-project/chart-ceasefire"">.

Boston is not the only city where community approaches to crime have worked. From Baltimore to Chicago to San Diego, studies have shown that community-based policing can help reduce violent crime while mending relations between the cities' most underserved communities and the forces that are meant to protect them.

The specific programs differ from city to city. Some focus on training police to interact with community members more amicably. Others allow community organizations to take over some roles traditionally performed by cops, such as the mediation of disputes. But they all have one thing in common: allowing local communities to have a say in how they're served by police.

""The current situation [in New York] proves police are not in the best position to decide how to police high-crime areas,"" said Jones-Brown. ""Community-based approaches mean that community members of all walks of life get to be involved in deciding what works best in keeping crime under control. That's what needs to take place in New York.""

For a brief period in New York's history, that kind of policing actually did take place.

In the early 1990s Mayor David Dinkins and Police Commissioner Lee Brown took a community-based policing pilot program active in one precinct and expanded it to the entire department. While research showed that Dinkins' approach was working, it was quickly changed when Giuliani took control of the city in 1994, and hired Bratton as his police commissioner.

""That's when the police started to see themselves as crime fighters only,"" Jones-Brown said.

Now, New York City is in the odd position of being governed by a mayor who actively campaigned against the crime fighting techniques that were popularized by Giuliani, while being policed by a man who helped institute those very techniques. But for police reform advocates, there are some small signals that policing can be fundamentally changed in New York, despite Bratton's history.

Increasingly, city leaders, including both the {Brooklyn and Manhattan District Attorneys}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/2014/07/12/330761032/brooklyn-da-shifts-stance-on-pot-but-that-wont-impact-nypd"">, are coming out against prosecuting low-level marijuana arrests. That may show the justice system in the city is nearing a turning point in how it views minor crimes.

And several small community-based crime intervention programs, like {Brotherhood/Sister Sol in Harlem}<hyperlink=""http://brotherhood-sistersol.org/"">, {Man Up in Brownsville}<hyperlink=""http://www.manupinc.org/"">, and {S.O.S. in Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant}<hyperlink=""http://crownheights.org/sos/"">, are showing promising signs of helping reduce crime by working with gangs and kids at risk of joining them. All without the need for aggressive police intervention.

Community leaders and police reform experts believe it's now up to de Blasio and Bratton to take those signals of change seriously.

""None of these things are a panacea—they're not going to solve all problems in a community, but they're cheaper and more effective than relying on broken windows policing,"" Vitale said. ""We just need more funding, and we need the police to step back and let those programs work.""

The conference came after {an autopsy requested by the family}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/autopsy-report-michael-brown-was-shot-at-least-six-tim-1623117894""> showed Brown was shot at least six times.

Dr. Michael Baden, the medical examiner, said that all but the last shot, which hit the top of Brown's head, would have been survivable, and attorneys argued that the trajectories of the head shots showed Brown was attempting to surrender to police. ""It shows a back-to-front [trajectory] for both of those, and it supports what the witnesses said about him trying to surrender to the officer,"" Attorney Daryl Parks said. ""His head was in a downward position. Had to be, for what had happened. Those types of facts are clear. And we believe that given those kinds of facts, this officer should have been arrested.""

""It verifies the worst that the family thinks happened—that he was executed,"" said Crump. ""It confirms what the witnesses said, that this was an execution. That's what the witnesses said from day one."" Crump also argued that the trajectory of bullets through Brown's hand and arm make it ""obvious"" that ""his hands were up at some point.""

Baden said that a final report would require analysis of Brown's clothing, USA Today reports, as gunshot residue could indicate whether he was shot from close range. No residue was found on Brown's body.

It wasn't, of course, but that won't stop people from talking about whether or not it was. Brown, the talking heads will say without saying, was the kind of black kid who did drugs, who stole Swishers and smoked weed—not the college-bound sweetheart friends and family have described.

But so what if he smoked weed? So what if that is him in the grainy surveillance footage, {""strong-arming"" a cashier for a box of cigars?}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/cop-who-killed-mike-brown-wasnt-aware-he-was-a-suspect-1622381365""> Who cares {whether or not he was going to college?}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/15/was-michael-brown-enrolled-in-college/""> (He was.)

It's also possible that the information will be used to argue that Brown was in some kind of reefer-fueled rage when he was killed. THC stays in the bloodstream for weeks after a person partakes, however, and we don't yet know how much was in Brown's.

In anticipation that Brown could be vilified by the results of the drug test, conducted as a routine part of the autopsy, protesters have consistently insisted that Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, should be required to submit to one as well.

While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along...

Oblivion has not been the only option for those of us outside Missouri, though. More than a few have been eating and opening windows and walking dully along for the last week while thinking of nothing but Ferguson. In fact, if you are a journalist or a writer you might have spent a lot of your time fighting with your editors to let you go to Missouri and see things for yourself, because observing feels like doing something, because the act of bearing witness holds out the promise of some effect. A tiny one. But it would be something.

What most of us can do, though, is barely above nothing, meaning that we can hang out on social media feeds and hope not too many of our friends are retreating to the comforting envelope of whatever this ice bucket stuff is. And we can yell, rather ineffectually and mostly by way of pixels, for someone to do something, anything.

The ""someones"" we have in mind are politicians, obviously. But the politicians, too, seem to be feeling helpless. They seem to spend a lot of time doing not much of anything other than watching the chaos themselves. Mostly, they issue statements, and seem to hope that since those statements are longer than tweets, they will somehow have a greater impact. Then authorities seem to throw their hands up in the air about the greater issues. They refer to ""{peace and justice}<hyperlink=""https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/statement-gov-nixon-regarding-ongoing-situation-ferguson-and-role-national-guard"">"" in these press releases; they just haven't anything of practical value to say about them.

Of course, action has its perils. It is not even that reassuring that the governor of Missouri {finally called in the National Guard today}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/missouri-governor-deploys-national-guard-to-ferguson-1623194322"">. More policing, more force, more restrictions aren't likely to calm anyone down. But what is likely to calm things down, what leadership could be doing, is implementing the sort of small, practical steps that will give any further investigation of Michael Brown's death the credibility it absolutely needs. There are practical ways to make this all look a little less like, as a friend put it, ""{using a police coup to hide a murder}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ntabebe/status/499780746966761473"">."" Suggestions include: appointing an outside Special Prosecutor, {releasing the incident report}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/wheres-the-incident-report-from-michael-browns-killing-1622199327""> from the Brown killing proper, revealing where exactly Darren Wilson is and why he hasn't been charged yet. (There is a preliminary report of {a grand jury hearing}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/report-grand-jury-hear-evidence-michael-brown-case"">, but it won't meet until Wednesday.)

When authorities can't get their act together to do such small, obvious things, it is very hard to have faith that we will see any movement on the larger issues this crisis raises about race and police brutality in America.

A lot of people hoped those larger issues would be the topic President Obama would speak on at his press conference this afternoon. Instead he simply said he'd send the Attorney-General, Eric Holder, to Ferguson to oversee an independent federal investigation by the FBI and the DoJ. Obama demurred on making too many pronouncements about Michael Brown's particularly, because he said it was important that he avoid ""pre-judging events."" He seemed tired and distracted as he said these things, taking long pauses between words.

He seemed, in a word, to be feeling helpless too.

The vacuum of faith in government that the crisis in Ferguson has revealed isn't new. Anyone who has followed any kind of criminal justice reform news for the last twenty years has seen it before. The refrain from everyone between {Michelle Alexander}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/2012/01/16/145175694/legal-scholar-jim-crow-still-exists-in-america""> and {Rand friggin' Paul}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> is that the system is set up to unduly target black people. It is practically spray-painted on the Washington Monument at this point. But infuriatingly, the people who are the most delicate about saying that, the most queasy about incorporating it into their policy decisions right now, are exactly the people who have the power to do the things that might end this.

In short, the only good news at this point is that people still have a sense of humor about the lack of leadership, even if the punchlines depend on hopelessness:

""I think we're about to be arrested because we're standing on a sidewalk,"" Lemon told a studio anchor in New York, sounding quizzical.

Very important with marijuana is the levels of the different drugs that are present in marijuana to have an opinion as to whether or not he might have been affected by the marijuana, so that he may have been acting in a crazy way and may have done things to the police officer that normally he would not have done.

Fulton's son Trayvon, of course, was gunned down in 2012 by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman who later testified that the unarmed Skittles-toting teenager made him fear for his life.

In her letter to Brown's family, Fulton acknowledges that their lives have been changed forever.

""I wish I had a word of automatic comfort but I don't. I wish I could say that it will be alright on a certain or specific day but I can't. I wish that all of the pain that I have endured could possibly ease some of yours but it won't,"" Fulton writes.

I hate that you and your family must join this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence. Of particular concern is that so many of these gun violence cases involve children far too young. But Michael is much more than a police/gun violence case; Michael is your son. A son that barely had a chance to live. Our children are our future so whenever any of our children – black, white, brown, yellow, or red – are taken from us unnecessarily, it causes a never-ending pain that is unlike anything I could have imagined experiencing.

Further complicating the pain and loss in this tragedy is the fact that the killer of your son is alive, known, and currently free. In fact, he is on paid administrative leave. Your own feelings will bounce between sorrow and anger. Even when you don't want to think about it because it is so much to bear, you will be forced to by merely turning on your television or answering your cell phone. You may find yourselves pulled in many different directions by strangers who may be well-wishers or detractors. Your circle will necessarily close tighter because the trust you once, if ever, you had in ""the system"" and their agents are forever changed. Your lives are forever changed.

However with those changes come new challenges and opportunities. You will experience a swell of support from all corners of the world. Many will express their sympathies and encourage you to keep fighting for Michael. You will also, unfortunately, hear character assassinations about Michael which I am certain you already have. This will incense and insult you. All of this will happen before and continue long after you have had the chance to lay your son to rest.
Addressing the media circus surrounding the shooting, Fulton advises the Browns to ""Honor your son and his life, not the circumstances of his alleged transgressions. I have always said that Trayvon was not perfect. But no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed.""

""But know this,"" she continues. ""Neither of their lives shall be in vain. The galvanizations of our communities must be continued beyond the tragedies. While we fight injustice, we will also hold ourselves to an appropriate level of intelligent advocacy. If they refuse to hear us, we will make them feel us. Some will mistake that last statement as being negatively provocative. But feeling us means feeling our pain; imagining our plight as parents of slain children. We will no longer be ignored. We will bond, continue our fights for justice, and make them remember our children in an appropriate light.""",16900,79,NA,NA

CNN's Jake Tapper was on the scene in Ferguson, Mo., Monday night, where violence continues to escalate even as the state's National Guard has taken over policing the town of 21,000. Since protests started last weekend, there's been a disparity between the level of violence from some protesters (looting, reportedly throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks) and the ""militarized"" response of police, armed with semi-automatic weapons and clad in armor and riot gear and firing tear gas.

In this clip, Tapper walks a major Ferguson throughway, the camera sweeping the gathering of protesters and then following Tapper to do a pan of the police, assembled as if they're ready to mount an offensive—for battle.

""Absolutely there have been looters, absolutely over the last nine days there has been violence, but there is nothing going on this street right now that merits this scene out of Bagram [Afghanistan], nothing."" Tapper says. ""So if people wonder why the people of Ferguson, Missouri are so upset, this is part of the reason. What is this? This doesn't make any sense.""",10400,286,NA,NA

Catron also shared a meme with the caption ""Remember how white people rioted after OJ's acquittal?""—because the one time a black man appeared to beat the system, thanks to an extremely expensive legal team, is definitely just as outrageous as a teenager being shot six times by the authority charged with protecting his community.

But over the last few days, a great deal of the social media chatter on the crisis has identified another group increasing the tension: the Revolutionary Communist Party. RCP members, as the rumor goes, have parachuted into Ferguson and are trying to incite a riot.

The person who has been most vigorously documenting the RCP's involvement is St. Louis Alderman Antonio French. Last night, for example, he posted this Vine of a local leader arguing with two men in telltale RCP black t-shirts.

You can also see one of these men in this youtube video, posted last Wednesday, making a speech to a crowd:

[tweetbegin 501748522996482048 tweetend]

According to {a website called the Missouri Torch}<hyperlink=""http://duanelester.com/tmt/blog/2014/08/17/meet-greg-joey-johnson-an-opportunistic-communist-revolutionary-agitating-in-ferguson-video/"">, the man French is referring to is one Greg ""Joey"" Johnson, of Chicago. They have a variety of other images and videos of Johnson and assorted ""commie"" — their word — friends being shown around Ferguson. It's pretty plain they've identified him correctly.

Johnson has been kicking around the paranoid end of American politics for some time. (To be utterly clear to any conservatives getting excited just reading this, that paranoid end is a 360 degree circle, really, comprising members of all stripes of political thought.) But he hasn't been wholly ineffective, as an activist. For one example: those of you who went to law school, might recognize him as the same {Gregory Johnson who was the defendant}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Lee_Johnson""> in {Texas v. Johnson}<hyperlink=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/491/397"">, the case which held that flag-burning is a protected activity under the First Amendment.

The group with which Johnson is affiliated, {the Revolutionary Communist Party}<hyperlink=""http://revcom.us/"">, is nowadays largely regarded as crank-ish even by many self-identified Communists. It is routinely referred to as a ""cult of personality"" for its leader Bob Avakian. Avakian, who lives in self-imposed exile... somewhere, still believes that Communist revolution is possible and writes long tracts to that end, identifying {the end of racial oppression}<hyperlink=""http://www.revcom.us/a/078/avakian-black-history-month1.html""> as key to the eventual overthrow of capitalism. He is also {the sort of fellow who writes like this}<hyperlink=""http://revcom.us/avakian/makingrevolution2/"">:

One important aspect of boldly spreading revolution and communism everywhere is the work of building what we have characterized as a culture of appreciation, promotion, and popularization around the leadership, the body of work and the method and approach of Bob Avakian. Now, I recognize that some people (especially among the middle strata, frankly) may find it ""immodest"" (and perhaps, to some, strangely disturbing) for me to speak about this (and, for god's sake, to refer to myself in the third person!). But, first of all and fundamentally, ""modesty"" (or ""immodesty"") is not the essential issue, not the heart of the matter.
We've reached out for comment from the RCP on their involvement in Ferguson but so far they have not responded.

They do have a habit of showing up at moments of racial unrest; the Missouri Torch, for example, points out that Johnson {was also spotted at protests}<hyperlink=""http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/26/communists-occupiers-infiltrate-sanford-trayvon-rally/""> over the Trayvon Martin killing.

Anyone who's spent any time in radical circles knows that the presence of interfering, troublemaking interlopers is an expected side-effect of a large-scale protest. But if the rumors are right and these guys trying to drum up even more tension than is already present in Ferguson, they're despicable.",41500,271,NA,NA
Gawker,gawk61,http://gawker.com/cop-pens-touching-op-ed-do-everything-i-say-and-i-wont-1623985263,Cop pens touching op-ed: do everything I say and I won't kill you,Jordan Sargent ,08/19/14,05/16/16,"As images of various police forces dressed in military uniforms attacking citizens in Ferguson, Mo. continue to play out across all of America's screens, what the enforcement-industrial complex needs is to showcase its human side. Thankfully, an LAPD cop has {written a column telling us that the one way not to get assaulted or killed by the police is do exactly and only what they say}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/08/19/im-a-cop-if-you-dont-want-to-get-hurt-dont-challenge-me/"">.

The cop's name is Sunil Dutta, and he is a professor at Colorado Tech University (real school), an LAPD officer of 17 years, and an amateur troll for various esteemed publications (so we at least have one thing in common). His most recent article, published in the Washington Post, is titled ""I'm a cop. If you don't want to get hurt, don't challenge me."" I will now challenge Sunil Dutta—if he kills me, please tell my mother I loved her.

If we skip the part where Dutta assures us that ""cops are not murderers""—{which is demonstrably false!}<hyperlink=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=cop%20indicted%20murder""> —we get to the main point of his argument:

Sometimes, though, no amount of persuasion or warnings work on a belligerent person; that's when cops have to use force, and the results can be tragic. We are still learning what transpired between Officer Darren Wilson and Brown, but in most cases it's less ambiguous — and officers are rarely at fault. When they use force, they are defending their, or the public's, safety.

There is an implication here that informs the entirety of Dutta's argument, which is that cops never are the aggressors in situations, and instead only operate from a place of reaction. A really bad time to make this argument would be right this very second, when every night America gets to watch Missouri policemen shoot endless canisters of tear gas at peaceful crowds of protestors and journalists.

It also would have been a bad time to make this argument two weeks ago, after America watched Eric Garner get strangled to death by a NYPD officer for selling untaxed cigarettes off the street, which is in no way harmful to the safety of police or the public. (That is, unless Dutta would like to argue that selling cigarettes is harmful and those that do so must be attacked, in which case {I have an idea of where police could start}<hyperlink=""http://www.pmi.com/eng/about_us/corporate_governance/pages/board_of_directors.aspx"">.)

It's a bad time to make this argument when the death of Eric Garner has brought the deaths of people like Patrick Dorismond—who was {killed by an undercover NPYD officer who badgered him for drugs}<hyperlink=""http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/03/nyc-m22.html""> —and Sean Bell—who was {killed after the NPYD sprayed 50 bullets into his vehicle the night before his wedding}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bell_shooting_incident""> —back into the spotlight.

Dutta's language here—""in most cases it's less ambiguous""—gives him as much wiggle room as he needs—#NotAllCops!—but he seems to fail to acknowledge that the incidents that fall outside of ""most cases"" are more than enough to engender the suspicion of police that he is so quick to dismiss as childish.

Then there's this:

Even though it might sound harsh and impolitic, here is the bottom line: if you don't want to get shot, tased, pepper-sprayed, struck with a baton or thrown to the ground, just do what I tell you. Don't argue with me, don't call me names, don't tell me that I can't stop you, don't say I'm a racist pig, don't threaten that you'll sue me and take away my badge. Don't scream at me that you pay my salary, and don't even think of aggressively walking towards me. Most field stops are complete in minutes. How difficult is it to cooperate for that long?
""If you don't want to get shot just do what I tell you"" is a purely insane thing to say. That is not how human interaction is supposed to work, regardless of whether an ""authority figure"" is involved or not. Later in his piece, Dutta notes that ""an average cop"" merely ""tries to control every encounter. An ""average cop"" should be able to control an encounter even if they are being argued with or being called a racist. Cops can deal with hurt feelings without beating people up, just like the rest of us.

Dutta's solution is to do whatever a cop says in the moment—up to and including an arrest that may or may not be lawful or warranted—because you can just go ahead and sue cops later.

Save your anger for later, and channel it appropriately. Do what the officer tells you to and it will end safely for both of you. We have a justice system in which you are presumed innocent; if a cop can do his or her job unmolested, that system can run its course. Later, you can ask for a supervisor, lodge a complaint or contact civil rights organizations if you believe your rights were violated. Feel free to sue the police! Just don't challenge a cop during a stop.
I can only address this argument if I believe that Dutta really thinks that people are supposed to have faith in internal and external investigations of cops, but I don't think he does.

He ends his piece by arguing that America's view of cops has been distorted by entertainment:

An average person cannot comprehend the risks and has no true understanding of a cop's job. Hollywood and television stereotypes of the police are cartoons in which fearless super cops singlehandedly defeat dozens of thugs, shooting guns out of their hands.
Yes, where would people begin to construct stereotypes of police. Certainly not in the pages of the Washington Post.",148000,644,NA,NA
