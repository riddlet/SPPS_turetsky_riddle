The event happened just days after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed not far from St. Louis in Ferguson, Missouri.

St. Louis police reportedly shot and killed a young black man Tuesday after, they say, he brandished a knife.

“The suspect, who right now is described as a 23-year-old African American, was acting erratically — walking back and forth up and down the street,” St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters. “As officers arrived, the suspect turned towards the officers and started to walk towards them clutching his waistband. He then pulled out a knife … and told the officers, ‘Shoot me now. Kill me now.’”

Dotson went on to say that officers told the man to stop and drop the knife but he soon advanced toward, coming within about four feet of one of the officers. That’s when, Dotson said, both officers then fired their weapons.

There is no word yet, however, on how many times the unnamed man was shot or if the officers were still in their vehicle.",NA,NA,NA,0 reads

He was there covering the story of unrest, following the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown by police over the weekend. “Officers say, you should get out of here, things are getting crazy. If you choose to stay here we’re not going to be able to protect you but they weren’t satisfied that we were going to stay and cover the riot,” Lowery says. What he says next will surprise you!

TOM JOYNER:  Wesley Lowery from The Washington Post is on the phone and out of jail.  What’s happening?

WESLEY LOWERY:  (Laugh) Thank you, Tom.

TOM JOYNER:  (Laugh) Not you too, you’re a journalist.

WESLEY LOWERY:  My objective facts tell me that I can do all these other interviews, but the day I go on Tom Joyner.  (Laughter)

TOM JOYNER:  Come on, Wesley, not you too.  All right, Wesley, what happened?

WESLEY LOWERY:  So, for people not on the ground here in Ferguson, the main stress where everything’s happening, where the initial shooting of Michael Brown happened, where the protests have been happening, are on what essentially is a main thoroughfare off of a, like a freeway, actually.  So you actually can imagine you got gas stations, as we’ve seen the one that was burned, McDonald’s, The Dollar Store, and so it was during the afternoon, there was a massive afternoon protest, largely peaceful afternoon protest, the police came out in a massive show of force. For myself and many other reporters it was all hands on deck, we were all covering this live from the sites, tweets, a lot of live updates, a lot of pictures, because this isn’t the first time the full SWAT and riot team had showed up during the daylight.  And so here we are documenting this and independently of each other, Ryan Riley, from The Huffington Post, the other reporter and his team, our phones were dying.

So what we did was we walked about two blocks, there’s a McDonald’s.  This has basically been the media center of all of Ferguson.  Any reporter here, he’ll tell you that, because as everybody knows that McDonald’s are definitely Wi-Fi.  And so for reporters who are typing and filing, anytime I’m on the road I think I need to find a McDonald’s or a Starbucks.  And so we’re in the McDonald’s writing the reporting, like a lot of reporters have been.  I believe him and I were the only two reporters at that moment because everything was topping off.  We had to pull ourselves out for a second because our phones were dead.  And so we’re the only two reporters in there, we’re working and filing, there’s maybe half a dozen people in there.  And at one point I look up and I see that there are six or seven officers now in the McDonald’s, you know, with their large weapons walking around and they’re talking to some of the patrons saying you should get out of here, things are getting crazy down there, you should get out of there.  So obviously I went on high alert. You know, I started to try to take pictures of what was going on in the McDonald’s, tweeting that; hey, officers have just shown up and they’re now evacuating us.

All of the sudden the story had come to our little alcove where we thought we had escaped it.  But at the time they did not order us to leave.  They said if you just choose to stay here we’re not going to be able to protect you.  If you call 911 we’re not going to answer, we’re not going to show up here, we told you; you need to leave.  Like, all right, cool.  They walk back to the front, they were not satisfied with the idea that we were willing to brave whatever it was, that we weren’t scared by the idea of a riot, in fact we were here to cover if there was going to be a riot.  So then they went to the manager to try to talk him into kicking us out.  Tried to talk him into giving them authority to evacuate the place or whatnot.

I had no idea whether or not that was granted but what I do know was a few moments later some of the officers re-approached us and said we’re evacuating, now you have to get out of here, you’ve got to get out of here. I’ve got my phone in my hands, so I hit record on my video, because, again, we’re being evacuated from a McDonald’s, this is going to be good video no matter what happens.  This is going to be something, this is going to help show what was going on in the ground, at which point an officer with a large assault weapon says to me; stop recording, turn that off.  And I said, as I’m walking backwards, still recording him, trying to get to my stuff, because I have no intention of staying in this McDonald’s they’re evacuating.

I said; Officer, don’t I have a first amendment right to record you?  He didn’t like that, but he didn’t directly respond to it.  He just said; move it, move it, move it.  So here I am holding in my left hand, it’s why my video has my fingers all over it, because I don’t really know how to hold these in my left hand, but with my right hand I’m trying to pack up my stuff, and, for some context, and I’m kind of going long here, but some context right before that, because my phone was dead, I was sitting there letting it charge, but also trying to do a little bit of a Twitter Q&A with people. I’ve been on the ground for a few days here, so I know there are some people who aren’t in Ferguson had some questions I might have answers to because they might’ve missed it.

So I was going back and forth.  I have all of my notebooks spread across this entire desk.  I was digging through my notes trying to be able to answer questions for people.  And so it’s taking me a little while with one hand to pack everything up, unplug computers, unplug things, load them up, try to zip up my bag.  Meanwhile, as he’s saying move, he’s gesturing with his weapon, which for me, I’ll be honest, it means, I might have been a little less attentive to packing and a little more attentive to this large weapon being gestured at me.

And so as I’m trying to pack my stuff up, I get up, I put my backpack on, I start walking towards the door, and I say; sir, am I going to be able to get my car, or do I need to walk out?  I don’t have time for your questions.  I don’t have time – I said; sir, I’m trying to leave, I need to know, can I go to my car?  Or should I just walk out?  And, again, this is not some type of urgent situation; they’re evacuating a McDonald’s two blocks away from the action.

They could’ve taken 20 minutes to do it, it wouldn’t have made any difference, there was no immediate threat to anyone inside that McDonald’s. And so here we are, and so I have my bag over one shoulder, and finally he says; yeah, you can go to your car.  So I’m walking towards that door, at which point another officer approaches me from that direction and says; you can’t go out that door, go out the other one.  I said okay, sir, so I just; can you tell me what door to go out?  I’ll go out it.  But the two of you are giving me opposite instructions.

They confer for a quick moment, they point me in the other direction, so as I turn around, my backpack, which is slung over just one shoulder, because, again, I’ve got my phone in my hand, begins to slide off of my shoulder.  I say; Officer, just give me one second, I just got to readjust this bag.  I didn’t want them to think I was stopping or defying their orders, that I need to readjust this bag, it’s about to fall, everything’s going to spill; you’re going to be upset.  That’s when they said; okay, let’s take him.  They threw me up against the …

TOM JOYNER:  Threw you up against the …

WESLEY LOWERY:  Up against the fountain soda machine, at which point, at which point I knew I was being arrested, I knew that was going to happen.  And so I …

TOM JOYNER:  Now this is Ferguson Police?

WESLEY LOWERY:  This is Ferg—well, it’s a combination, it’s was county police, there was, I believe there was some Ferguson Police, and also some other state agencies, I mean …

TOM JOYNER:  And all of them white?

WESLEY LOWERY:  I believe all of them inside of McDonald’s white.  At one point we saw a black officer outside while they were holding us, but all these officers in the McDonald’s are white.  So they throw me off, my phone is still recording in my left hand, but I dropped everything else in my right hand and I’m saying to them; I’m not going to resist, you can arrest me, I’m not resisting, I’m not resisting.  And they’re saying to me; you are resisting, stop resisting.  And that, frankly, was the most horrified I’ve been, because I’ve just seen too many videos of people who were allegedly resisting arrest/not resisting arrest, these things happening.  And so I’m telling them, I’m not resisting …

TOM JOYNER:  This sounds like a foreign countr …

WESLEY LOWERY:  I’m not resisting, I’m not resisting, I’m not, you can arrest me, my hands are behind my back.  I know that I’m going to be fine as long as nothing happens to me physically.  And so I’m telling them; I’m not resisting, you can arrest me.  So then …

SYBIL WILKES:  Are you still recording at this time?

WESLEY LOWERY:  I recorded through most of it.  So the video we posted, I think there are maybe five or ten seconds after that that I think our video editors cut out.  But for the most part, until they physically threw me it recorded.  And then I, the phone dropped out of my hand as the Coke started splashing on my arm, because I was up against the fountain soda machine.  And so I have some of this recorded, at least the audio of it, it goes black.  But then they, they take me outside, and as I’m walking out I see Ryan’s still in the corner having more of a verbal conversation, I was telling him; tweet that they’re arresting me, tweet that they’re arresting me.

He didn’t have that opportunity; moments later they’re slamming him into something, putting him in cuffs bringing him out. As we’re coming out some of the res—some of the people who had been in the McDonald’s, actually some nice, we had some very nice conversations with some of the, there was a woman that came up to me right bef—a few minutes before; hey, are you with the media?  I see your, and we had a kind of nice back and forth, not an interview, we were just chatting.  You know, civil.  And she’s screaming out to me; why are they arresting you?

And I said; for videotaping them.  And that alerted a few journalists who were in a broader area; I think there was a picture of Ryan taken in his cuffs.  We are standing outside at this point, outside the McDonald’s in the middle of the street, and they have a police tank, you know, one of the big trucks they use to transport people.  And as we’re, and initially they want to put us in this and they open the back door and there are two people in there.

There’s one sitting on one of the benches, there are benches on both sides, and then the other person is this large, large black man, had to be well over 250, probably 300, 350 pounds, who cannot sit on the bench …

TOM JOYNER:  Wait a minute, Wesley, Wesley, Wesley, Wesley …

WESLEY LOWERY:  Yes?

TOM JOYNER:  I’m, I’m, I’m out of time.

WESLEY LOWERY:  Oh, you’re out of time?  (Laugh)

TOM JOYNER:  I’m so out of town.

WESLEY LOWERY:  This man was screaming for paramedics and they refused to give him one.  That’s the end of my story.  That’s the end of that story.  Imagine the Eric Garner video.  That is what happened in front of us, the guy was locked up.

TOM JOYNER:  But you are all right?

WESLEY LOWERY:  I am all right physically, and like I said before a few times, I’ve seen residents of Ferguson be actually injured.  I am not injured.  I’m fine.  We’re going to be fine.  This story shouldn’t be about me, but in a same way this is an anecdote about what’s going on in the ground here.  If I was dealt with this way, another reporter was dealt with this way, imagine residents who don’t have the legal power of The Washington Post behind them, who don’t have people noticing them being arrested and tweeting; hey, is that reporter getting arrested?  So that’s why, listeners who aren’t here and aren’t seeing this, that’s the context I get from this, I don’t want people to feel sorry for me.  I’m in the field right now reporting on it.

Louis native son rapper/actor Nelly spoke about the Mike Brown case and what he feels needs to happen next.

Said Nelly,

“I understand the frustration, but we have to strategize before we overreact … We don’t get no do-over on sh*t like this, so we have to do it right the first time. Ain’t nothing happen no different that hasn’t been happening … At the end of the day, we should have waited to strategize first and take all the right steps to organize.”

T.I. also weighed in on the matter saying,

“We needed to play chess instead of checkers. We should have waited to see if justice was going to be served first … We shouldn’t have played our strongest hand first.”

Nelly wanted to do something constructive to help so he just started a scholarship fund in Mike Brown’s name with help of T.I., Kevin Hart and NBA star Al Jefferson. The 4 celebrities each pledged $15,000 a year in college tuition to teens chosen by the Brown Family.

(AP) — A candlelight vigil for an unarmed black man who was fatally shot by a suburban St. Louis police officer was followed by unrest as crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted officers who tried to block access to parts of the city.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said 32 people were arrested for various infractions including assault, burglary and theft. Schellman said two officers suffered minor injuries and that there were no reports of civilians hurt.

The tensions erupted after a candlelight vigil Sunday night for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday in a scuffle with an officer. The investigation into what led to the shooting was ongoing.

Though police have said that Brown was involved in a scuffle with the officer who shot him, other reports say eyewitnesses at the scene and the friend with him said that Brown was confronted by police, words were exchanged and he was shot while his hands were up.

Photos on social media show an uncovered Brown dead in the street for a undetermined time, as police blocked access to the apartment buildings where Brown was shot. Twitter users in Ferguson as well as a local reporter highlighted the unrest, as well as the call for an investigation that finds out exactly what happened.

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said that on Saturday, an officer encountered Brown and another man outside an apartment complex in Ferguson. One of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who fought with the officer.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn’t known and that all shell casings at the scene matched the officer’s gun. Police were investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and it wasn’t clear if he was armed.

Eyewitnesses dispute this account, saying that the police version of events is not what happened.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV there’s no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn’t yet put to use.

Jackson said blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him. Toxicology tests can take weeks to complete.

In the ensuing protest, several businesses were looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer, and carted rims away from a tire store. Some climbed atop police cars as the officers with riot shields and batons stood stoic nearby, trying to restrict access to the most seriously affected areas.

Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used Brown’s death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.

“Most came here for a peaceful protest but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. … I can understand the anger and unrest but I can’t understand the violence and looting,” Trout, 53, said.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries as of about 11 p.m. But there were scattered reports of assaults into the very early morning. Pat Washington, a spokeswoman for Dooley, said tear gas had been used. Authorities would not immediately confirm media reports of gunfire.

“The small group of people are creating a huge mess,” Mayor James Knowles said. “Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. … We’re only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.”

Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting “Don’t shoot me” while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn’t use force; the crowd eventually left.

In a new development, the shadowy Internet hactivist group {Anonymous}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)""> says they will be monitoring the behavior of the police dealing with protesters in the incidents and will attack Ferguson’s police department web and technology accounts if they don’t treat protestors to the letter of the law. They have also tweeted their support of the unoffical version of the shooting thus far.

An Internet hashtag #IfWeWereGunnedDown is trending in response to the Brown shooting. It is young people showing pictures of themselves doing various things – smoking, having fun, looking “menacing” next to graduation pictures, military pictures in uniform and more, to make the point that the media may misrepresent them to suit an agenda if they were killed.

Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she didn’t understand why police didn’t subdue her high school graduate son with a club or stun gun, and that the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

“I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,” she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

“We’re outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,” said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.

Ferguson’s population of about 21,000 people is almost 70 percent black. The race of the officer has not been disclosed. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.

St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, and Dooley said he will request an FBI investigation. The U.S. Justice Department said Attorney General Eric Holder instructed staff to monitor developments.",NA,NA,NA,2 reads

She was photographed with Delsurea Harris, Michael Brown’s grandmother at a news conference earlier in the week. Parks later tweeted:

Since Nelly is repping the Lou when he’s rapping, his fans felt the owed the Brown family and the city of Ferguson a little bit more support. Several of his followers pointed out that he talked to Lesley McSpaddden, Brown’s mother and to his credit he did not do so for the publicity.

Both teens were unarmed.

In the heartbreaking and powerful letter, published on {Time.com,}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3136685/travyon-sybrina-fulton-ferguson/""> Fulton urges McSpadden not to allow the character assassination of her son perpetuated by some media outlets and law enforcement, to define who he was:

Facts, myths, and flat out lies are already out there in Michael’s case. Theories, regardless of how ridiculous, are being pondered by the pundits. My advice is to surround yourselves with proven and trusted support. Through it all, I never let go of my faith, my family, or my friends. Long after the overwhelming media attention is gone, you will need those three entities to find your ‘new normal.’ Honor your son and his life, not the circumstances of his alleged transgressions. I have always said that Trayvon was not perfect. But no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed.

A recently released autopsy reports shows that Officer Wilson shot Michael Brown at least 6 times, at least twice in the head, before leaving him uncovered on the pavement.

The Ferguson police department refused to release his name for 5 days, even though it’s legally a matter of public record. And once Wilson’s identity was revealed, it was also discovered that he had been allowed to leave town on paid administrative leave.

He added that the source “reached out to us, we did not seek out this person.”

Harkinson’s source said that Anon members were firmly united behind the group’s recent efforts in Ferguson:

Per Harkinson:

It has been a busy few days for Operation Ferguson. The hackers shut down the city’s website for a few hours on Sunday night and Tuesday morning, posted the home address and number of police chief John Belmar, and dropped an email bomb that crammed city and police inboxes with junk messages. The goal was “to get journalists like you to do interviews with us, and incidentally maybe talk about the issue at hand in the process,” Fawkes told me. “Looks like it worked.” Early this morning, the allied Twitter account @TheAnonMessage announced that it had access to emergency response recordings related to Brown’s death.",NA,NA,NA,2 reads

“To keep seeing things escalate makes me upset…I don’t know what I can do with my voice other than make other people aware… I wish #MichaelBrown was alive to tell his side of the story, somehow we never get to hear the other side when things like this happen. I don’t think it’s a race thing, I think the police training is outdated, I don’t know maybe the sensitivity has risen due to 9/11 but I really think it’s time for new procedures based on all these accidental killings. #PrayforFerguson.”

Needless to say, Draya got a lot of backlash from what she posted. Which is why she went on Twitter to smooth things over

“And yeah I was just saying, we can’t fix the race issues… But we can train the people to protect and serve us better procedures,” the reality TV star tweeted. “Poor choice of words saying accidental :: I meant homicides that just shouldn’t have happened . I apologize. Sincerely,” Draya said while addressing the haters and the dust up over her Instagram post. “You use voices for whatever you want on your own page… Talking @ me, isn’t going to do much.

“I don’t know how that came off ignorant … But ok… Screaming out racism isn’t going to change what’s inside these people’s head,” she continued.
OK, there you have it straight from Draya Michelle. What say ye? Sound off below.

BlackAmericaWeb,baw11,http://blackamericaweb.com/2014/08/13/say-what-gilbert-arenas-calls-rev-al-sharpton-a-thot/,Say What?! Gilbert Arenas Calls Rev. Al Sharpton A Thot,Tonya Pendleton,08/13/14,06/09/16,"NBA bust Gilbert Arenas, who last played for a Chinese basketball team decided to take to his Instagram today to talk about Rev. Al Sharpton and give his thoughts on the Mike Brown shooting. Predictably, Arenas quickly made a fool of himself, calling Sharpton a “coon” and a “thot’ for heading to St. Louis to assist in the Ferguson, Missouri unrest.

Here’s what Arenas had to say:

“I would like to start off by saying too the family of the victim GOD BLESS#RIPmichealbrown you will be missed: too EVERY African American out there..how dumb are we really???every time we hear some bad news, the first thing we do is #RIOT #ROB #STEAL #BURN sh-t in our OWN neighborhoods..this racism fight has never been #blackvswhite, it’s ALWAYS been #blackvsblack from what the stats.. About 10 riots from the black community over the years and the only thing damaged ,was the BLACK COMMUNITY by The BLACK COMMUNITY..only reason they issue riot police isssss just in case you actually got smart enough to walk 6 blocks ,YALL ain’t f-cking up white rich sh-t smdh”

“FAMILiES of the victims pleaseeeeee stop asking #alsharpton to speak or ur behalf,you have a better chance having #caesar the monkey from #planetoftheapes to get justice for you..the stats also show AL coon sharpton has not helped one situation he has protested at,he actually made it worst and because of him the jury goes the other way..(think about it) Jena six,trayvon and the list goes back way back..#AL ur like a #THOT in the club,lookn for attention what u said at trayvons rally #enoughisenough ur right were tired of u PRETENDING”

Of course, Arenas, who says that he’s given over $100,000 to D.C. school while he played for the Washington Wizards and that he gave away $300,000 worth of shoes to needy kids, didn’t mention his own stupidity got him drummed out of the NBA.

You may remember that Arenas was suspended in 2010 when he and Wizards teammate Javaris Crittenton pulled multiple guns on each other during a dispute over a card game on Christmas Eve of 2009. Arenas pled guilty to a misdemeanor gun charge in 2012 and served two years of probation.

The NBA suspended him for 50 games and he last played in the NBA for the Memphis Grizzlies in 2012. (Arenas still collects a lucrative NBA contract and will through 2015, he said recently.) Crittenton was also suspended and was ultimately released by the Wizards, his last NBA team. In 2013, he  was indicted on murder charges in Georgia.

Arenas has four children with longtime girlfriend Gloria Govan, who appeared on Basketball Wives: LA. Her sister Laura Govan is married to L.A. Clipper Matt Barnes and was also part of the Basketball Wives franchise.",NA,NA,NA,5 reads
BlackAmericaWeb,baw12,http://blackamericaweb.com/2014/08/15/breaking-robbery-now-alleged-in-mike-brown-shooting/,"BREAKING: Robbery Now Alleged in Mike Brown Shooting, Officer ID’ed [PHOTO, VIDEO]",David A. Lieb; Alan Scher Zagier; The Associated Press,08/15/14,06/09/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — A suburban St. Louis police chief on Friday identified the officer whose fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager ignited days of heated protests, and released documents alleging the teen was killed after a robbery in which he was suspected of stealing a $48.99 box of cigars.

Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, were suspected of taking a box of cigars from a convenience store in Ferguson that morning, according to police reports. Jackson said Wilson went to the area after a 911 call reporting a “strong-arm” robbery just before noon. He said a dispatcher gave a description of the robbery suspect, and Wilson, who had been assisting on another call, was sent to investigate.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the police department, encountered Brown just after 12:01 p.m., with a second officer arriving three minutes later, Jackson said.

Brown’s uncle, Bernard Ewing, questioned whether Wilson really believed Brown was a suspect. He noted Johnson’s account that the officer told the two young men to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk, and that Brown had his hands up when he was shot.

“If he’s a robbery suspect, they would have had the lights on,” Ewing said. “If you rob somebody, you would tell them, ‘Get on the ground’ or something, not, ‘Get off the sidewalk.'”

“It still doesn’t justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,” he added. “You still don’t shoot him in the face.”

A phone message seeking comment from the family’s attorney, Benjamin Crump, wasn’t immediately returned.

Brown’s death has sparked several days of clashes with furious protesters in the city. The mood was quelled on Thursday after the governor turned oversight of the protests over to the state Highway Patrol. State troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of peaceful protesters replaced the image of previous nights: police in riot gear and armored tanks.

But the police chief’s announcement Friday was met with immediate disbelief and anger by several dozen community members who also attended the news conference, which was hastily held at a gas station burned during a night of looting earlier in the week in Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

“He stopped the wrong one, bottom line,” yelled Tatinisha Wheeler, a nurse’s aide who was at the news conference.

A couple dozen protesters began marching around the charred gas station and in the street chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” and, “What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!”

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer’s weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times, according to police.

Dorian Johnson has told media a different story. He said he and Brown were walking in the street when an officer ordered them onto the sidewalk, then grabbed his friend’s neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He said Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Tensions in Ferguson boiled over after a candlelight vigil Sunday night, as looters smashed and burned businesses in the neighborhood, where police have repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

By Thursday, there was a dramatic shift in the atmosphere after Gov. Jay Nixon assigned protest oversight to Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black and grew up near Ferguson. He marched alongside protesters, along with other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol and the St. Louis County Police Department.

“We’re here to serve and protect,” Johnson said. “We’re not here to instill fear.”

The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell — the point at which previous protests have grown tense — no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.

“All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,” Pedro Smith, who has participated in the nightly protests, said Thursday. “This is totally different. Now we’re being treated with respect.”

The more tolerant response came as President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time about the shooting — and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson.

Obama said there was “no excuse” for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.

Attorney General Eric Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed witnesses to the shooting.

“What’s up to the family down in St. Louis,” Baisden says. “There haven’t been many days that I’ve felt a void or a loss since I’ve been off the air  I have during this situation down in Ferguson. So to the family down in St. Louis, please tell Michael Brown’s family that I’m doing everything I can through {Baisden Live}<hyperlink=""http://www.michaelbaisden.com/""> on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to support them. The great thing about being on in the afternoon is that we had a chance to support them as all these marches were happening  so we were able to have a plan together and to tell the truth about what was going on. I miss you family, and its hard to be on the sidelines for something like this, but I’m sure it’s all going to work out.”

At the 2014 Tom Joyner Allstate Family Reunion which takes place in Orlando August  28 through September 1, Baisden will be hosting the  ‘Raise Your Hand Relationship Seminar,”a mentoring panel for young men and auditioning actors for his stage play Men Cry In The Dark  II. Baisden has committed himself to working with a group of young Black males in the Orlando area and part of what they’re taught is how to respond to the police.

“We’re going to talk about how to respond to the police. We do that at the beginning of every year. We bring police officers in and all of the boys have individual mentors. Mad love to all the churches in Orlando who pitched in and helped us get mentors. The first two books we’re reading are {Rich Dad, Poor Dad}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680011#""> by Robert Kiyosaki and {Think and Grow Rich}<hyperlink=""https://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Dennis-Kimbro-ebook/dp/B0054KLWOE?ie=UTF8&keywords=kimbro%20think%20and%20grow%20rich&qid=1408459301&ref_=sr_1_1&s=books&sr=1-1""> by Dennis Kimbro. It’s not just an mentoring issue, it’s an economic issue and we need to own those businesses in our community.”

Its unnerving and frustrating for many parents to think that part of raising their sons to be men is ensuring they know how not get killed by the police. It’s particularly frustrating when those are the very people who are supposedly trained to protect them.

“Someone needs to teach these cops how to respond to us. It’s a lot of police both Black and white, who are afraid of us. This is what the Captain has been saying down there in Ferguson – you have to have a relationship with the people. Cops used to walk the beat and we actually touched the cops, talked to the cops and sat down on a park bench with the cops. That’s part of the problem we’re having right now. This occoupation down there it’s like the Keystone cops nonsense down there. Mad love to the protestors. People don’t want to be invisible. When you’re invisible the only thing you can do is protest. That is the voice of the power and that’s what you see happening right now.”

Baisden understand the pain Black men face every day. That’s why he’s taking his book turned stage play Men Cry In The Dark II on the road. He’ll be auditioning at the Family Reunion with Leah Daniels IYes, Lee’s sister)  and is searching for unknowns as well as experienced actors.

“If you’re an unknown it doesn’t matter. I was an unknown radio personality I was an unknown author so you have to know I’m going to be promoting unknowns.”

Presented by Lexus and hosted by Laz Alonso, each 30-minute episode features star-studded musical guests and spoken word performances from some of the most profound poets around.

HelloBeautiful caught up with one such artist, Prentice Powell, a Oakland, California native who has had the distinct honor of being the only poet to grace the “Verses And Flow” stage every year since the show’s inception. You may have also seen the 2013 NAACP Image Award Nominee on the “Arsenio Hall Show,” touring with singer Jill Scott or performing at your nearest slam with his spoken word poetry collective, Fiveology, a group of five talented, passionate, and internationally recognized artists. And if you haven’t seen him perform yet, whew, you’re in for a treat! This season of “Verses And Flow,” is unlike any other, he says.

“It was a really really different experience this season for me,” Powell tells us. “Usually I’ve had the opportunity to perform individually but I was blessed by Lexus ‘Verses And Flow’ and asked to be back to be a part of an organization called IconMan which is all about highlighting Black men in general. They highlight your local mailman, your coach who coaches the local basketball team in his free time, Harry Belafonte and other prominent Black men.

So what I was asked to do by ‘Verses And Flow’ is to write and introductory piece for the season. [It] was really different because usually they know your poems, they look and see what they like and you do your own poems, but I was asked to write something specifically for this season. Not only to do that, but to write for four other people as well. So I was able to share the stage with Lance Reddick, Aldis Hodge, Wesley Jonathan and Jay Ellis…it was really wonderful. It was a great experience to get up there and perform with other people who were doing my work — a completely new experience for me.”

Now, he didn’t want to spoil that group performance since it will open tonight’s seasons premiere, but Powell did give us a taste of a poem that he recorded that didn’t make it on the show–and if this is what was left on the cutting room floor, we can’t wait to see more. The piece (in the video above) expresses the poet’s thoughts on what it means to be a Black man in America, a particularly potent narrative and perspective in the wake of Michael Brown’s death by police and the current aftermath in Ferguson, Missouri that has shaken the nation.

In addition to Powell, more than 25 other mic-dropping poets will appear on this year’s eight-episode season of “Verses And Flow” that will also feature the soulful sounds of artists including Maxwell, K. Michelle, Joe, Johnny Gill, Ruben Studdard, Candice Glover, Gary Clark Jr., Sebastian Mikael, Leela James, Anthony Hamilton, Alice Smith and Mali Music. You won’t want to miss it!

“The autopsy concludes our worst fears. He was shot multiple times, the most troubling being the head shots. This is only part of the story. Dr. Baden was not allowed to have his clothes to see if there was gunshot residue on them,” Attorney Crump says.

Glen Ivey expands on the importance of Attorney General Eric Holder stepping in.

“It’s a big step that the Attorney General intervened in this way,” Ivey says. “It was critical for him to move forward with that and it’s important that the Feds have a parallel investigation.”

The “Just Keke” host found this out firsthand when she weighed in on the Michael Brown shooting and resulting protests on Twitter.

Palmer received “extreme backlash” when she posted the following tweet, which questioned the reason why people were killing and causing harm as she advised her followers to stop using race to separate themselves:

“Oh my Lord, bless Mike Brown & his family. This is terrible. Why y’all? Why do we do this to each other. Why do we hate each other, harm each other, kill each other? We are brothers & sisters y’all. All colors! Peace is the answer. Stop separating yourself through race. That’s the issue. We actually think that’s a thing, we are ALL family! You don’t stop hate with hate. Come on now, MLK taught us that. If you want to end racism, you start by not generalizing/grouping ppl w/ the thought that they all believe the same things.”

Aware of the backlash, Palmer addressed her tweet during an interview with the Huffington Post, as she confessed that she might have been naïve when speaking on what was going on. In addition, the actress mentioned that she planned to visit Ferguson to get a better understanding of what was going on:

“Being naïve is never anything to be ashamed of, because I believe me being naïve [to racism] is what has allowed me to do all the things that I can because if I believe in and quote what’s realistic then I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing right now. I simply wouldn’t be ‘Cinderella’ on Broadway, I wouldn’t have ‘Just KeKe,’” she stated.

“I wouldn’t have done any of the things that I’ve done. So I think that’s a play on people’s ideas of what they can’t do and what they believe is possible. And for me, I believe everything is possible. That’s the way that I was raised, and from what I’ve been able to do I’ve seen that to be true that your reality is what you make it.”
Regarding her opinion of the Mike Brown situation, Palmer said:

“As far as what’s going on with Mike Brown, I spoke up on that, because unproductive outrage has never gotten us anywhere. Even with MLK and everything that he did for black people…all he spoke about was unity, because throwing hate and being angry, and violence, that doesn’t give us peace and equality. That’s like having sex in order to get your virginity. It’s just the complete opposite thing to do.

“I don’t have all the answers and there are no quick fixes for things like this. But uniting and coming together on one clear message and trying to get that message across is much better than us all being everywhere and fighting against one another and coming from all different sides. That’s never going to get us anywhere.”

Witnesses have said the officer was white and Brown was black. The shooting has prompted violent protests in Brown’s community.

Obama says he and wife Michelle send their deepest condolences to Brown’s family and community. He says the Justice Department is continuing to investigate the situation along with local officials.

The president also called on people to comfort each other “in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. “

If you’re a person of color hoping to get hired by a political campaign, here’s the ugly truth: You’ll probably get paid less than your white counterparts, if you’re even hired at all. On both sides of the aisle, there is a racial pay gap in campaign politics. Asian, Black and Latino staffers are paid less than their white counterparts, according to an analysis by the New Organizing Institute. For example, African-American staffers on Democratic campaigns were paid 70 cents for each dollar their white counterparts made.

KEM:  Yeah, I think they need to.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah, yeah.  All right, let’s change gears here.

J. ANTHONY BROWN:  Let’s get it smooth, eh?  Smooth it out.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah, let’s get smooth.  Let’s get smooth.  First of all, I have a favor to ask.

KEM:  Yeah?

TOM JOYNER:  Sybil’s birthday is coming up this tomorrow.

SYBIL WILKES:  It’s tomorrow.

KEM:  It’s tomorrow.

TOM JOYNER:  It’s tomorrow, it’s tomorrow.

SYBIL WILKES:  Yeah.

TOM JOYNER:  Sybil’s birthday is tomorrow, you’re here today.

KEM:  Yeah.

TOM JOYNER:  If you could bang out a Happy Birthday …

J. ANTHONY BROWN:  Bang out Sybil?  (Laughter) You can bang out Sybil.

TOM JOYNER:  It’s early in the morning.

J. ANTHONY BROWN:  He’ll be holding it to you.

SYBIL WILKES:  It wasn’t the way I would’ve asked him.

TOM JOYNER:  You wouldn’t have put it quite that way.

J. ANTHONY BROWN:  You can’t top that with a car.

TOM JOYNER:  Not in …

SYBIL WILKES:  Off air, maybe, Kem, but

TOM JOYNER:  But you can’t bang out a Happy Birthday.

J. ANTHONY BROWN:  Bang out Sybil.  (Laugh)

SYBIL WILKES:  Bang out a Happy Birthday.

J. ANTHONY BROWN:  Put my name on that bang.  (Laughter)

SYBIL WILKES:  Now you’re ruining the moment, Jay.  (Laughter)

TOM JOYNER:  Kem is going to be with us at the Family Reunion.

SYBIL WILKES:  Yes, he is.

JAB:  Yes, he will.

TOM JOYNER:  And I don’t know, when have you been home last?  Because every time you go to a market to promote your new music …

KEM:  Yeah?

TOM JOYNER:  … I hear about it, because in Texas they text me at 646464, and you’ve been a lot of places.  When the last time you’ve been back to Detroit?

KEM:  It’s been a minute.  You know, I told you, we already are promoting Promise To Love, which is out on August 25th, like I’m running for President.  I’m campaigning like I’m running for President.  But, you know, serious talk though, I don’t take my listenership for granted

TOM JOYNER:  No, you don’t.  You never have.

KEM:  So it’s important to go into these markets and see people face to face and thank them, you know, for their support of this classic R&B music face to face.  You know, I learned that from you, man.  I learned that from you, getting up at 3, 4 o’clock in the morning, man, out in the parking lot of Ralph’s and Kroger’s, you know what I mean?  (Laughter)

TOM JOYNER:  I like hugs and kisses.  You know?  Nice bosomy hugs too.

KEM:  Yeah, nothing happens without the people, man.  You got to let the people know you appreciate them.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah.  And you do, you do.

SYBIL WILKES:  And this will coincide with your fundraising event, your charity, Mack and Third.

KEM:  Right, Mack and Third.

TOM JOYNER:  It’s time for that again.

KEM:  Mack and Third Live is happening on the 24th, the day before the release of the album, in Detroit.  It’s an event, it’s a flagship event of my foundation, Mack and Third, which puts resources back in the hands of organizations and individuals that help people, like the people that helped me when I was homeless and in my addiction in Detroit.  It’s a concert, it’s a benefit, people can come and get, you know, wellness services, blood pressure, cholesterol, activities for the kids, feed the homeless, collect canned goods, you know, so it’s good, I’m performing, and I’ve got some good friends of mine, and yours, the OJ’s are performing as well.

SYBIL WILKES:  Nice.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah.

KEM:  So it’s going to be a, we’re going to have a good time.

TOM JOYNER:  Good, good, good.  And you’re raising money for your foundation.

KEM:  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.

TOM JOYNER:  Okay.  Let me donate $5,000 to your foundation.  From me personally.

KEM:  I appreciate that, man.

SYBIL WILKES:  Nice.

KEM:  Thank you so much.

SYBIL WILKES:  Very nice.

KEM:  Yeah, absolutely.

TOM JOYNER:  Because your foundation helps …

SYBIL WILKES:  The people of Detroit.

KEM:  It helps people of the metropolitan Detroit area.

SYBIL WILKES:  Put Sybil down and me for $5,000.

TOM JOYNER:  Put Sybil, put your name on this too?

J. ANTHONY BROWN:  Yeah.

TOM JOYNER:  Put your name on this $5,000?

SYBIL WILKES:  Jay would like to donate $5,000.

J. ANTHONY BROWN:  Yeah.

TOM JOYNER:  Put your name on the $5,000 donation?

J. ANTHONY BROWN:  Yes, yes.  (Laugh) It’s for a good cause, right?

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah.

J. ANTHONY BROWN:  Put my name on it.

TOM JOYNER:  Put your name on it.

KEM:  Yeah, but we’re helping people in the city of Detroit.

TOM JOYNER:  You’re not going to put anything on it?

J. ANTHONY BROWN:  I just did.  (Laughter)

SYBIL WILKES:  Oh, Lord.

TOM JOYNER:  When we come back we’ll talk about the new music, and KEM will bang out Happy Birthday.

KEM:  Watch out, now.

TOM JOYNER:  Promise To Love.

SYBIL WILKES:  That’s the new CD coming out next week.

TOM JOYNER:  It goes on sale next week.

KEM:  Yes, sir.

TOM JOYNER:  Kem, all right, let’s take a listen to this new CD.  This is called Nobody.

[Song]

SYBIL WILKES:  Hmm.

TOM JOYNER:  Ron Isley is featured?

KEM:  Yeah, Ron Isley on My Favorite Thing, yeah, yeah, you know about that.

[Song]

TOM JOYNER:  This sounds real for you.

KEM:  Oh, yeah.

TOM JOYNER:  Don’t Say Goodbye.

[Song]

SYBIL WILKES:  That’s your girl.

KEM:  That’s my artist, that’s my artist, El Renay, who’s also from Detroit, her record is coming out at the top of the year, but I put her single, Don’t Say Goodbye, on my record.

SYBIL WILKES:  Nice.

TOM JOYNER:  I fell in love with her on the cruise.

KEM:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, she’s that, she’s that.

SYBIL WILKES:  And good reason, she is phenomenal.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah.

KEM:  Yes, and a sweetheart too.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah.  Still got the short and sexy hair?

KEM:  Absolutely.  Yeah.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah, I like that.  I like that.  (Laughter) I really like that.  You hooked up with Snoop Dogg?

KEM:  Snoop Dogg’s on this record.

TOM JOYNER:  Snoop Dogg and Kim.

KEM:  Yeah, I know it sound, it sounds crazy, right?

TOM JOYNER:  (Laugh)

SYBIL WILKES:  Yeah, it does, yeah.

KEM:  But somebody sent me a YouTube of Snoop and 2Chainz(?) singing I Can’t Stop Loving You.  Right?  So this rap that I was going to do myself, as soon as I saw it, I was like, dude, why rap when you can get a real rapper, you know what I mean?  And we put the word out and, uh, and he graced us, he graced us with this presence on this album, I love him.

[Song]

TOM JOYNER:  Aw, you didn’t put the rap on there.  Okay, okay, okay.  Soft Side of Love.

[Song]

TOM JOYNER:  Why don’t you come on over for dinner?  And put that knew Kem on.  Oh, Lord, he put the new Kem on.

SYBIL WILKES:  Now I got to stay.

TOM JOYNER:  Now I got to stay, I didn’t come here for all this, I don’t …

[Song]

TOM JOYNER:  Oh, Lord, oh, Lord, oh, Lord.

SYBIL WILKES:  Hmm.

TOM JOYNER:  Okay, so how many Kem CDs are we up to now?

KEM:  This is the fourth studio album, not including the …

TOM JOYNER:  The Christmas …

KEM:  The Christmas record, but just my fourth studio album, yeah.  It’s hard to believe, man, I was thinking about that on the way over here.  I ain’t had a real job in over a decade.

SYBIL WILKES:  (Laugh)

TOM JOYNER:  Because it’s been ten years?

SYBIL WILKES:  Ten years.

KEM:  Yeah.  Yeah.

TOM JOYNER:  It’s been ten years?

ANTHONY BROWN: Out of your regular music, Kem, which is harder for you to put together? Christmas music?

KEM:  Christmas music is harder.

ANTHONY BROWN: It is, eh?

KEM:  Yeah.

ANTHONY BROWN: Because you got to write it in July or something like that.

KEM:  You got to do it – right.  Right.

SYBIL WILKES:  In July.

TOM JOYNER:  Kem, would you come out the basement?

ANTHONY BROWN: I’m writing Christmas songs!

TOM JOYNER:  Kem, I got a sandwich for you.

ANTHONY BROWN: I’m writing Christmas songs!

KEM:  Yeah, people picky about their Christmas music.

TOM JOYNER:  Aren’t you hungry, Kem.

ANTHONY BROWN: (Laugh) No, no.

SYBIL WILKES:  So in terms of picking your favorite Christmas songs?  Or being mindful of other people’s favorites?

KEM:  Either, you know, both.  I mean writing a Christmas song is like, you know, you can’t be really cheesy, you know what I mean, but you got to get all the words in there, and there’s only so many words you can put in a Christmas song, right?  And then when you’re doing somebody else’s record, every record’s been done so many times, so how are you going to approach this differently?  You know what I mean?

SYBIL WILKES:  Yeah, put that Kem spin on it.

[Song]

SYBIL WILKES:  There’s your Christmas, I mean, your wedding song right there.

KEM:  Yeah.

SYBIL WILKES:  There’s your wedding song.

ANTHONY BROWN: No one needs that.

SYBIL WILKES:  (Laugh)

TOM JOYNER:  Says the bitter brother.

SYBIL WILKES:  Everybody but ju, Bitter man, bitter man, bitter man.

ANTHONY BROWN: Yeah.

TOM JOYNER:  Someone just texted and said your single, It’s You, is going to be their wedding song when they get married in October.  You probably get a lot of requests to do weddings.

KEM:  Yeah, I do weddings.  Yeah, I’d be glad to sing at anybody’s wedding, you know?

SYBIL WILKES:  Aw.

TOM JOYNER:  Say what?

KEM:  For $75,000.  (Laughter) For $350,000 you can get me at your wedding.

ANTHONY BROWN: And I would like to.

SYBIL WILKES:  I would like to.

KEM:  But I’ve actually done that in the show, you know?  Somebody will propose at the show, you know?  And I’ve sang, I’ve gone to a couple of fan’s wedding and sang at their wedding.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah?

KEM: Yeah.

TOM JOYNER:  I don’t know why you said that today.

KEM:  Right?  (Laugh)

TOM JOYNER:  I’m going to send all these messages to you, okay?

ANTHONY BROWN: Yeah, you’re going to be busy.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah, you’re going to be busy.  (Laugh) Yeah.  And the single, It’s You.

KEM:  The single, It’s You.

TOM JOYNER:  Here it is.

TOM JOYNER:  Kem, and It’s You.  Promise To Love goes on sale next week.

KEM:  Next week, August 25th.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah.  And Happy Birthday, Sybil.

SYBIL WILKES:  Really, thank you so much.  This really is a great birthday present.  I’m telling you, this CD, really, yesterday just lifted my heart.  It really did.

TOM JOYNER:  All because you were riding around and trying to get Ferguson off your mind for a minute.

SYBIL WILKES:  Just consumed by all that’s going on and putting this in and driving yesterday just really took me to a whole other place, away from all of the madness and all of the sadness.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah, you listen to Kem and…

SYBIL WILKES:  I don’t like downtown with Snoop, you know, Kem, but all of …

TOM JOYNER:  And Jay, to get his mind off of everything, was watching ratchet reality shows last night.

SYBIL WILKES:  Everybody has their own …

ANTHONY BROWN: right.

TOM JOYNER:  All right, Kem, well, good luck on album, CD number four.

KEM:  Number four. Yeah.

TOM JOYNER:  CD number four, Promise To Love.  On sale next week.

SYBIL WILKES:  And good luck with Mack and Third this weekend yeah.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah.

KEM:  Thank you, so much, and thanks, Tom, for the donation, we appreciate it, man.

TOM JOYNER:  You got it.  You got it.

SYBIL WILKES:  And we’ll see you next week.

KEM:  Absolutely.

TOM JOYNER:  Yeah, after I’ve made my donation I’ve got no other …

ANTHONY BROWN: Sybil should be dry by then. (Laughter)

TOM JOYNER:  I’ve got no other request to make a donation, but when you sang Happy Birthday everybody wants them to sing Happy Birthday to them now.  (Laugh) All right, Kem, thanks for dropping by, man.",NA,NA,NA,9 reads
