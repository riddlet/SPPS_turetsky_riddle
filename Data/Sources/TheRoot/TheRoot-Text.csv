As the nation followed the aftermath of the police shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in suburban Ferguson, Mo. — {including the detention of two journalists and the tear-gassing of at least one camera crew}<hyperlink=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/08/14/police_in_ferguson_tear_gas_tv_reporters_al_jazeera_camera_crew_flees.html?%20wpsrc=sh_all_mob_tw_top>, many journalism organizations rushed to condemn what they considered the unfair treatment of one of their own.

Others broadened their outrage to include the shooting death, the militarization of the local police force, the looting and the treatment of citizens.

But at the Washington convention of the Asian American Journalists Association, where Executive Director Kathy Chow said Thursday that 770 people had assembled, including ""close to 600"" registrants, it seemed to be business as usual.

""Different members are talking about it,"" AAJA President Paul Cheung told Journal-isms, speaking of Ferguson. ""People here are focusing on jobs and career, and you tend to be in a bubble"" at conventions.

The {National Association of Black Journalists issued a statement Wednesday}<hyperlink=https://nabj.site-ym.com/news/news.asp?id=186548> after Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery, a former NABJ board member, and Huffington Post reporter Ryan J. Reilly were detained that day in Ferguson.

NABJ President Bob Butler then wrote his own piece for CNN.com, updated Friday under the headline ""{Press freedom in Ferguson: Is this 1964 or 2014?}<hyperlink=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/opinion/butler-ferguson-arrests-journalists/index.html>"" He compared events in Missouri with the battlegrounds of the civil rights movement. Errin Whack, NABJ's vice president for print, wrote from the scene on Thursday under the Slate headline, ""{This is America in 2014? What I witnessed last night in Ferguson was appalling.}<hyperlink=http://fusion.net/story/6283/this-is-america-in-2014-what-i-witnessed-last-night-in-ferguson-was-appalling/>""

The {National Association of Hispanic Journalists followed NABJ}<hyperlink=http://nahj.org/nahj-condemns-reporter-arrests/> on Thursday with a statement of support for the NABJ position.

Then came the {American Society of News Editors}<hyperlink=http://asne.org/blog_home.asp?Display=1743>, the {Associated Press Media Editors}<hyperlink=http://www.apme.com/>, the {Radio Television Digital News Association}<hyperlink=http://rtdna.org/article/rtdna_condemns_assaults_and_arrests_of_reporters_in_ferguson#.U-9YuWPdmZQ> and a {coalition of 48 national media organizations}<hyperlink=http://rcfp.org/media-coalition-protests-police-treatment-reporters-during-ferguson-events> led by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

""I look at it as a freedom of the press issue,"" Cheung said. ""Any journalist should be outraged.""

Some saw more. Jeff Yang, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, called the relative silence at AAJA ""shocking.""

A recurring theme for Asian Americans, Yang said, was ""Do we belong here? This whole notion of belonging and who are our identities as Americans."" African Americans and Asian Americans would both bring that perspective to any conversation about Ferguson, he said. With each group, others are continually ""questioning our right to be here.""

Emil Guillermo, a longtime journalist who blogs for the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said, ""You can fault AAJA for not talking about Jim Risen,"" the New York Times reporter whom the Obama administration is trying to compel to reveal a source. ""You can fault AAJA for not really pressing about the diversity numbers."" But on the Ferguson issue, ""We kind of vacated our role.""

It's not that the story hasn't captivated individual members. Mi-Ai Parrish, president and publisher of the Kansas City Star, said ""everybody's asking me about it"" once they discover that she is from Missouri. But at the convention, ""you're kind of in a bubble,"" she agreed. ""It's a little bit isolated.""

{Gil Asakawa}<hyperlink=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gil-asakawa/>, another AAJA veteran and manager of student media at the University of Colorado’s School of Journalism and Mass Communication, said, ""I've been glued to the television all week and this story is amazing. I've been trying to extrapolate and relate [this] to the Asian American experience."" He said he immediately thought of the civil rights and anti-Vietnam movements of the 1960s.

""It always fascinated me that Asian Americans haven't been a part of that protest movement,"" Asakawa continued, with the exceptions of the {slaying of Detroit autoworker Vincent Chin in 1982}<hyperlink=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/opinion/why-vincent-chin-matters.html?_r=0> and protests by Korean Americans over racial tensions in the 1992 Los Angeles riots. ""It gives me pause,"" he said of the relative lack of public discussion at AAJA.

Phil Yu, who writes the popular {Angry Asian Man}<hyperlink=http://blog.angryasianman.com/> blog and moderated a panel on {""Why and how should we cover the Asian American community?}<hyperlink=http://www.c-span.org/video/?321020-2/media-asianamerican-community>"" (video) said afterward, ""You don't have to be black to understand suffering.""

Yu said that the mainstream media was not doing a good job of covering the Ferguson situation and that ""I get most of my information on Twitter."" Mainstream media was ""late to the game. When I was reading my Twitter feed, I went to the networks."" CNN, for example was airing a piece on Pope Francis' visit to South Korea.

Yu pointed to a piece by Arthur Chu in the Daily Beast that expanded on the identity question. It was titled ""Men Without a Country: Mike Brown, Trayvon Martin, My Father and Me,"" with the subtitle, ""{I can pretend to belong here better than Trayvon and Mike Brown were ever given the chance to}<hyperlink=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/12/men-without-a-country-mike-brown-trayvon-martin-my-father-and-me.html>. But however hard I try, however well they treat me, I know this is not my country.""

In one of many follow-ups to the fast-moving story, Reid Wilson wrote Thursday in the Washington Post of the racial disparity in government jobs. 

In the 100 largest metropolitan areas, Wilson wrote, ""{Mainly, it's Hispanic and Asian American populations missing out on government jobs}<hyperlink=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/08/14/racial-imbalance-exists-all-across-local-governments-not-just-in-police-departments/>. While the proportion of African Americans in high-wage jobs has equalized in recent decades, other non-white populations remain significantly below proportional representation.

""Government positions, which usually come with stability and good benefits, have long been a route to upward social mobility,"" been a route to upward social mobility,"" [Census Bureau historian Todd] Gardner wrote [for the Urban Institute.] ""Even half a century after the Civil Rights Act, African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans remain at a disadvantage in getting those jobs — especially in police departments.""

Cheung said Friday that AAJA's message was being delivered through the Unity: Journalists for Diversity coalition. Issued Friday, a Unity news release focused on the detention of Lowery and Reilly and quoted Unity President David Steinberg. ""Officers need to keep the public safe, but they also must respect the First Amendment rights of the journalists covering this story,"" Steinberg said.

{After Delays, Police Name Officer Who Killed Michael Brown}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/blogs/journalisms/2014/08/null>

""One day after roiling tensions over the police shooting of a black teenager here began to subside, emotions flared anew on Friday as the police identified the officer involved {but also released evidence that the victim was a suspect in a convenience store robbery moments before being shot}<hyperlink=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/us/darren-wilson-identified-as-officer-in-fatal-shooting-in-ferguson-missouri.html?_r=0>,"" Tanzina Vega, Timothy Williams and Erik Eckholm reported Friday for the New York Times.

""The manner in which the police here released the information, which included a 19-page police report on the robbery but no new details about the shooting, led to the spectacle of dueling police news conferences, one led by a white officer who seemed ill at ease and defensive, and the other dominated by a charismatic black officer who expressed solidarity with the crowd even as he pleaded for peace.

""The white officer, Thomas Jackson, the police chief in Ferguson, gave a series of incomplete accounts that sowed confusion about whether the officer who shot the teenager knew he was a suspect in the robbery. The black officer, Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, expressed his displeasure with how the information had been released.

"" 'I would have liked to have been consulted,' he said pointedly about the pairing of the shooter's identity with the robbery accusation.

""All week, community members had demanded the name of the officer who killed Michael Brown, 18, last Saturday, but when it finally came, it was accompanied by surveillance videotapes that appeared to show Mr. Brown shoving a store clerk aside as he stole a box of cigarillos. . . .""

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorialized Tuesday, ""{the failure to identify the officer violates every principle of transparency recommended by law enforcement experts}<hyperlink=http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/the-platform/editorial-governor-must-let-ferguson-be-where-better-%20begins/article_4a53e231-5b93-58d9-8935-accaf2cd9edd.html>. Society grants police officers the right to use deadly force. That right carries special obligations, one of which is strict public accountability. The longer the officer stays anonymous, the more public confidence is undermined. . . .""

{Balta, Ericksen Debate NAHJ Award to Fox News Latino}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/blogs/journalisms/2014/08/null>

The National Association of Hispanic Journalists' award to Fox News Latino last week prompted a radio faceoff Friday between immediate past president Hugo Balta, who presented the honor, and NAHJ co-founder Charlie Ericksen, who called it ""kind of a farce"" for the organization to praise Fox News.

Before the faceoff, however, the National Institute for Latino Policy made it known that it sides unambiguously with Ericksen.

The Institute {posted a Journal-isms column reporting Ericksen's remarks}<hyperlink=http://mije.org/richardprince/nahj-founder-calls-award-fox-farce> in an email and its director, longtime Latino activist Angelo Falcón told Journal-isms by email:

""The National Institute for Latino Policy considers Charlie Ericksen a revered elder of the Latino community and found Hugo Balta's dismissal of his concerns disrespectful. At the same time, we agree with Mr. Ericksen's position that for the National Association of Hispanic Journalists to honor Fox News in any form was disgraceful given their constant attacks on the Latino community. The existence of Fox News Latino does not negate the damage being done daily to our community by their parent company. As to whether Mr. Balta needs to apologize, we will leave that up to his conscience to grapple with.""

Referring to columnist Ruben Navarrette Jr., who wrote a column this week criticizing NAHJ, Falcón said, ""well, nobody seems to like the guy but we agree with him in this instance!""

The Latino Rebels website {posted audio of Balta's and Ericksen's appearance on New York's WBAI-FM}<hyperlink=http://www.latinorebels.com/2014/08/15/hugo-balta-and-charlie-ericksen-debate-nahjs-award-to-fox-news-latino-full-audio/> (audio) and summarized the 33-minute segment this way:

""Balta's position was that NAHJ needed to be more inclusive, especially since outlets like FOX News do employ Latinos and NAHJ members who work for FOX or its affiliates were at the event when Ericksen made his comments. Ericksen brought up the fact that this is all about how to ethically receive money, and how NAHJ's awards are now honoring news organizations and not individuals who work in those organizations. In addition, Ericksen did say that he does not watch FOX News or read Fox News Latino — a point Balta emphasized in the discussion. Balta said that Fox News Latino has become a successful digital outlet for Latinos, while Ericksen countered that such an award will make FOX News think that it is doing a good job with the Latino community.""

{AAJA's Sharon Chan Named to New Position at Seattle Times}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/blogs/journalisms/2014/08/null>

Sharon Pian ChanSharon Pian Chan, associate opinions editor/digital for the Seattle Times and national president of the Asian American Journalists Association from 2009 to 2010, has been named director of journalism initiatives for the Times, the newspaper announced on Thursday.

A news release said, "" 'This new role builds on our success at developing new funding sources to expand our storytelling, commentary and community engagement beyond what we could otherwise afford,' said Seattle Times publisher Frank Blethen. 'As one of the country’s last independent metro dailies, we are fiercely committed to our journalism/public service mission. Anything we can do to grow nontraditional revenue to expand our journalism is of significant benefit to our community.

"" 'As an experienced and highly regarded journalist, Sharon is the ideal fit for this new role. She already has extensive experience in the nonprofit journalism community.'

""Chan will focus on funding journalism by building partnerships between The Seattle Times, nonprofits and philanthropy. This special assignment reports to the publisher. Chan will begin in October. . . .""

Chan was vice president of Unity: Journalists for Diversity from 2011 to 2012.

The Times posted an announcement to fill Chan's job.

TheRoot,root2,http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2014/08/ferguson_s_white_city_government_must_change.html,Ferguson's White City Leadership Must Change,Charles D. Ellison,08/18/2014,12/01/2015,"From Ferguson, Mo., to similarly afflicted hoods: It’s about time to put the hands down and roll the sleeves up.

The strategy? A shrewdly engineered calculus for political engagement that fundamentally reshapes contemporary Ferguson. Sure, most of us are not on the ground in Ferguson, so I’ll take the predictable hit from some readers as Monday-morning quarterback. I didn’t rock the obligatory plane ticket to Missouri and prove my blackness in a blaze of hands-up glory. Easy for the chatty, tweeting lot of us to work our infinite rhetorical wisdom from keyboards.

But no one is doing Ferguson’s black residents any favors if a city with a population that is 67 percent African American continues operating politically like a postmodern 12 Years a Slave sequel. The {mayor}<hyperlink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Knowles_III> is a white Republican—and former Ferguson Police Department officer. The six-member City Council is all-white, save the one black member. The longtime all-white school board just got its first black member this April, shortly after it ousted the school district’s first black superintendent.

The reasons for this are, of course, as complex as they are shady by design. {St. Louis County,}<hyperlink=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/29/29189.html> the suburbia in which Ferguson sits, gets a proportion of representation, with its 70 percent white population matched with six white County Council members, and the 24 percent black population getting one black council member {who can’t pass}<hyperlink=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2014/06/18/st-louis-county-diversity-bills-on-hold/> a diversity contracting bill. And black County Executive Charlie Dooley {just lost his primary}<hyperlink=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2014/06/18/st-louis-county-diversity-bills-on-hold/> to a white County Council member sure to keep the racial status quo locked.

Now that Ferguson has captured our attention—along with bands of preachers, activists and pundits racing to the impoverished St. Louis suburb—when does the really impactful task of political organization and engagement begin?

If we took a random poll of folks who line that raucous stretch of several blocks in Ferguson, would they know the date of the next election?

This is where rubber meets the road. It’s all a fruitless and insanely typical exercise in badly channeled outrage if, come the next city electoral cycle, Ferguson’s disproportionately black, struggling and disenfranchised residents have not been tightly mobilized into an empowered political force to be reckoned with.

Until then, let’s put money on it that Ferguson stays the same. Same indifferent and indefensibly unrepresentative city government. We’ll keep having the same recycled discourse about police strategies and racial disparities, conveniently avoiding the much more consequential discussion about who’s running the show.

Where is the political action? Clearly, there are quite a few residents with time and energy on their hands to spend days standing around in protest—some either staring down riot-geared police and others popping off in violent expression. Frustrated that his racial magic trick with black state trooper and area native {Capt. Ron Johnson}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/_7_things_to_know_about_ronald_s_johnson_the_highway_patrol_captain_in_charge.html> didn’t work (the hilarity of watching folks fall for that was classic), Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, breaks down and calls the {National Guard,}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/autopsy_shows_michael_brown_was_shot_six_times_missouri_governor_orders.html?wpisrc=topstories> a move that some of us knew was coming.

But neither Nixon nor the rest of the entrenched Missouri political machine will suggest it’s time to overhaul Ferguson’s off-base system of three wards with two council members, and general election days scheduled in the middle of spring, rather than November, when few are paying attention. As a result, {black voter turnout}<hyperlink=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/15/how-ferguson-exposes-the-racial-bias-in-local-elections/> in the 2013 city election was 7 percent—compared with the relatively low white voter turnout of 17 percent.

Let’s stop insulting the intelligence of Ferguson’s residents: Political mobilization is hard, but it is possible. Low black turnout is not just Ferguson’s or St. Louis County’s institutionalized racism at work; it’s also an epic fail on the part of community leaders who long ago should have tapped into what could be a perpetually powerful black voting bloc.

Ferguson’s residents do have options, and they must begin the important phase of exercising them. Show them how to holistically master the political game through a blend of sophisticated advocacy and digital campaigns. Show them how to change not only faces in government but also the way their city, county and state tackles chronic poverty, unemployment, crime and bad schools. Organize idling residents looking for an outlet by creating political action committees, registering them to vote, advising them on the next elections or showing them how to force emergency ones in the immediate future. Have them identify candidates and leadership who will, finally, work in their best interests.",NA,274,NA,NA
TheRoot,root3,http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/ferguson_uprising_should_come_as_no_surprise.html,How Ferguson Has Exposed a Civil Rights Generational Divide,Peniel E. Joseph,08/18/2014,12/01/2015,"This past week’s racial crisis in Ferguson, Mo., has uncovered {a divide}<hyperlink=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/us/lack-of-leadership-and-a-generational-split-hinder-protests-in-ferguson.html?_r=0> within the black community—one based on generation, class and the cloudy political vision offered by African-American politics in the Obama age.

When asked who is the leader of the ongoing protests since the killing of Michael Brown—protests that have triggered Missouri’s governor to declare a state of emergency and curfew—one young man from St. Louis answered, “Do we have a leader? No,” and he went on to suggest that the martyred Brown, himself, offered the best example of leadership for Ferguson’s angry and alienated young people.

As last week progressed, protests on the streets of that city operated on two separate tracks: Civil rights leaders have organized effective nonviolent marches even as young protesters, and some would-be outlaws, have descended into violence and looting in parts of the city.

Leaders such as the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have visited Ferguson, but their pleas for calm have been ineffective.

Ironically, the black person who provided arguably the most visible leadership during the Ferguson events has been Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. {Ron Johnson}<hyperlink=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/mo-highway-patrol-captain-restores-order-ferguson-article-1.1905028>, whose forceful, yet compassionate, presence and policing tactics helped to temporarily defuse the escalating crisis.

That young people in Ferguson refused to heed calls for nonviolence should come as no surprise. Demonstrations at the height of the civil rights era featured sporadic incidents of violence waged by angry black Americans outraged at racism and poverty, but unwilling or unable to commit to the discipline of nonviolence. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. encountered these episodes in Birmingham, Ala., and Memphis, Tenn., and was famously heckled when he visited Watts in the aftermath of Los Angeles’ {1965 rebellion}<hyperlink=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_watts_rebellion_los_angeles_1965/>.

What makes the current situation different from the 1960s is that we have no Stokely Carmichael or Black Panthers who can properly relate to the young people in and outside of Ferguson, who have used the language of violence to convey rage and disappointment.

Make no mistake: Brown’s killing is not the root cause of Ferguson’s violence. It’s merely the spark that triggered it. Poverty, segregation, unemployment and a climate of anti-black racism haunt tiny Ferguson and the wider St. Louis metropolitan area. Riots, King reminded us, are “the language of the unheard” and oppressed.

It’s no wonder, then, that local young black men and women can’t identify a single black leader or organization as the leader of the chaotic demonstrations in which they have participated.

National black political leaders from the civil rights era have tried, through organizational outreach, speeches, media—both traditional and social—marches and demonstrations to reach out to and stay connected with a new generation of young people. But this effort bumps up against the limitations of resources and outreach.

America’s racial underclass, the off-the-grid hustlers and entrepreneurs whom many black elites ignore or demonize, rarely sees political leaders of any color advocating for them.

The divide, while generational on the surface, is also fueled by class, since young people with education, networks and access tend to view politics as a long-term process—one that comes with victories but also compromise and setbacks. Millions of young blacks have no entree to the nuances of American democracy and racial struggle. Their world is more painfully straightforward and wrenching—black folks get shot in the streets with no hope of justice.

The ideal response to this tragedy, one that our national civil rights narrative promotes but, in fact, was never entirely true, is for the entire black population of Ferguson to put on their best church clothes and nonviolently show the world what happened to Michael Brown.

But in the age of Obama, these young people find the lessons of the civil rights era increasingly hard to comprehend. Certainly, {the frequency}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/where_are_the_good_cops.html> of police killings of black men, the Iraq War-styled police presence in Ferguson, and the numbing persistence of racial segregation and violence make talk of racial progress ring hollow.

Putting civil rights leaders in a tough spot. They’re wary of being too critical of President Barack Obama’s track record on race and poverty, aware that the attorney general is his staunch ally and they’ve been pilloried by conservatives as “race hustlers,” eager to arouse the rabble. But perhaps most importantly, the very constituency they often claim to speak for—the voiceless black youths who have come out in Ferguson over the past week—find these leaders’ voices indistinguishable from the political white noise that only unfettered violence seems capable of breaking through.",1,1300,NA,NA

When Capt. Ronald S. Johnson came in front of the bright lights on Thursday evening to give his first press conference, critics of the investigation were once again assuaged. Johnson is an African-American man, unlike 94 percent of Ferguson’s police force. Also, he has managerial experience in law enforcement: He’s the captain of a sizable portion of Missouri’s Highway Patrol unit.

Plus, Johnson already feels a certain way about how Ferguson’s law enforcement has conducted itself in response to the protesting.

Here are some notable things about Johnson, culled from a few online sources, but primarily from this {Washington Post report}<hyperlink=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/meet-the-missouri-highway-state-patrol-captain-who-is-taking-over-in-ferguson/>.  

1. He’s sympathetic to the concerns of critics.
It’s likely that Johnson’s identity, both as an African American and as a man, will influence his ability to empathize with those hurting in Ferguson, particularly the way in which protesters and journalists have been treated. That he might be able to relate to Michael Brown—the unarmed African-American victim at the center of this uprising—even in the slightest way, is also noteworthy.  

During a brief press conference on Thursday, Johnson assured the community that he’s heard their concerns and he understands “the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling.” He’s also planning to implement a “different approach,” he told reporters, one that conveys the message that law enforcement and the citizens of Ferguson are “in this together.”

2. He put a stop to the tear gas used against protesters.
Johnson told police officers “to remove their gas masks” and marched {alongside protesters}<hyperlink=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/capt-ron-johnson-marches-protesters-ferguson-article-1.1904210> on Thursday. “I’ve assigned all police assigned to this detail to take their gas masks off,” he said.

3. He’s an OG in the game.
Johnson has been with Missouri’s Highway Patrol team for {27 years}<hyperlink=> and is currently the captain of Troop C—an area that encompasses 11 counties in St. Louis.

4. He’s frat.
Although it hasn't been officially confirmed, there are reports that Johnson is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity—one of the historically black “Divine 9” Greek organizations in the U.S., initiated in 1983.

5. He has a degree in criminal justice.
Johnson is an alum of Florissant Valley Community College in Ferguson.

6. He’s a father.
Not only does Johnson know what it’s like to be a young black man in America, but he also knows what it’s like to be a father of black children. He’s got two of his own—they’re both in their 20s. He might be sensitive to how black teenagers are sometimes perceived and treated by law enforcement.

7. He has a personal stake in this.
Aside from being black and a father and once a young black man in America (he’s in his early 50s), Johnson is from Ferguson and has a stake in seeing that his hometown does the right thing and puts a stop to the injustices and mayhem that have engulfed his community.  

“It means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence,” he {told reporters}<hyperlink=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/capt-ron-johnson-marches-protesters-ferguson-article-1.1904210> on Thursday.",NA,1600,NA,NA
TheRoot,root5,http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/stress_is_a_growing_way_of_life_in_ferguson.html,Stress Is a Growing Way of Life in Ferguson ,Lynette Holloway,08/18/2014,12/01/2015,"Friday, Aug. 8, was a big day for Kizzie and Charles Davis. It was the day they opened Ferguson Burger Bar & More on West Florissant Avenue for the first time after taking it over from the previous owner, they told The Root Monday.

But the next day, they were saddened to learn that {Michael Brown was gunned down by a police officer}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/new_witness_gives_her_account_of_michael_brown_shooting.html>, and within hours the streets were catching fire as angry protesters rolled out to call for justice over the shooting. The Davises’ business has closed early nearly every day since the shooting, and they worry about its future, but they are keeping faith. And while saddened by Brown’s death, they see one silver lining. There is new attention on a long-simmering issue in the black community: police brutality and the use of excessive force.

“It’s bittersweet,” Kizzie Davis, 35, of Ferguson, told The Root, taking a break from the lunchtime rush, serving up burgers, catfish and jack-tail dinners and Philly-cheesesteak sandwiches. “Brown’s unfortunate death has turned attention to an important issue of the black community’s relationship with the police. We hope it brings about lasting change.“

Not far from where the 18-year-old was shot by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, new Ferguson resident Jesse Burns worked quickly to trim his lawn on Monday afternoon before nightfall. He did not mince words when asked about life in Ferguson. “Terrible,” Burns, 40, told The Root with a nervous laugh during an interview just a stone’s throw from his tidy three-bedroom house off Canfield Drive, which he moved into about three weeks ago. “The police or whatever won’t let me come home if it’s too late [between 3 and 5 p.m.]. The streets are blocked off.”

In fact, Burns, who came to Ferguson from another St. Louis suburb and works for UPS Trucking, said the roadblocks are so bad that he had to sleep at his girlfriend’s house in a different community Sunday night after work because the roads were closed to vehicle traffic. He was off Monday, so he used the time to inspect his home and do a little lawn maintenance, he said.

{Schools have shut down}<hyperlink=http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/17/ferguson-florissant-school-monday/14192863/> because of fear of violence around children walking to or from school, prompting families to make alternate child-care plans or simply stay home from work. Gloria Vann, 65, a retired public school administrative assistant who lives in Ferguson, stepped in to help out by taking care of her great-grandsons, 9 and 12, who were off from school. She declined to give their names.

“I’m happy to be out of school,” the 12-year-old told The Root, but “I’m not happy about the shooting.”

Vann and the boys stood along West Florissant Avenue, a busy commercial strip in Ferguson, observing the scene a little after noon on Monday. “I brought them out so they could see why they can’t go to school today,” she said. “When I get back home, I will review the things we saw. They had a chance to meet Jesse Jackson and took pictures with him.”

{The Revs. Jackson and Al Sharpton}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/tensions_flare_again_in_ferguson_amid_strong_arm_robbery_report.html> have made appearances in Ferguson, calling for peace and calm. But the protests continue, taking on a life of their own, marked alternately by violent outbursts and acts of civil disobedience played out on West Florissant Avenue. And after nearly a week of violent clashes between police and protesters, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced early Monday that the National Guard would patrol the streets, increasing anger and resentment among some residents. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder plans to travel to Missouri amid a civil rights investigation into Brown’s shooting, {President Obama announced}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2014/08/obama_attorney_general_eric_holder_to_be_in_ferguson_on_wednesday.html?wpisrc=topstories> during a news conference Monday.

Indeed, Ferguson at night almost rivals televised news images of some conflicts in the Middle East. Sirens wail against the backdrop of chanting protesters and bottles crashing on the cement, and ribbons of flashing blue and red police lights illuminate the dark sky as hulking armored tanks block off major intersections.

Scores of people, young and old, line both sides of West Florissant Avenue. Some chant, others thrust their hands in the air as if under arrest, while others simply stand by taking in the scene, snapping pictures. The media scrum generates the attention of those who want justice for Brown, as well as some fame seekers and outside agitators, residents, including Burns, have told The Root.

Snaking roadblocks, with scads of officers standing sentinel, aren’t the only problem, according to Burns. He says that noise is generated by police helicopters that begin circling overhead with spotlights at nightfall and continue until daybreak. “I can’t get any sleep around here,” he said. “I know I’m right here in the middle of it, and I can’t expect for it to be quiet, but some nights I just don’t stay over here.”

As for the violence, residents hope it will ratchet down soon, especially with Holder planning to make an appearance in the city.

“I believe it’s the people that are not of this area that’s creating all of the havoc,” Vann said. “And the police are instigating this. Why do they need to throw fire or gas bombs at these youths? Why? That’s not the solution, and bringing in the National Guard is not the solution, either. They need to sit and listen to what the people have to say. That’s where they need to start.”",NA,182,NA,NA
TheRoot,root6,http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/ferguson_police_chief_identifies_officer_who_fatally_shot_michael_brown.html,Ferguson Police Chief Identifies Officer Who Fatally Shot Michael Brown ,Stephen A. Crockett Jr. ,08/15/2014,12/01/2015,"Ferguson, Mo., Police Chief Thomas Jackson at a press conference early Friday morning released the name of the officer who was involved in the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown. The officer has been identified as Darren Wilson. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch notes that he is a six-year veteran of the force and doesn't have any blemishes on his record.

For days, the police chief had been adamant about protecting the identity of the police officer involved in the shooting, claiming that the department had received death threats. The identity of the officer comes after days of protest and civil rights leaders urging that his name be made public. 

The police chief also noted that Wilson was in the field attending to a sick person when another call came in about a strong-arm robbery. The police chief noted that Wilson left the sick person to respond to the robbery call when he encountered Brown, according to the Post-Dispatch.

It is unclear why the police chief noted the information about the robbery, since Michael Brown was not named as a suspect, and did not connect that information to the shooting death, the Post-Dispatch notes. 

On Thursday Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced that he was handing the protest-policing reins over to Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, an African American who was raised in Ferguson, Mo., and is vowing to take a different approach.

""It means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence,"" Johnson told reporters at a news conference, the {New York Daily News}<hyperlink=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/st-louis-area-id-michael-brown-killer-article-1.1903336> notes.

Ferguson has been widely criticized for its militarized police action in handling peaceful protests after Brown was fatally shot by Wilson on Saturday. Violent images showing clashes between police and protesters, officers in full riot gear carrying high-powered automatic weapons, and tear-gas smoke-filled nights have caused many to compare Ferguson to that of a war zone.

""What's gone on here over the last few days is not what Missouri's about, it's not what Ferguson's about,"" the governor said during his press conference, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. ""[It's] a Missouri community, but lately it's looked a little bit more like a war zone, and that's unacceptable.""

So now Johnson and his fellow state troopers have been asked to set a different tone from the one left by the Ferguson and St. Louis County police.

""I understand the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling, and our police officers will respect both of those,"" Johnson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

So far things are looking up. According to the Post-Dispatch, Johnson joined protesters during a peaceful march and engaged citizens in conversation. He also told a crowd of a reported 1,000 demonstrators who gathered Thursday night that ""the gas masks are off. Won't come back.""

On Thursday the Daily News noted that the ACLU has ""filed a suit demanding that the St. Louis County police release the incident report of Saturday's shooting.""

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been in Ferguson but has spent the majority of his time with Brown's family, has a rally planned for Sunday. According to the Daily News, he has asked that the Justice Department pay close attention to how the police are handling the aftermath of events.

""Even if we disagree, this climate is not good for anyone and is dangerous for everyone,"" Sharpton said in a statement viewed by the newspaper.

The Daily News notes that the Brown family has asked that the Justice Department monitor a second autopsy of Brown's body.",NA,173,NA,NA

The images were jarring, and rightfully so—the appropriate backdrop to an oppressive police environment that isn't new in a sleepy railroad town, 70 percent of whose residents are black and 90 percent of whose police force is white.

That means that 50 of the city's 53 officers are white in a town of 21,000 people, according to the {Associated Press}<hyperlink=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/racial-tensions-are-not-new-st-louis-suburb>.

There are two stories as to what happened that day—and one gun and one death.

{Police will say}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/st_louis_residents_protest_after_cop_kills_unarmed_black_teen.html> that two boys were stopped while walking down the street. Cops tell the story of a slammed car door, of Brown attempting to enter the car, of a scuffle in which the teen reached for the officer's gun, of a shot fired inside the car. The unarmed teen would run away, only to be gunned down.

{The second version}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/friend_who_witnessed_mike_brown_shooting_speaks.html?wpisrc=mostpopular> is that two kids are walking in the street when an officer tells them to {""get the f--k on the sidewalk.""}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/friend_who_witnessed_mike_brown_shooting_speaks.html> The officer, who has pulled up close to one of the teens, tries to get out of the squad car. The door hits the teen and closes shut. The officer puts the teen in a headlock through the open car window, a scuffle ensues, and then the teen breaks free and starts running. The officer draws his weapon and starts firing. The teen puts his hands in the air and is shot down.

The sad part of the convoluted versions emerging since the shootings is one of racial politics, policing and embedded theory that somehow violence is associated with black skin. That somehow young black men are violent, even while chilling. That somehow just being black is enough to make you a suspect. And walking is reasonable justification to investigate.

And the story of black life and the ability to dehumanize black men so that their deaths are justifiable even when all signs point to blame is a complicated story that involves a history lesson far beyond my scope. But somewhere in the arc between slavery and this act of violence is the lifeless body of Michael Brown {covered in only a white sheet}<hyperlink=http://theroottv.theroot.com/video/Video-Shows-Slain-Teen-s-Body-L> for tired residents to view and have scorched into their memories. It didn't take long for the marching to turn to yelling and the yelling to turn to rage.

Rage is not a useless emotion. It is destructive and damaging, but it is also cathartic and freeing. It is arguably the most primal and guttural feeling in the emotional spectrum, and as such, it is justified for a tragedy of this magnitude.

Tupac attempted to explain {hip-hop's}<hyperlink=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0XMJMphPT4> rage like this:

If I know in this hotel room they have food every day and I am knocking on the door and they let me see the party ... I can see the food ... but they are telling me there is no food in here. Every day I stand outside trying to sing my way in, 'We are hungry, please let us in,' after a week that song is going to change, 'We hungry, we need some food.' ... After a year, you are just like, 'I'm picking the lock and coming through the door blasting.'

And it is a hip-hop generation that is being stopped and harassed. They are being targeted and forced to carry the weight of assumptions heaped onto them. Just because the music they listen to carries violent themes doesn't mean that they do. But those chickens have come home to roost, and while the rage is understandable, the looting is not.

There are lessons to be learned in the anger of Ferguson that doesn't involve riot gear and military policing. What's involved is undoing the racial storytelling that has created all black men as animals or suspects or violent or dangerous. It involves a level of humanization and compassion that doesn't seem to be held for young black men.

While the facts are left for the living to debate, Michael Brown's voice will carry no weight, his version of events won't be heard while the police department protects its own. As this was being written, the Rev. {Al Sharpton was fighting}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/family_michael_brown_dreamed_that_world_would_know_his_name.html> to have the officer's name made public.

What happened wasn't an isolated incident. It was the final straw in a black city that has felt the collective racial tensions brewing. Since the shooting, scores of news stories have emerged with young black men of Ferguson telling of the harassment and brutality that they have faced from police. This death connected a communal oppression that resonated, and the reverb was loud and destructive. So black people who live in Ferguson didn't have to know Brown personally to know that whatever happened that day could have happened to them.

And for that, they are willing to ride. To protest, to march, to yell and, in some cases, burn things to the ground, because nerves have been exposed and are now sensitive to the touch.  

A young man lost his life while running away from a man with a gun. The man happened to be a police officer. The young man happened to be black. What happened that day in question is a storyline that has yet to be sorted out, but the historical narrative that was crafted long before Michael Brown and the unnamed officer met is one that Ferguson is trying to burn down.",NA,1400,NA,NA
TheRoot,root8,http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2014/08/obama_attorney_general_eric_holder_to_be_in_ferguson_on_wednesday.html,Obama: Attorney General Eric Holder Will Be in Ferguson on Wednesday,Breanna Edwards,08/18/2014,12/01/2015,"President Barack Obama, back from vacation at Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, once again stood before the nation to address the racial tensions in Ferguson, Mo., as well as the tensions between law enforcement and the black community, saying that he has spoken with state officials and plans to dig deeper into the circumstances of unarmed teen Michael Brown’s death.

The president said that Attorney General Eric Holder will be traveling to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with FBI agents and other Department of Justice personnel, who are currently conducting a federal criminal investigation. The DOJ Office of Community Oriented Policing Services Director Ronald Davis will also be making an appearance in the embattled town to work with police officials there.

Obama took the time to remind residents to remain calm in the face of the tragedy. “While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos. It undermines rather than advances justice,” he said at the press conference Monday.

“Let me also be clear that our constitutional rights to speak freely, to assemble and to report in the press must be vigilantly safeguarded, especially in moments like these. There’s no excuse for excessive force by police or any action that denies people the right to protest peacefully,” he added. “Ours is a nation of laws: of the citizens who live under them and for the citizens who enforce them. So, to a community in Ferguson that is rightly hurting and looking for answers, let me call once again for us to seek some understanding rather than simply holler at each other. Let’s seek to heal rather than to wound each other.”

The president lamented the loss of “the potential of a young man” while acknowledging the “frustrations of a community,” referencing the “gulf of mistrust” that currently exists between residents and law enforcement. 

Obama also addressed the apparent militarization of the police force, pointing out that “one of the great things about the United States has been our ability to maintain a distinction between our military and domestic law enforcement,” saying that it helps preserve civil liberties.

The president acknowledged the post-9/11 scare that led up to the acquiring of military-grade equipment so that local communities would be able to brace themselves for a terrorist attack, but he also suggested that it might be time to review what the funding is going toward.

“I think it’s probably useful for us to review how the funding has gone, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars, to make sure that what ... they’re purchasing is stuff that they actually need,” he said. “Because, you know, there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions.”

When asked by retiring ABC reporter Ann Compton if there was anything more that he could personally do to help with the situation in Ferguson, Obama responded, “I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed.”

“I’ve got to make sure that I don’t look like I’m putting my thumb on the scales,” Obama added. “So it’s hard for me to address a specific case, beyond making sure that it’s conducted in a way that [is] transparent, where there’s accountability, where people can trust the process, hoping that, as a consequence of a fair and just process, you end up with a fair and just outcome.”",NA,245,NA,NA
TheRoot,root9,http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2014/08/obama_s_response_on_ferguson_was_right.html,The President's Critics Are Wrong About His Response to Ferguson,David Swerdlick,08/18/2014,12/01/2015,"Last year, right before President Barack Obama made his unannounced appearance in the White House briefing room to personally address the acquittal of George Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin’s killer, on murder charges, I was among those who argued, no, the president shouldn’t be called on to make a statement about the case.

Although {the words Obama ultimately offered}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2013/07/obama_statement_on_zimmerman_verdict_he_chose_his_words_well.html> were powerful, moving and appropriate, I believed then, and still do, that no matter how unjust the verdict felt to so many Americans—including me—the president of the United States shouldn’t tread anywhere near the possibility of second-guessing a duly rendered jury verdict.

Why?

Because, {as I wrote at the time,}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2013/07/obama_on_trayvon_presidents_response_was_right.html> no matter how Obama felt about Trayvon’s death—as a parent, as a black man, as a compassionate human being—it falls to the president, as the head of government and head of state, “to represent the American system” even “with all its attendant flaws.”

But last week we saw the system run amok—police in Ferguson, Mo., using equipment meant for a war zone to disperse crowds that were, for the most part, peacefully demonstrating to express outrage over a teenager being killed by a police officer in broad daylight—followed by the selective release of details about the case that appear, pretty clearly, to be meant to shield the shooter from responsibility and cast a negative light on the shooting victim. And for that reason I believe Obama was absolutely right to speak directly last Thursday about events in Ferguson.

I’ve been surprised, though, by some of the criticism that Obama has taken over the last couple of days by critics who feel that he has somehow shirked responsibility in this situation. That “President Obama failed”—as Michael Eric Dyson said Friday while hosting MSNBC’s The Ed Show—“in his leadership to say what he really knows and has lived as a black man in America.” Or that, according to CNN’s Marc Lamont Hill, Obama, in his general appeal for calm on all sides, “{failed to acknowledge the legitimacy of black anger}<hyperlink=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/opinion/hill-obama-brown-ferguson-race/index.html?hpt=hp_t3>.”

It strikes me that the president’s words last week were exactly right.

Obama offered condolences to Michael Brown’s family. He called on police to conduct an “open and transparent” investigation—something they’ve failed to do. He called out police use of “excessive force,” announced that he’d been in direct contact with Missouri’s governor and explained what steps he instructed Attorney General Eric Holder to take. Indeed, he declined to cast the incident in specifically racial terms and instead emphasized that his priority was restoring peace and calm.

But he did emphasize that government—including police—must uphold “the dignity of every single man, woman and child.” And he left the door open to more directly address race, as he did after Trayvon’s death, in his own time.

Yes, President Obama can, and should, offer a more comprehensive response for Americans. He should connect Brown’s killing to the {fatal shooting}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/unarmed_black_man_ezell_ford_shot_by_police_in_la.html> last week of unarmed Ezell Ford by the Los Angeles Police Department, the {vicious beating}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/grandmother_speaks_about_cop_beating_i_felt_like_he_was_going_to_kill_me.html> last month of Marlene Pinnock by a California Highway Patrol officer and last month’s {choking death}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/eric_garner_s_death_ruled_a_homicide_by_nyc_medical_examiner.html> of Eric Garner at the hands of a New York City police officer while other officers stood watching.

That’s not just an issue for the first black president. It’s an issue that any president should address. But although there are a lot of different voices that can underscore the racial injustice that surrounds Ferguson and the killing of Michael Brown, there’s only one person who can direct FBI resources and order the Justice Department to investigate a civil rights violation: Obama. And I’d rather see someone who does understand black anger fulfilling that role rather than focusing on making speeches.

The president may yet have to get more involved—to take over the investigation of Brown’s death or to federalize the Missouri National Guard—if Gov. Jay Nixon and local law enforcement continue to demonstrate that they can’t resolve the situation without trampling over the people of Ferguson.

It’s worth noting, though, that the man Americans elected twice to lead them is approaching Ferguson the same way he approaches the Middle East, Ukraine, Newtown, immigration, Birthers and the debt ceiling. He’s a measured guy. In this kind of a crisis, that’s a feature, not a bug.

And if you ask me, so far he’s found the right balance between his role as explainer in chief and his role as the chief executive.",NA,561,NA,NA

Family members of Eric Garner, the Staten Island man who died after an officer placed him in an illegal chokehold, called for justice in his case and in that of Michael Brown, who was gunned down by an officer last weekend in Ferguson.

Gwen Carr, Garner’s mother, encouraged protesters to proceed peacefully at next week’s combined rally for Garner and Brown, according to 1010 WINS’ Roger Stern, the report says.

“We’re not gonna start fightin’ and pushing each other and breaking windows, right?” Carr said Saturday at the National Action Network rally, CBS News reports.

Sharpton plans to travel Sunday to Ferguson to lead another march and rally. The Rev. Jesse Jackson walked the streets Friday with demonstrators in a peaceful protest.

An eruption of anger ended a tenuous calm in Ferguson, Mo., early Saturday as police and protesters clashed, the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports}<hyperlink=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/after-day-s-calm-a-storm-erupts-in-fergusoNArticle_fd8c251f-ff3e-51ed-bfcb-2be8fbe252b4.html>.

Police and about 200 protesters clashed after an emotional day, which was fueled by a report that Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old who was fatally shot by an officer last weekend, allegedly stole a $48.99 box of cigars from a convenience store and strong-armed a clerk on his way out, the report says. At the same time, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released the name of the officer involved in the shooting.

About midnight, some protesters in what had been a large but mostly well-behaved crowd broke into the small convenience store—allegedly robbed by Brown—and began looting it, said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, {according to Fox News}<hyperlink=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/16/ferguson-shooting-police-standoff/>.

Johnson said some members of the crowd threw rocks and other objects at the police, injuring one officer, Fox News reports. Further details about the injury were not available.

Additionally, Johnson said that police tried to ease tensions by backing off from the crowd, whose members may have looted nearby stores, the report says. No arrests were made.

After nearly a week of unrest in the suburban community, prominent civil rights leaders are scheduled to arrive this weekend to call for justice.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Friday was among hundreds of demonstrators who lined the streets for the sixth straight night to protest the shooting of Brown by six-year officer Darren Wilson.

{CBS News}<hyperlink=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jesse-jackson-leads-peaceful-protests-in-ferguson-missouri/> reports that passing motorists honked their horns as demonstrators lined the streets. Many protesters held signs with slogans such as ""We want justice"" and ""No justice, no peace.""

Jackson locked arms with other protesters “as they walked through the streets to the site where Brown was killed. The prominent civil rights activist bent over in front of a memorial cross and candles and let out a deep sigh,” CBS reports.

{The Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/the-rev-jesse-jackson-shows-up-at-protest-site-as/article_52c40b84-ad90-5f9a-973c-70d628d0be04.html> reported that he encouraged the crowd to continue protesting but to avoid violence.

“You can reshape an iron while it's hot, but don't destroy yourself in the process,” Jackson said, according to the newspaper. “Don’t self-destruct.”

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who was in the city earlier in the week, is slated to return Sunday to lead a rally, according to a news release received by The Root. The visit is slated to come after a rally Saturday morning at his Harlem-based National Action Network, where he plans to address “the smear campaign against Michael Brown and the fact that it is meaningless in regard to his killing,” the release states, referring to the teen’s alleged involvement in a strong-arm robbery.

Sharpton was not the only one upset by the release of the robbery information. {Brown's family blasted the decision Friday}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/ferguson_police_report_ids_mike_brown_as_primary_suspect_in_strong_arm_robbery.html?wpisrc=topstories>.

Parks told reporters during a news conference that the fatal bullet struck the 18-year-old at ""the very top of the head,"" which Parks believes indicates that Brown was lowering his head in surrender.

Federal and local autopsy reports have yet to been released, according to the news service.

Although the details around the shooting remain unclear and there are several versions about what happened that Aug. 9 afternoon, Reuters notes that protesters and the Brown family ""have called for the officer's arrest for days.""

Police refused to release the 28-year-old officer's name after the shooting, citing concerns over Wilson's safety and causing some to believe that the Ferguson Police Department was protecting its own. Wilson was put on paid administrative leave, according to Reuters and, according to several reports, is no longer in the St. Louis area.

Since the Aug. 9 shooting, protesters and police have clashed in the streets of Ferguson, causing schools to be closed all week, Reuters reports.

Eric Holder instructed officials to arrange for a federal medical examiner to perform a second autopsy in the police shooting death of Michael Brown, according to a statement released Sunday by the Department of Justice.

Holder cites a request from the family and “the extraordinary circumstances involved in the case” as reasons for his decision, Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, says in the statement received by The Root.

“This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,” Fallon states. “Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.”

Updated Sunday, Aug. 17, 9:46 a.m. EDT: Just hours after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon imposed a curfew in Ferguson, Mo., in an effort to quell unrest over the police shooting death of Michael Brown, his plan backfired Sunday as anger erupted over the decision.

Nixon’s decision to impose a curfew between midnight and 5 a.m., came after a week of unrest in the aftermath of the shooting death of 18-year-old Brown, who was unarmed, by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who is white.

But 30 minutes after the curfew deadline, {the New York Times reports}<hyperlink=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=LedeSumLargeMedia&module=a-lede-package-region&region=lede-package&WT.nav=lede-package>, seven protesters, who refused to disperse, were arrested. They were all charged with “failure to disperse,” the report says.

“The protesters had moved toward the officers—some of whom rode in armored vehicles—and chanted: ‘We are Mike Brown! We have the right to assemble peacefully!’” the Times writes. “‘You are violating the state-imposed curfew,’ an officer told the demonstrators as rain, heavy at times, passed through the area.”

The Times reports that “despite an earlier pledge by Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, the state Highway Patrol commander whose is overseeing security in Ferguson, the police eventually began firing both smoke grenades and some tear gas.”

During a briefing just before 3 a.m., Johnson said that police began using smoke bombs after learning that men were on the roof of Red’s BBQ, {the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports}<hyperlink=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/curfew-defied-shots-ring-out-smoke-bombs-in-fergusoNArticle_03b8ca92-776d-525d-b95e-4387ef63a3e2.html>. The law enforcement officers then heard there was a shooting victim near the Red’s, a police car fired upon, and a man standing in the street with a handgun, the Post-Dispatch says.

By the time officers removed protesters from the scene, the shooting victim had been taken by private vehicle to a hospital, Johnson said, according to the Post-Dispatch. It was not known if the victim was a protester.

St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been at the demonstrations all week, said police tactics had improved. Many officers urged defiant protesters to mind the curfew, “But there was no convincing them,” he said, according to the Post-Dispatch. “Some ‘didn't want to be told to leave.’ ”

Wilson cursed at the pair and ordered them onto the sidewalk, the lawyer, Freeman Bosley Jr., told the Washington Post. “When they refused to comply, he said, the officer grabbed Brown’s throat through the window of his cruiser, pulled out a pistol and shot him. Wilson then chased Brown, shot him in the back and shot him five to six more times as Brown’s hands were raised,” Bosley told the Post.

Maybe one can say that because Church isn’t from the U.S. (she was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland), she doesn’t actually know much about the old-school police tactics used on black people during the civil rights movement?

Meanwhile, Dorian Johnson, the young man who identified himself as Brown’s friend and {gave his personal testimony}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/friend_who_witnessed_mike_brown_shooting_speaks.html> about what happened on MSNBC earlier this week, confirmed that he and Brown did indeed steal cigars from a convenience store, his attorney stated.   

“We see that there’s tape, that they claim they got a tape that shows there was some sort of strong-armed robbery,” Freeman Bosley, Johnson’s attorney, said, {according to MSNBC}<hyperlink=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ferguson-police-name-michael-brown>. “We need to see that tape, my client did tell us and told the FBI that they went into the store. He told FBI that [Brown] did take cigarillos. He told that to the DOJ and the St. Louis County Police.”

Updated Friday, Aug. 15, 2:30 p.m. EDT: The attorneys representing Michael Brown’s family {released a scathing statement}<hyperlink=http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s44se5> after the press conference and police report that linked the unarmed teen to a robbery shortly before the shooting.

Attorneys representing the family called the methods of the police “devious,” adding that they were ""beyond outraged”:

Michael Brown’s family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate [piecemeal] information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.

There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.

The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.

It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.

The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.

In a brief press conference on Friday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released the name of the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, who was unarmed and allegedly surrendering.

Details from the fatal shooting are still unclear and were not the focus of the press conference. Instead, Jackson detailed a timeline of a strong-arm robbery that took place just before the shooting, {according to Talking Points Memo}<hyperlink=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/michael-brown-suspect-robbery-ferguson-police-shooting>.

Reporters got a handout of the report, which included stills from video footage taken from store surveillance. In the report, both Brown and a friend who was with him at the time of the shooting, Dorian Johnson, were named as suspects in the robbery.

{A report by the Daily Mail}<hyperlink=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2725917/Ferguson-police-Officer-Darren-Wilson-cop-shot-dead-unarmed-teenager-Michael-Brown.html> points out that Brown appeared to be wearing the same outfit in the surveillance footage that he was wearing when he was gunned down.

[tweetbegin 500279501369397248 tweetend]

The suspect in the video was wearing what appeared to be a gray, or other light-colored, shirt, shorts and distinctive shoes with a red cap. In pictures of Brown’s body, he also appeared to be wearing a light-colored shirt, shorts and unusual shoes. A baseball cap was also at the crime scene, according to the Daily Mail. However, during the press conference, a woman questioned the footwear, observing that the socks and shoes from the video don’t match images of Michael Brown lying in the street.

As (redacted) was placing the boxes on the counter, Brown grabbed a box of Swisher Sweets cigars and handed them to Johnson who was standing behind Brown. (Redacted) witnessed (redacted) tell Brown that he had to pay for those cigars first. That is when Brown reached across the counter and grabbed numerous packs of Swisher Sweets and turned to leave the store. (Redacted) then calls ‘911.’ Meanwhile (redacted) comes out from behind the counter and attempts to stop Brown from leaving. According to (redacted),(redacted) was trying to lock the door until Brown returned the merchandise to him. That is when Brown grabbed (redacted) by the shirt and forcefully pushed him back in to a display rack. (Redacted) backed away and Brown and Johnson exited the store with the cigars.

However, according to the Post-Dispatch, some just saw the details of the robbery as a distraction. “I am incensed,” St. Louis resident Laura Keys told the Dispatch. “I can’t believe this is the tactic they are using, bringing up a robbery to make the victim look like he was the person who created this whole mess. Where’s the footage?”

“They brought it up to justify the cop’s actions,” Jay Williams added.

The president called for calm and asked for protesters and police to ""take a step back."" 

""Now is the time for all of us to reflect on what happened,"" Obama said.

He noted that he has been fully aware of the events and has been updated by Attorney General Eric Holder. Obama emphasized that he has ""already tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI to independently investigate the death of Michael Brown, along with local officials on the ground.""

The president also stated that he believed that the police should be ""open and transparent"" about their investigation and noted that there was no excuse for violence toward police or looting. ""There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights,"" Obama added.

The president also said that those rubbed raw by the recent events should remember that ""we are all a part of one American family.""

""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds,"" Obama said.

According to the newspaper, the shooting happened around 12:30 p.m. after a man entered the Six Stars Market, grabbed several items and left. A store employee followed the man outside and told him that he would have to pay for the items. According to witnesses, one of whom was St. Louis Alderwoman Dionne Flowers, the man then began throwing the items on the ground and into the street. 

""The store owner and the alderwoman said the suspect was armed with a knife, acting erratically, pacing back and forth in the street, talking to himself,"" St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson told the Post-Dispatch at the scene of the shooting.

According to several witnesses who spoke with the Post-Dispatch, once police arrived, the man, who was asked several times to get on the ground, refused. The man, who has not been identified but who the newspaper notes was 23, kept walking and reaching for his waistband, according to the newspaper.

The man began yelling, ""Shoot me, kill me now,"" and at one point pulled out a knife and began walking toward the officers, who, according to witnesses, took out their guns and ordered the man to drop the knife. When the man refused and continued walking toward the officers with the knife held high, they waited until he was within two to three feet before firing shots and killing the man, according to police officials who spoke with the Post-Dispatch. 

""This is a lethal range for a knife,"" Dotson noted of the man’s distance from police before they began firing. He also noted that the police were not injured and that they were placed on administrative duty until an investigation could be conducted, the Post-Dispatch reports. 

Several protesters gathered around the shooting scene as Dotson's press briefing quickly became an ""impromptu press conference,"" according to the Post-Dispatch. What started as a peaceful gathering quickly broke out with shouts of, ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" as several of those gathered wanted to know why the police didn't use their Tasers instead of shooting the man.

Dotson told them that ""officers have a reasonable expectation to go home at the end of their shift.""

The chief also noted that he wanted details of the shooting to "" ... be out as quickly and truthfully as possible,"" the Post-Dispatch notes.",NA,175,NA,NA
TheRoot,root25,http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2014/08/michael_brown_was_one_of_we_the_people_too.html,"Like Dred Scott, Michael Brown Was Denied His Right to Live- and to Live as an American",Blair L.M. Kelley,08/14/2014,12/04/2015,"News out of Ferguson, Mo., has been devastating.

Since unarmed teenager Michael Brown was killed by an as-yet-unidentified police officer, local police have responded to the community’s demonstration of outrage with {unprecedented force}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/_24_hours_in_ferguson.html>—using military-style weaponry to suppress peaceful protests, arrest black elected officials and detain journalists. And Brown’s death seems to have unearthed a history of disregard for the rights of black residents.

There is outrage across the country because Ferguson officials have not behaved as though the black citizens of this majority-black town have the same rights as all other Americans. Reporters keep saying that these images do not look like America, but Ferguson is America. And in America, black citizens should enjoy equal protection under the law and the right of a free press to report on what is happening anywhere in the United States.

And this moment in Ferguson, Mo., makes me think about the historic {Dred Scott v. Sandford}<hyperlink=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford> case, an 1857 Supreme Court decision which had its roots in this same part of the country.

Dred Scott was one of the tens of thousands of the enslaved who were born in the Southeast and moved west in the early 19th century. Scott was moved, first to Alabama and then later to Missouri, as his owner sought new fortunes on the American “frontier.” But white settlement required not only wars of displacement against Native Americans but also the violent removal of enslaved African Americans from their communities of origin.

Neither Native Americans nor black slaves were conceived of as having claims to anyplace they could call home. The enslaved were auctioned off and sold, traveling in shackles to the newly expanding Deep South or the new Southwest, while the Indian Removal Act of 1830 opened the door for the violent forced removal and warfare against hundreds of thousands of Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole. The process of making space for new white citizens—grounded in the notion of {Manifest Destiny}<hyperlink=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny>—could only be fulfilled through the exploitation of slave labor and “Indian removal,” a moment that marked citizenship as white, and black and brown bodies as movable and disposable.

Scott was purchased by U.S. Army Major John Emerson in 1832. When Emerson was assigned to Army posts in the free state of Illinois and the free Wisconsin territory, he brought Scott with him. While in the North, Scott married, and started a family, while continuing to work for Emerson. Called South to serve in the Seminole War of 1840, Emerson called on Scott to return to Missouri with his wife and newborn daughter.

When Emerson died, his widow, Eliza Emerson, attempted to lease Scott as a laborer and keep all of the income. Scott, who had lived in the free North for more than a decade, demanded he be emancipated. After he sought to purchase his freedom and Eliza Emerson refused, Scott sued in Missouri’s courts for his freedom.

Missouri was at the heart of the national debate over slavery. Missouri had been admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise, but there was also a small free black community in St. Louis who had found their way to freedom despite difficult circumstances. Scott had reason to believe that he, too, could be free.

And initially, a St. Louis circuit court ruled that Scott and his family should be free. However, Scott lost after Eliza Emerson appealed the decision to the Missouri Supreme Court. Scott pressed appeal after appeal, finally being heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1857 found that although Scott had lived in the free North and had been allowed to legally marry—the enslaved were legally prohibited from marrying—he was not, the court said, a free man. The decision articulated broad grounds for attacking not only Scott’s individual claim but also the freedoms of black Americans as a whole. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, a staunch supporter of slavery, wrote the majority opinion, asserting that because Scott was black, he was not a citizen.

In an unprecedented argument, Taney wrote that Scott had no right to sue, although in fact, black Americans had sued and petitioned for their freedom and their rights since Colonial times. Although some free blacks had even voted to ratify the Constitution, Taney dismissed the idea that the Declaration of Independence might apply to black Americans when it insisted that “all men are created equal,” writing, “It is too clear for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed and adopted this declaration.” In his version of “original intent,” Taney insisted that the framers of the Constitution believed that black Americans were so inferior that they “had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.”

The Dred Scott decision meant that to be black in America in the late 1850s was to live in a land that said you did not have a future. You were living in a country where, whether free or slave, you would never be a real American. It was devastating to black America. But despite attempts to wash away the history of black people in America, black Americans found their way to freedom, and through a valiant struggle over the next 100 years, found their way to citizenship rights.

It doesn’t sound all that far off from the situation facing Ferguson, Mo., today.

So as we witness the disrespect and discontent in the state where Dred Scott is buried, let’s remind ourselves just how wrong Justice Taney was. Although we shouldn’t have to do anything to “prove” our humanity and our citizenship, African Americans, through our service and our struggle, have more than demonstrated that we are part of “the people,” too. Police in Ferguson have no right to subjugate black protesters and trample on their rights to peaceably assemble and protest. And Michael Brown, in life and now in death, deserves that respect as well. ",NA,353,NA,NA
TheRoot,root26,http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/ferguson_how_white_people_can_be_allies.html,12 Ways to Be a White Ally to Black People,Janee Woods,08/19/2014,12/04/2015,"Michael Brown, an African-American teenager, was shot six times and killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, during a stop for jaywalking in Ferguson, Mo. Some facts are uncontroverted: Brown was unarmed when he was shot about 35 feet away from Wilson, who didn’t know that Brown was a suspect in an alleged shoplifting incident that occurred a short time before the shooting. Other facts are disputed: Some people claim that Brown attacked Wilson, and others claim that Brown was running away from Wilson with his hands in the air. Either way, another young black man is dead because of use of excessive force by the police in a situation that did not justify shooting to kill.

Most of us have watched as Ferguson’s black community rose up in outrage against the almost all-white police department, demanding justice and accountability. Our disbelief and heartache turned to collective anger and fear as the response to the protests became more militarized, with the deployment of police dogs, riot gear, tear gas and rubber bullets. And we’ve started speaking out in opposition to these developments, all of which have the hallmarks of being rooted in systemic, institutionalized racism.

Yet some people, especially some white people, have not yet become engaged. Perhaps they don’t know what to say or how to say it or are concerned about backlash from other white people. This is understandable but not acceptable when the continuation of white silence and inaction means the oppression and death of black people.

So let’s talk about an active role for white people in the fight against racism, because racism burdens all of us and is destroying our communities. White people have a role in undoing racism because white people created and, for the most part, currently maintain (whether they want to or not) the racist system that benefits white people to the detriment of people of color.

White people who hate racism should work hard to become white allies. Here are some ways for a white person to become engaged, thoughtfully and critically, in examining the crisis in Ferguson and systemic racism in America.

1. Learn about the racialized history of Ferguson and how it reflects the racialized history of America. Brown’s killing is not an anomaly or a statistical outlier. It is the {direct product}<hyperlink=http://time.com/3104128/michael-brown-ferguson-cop-shooting-protests/> of deadly tensions born from decades of housing discrimination, white flight, intergenerational poverty and racial profiling.

2. Reject the “He was a good kid” or “He was a criminal” narrative and lift up the “Black lives matter” narrative. Those who knew him say Brown was a good kid. But that’s not why his death is tragic. {His death isn’t tragic because he was on his way to college the following week.}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/michael_brown_and_our_obsession_with_respectable_black_victims.html> His death is tragic because he was a human being and his life mattered. The good-kid narrative might provoke some sympathy, but what it really does is support the lie that as a rule black people, black men in particular, have a norm of violence or criminal behavior. The good-kid narrative says that this kid didn’t deserve to die because his goodness was an exception to the rule. This is wrong. This kid didn’t deserve to die, period. Similarly, reject the “He was a criminal” narrative surrounding the convenience store robbery because even if Brown did steal some cigars and have a scuffle with the shopkeeper, that is still not a justification for his killing. All black lives matter, not just the ones we deem to be “good.”

3. Use words that speak the truth about the disempowerment, oppression, disinvestment and racism that are rampant in our communities. Be mindful, and politically and socially aware with your language. Notice how the mainstream news outlets are using words like “riot” and “looting” to describe the uprising in Ferguson. What’s happening is {not a riot.}<hyperlink=http://www.blackgirldangerous.org/2014/08/things-stop-distracted-black-person-gets-murdered-police/> The people are protesting with a righteous anger. This is a justified rebellion.

4. Understand the modern forms of race oppression and slavery and how they are intertwined with policing, the courts and the prison-industrial complex. Black people aren’t enslaved on the plantation anymore. Now African Americans are locked up in for-profit prisons at disproportionate rates and for longer sentences for the same crimes committed by white people. And when we’re released we’re second-class citizens, stripped of voting rights in some states and denied access to housing, employment and education. Mass incarceration is {the new Jim Crow.}<hyperlink=http://newjimcrow.com/>

5. Examine the interplay between poverty and racial equity. The {twin pillar of racism is economic injustice}<hyperlink=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91626373>, but don’t use class issues to trump race issues and avoid the racism conversation. Although racism and class oppression are {tangled together}<hyperlink=http://www.blackcollegian.com/the-connection-between-racism-and-poverty/> in this country, the fact remains that the No. 1 predictor of prosperity and access to opportunity is race.

6. Diversify your media. Be intentional about looking for and paying close attention to diverse voices of color on television, on radio, online and in print to help shape your awareness, understanding and thinking about political, economic and social issues.

7. Adhere to the philosophy of nonviolence as you resist racism and oppression. Martin Luther King Jr. advocated for nonviolent conflict reconciliation as the primary strategy of the civil rights movement and the charge of his “{final marching orders.” East Point Peace Academy}<hyperlink=http://eastpointpeace.org/> offers online resources and in-person training on nonviolence that is accessible to all people, regardless of ability to pay.

8. Find support from fellow white allies. Challenge and encourage one another to dig deeper, even when it hurts and especially when you feel confused, angry and hopeless, so that you can be more authentic in your shared journey with people of color to protect principles of anti-racism and equity. Go to workshops like Training for Change’s {Whites Confronting Racism}<hyperlink=https://www.trainingforchange.org/workshop/whites-confronting-racism> or the People’s Institute’s {European Dissent}<hyperlink=http://www.pisab.org/programs>. Attend {the White Privilege Conference}<hyperlink=http://www.whiteprivilegeconference.com/> or {the Facing Race}<hyperlink=https://facingrace.raceforward.org/> conference. Some organizations offer scholarships or reduced fees to help people attend.

9. If you are a person of faith, look to your Scriptures or other holy texts for guidance. Seek out faith-based organizations like {Sojourners}<hyperlink=http://sojo.net/>, and follow faith leaders who incorporate social justice into their ministry. Ask your clergyperson to address anti-racism in sermons and teachings. If you are not a person of faith, learn how the world’s religions view social-justice issues so that when you have an opportunity to invite people of faith to also become white allies, you can talk with them meaningfully about why being a white ally is supported by their spiritual beliefs.

10. Don’t be afraid to be unpopular. If you start calling out all the racism you witness (and it will be a lot, once you know what you’re seeing), some people might not want to hang out with you as much. But think about it like this: Staying silent when you witness oppression is the same as supporting oppression. So you can be the popular person who stands with oppression, or you can be the (maybe) unpopular person who stands for equality and dignity for all people. Which person would you prefer to be?

11. Be proactive in your own community. As a white ally, you are not limited to reacting only when black people are subjected to violence very visibly and publicly. Moments of crisis do not need to be the catalyst. Taking action against systemic racism is always appropriate because systemic racism permeates this country. Some ideas for action: Organize {a community conversation about the state of police-community relations in your neighborhood}<hyperlink=http://everyday-democracy.org/resources/police-community-relations#.U_Je5yqF_Xx>; support leaders of color by donating your time or money to their campaigns or causes; ask the local library to host a showing of, and discussion group about, the documentary {Race—the Power of an Illusion}<hyperlink=http://www.pbs.org/race/000_General/000_00-Home.htm>; attend workshops {to learn how to transform conflict into opportunity for dialogue}<hyperlink=http://www.publicconversations.org/>. Gather together white allies who represent the diversity of backgrounds in your community. Anti-racism is not a liberals-only cause. Anti-racism is a movement for all people, whether they are conservative, progressive, rich, poor, urban or rural.

12. Don’t give up. We’re 400 years into this racist system, and it’s going to take decades—centuries, probably—to dismantle. The anti-racism movement is a struggle for generations, not simply the hot-button issue of the moment. Transformation of a broken system doesn’t happen quickly or easily. You may not see or feel the positive impact of your white allyship during the next month, the next year, the next decade or even your lifetime. But don’t ever stop. Being a white ally matters because you will be part of what turns the tide someday. Change starts with the individual.

People of color cannot and should not shoulder the burden for dismantling the racist, white-supremacist system that devalues and criminalizes black life without the all-in support, blood, sweat and tears of white people. If you are not already a white ally, now is the time to become one.",24,11500,NA,NA

All five witnesses had distinct vantage points: One person was with Brown during the incident, one woman was inside her vehicle, another woman observed the incident from her apartment balcony, one man was inside his apartment and another man was standing outside.

None of the eyewitnesses in this roundup—save for two—knew each other prior to the shooting. They could not have imagined that their lives would forever be intertwined as a result of what they allegedly witnessed that sunny afternoon in Ferguson, Mo.

1. Dorian Johnson, Michael Brown’s friend.

Johnson was with Brown when they were stopped by police.

During interviews with reporters, Johnson recounted the chilling confrontation. He said that a police car pulled up alongside Brown and him, and the officer—who has been identified as Darren Wilson—allegedly told Johnson and Brown to “{get the f--k on the sidewalk.}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/friend_who_witnessed_mike_brown_shooting_speaks.html>”

The two men told the officer that they were only minutes away from their destination. Johnson said that Wilson backed up his car and asked Brown and Johnson what they just said. Johnson claimed that Wilson then tried to open his car door but the door ricocheted off of Brown’s body and closed again.

Johnson said that Wilson pulled Brown through the car window by his neck, and Brown began to try to pull away. Johnson said that Wilson shot Brown during the scuffle, and Brown managed to break away from Wilson’s grip. Brown and Johnson then began to run away from the police vehicle.

Johnson said that Wilson got out of his car {and began to shoot at Brown}<hyperlink=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlMjhoYPmZ8> while Brown was running away. Brown then stopped, put his hands in the air, turned around and pleaded with the officer to stop shooting, since he didn’t have a gun. 

Johnson said that Wilson continued to fire several more shots before Brown’s body fell to the ground.

2. Tiffany Mitchell, who was visiting her employee in a nearby apartment complex.

Mitchell had never met or seen Michael Brown or Dorian Johnson. In fact, she’s not even from the area and was on her way to pick up an employee when the incident occurred.

{During an interview with MSNBC,}<hyperlink=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/st-louis-official-reporters-arrested-ferguson-michael-brown> Mitchell said she was driving when she saw the confrontation at the point when Brown and Wilson were wrestling through the window. “Brown was pushing, trying to get away from the officer,” Mitchell explained, “and the officer was trying to pull him in.”

Mitchell’s and Johnson’s versions of events match up from that point on. A shot was fired, and Brown broke away and started to run down the street away from the police car. Mitchell said the officer then got out of his vehicle and started to pursue Brown, all the while shooting at him.

“Michael’s body jerked as if he were hit,” Mitchell said. “Then he turns around and put his hands up, and the officer continued to walk up on him and shoot him, until he goes all the way down to the ground.”

3. Piaget Crenshaw, the woman who saw the incident while standing on her apartment balcony.

Crenshaw was the employee that Mitchell was coming to pick up. She was standing on her apartment balcony and saw Brown running away from Wilson.

“I witnessed the police chase after the guy—full force,” {Crenshaw told local news reporters in Ferguson.}<hyperlink=http://www.ksdk.com/videos/news/local/2014/08/13/14007133/> “[Brown] put his arm up to let them know that he was compliant and that he was unarmed, and they shot him twice more, and he fell to the ground and died.”

Crenshaw explained to reporters on the scene, “[Brown] was running this way, but his body is laying this way because he turned around to tell the police that he was unarmed.

“He didn’t have no weapon on him at all,” she continued. “They killed this boy for no reason, and there should be justice about this.”

4. Emmanuel Freeman, who reportedly tweeted about the shooting right after it happened.

Freeman, whose Twitter handle is {@TheePharoah}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/TheePharoah>, was sitting in his home in Ferguson when he heard gunshots outside his window. He began to tweet his reaction.

5. The man who spoke to Brown right before he left for the convenience store.

A man, who preferred to speak on condition of anonymity, told {Fox2 News}<hyperlink=http://fox2now.com/2014/08/12/witness-claims-he-saw-what-happened-when-michael-brown-was-shot/> that he and Brown had seen each other right before Brown went to the convenience store. The man said Brown told him that he was “feeling some bad vibes” but that the “Lord Jesus Christ” would help him through it. The man said that Brown said he’d return to continue their conversation after making a stop at the store.

Approximately 25 minutes later, the man heard gunfire and looked up and saw a man, who he didn’t know at the time was Brown, “staggering and running.”

The man said that Brown put his hands up and started screaming, “OK! OK! OK! OK! OK!” The witness claims that the police officer didn’t tell Brown to get on the ground or anything.

“He just started shooting,” the man continued, estimating that the officer shot Brown six or seven times after he turned around to seemingly surrender. “There’s no way you can justify it.”",9,1200,NA,NA

It’s safe to say that Brown has become a victim of what I like to refer to as the “Trayvon Martin effect” in the media.

Trayvon, who was killed by George Zimmerman, was depicted as a gold-grill-wearing, weed-smoking teenager in the photos used by the media. There were no photos of Trayvon smiling with his family members or being just your average happy teen, which his family members said he was. Similarly, the photos of Brown that have been picked up by the media included him throwing up a peace sign, which conservative media has translated into a “gang sign.”

You’d be hard-pressed to find mainstream media showing Brown at his high school graduation or with members of his family. Ironically, all of those photos exist courtesy of Brown’s Facebook page. Unfortunately, because of Ferguson police, we’ll never be able to see a photo of Brown attending his first day of college today.

#IfTheyGunnedMeDown is not only a sad commentary on what it means to be black in America but also shows that in order to have our own narrative correctly reported, we have to do the reporting ourselves.

Following the slaying of Brown, various media outlets falsely reported that protesters were chanting, “Kill the police,” but if you followed the social media accounts of those at the protest, they verified that the protesters were shouting not “Kill the police” but “No justice, no peace.” 

Several residents in the St. Louis area have taken to their social media accounts to provide an accurate narrative of what’s going on in Ferguson. People like {St. Louis rapper Vandalyzm}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/Vandalyzm> and {Alderman Antonio French}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench> have diligently updated their Twitter and Vine accounts to provide videos of the protests and the unfortunate looting that has occurred. 

As the Ferguson police continue their investigation into the police killing of Brown, residents of the city have the right and just cause to shout and scream for answers. Brown’s killing proves once again that those whose jobs are to “protect and serve” are sometimes the ones we need to protect ourselves from, especially if we’re black. ",NA,12900,NA,NA

According to the {Associated Press,}<hyperlink=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/obama-heading-back-dc-rare-vacation-break> Obama made the move as tensions in Ferguson, Mo., and in Iraq continue to grow.

AP notes that the president had been receiving updates on both situations while on vacation and that it was unclear as to why the president had to return home as ""the White House had also already announced Obama's plans to return to Washington before the U.S. air strikes in Iraq began.""

The president's decision to interrupt his two-week vacation appears to have been fueled by growing criticism of the commander in chief vacationing while tensions remain high in Ferguson, Mo., after an unarmed African-American teen was fatally shot by a white police officer. During the first week of his vacation, Obama made statements about the clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson, as well as the situation in Iraq. AP reports that the president ""also called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas.""

""I think it's fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that's why you've seen the president stay engaged,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz told AP.

As the sun came down, police informed the protesters that their rights to protest had been denied.

Cops in Ferguson fired rubber bullets and tear gas bombs at the protesters and journalists covering the night. As law enforcement approached the protesters, many tried their best to scurry off into the neighborhood.   

As many on social media were watching everything unfold through various live streams available online, as a sign of solidarity, #dontshoot photos became prominent. According to Dorian Johnson, a witness to Michael Brown’s shooting, Brown was facing the officer who shot him with his hands in the air.

Various people, including a group of freshman students at Howard University, posted photos with their hands in the air captioned with #dontshoot.

Crockett Jr. ,08/11/2014,12/04/2015,"While details continue to emerge in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by police in Ferguson, Mo., protesters turned looters on Sunday night as several stores were ransacked, vehicles were vandalized and police in riot gear were taunted as tensions continued to mount over exactly what happened that cost Michael Brown his life.  

According to the {Associated Press,}<hyperlink=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/thousands-gather-vigil-missouri-man-24923007> a presumably peaceful candlelight vigil Sunday night in Ferguson—a predominantly black suburb outside St. Louis—to honor the memory of the 18-year-old, who was shot multiple times by police, turned chaotic after ""businesses near the shooting scene were looted, including a convenience store, a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store.""

Video footage of the scene posted online by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch shows a convenience store on fire. Other video footage shows people running out of stores with items and some jumping atop police cars.  

""The small group of people are creating a huge mess,"" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told news station {KTVI-TV}<hyperlink=http://fox2now.com/2014/08/10/report-michael-brown-protesters-damage-police-vehicles-on-west-florissant/> about the looting. ""Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.""

Although the motive for the attempted arrest and subsequent shooting of Brown remained unclear, witnesses to the incident have told a very different story from that of the police. According to early reports, Brown, who was set to start college on Monday, was going to visit his grandmother Saturday when police approached him. He was arrested and placed in the back of a police car.

""I witnessed the police chase after the guy, full force. He ran for his life,"" Piaget Crenshaw, 19, told the {Chicago Tribune.}<hyperlink=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-missouri-police-shooting-20140810-story.html> ""They shot him and he fell.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told AP a very different version of what happened. Belmar claims that two men were seen standing outside an apartment complex in Ferguson. Police approached the men and the officer arrested Brown. A struggle ensued and at least one shot was fired inside the squad car, according to Belmar. It was unclear if Brown or the second man was the one who allegedly struggled with the officer, AP reported.

That struggle made its way outside the police car and left Brown dead. Police confirmed that Brown was not armed and that shell casings found at the scene match the officer's gun. AP reports that police are still trying to sort out exactly what happened that night.

{Editor Says Inclusion Could Increase Community Contacts}<hyperlink=http://mije.org/node/8581/#brown>

The fatal police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old black man in a St. Louis suburb, followed by looting and burning by angry protesters, led to a national social media campaign protesting the media images of black men, a quickly published editorial by the city's black newspaper and an acknowledgement by an editor at the city's major daily that more diversity on the staff could help the paper cover what he called a ""huge story.""

""We're pretty much doing blanket coverage. The biggest difficulty for us is trying to cover the investigation itself and the bigger issues out there and what it means and the violence,"" Adam Goodman, a deputy managing editor at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, told Journal-isms by telephone. The looting and the police response to anger at the killing of Michael Brown, put the paper to the test. They happened between editions on Sunday, he said.

""For us,"" Goodman added, ""the next thing is to try to get to the bottom of exactly what happened"" to cause Brown's death. Police and a friend who accompanied Brown have offered conflicting accounts.

The Post-Dispatch has deployed 12 to 15 reporters, plus at least an additional half-dozen photographers and videographers on the story, Goodman said.

Readers have at least 16 or 17 ""different entry points"" to it, he said, and the {front page for Tuesday}<hyperlink=http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=MO_SLPD&ref_pge=gal&b_pge=3>, as the one Monday, is to be completely be given over to the story of Brown's killing and its aftermath, save for some referrals to stories inside.

Goodman said two of the reporters are black journalists: Denise Hollinshed, who was covering police on Saturday night, when the shooting occurred, and Koran Addo, who normally covers higher education. According to the annual diversity census by the American Society of News Editors, the Post-Dispatch newsroom is 7.1 percent black, while U.S. Census figures put the city of St. Louis at 49.29 percent black and St. Louis County at 23.7 percent black.

Two white journalists, reporter Steve Giegerich and photographer David Carson, were assaulted by a predominantly black crowd, {Carson as he was photographing looters}<hyperlink=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/attacked-on-the-job-a-post-dispatch-photographer-s-tale/article_1b6fba60-5ac1-592a-8818-19614f1910aa.html>.

Goodman is supervising the newsroom while top editor Gilbert Bailon is away, driving back from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists convention in San Antonio.

Goodman said he would not attribute the attacks to race, noting that police did not like journalists, either. But, he said, ""Certainly, it is unfortunate that our numbers are not higher in that regard."" Asked to elaborate, he said, ""In terms of sourcing and getting out in the community and talking to people. It was a dangerous scene last night. It doesn't matter who it was. Unfortunately it was pretty unpredictable."" But having more black journalists might mean ""better ideas on following up, and just in terms of ideas and coverage.""

He said the newsroom has been hiring about two people a month through the summer to fill vacancies. In May, Columbia Journalism Review reported that the {Post-Dispatch has sustained more than 230 buyouts or layoffs since 2008}<hyperlink=http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/at_lee_exec_bonuses_flat_wages_sinking_morale.php?page=all>, according to {Paper Cuts}<hyperlink=http://newspaperlayoffs.com/>, a website tracking newspaper layoffs which is run by former P-D staffer Erica Smith.

The Post-Dispatch has not had a black local-news columnist since 2009, {when Sylvester Brown Jr. was fired.}<hyperlink=http://mije.org/richardprince/74-take-buyouts-atlanta-paper> Brown succeeded the late and popular Gregory Freeman, {who died in 2002.}<hyperlink=http://www.amazon.com/Greg-Freeman-Gentleman-Gentle-Man/dp/1891442236> Brown {wrote about the shooting on his blog}<hyperlink=http://sylvesterbrownjr.blogspot.com/2014/08/now-you-see-me.html>.

Goodman spoke as KSDK-TV, the NBC affiliate, was broadcasting live one of several news conferences relating to the events. The stations' websites posted video of appearances by police officials, family representatives and community members and live streamed police activity.

As Jim Shur and David A. Lieb reported Monday for the Associated Press:

""{A black teenager who was fatally shot by a police officer had his hands raised when the officer approached with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly}<hyperlink=http://www.boston.com/business/news/2014/08/11/vandalism-looting-after-vigil-for-missouri-man/YAWFOqR0DBTbRAZHROdLLJ/story.html>, according to two men who said they witnessed the shooting that sparked two nights of unrest in suburban St. Louis.

""The FBI opened an investigation Monday into the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after being confronted by an officer in Ferguson, a suburb of 21,000 that's nearly 70 percent black.

""Authorities in Ferguson used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse a large crowd Monday night that had gathered at the site of a burned-out convenience store damaged a night earlier, when many businesses in the area were looted.. . .""

The Rev. Al Sharpton, leader of the National Action Network who is also the host of MSNBC's ""PoliticsNation,"" {announced that the family had asked him to come to the area}<hyperlink=http://www.eurweb.com/2014/08/sharpton-says-family-of-mike-brown-asks-for-his-help-he-has-accepted/#R98bSDBuVyIixFut.99> to help them in the investigation of Brown's death. He said he would do so.

The St. Louis American, an award-winning black weekly, posted an editorial Monday that said, ""{Our reporter Bridjes O'Neil reports from the streets the immediately relevant fact that the riot last night was partly incited by outsiders}<hyperlink=http://www.stlamerican.com/news/editorials/article_9beb2f34-2186-11e4-9130-0019bb2963f4.html>. We believe the public attention being turned away from the police shooting an unarmed teen toward an angry community boiling over was in part manipulated by people who do not have the best interests of our community at heart.""

The editorial also said, ""In North St. Louis County, it also must be said, decades of disinvestment have left many youth with a feeling of hopelessness and an absence of opportunities. The ugly image of teens looting local stores is an all-too-familiar image that results when high-tension crisis meets grinding poverty.

The newspaper urged the community ""to channel its anger more productively than what transpired on the streets last night. However many frustrated teens and ill-willed opportunists may have turned to senseless violence last night, we know that the majority of our community wants justice, not more violence.

""While we believe agitators are partly responsible for making a matter of justice into a racially charged crisis, our community remains deeply convinced that Michael Brown is dead today because he was African American. . . .""

Chris King, the American's editorial director, told Journal-isms by telephone that he believed the outsiders included some white people ""who would like it to be a story of black people tearing up their own community"" instead of a black teenager killed by police. He attributed the agitation to both the far left and the far right.

King said he had asked several community members to write pieces for the American to augment its relatively small reporting staff. The paper was also making use of {Twitter}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/StLouisAmerican>, Facebook and other social media to give the American's reports immediacy, and he and other staff members were being interviewed by the national media.

In June, the American won the National Newspaper Publishers Association’s Russwurm/Senstacke Trophy for general excellence {for the third consecutive year}<hyperlink=http://www.blackpressusa.com/2014/06/st-louis-american-wins-nnpa-best-newspaper-award/#sthash.FpxdC02P.dpbs>.

The Post-Dispatch also spoke to black complaints. Under the headline, ""{Michael Brown and the disparity of due process,}<hyperlink=http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/the-platform/editorial-michael-brown-and-the-disparity-of-due-process/article_40bb2d0e-8619-534a-b629-093ebc79f0a6.html>"" the daily editorialized, ""In Ferguson, the city where Michael died, the police in 2013 pulled over blacks at a 37 percent higher rate than whites compared to their relative populations. Black drivers were twice as likely to be searched and twice as likely to be arrested compared to white drivers.

""Those statistics don't prove racial profiling.

""But those numbers plus a dead young man in the street make a strong case for deserving a closer look.""

Nationally, African Americans on social media used the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown to demonstrate how they said the news media portrays black men in the worst light.

""{Black users shared pictures of themselves at their best — in uniforms or caps and gowns}<hyperlink=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/11/after-michael-browns-killing-iftheygunnedmedown-shows-how-selfies-shape-history/> — juxtaposed with images that would garner less sympathy and perhaps paint more tawdry pictures of their lives,"" Soraya Nadia McDonald wrote Monday for the Washington Post.

Citing Geraldo Rivera's 2012 statement that ""{I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon Martin’s death as George Zimmerman was}<hyperlink=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/23/geraldo-rivera-trayvon-martin-hoodie_n_1375080.html>,"" McDonald wrote, ""#IfTheyGunnedMeDown isn't just demanding that people like Geraldo see past clothing. It's questioning if it's possible for people, especially young black men, to live their lives online without worry that an innocent photo of them gettin' gully at a party will somehow become re-appropriated as evidence of black thuggery. . . .

""The entire nation may now judge whether a victim was a good kid or deserved to be shot. The hashtag asks if black teens have the same right as others to make mistakes — to do dumb things and post about it on Facebook or clown around with their friends — without becoming branded in perpetuity.""

Asked {""What do you consider 'diversity'}<hyperlink=http://www.buzzfeed.com/hnigatu/top-editors-on-how-they-think-about-diversity-in-newsrooms>,"" Ben Smith, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed, replied, ""I think I've been persuaded of a definition by my colleague Shani Hilton: It's important to hire in a way that doesn't oblige people to represent their own identity internally or externally. Ideally, that means that you have enough, say, black or Hispanic or Mormon staff writers that, far from representing some monolithic viewpoint, they can disagree with one another about any given thing. Conversely, we do try to have a newsroom where people can choose to write about their identities in a direct way, and where the subjects of identity and diversity aren't taboo.""

Smith was one of 13 top editors asked by his publication how they think about diversity in their newsrooms. The answers were reported Monday by BuzzFeed staffers Heben Nigatu and Tracy Clayton.

To the question ""How is the issue of diversity in the newsroom addressed by your publication or by you specifically?"" Julia Turner, editor-in-chief of Slate, replied, ""We’re addressing the issue head-on. We convened a working group on the issue last fall that resulted in a big shift: We began paying all of our interns. This required some adjustments to the budget, but we thought it was important to be able to attract candidates who couldn't afford to take a free internship.

""We've also over the past few months initiated a review of our hiring practices. At one meeting on the subject, the staffers present went around the room and explained how they'd come to Slate. Of those present, all of the white staffers had found out about their positions through their networks: friends, connections, forwarded email listings. All of the people of color had seen a public listing posted on our site, a job board, or social media. That was striking to us, and has caused us to rethink how we are writing job listings and where we are posting them.""

The article explained, ""We reached out to the editors at some of the top publications — magazines, newspapers, and websites — and asked them six questions concerning their handling of racial diversity in their newsrooms. This is the second part of a two-part project, the first of which focused on journalists of color.

""Of the 33 publications we reached out to, we received responses from 13, including BuzzFeed's editor-in-chief, Ben Smith: The Guardian, The New York Observer, Politico, New York Magazine, Vice, The New Republic, Vox, the Washington Post, Slate, ThinkProgress, The New Yorker, and the Los Angeles Times.""

When Congress goes on break, so does the rest of Washington—along with the President Barack Obama, vacationing in Martha’s Vineyard, who quickly issued a statement on the death of beloved comedian actor Robin Williams but who took near three days before public “{reflection}<hyperlink=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/barack-obama-michael-brown-statement-109959.html?hp=r1” on events sparked by the death of a random college-bound black teen.

CBC members were tight-lipped over the weekend as smoke started rising from the working-class St. Louis suburb. A {joint statement}<hyperlink=http://cbc.fudge.house.gov/in-the-news/reps-conyers-clay-and-fudge-call-on-department-of-justice-to-investigate-the-death-of-michael-brown1/> finally emerged on Monday from CBC Chair Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), House Judiciary ranking member John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Mound City-area Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), publicly nudging the Justice Department to probe the Michael Brown incident—which it has. But updates from {@OfficialCBC}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/OfficialCBC> and the CBC’s website didn’t get going until a spate of tweets later the same day. If you looked to Clay’s Twitter timeline for real-time assessment, from the tone of the tweets, you’d think he was in another district than the one he represents—right where Ferguson is.

Meanwhile, the 600-plus-strong {National Black Caucus of State Legislators}<hyperlink=http://nbcsl.org/> hasn’t yet huddled or issued a statement. But individually, black state legislators, like Missouri Rep. Clem Smith (D-St. Louis), are attempting something. “The leadership in Ferguson doesn’t reflect [the racial composition] of the city,” Smith told The Root. “This is where political power comes in, where we can elect a board that’s responsive to [black residents’] needs.”

Clay’s cautious stance could be politically problematic for him down the road, should St. Louis 21st Ward Alderman {Antonio French}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench> decide to capitalize. French went from 4,000 Twitter followers on Saturday to now more than 32,000 as he’s street-credded himself with far more comprehensive coverage of events in Ferguson.

Expectations differ from political realities. Justice-seeking black constituents demand commandolike advocacy in the form of G.I. Joe-like black politicians ready to battle heavily armed racist institutions. 

But it’s not that easy. Black Congressional members, for example, have to fend off existential threats from gerrymandering Republican state legislatures diluting black political power. African-American state and local politicians are forced to forge winning “coalitions” of voters, including white voters—and powerful police unions that make influential endorsements.

Democratic-aligned black politicos must also navigate racially charged waters or risk tipping the scales further against their weakened party during elections. White conservative “tough on crime” voters siding with pro-police GOP candidates are clearly more energized than voters of color. And November is bleak enough electorally for Democrats. Being too strong on police brutality fuels Republican narratives of a “{war on whites}<hyperlink=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/214245-republican-accuses-dems-of-launching-war-on-whites-in-border>.”

So black politicians are likely doing all they can do—or, at least, all they think they can do. They’re monitoring the situation, conducting official oversight and putting pressure on government agencies to act. “It’s important we redouble our efforts to respond to police violence,” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) carefully told The Root. “[But] the most important thing we can do is to make certain the Department of Justice enforces [applicable] civil rights statutes.”

Jeffries, dealing with the killing of Eric Garner last month, concedes that “there’s an epidemic of police violence.” Jeffries and several colleagues in New York's congressional delegation have called a press conference for Thursday, to call for federal action in the Garner case, but even he will tell you he can’t speak for the whole CBC. Plus, he’s comfortably situated in New York’s 8th Congressional District, where the population is overwhelmingly black and Latino. Clay doesn’t have that luxury in a gerrymandered 47 percent white district that’s forced him to tread softly.  Many modern black politicians are not your neighborhood preacher or soapbox civil rights organizer. Fifty years since the Voting Rights Act, they are maturing into skilled elected officials who must get re-elected—at whatever political cost.",NA,1600,NA,NA

You should recognize these names. They all belong to unarmed black men who were killed by law enforcement since July 2014 for seemingly inexplicable reasons: allegedly selling loose cigarettes, allegedly holding a toy gun in the toy section of Wal-Mart, allegedly running away after a scuffle with the cops, and allegedly complying with police and lying down on the street.

All of these cases are in varying stages of investigation. Here’s a roundup of what you need to know about each one:

{Ezell Ford}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/unarmed_black_man_ezell_ford_shot_by_police_in_la.html>

Family says: Ford’s family claims that when he was shot Aug. 11 in South Los Angeles, he was obeying Los Angeles Police Department officers and lying on the ground. The 25-year-old, who was mentally disabled, was stopped by police for what was described as “investigative” reasons. A cousin, who did not want to be identified, said that the unarmed young man was laid out before he was shot in the back three times. Ford was rushed to the hospital, where he had to undergo surgery, but he did not make it. Tritobia Ford, who was identified as the young man’s mother, said that the police would not tell her where her son was hospitalized.

Officers say: During the “investigative stop,” there was allegedly a “struggle” that caused shots to be fired, according to an LAPD news release. The officers involved did not require medical attention, although they did reportedly have minor scrapes. The department also said that it was unaware of any information being withheld from the family.

Any charges? So far no charges have been filed in this particular case, but the officer responsible, who has yet to be identified, has been put on paid administrative leave as the incident is investigated. According to reports, LAPD police Chief Charlie Beck, the Office of the Inspector General and the Board of Police Commissioners are expected to review the case.

Community reaction: Twitter has taken the lead on this case, as usual, with the hashtag {#EzellFord}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/hashtag/EzellFord?src=hash>. News of Ford’s death is still spreading online and in real life as the nation reels from the loss of Ferguson, Mo.’s “gentle giant,” Michael Brown. According to reports, a rally for Ford is being planned for Sunday, Aug. 17, at LAPD headquarters.

{Michael Brown}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/st_louis_residents_protest_after_cop_kills_unarmed_black_teen.html>

Family says: Details remain extremely sketchy in this particular case. One eyewitness to the shooting, {Brown’s friend Dorian Johnson, told MSNBC}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/friend_who_witnessed_mike_brown_shooting_speaks.html> in an exclusive interview that the young men were confronted on Aug. 9 by a cop in Ferguson, who told them to “get the f--k off the sidewalk.” The officer tried to get out of the squad car, but the door slammed against Brown’s body and closed. The officer allegedly reached out of the car, grabbing Brown by his throat before threatening to shoot.

That was when Darren Wilson, a six-year veteran, ended up firing the first shot. The young men allegedly started running, and Johnson ducked behind a car. Brown, 18, kept running and was hit again by another bullet. At this point he tried to surrender, holding up his hands and attempting to get to the floor, but the officer continued shooting, according to reports. In the aftermath, Brown’s body was left lying in the street for hours, and his mother claimed that she was not given an opportunity to identify her own son.

Officers say: Police claim that Brown was attempting to reach for the officer’s gun when a scuffle ensued and he subsequently took off running, resulting in the shooting.

Any charges? So far the officer is on paid administrative leave. The FBI has gotten involved in the case and is said to be conducting an investigation parallel to that of local authorities. The Department of Justice is apparently also watching this case closely.

Community reaction: This particular case has rocked the community both online and on the ground with incredible force. Almost immediately, people took to the streets of Ferguson demanding answers and justice and refusing to be budged by police, who eventually came out with dogs, SWAT teams and heavy equipment to try to quell the protest.

Eventually, some of the protesters turned to violence, with looting and destruction of property. Police have been deploying tear gas and smoke bombs into the crowd, which has responded {by throwing back tear gas and Molotov cocktails}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/_24_hours_in_ferguson.html?wpisrc=topstories>. Online, the powerful hashtag {#iftheygunnedmedown}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/hashtag/iftheygunnedmedown> surfaced, while citizen reporters tweeted pictures and video from the scene. Currently, black community leaders like the Rev. Al Sharpton, and organizations like the NAACP, are urging protesters to stay calm and peaceful while adding their own voices to the calls for justice.

{John Crawford III}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/family_claims_ohio_father_was_shot_dead_by_police_in_walmart_over_toy_gun.html>

Family says: His relatives tell the story of a young, loving father who was just handling a toy gun in the toy section of Wal-Mart in southwestern Ohio on Aug. 5 before he was inexplicably gunned down by law enforcement. Since then the family have been demanding that surveillance video from the store be released so that they can prove exactly what happened. They have taken their case to civil rights organizations in hopes of finding closure.

Officers say: Authorities say they responded appropriately to a 911 call about a man who was supposedly holding a rifle and seemed to be loading the weapon. Officers claim that Crawford, 22, was waving the rifle at a customer and would not drop it, which was the reason the police opened fire. That weapon turned out to be a pump air rifle, a type of BB gun, which cannot kill people but can kill small animals.

Any charges? The two law-enforcement agents who fired their weapons—Officer Sean Williams and Sgt. David Darkow—were put on leave after the incident and pending an investigation. Local authorities have asked the state to take over, with Beavercreek Police Chief Dennis Evers requesting that the state attorney general and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation look into whether the use of deadly force was justified, according to reports.

Community reaction: Social media have led the campaign on this slaying, with Twitter users pointing out the disparity between the reaction to Crawford {holding what ended up being a toy rifle}<hyperlink=http://americawakiewakie.com/post/94356442808/cops-shoot-and-kill-man-holding-toy-gun-in-walmart> and the response to (white) {open carriers of assault rifles}<hyperlink=http://mysharona1987.tumblr.com/post/94307556934/tell-me-white-privilege-isnt-real>, who have walked into business establishments without worry or confrontation.

{Eric Garner}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/07/video_ny_father_dies_after_being_put_in_chokehold_by_police.html>

Family says: The tragic video showing the death of the Staten Island, N.Y., father of six on July 17 was widely publicized. From the moment the footage was released, Garner’s family has been demanding justice.

Video footage taken at the scene of the incident shows Garner in what appears to be a choke hold after he was accused of selling loose cigarettes illegally. His family pointed to the fact that he did not have any cigarettes on him or in his car at the time of his death. His widow, Esaw Garner, alongside black leaders like Al Sharpton, {called for a thorough and prompt investigation and civil rights probe}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/07/eric_garner_s_widow_calls_for_civil_rights_investigation.html> into the incident, given that it is illegal in New York to subdue suspects using a choke hold.

Officers say: {An internal report by the New York City Police Department}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/07/nypd_internal_report_staten_island_dad_was_not_in_great_distress.html. after the death did not make any mention of the alleged choke hold and stated that officers apparently did not pick up any cues that Garner was in distress.

Any charges? Internal Affairs was looking into the matter as of last month, and in the immediate aftermath two officers, Daniel Pantaleo and Justin Damico, were put on desk duty. {A medical examiner ruled}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/eric_garner_s_death_ruled_a_homicide_by_nyc_medical_examiner.html> at the beginning of August that Garner did, in fact, die as a result of the choke hold, ruling the 43-year-old father’s death a homicide.

Community reaction: Once again, social media has led the battalion in the call for justice. The video of Garner’s confrontation with police spread like wildfire as viewers questioned the need to apprehend the father in such a violent manner.

De Blasio stayed in the middle of the argument, carefully walking the line between holding the NYPD responsible and praising Bratton for his job thus far.

The shooting of Michael Brown, who was set to start college Monday, sparked a night of unrest in Ferguson, a suburb just outside of St. Louis, the report says.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said during a Sunday morning news conference, “One shot was fired by the officer's gun inside the car during the struggle, and that the officer fired multiple times at Michael Brown as he ran away,” the report says.

He noted that an autopsy was pending and that a toxicology test would take as long as six weeks to determine whether Brown had alcohol or drugs in his system.

Belmar said a full investigation by his department is under way and could also involve the FBI, the report says. And according to the Post-Dispatch, he said, “the results would be forwarded to St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch, whose office would decide whether criminal charges were justified.”

Belmar said that Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who arrived at the scene Saturday, called him personally to ask for a county investigation.

The officer, a six-year veteran whose name has not been disclosed, has been placed on administrative leave. The chief said that the officer “appears to have ‘no other issues’ in his past,” the report says.

Details were sketchy about what exactly happened, but the St. Louis County Police Department is scheduled to hold a news conference early Sunday to discuss the incident that began about noon Saturday at the Canfield Green Apartment complex in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, {reports USA Today}<hyperlink=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/09/anger-follows-police-shooting-in-st-louis-suburb/13844477/>.

The victim, Michael Brown, apparently was on his way to visit his grandmother when he was allegedly shot by the officer, according to his mother, Lesley McSpadden, Post-Dispatch reports. The officer's name has not yet been released.

Piaget Crenshaw, 19, told the Post-Dispatch that she was waiting for a ride to work when she saw a police officer attempting to place Brown in the rear seat of a squad car.

“She then said she saw the teen, hands in the air, attempt to flee,” the Post-Dispatch writes. “Several shots hit Brown as he ran, Crenshaw said. She complied with a request that she give photos of the scene to authorities.”

Brown, who graduated this year from Normandy High School, was scheduled to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday, the Post-Dispatch says.

The shooting touched off a vociferous protest in the community.

Hundreds of residents took to the streets in the St. Louis suburb, some shouting “Kill the police” during a protest that lasted several hours, {the Associated Press reports}<hyperlink=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_POLICE_SHOOTING_MISSOURI?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2014-08-10-01-45-15>.

“Louis Head, Brown’s stepfather, held a sign that said: ‘Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!’,” writes the Post-Dispatch.

A St. Louis County chapter of the NAACP, according to AP, called on the FBI to look into the shooting that took place in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Other residents took to Twitter to express outrage.

Jay Nixon: Releasing Video an Attempt to 'Besmirch' Victim,Stephen A. Crockett Jr. ,08/18/2014,12/05/2015,"Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson aren't in agreement over the release to the press of a store security video that allegedly shows Michael Brown stealing cigars from a convenience store. Brown, an unarmed Ferguson teen, was fatally shot by police Officer Darren Wilson a week ago, and the shooting has sparked national debate, several demonstrations and police confrontations.

Nixon says the video, released Friday, ignited the flames for more protests in Ferguson, which had started to see a peaceful process Thursday evening. ""It had an incendiary effect,"" the Democratic governor, who has given control of the police department during the protest to Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson, said of the video on the CBS show {Face the Nation}<hyperlink=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-jay-nixon-ferguson-robbery-video-had-an-incendiary-effect/>.

The video allegedly showed Brown stealing cigars from behind the counter of an area convenience store and shoving a store clerk who tried to stop him on the way out.  

""When you release [a] picture and you clearly are attempting to besmirch a victim of a shooting, shot down in his own street, a young man, and at the same time, you're releasing information to try to make it, to tarnish him, then properly, there was a lot of folks that were concerned about that,"" Nixon explained. ""I do think it flamed it back up and has caused us to have to deal with some of that.""

Nixon, who made the television rounds on Sunday, noted that his office was not informed and had no idea that the video was going to be released.

Jackson's decision to release the video at the same time that he announced the name of the officer who fatally shot Brown incensed area residents who felt that the police chief was trying to connect the two separate events.

Jackson would admit later that Wilson was not aware that Brown might have been a suspect in the alleged strong-arm robbery when the two encountered each other. 

For eight days, Ferguson has seen several violent clashes between protesters and police, who initially responded to the demonstrations with fully militarized tactics. Images of police in riot gear and SWAT vehicles and carrying automatic weapons and deploying tear gas on marchers began to saturate the news. The images were also jarring to the governor of Missouri.

""All of us were thunderstruck by the pictures we saw, I mean, the overmilitarization, the [mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles] rolling in, the guns pointed at kids in the street,"" Nixon said Sunday on ABC's {This Week}<hyperlink=http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-missouri-gov-jay-nixon/story?id=25008455>.

“I ... wanted the committee to know that [Trayvon] was killed by a person [who] is of non-African-American descent and that the person was 28 years old so that they can understand that this was a 17-year-old child, by U.S. standards, against a 28-year-old adult male, and that Trayvon was considered a threat only because of the color of his skin,” Fulton said of her son, who was killed in February 2012 by former neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. “Although ‘Stand your ground’ may seem like it’s a neutral law on the surface ... it really isn’t, the way it is applied in the USA.”

The convention to eliminate racial discrimination is a treaty, approved by the U.S. in 1994, which details what countries should do and what standards should be upheld to prevent, eliminate and redress racism and discrimination. The U.N.’s Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination oversees implementation of the convention.

“We’re part of a process to ensure that the U.S. is upholding human rights standards in the way that addresses racial discrimination across the range of issue areas in the U.S.,"" U.S. Human Rights Network Executive Director Ejim Dike, whose organization led the event, explained during a teleconference Thursday.

""As you know, we have a number of racial tensions right now flaring up in the U.S. including in Ferguson, Missouri, and issues around police violence directed at people of color, black and brown people in the U.S., which really stems from a culture where we criminalize the bodies of black and brown people in the U.S.,” Dike said.

“The tragic shooting of Michael Brown and the events in Ferguson underscored the gap between what our Constitution requires and what our society currently is confronting in terms of racial discrimination,” added Chandra S. Bhatnager, senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s Human Rights Program.

 “It also underscored the gap between what the U.S. obligations are under CERD and the current practice, and that’s what we’re here to highlight,” he continued. “We’re here to highlight that gap, we’re here to hold the government accountable to improve its policies to eliminate or reduce discrimination and profiling.”

Bhatnager stated that the delegation was calling on the U.S. government to create a national plan of action on racism, indicating that a lack of a plan could be the reason for the current gap between what should be versus what actually is.

The delegation also called for the creation of a national human rights institution so that people would be able to address human rights violations, as well as an update of U.S. Department of Justice guidlines on the use of race.

“That guidance was from 2003 and that has yet been updated ... there’s hope for many of us who are racial-justice advocates that the guidance will be updated and that the loopholes that exist in the guidance now, which allow for profiling related to immigration or profiling related to national security, that those loopholes will be eliminated,” Bhatnager said, “and that a strong updated guidance will be issued, that the guidance will be able to be implemented, it will have teeth and it will be applicable, not only to federal police and federal law enforcement but also to state and local officials, who are often the primary interaction between communities and law enforcement.”

Dike pointed out that many thought the lack of executive response could be linked to why these problems continue to occur.

“What we have been seeing is a failure of leadership in policing. I think ultimately that should come from the top, and that’s one of the reasons we’re here in Geneva ... to emphasize the point that because we have these race disparities, because there’s this disproportionate racial impact on people of color—that is directly linked to police violence, as well as to a failure to come up with any kind of sensible limits on gun control—the result is that young people of color are paying the price with their lives,” Dike said. “We think that the federal government can show some more leadership in its moral authority, in just making clear statements about what policing should look like on the local level.”

As part of the U.S. delegation, sharing their own stories of grief in the hopes of turning losses into something positive, were Fulton and Davis.

“My son, 17-year-old Jordan Davis ... was killed at a gas station in Jacksonville, Florida, for no other reason other than the color of his skin and also that he was playing loud music,” Ron Davis said, speaking about his own purpose in Geneva. “I think that shooter Michael Dunn was emboldened by the fact that when he took a concealed-weapons class they [told] him, ‘All you have to say when you shoot somebody is five things: I feared for my life.’

“Regardless that my son didn’t have a weapon, regardless that my son never touched a hair on his head, regardless that my son never even got out of the car to touch his car ... in their mind they say that they fear someone for whatever reason, they’re able to take action,” Davis added. “I think that’s a human rights violation, that people can fear you in their mind even though you’re not taking action against them, and they can still take action against you and try to get away with it.”

“People are shooting first and asking questions later, and it used to be a 50 percent chance that they go to jail, now it’s something like 20 percent chance that they’re going to jail. It’s highly unlikely they’ll go to jail because most people are using ‘Stand your ground,’ and they’re saying because the person looks suspicious or they feared for their life,” Fulton highlighted. “[I’ve also] asked the committee to challenge the federal government and to work with states to repeal or amend the ‘Stand your ground’ law so that people of color have a future.”",NA,1700,NA,NA

It was another tension-filled day for the citizens of Ferguson after Saturday's shooting of the unarmed African-American teen sparked protests, police in full-out riot gear, looting, tear gas and an armored SWAT car as the St. Louis area continued to struggle with the fatal shooting of one of its own.

Monday saw the FBI noting that it will be investigating the killing of Brown, who, according to witnesses, was shot and killed by a police officer as he stood with his hands in the air. Authorities have noted that no weapon was found on Brown.

Monday also saw Brown's parents asking for an end to the violence that peppered the Sunday evening news. Looters were shown running from stores as other buildings burned in the background. Although Brown's parents made it abundantly clear that they wanted the city to remain calm, they also made it abundantly clear that they did not agree with the police account of what happened to their son Saturday, according to the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-use-tear-gas-in-ferguson-people-jam-church-for/article_6060a563-d7d1-544a-8bb3-793c46be427c.html>.

According to witnesses, Brown and his friend were walking in the middle of the street near the apartment of Brown's grandmother when a police cruiser approached them and an officer allegedly told the young men to get back on the sidewalk. The officer reportedly put Brown in a headlock, and when Brown broke free he began running with his hands in the air. Witnesses claim that the officer gave chase with his gun drawn and fatally shot Brown.

Although police have been tight-lipped about the shooting, early reports claimed that the officer was trying to place Brown in the backseat of the squad car when a scuffle for the officer's gun ensued and the officer fired on Brown inside the police car. Police officials have noted that the officer, who has not been identified, fired several more shots away from the vehicle. 

It is unclear why the officer stopped Brown and his friend or whether the officer was attempting to arrest Brown. It has been reported that Brown's friend was not arrested or charged with any wrongdoing. The officer has been placed on leave.

The Post-Dispatch reports that the early part of Monday saw protesters and police out in full force, but by nightfall, police began firing tear gas, telling protesters to go home. The newspaper notes that the streets were clear and quiet by midnight. Police told the Post-Dispatch that they arrested some 10 people on Monday, compared with 32 arrests on Sunday.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told the Post-Dispatch that they will be sharing all information from their investigation with the FBI and the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney.

""This is a complex investigation, as it should be,"" Belmar told the newspaper. ""We need to make sure everything’s done right."" Belmar also noted that several people at the apartment complex still need to be interviewed by investigators. 

""I understand the public has a right to be skeptical,"" Belmar said. ""But I would also ask the public to be reasonable.""",NA,376,NA,NA

The 22-year-old, who was walking with Michael Brown before Brown was fatally shot, revealed to {MSNBC in an exclusive interview}<hyperlink=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri. exactly what he saw during the inexplicable shooting by police Saturday in Ferguson, Mo.

Johnson told MSNBC that he saw the gun and “fire” coming out of the barrel ... all over what he described as a confrontation with a bully cop.

According to the young man, he and Brown, 18, were walking and talking when a squad car pulled up. The officer in the car told them to “get the f--k on the sidewalk.”

The young men told the officer that they were almost at Johnson’s residence, and that is when things got violent ... on the part of the cop, Johnson said.

The young man told MSNBC that the officer put the vehicle in reverse, almost hitting them, so that they were in line with his side door. He demanded to know what they had said, or something to that effect, Johnson told MSNBC. The officer tried to open the door, but it bumped into Brown and closed again. Then the officer reached out and grabbed the teen by his neck, choking him, Johnson said.

“I could see the muscles in his forearm,” Johnson told MSNBC. “Mike was trying to get away from being choked.”

The struggle continued, with the officer now grabbing the young man’s shirt and a “tug of war” ensuing, with the officer trying to pull Brown in and Brown trying to get away.

Then the officer voiced a threat that turned into tragic action, Johnson told MSNBC.

“I’ll shoot,” Johnson said the officer said.

“I seen the barrel of the gun pointed at my friend,” he said. “He had it pointed at him and said ‘I’ll shoot,’ one more time.”

Then he started firing, Johnson told the cable news station, with the first shot leaving blood seeping through Brown’s shirt.

Both young men started running. Johnson managed to duck behind a car, but Brown kept on running, advising his friend Johnson to “keep running.”

A second shot was fired.

Brown put his hands up in the air, begging the officer to stop shooting, and shouting that he did not have a gun, Johnson told MSNBC.

It didn’t matter.

The officer was face-to-face with Brown, according to Johnson, and he still kept on shooting.

“After seeing my friend get gunned down, my body just ran,” he said.

He ran back to his apartment and vomited. At that point, when he returned to the scene, he saw his friend, lying lifeless in the street.

The exclusive interview comes a day after it was revealed that the FBI is planning to conduct an investigation into the shooting of the unarmed Ferguson teen.

According to the {Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html#page=1>, the investigation will be parallel to that of local authorities.

Protesters have continued to congregate in the suburb of St. Louis, demanding that the officer who killed the unarmed teen be named, fired and charged in the slaying, the Los Angeles Times notes.

The crowd, which was gathered outside of the police department Monday, chanted, “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.""

According to the Los Angeles Times, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar was open to the parallel investigation, calling the outbreak of violence amid the protests a “tragedy.”

“We want to heal. We want to build trust with the community,” Belmar said.

Two officers were reportedly injured Sunday night after violence erupted during a protest and looting began. More than 30 people were arrested, suspected of theft, assault or burglary. Several businesses were vandalized and looted in the process.

“The death of yet another African American at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve the community where he lived is heartbreaking,” NAACP President Cornell Williams Brooks said in a statement, demanding answers about the tragedy. “Michael Brown was preparing to begin college, and now his family is preparing to bury their child—his life cut short in a tragic encounter with the police.”

However, the statement also cautioned protesters to act “calmly.”

“Even as we call for accountability by those charged with protecting the community, we call on the community to act collectively and calmly until we secure justice for the family of Michael Brown,"" Brooks added in the statement, according to {the Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html#page=1>.",NA,2800,NA,NA

According to {the Associated Press}<hyperlink=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/family-missouri-shooting-victim-had-eerie-dream>, the unarmed teen’s uncle, Charles Ewing, said that Brown had declared Jesus as his savior weeks before the incident. Brown later had a dream, telling relatives that he saw a body covered by a sheet and he thought the world would one day know his name.

Indeed, his name is now a rallying cry for justice in the suburb where protests continue in the wake of the inexplicable shooting.

{AP notes}<hyperlink=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/racial-tensions-are-not-new-st-louis-suburb> that racial tensions in the community, which is about 70 percent black, have been high. The police force is 90 percent white, a fact that feeds into the distrust of law enforcement.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that he has tried to recruit more black officers and has made it a priority from the time he took over about four years ago. ""I'm constantly trying to recruit African Americans and other minorities,"" he told AP. ""But it's an uphill battle. The minority makeup of this police department is not where I want it to be."" 

Young black residents told AP that this kind of tension is almost normal. Law enforcement, they think, targets them.

""The cop told me I looked like a guy who robbed a bank nearby,"" said 29-year-old Stephen Bussey, who claimed he was recently stopped by an officer while going to a convenience store early in the morning before his work shift. ""I didn't make a big deal about it. But since when is walking a crime?""

""You get harassed,"" Jarrett Snider, 19, added. ""It's too much ... Mike's situation is not the first time.""

One of the main points of contention for the community is the refusal of the police department to release the name of the officer who killed the teen. The authorities have said they have withheld the officer's name because of death threats. 

The Rev. Al Sharpton has gotten involved, adding his voice to those demanding to have the officer's identity made public. ""The local authorities have put themselves in a position—hiding names and not being transparent—where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,"" Sharpton said at a news conference in St. Louis, {according to AP}<hyperlink=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/police-protesters-again-clash-outside-st-louis>.

Mitchell said that she saw Brown break free and start running and that ""the kid's body jerked as if he was hit from behind and he turned around and he puts his hands up like this, and the cop continued to fire, until he just dropped down to the ground and his face smacked the concrete.""

She told Lemon that she heard at least five or six shots.

Brown’s death has sparked rallies throughout the country as well as international support. Protesters and members of the press have been teargassed, shot with wooden bullets and arrested for exercising their right to peaceful assembly.

But there are some detractors who believe that Brown is not the real victim of the shooting on Aug. 9. The real victim is Darren Wilson, the officer responsible for killing Michael Brown. Supporters say that his character is being assassinated by the media, reports {The Guardian}<hyperlink=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-supporters-police-killed-teenager-protest?CMP=twt_gu>.

Roughly 150 supporters of Wilson protested in front of the offices of KSDK, the station that aired footage of Wilson’s home.

“He was doing his job, and now, because of public uproar in Ferguson, he is being victimized. He is being victimized by the whole city, the state and the federal government,” said protest attendee Kaycee Reinisch.

The rally for Darren Wilson was organized through the {Support Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1465796257016669&id=1464514543811507> Facebook page, reports {ThinkProgress}<hyperlink=http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/17/3472284/supporters-of-police-officer-who-shot-unarmed-teen-dead-stage-rally-raise-thousands/>.

One online donator said, “{As a retired officer I have run into thugs like Mike Brown also.}<hyperlink=http://www.gofundme.com/d5905w> Why do we let the media make a hero out of a thug and a criminal out of a good officer.”",NA,687,NA,NA

Look at that—talking about who doesn’t need to reproduce and calling people animals. Way to go, post-racial America.

Forty-nine years ago this week, Los Angeles’ Watts neighborhood erupted into a weeklong urban rebellion in the aftermath of a confrontation between police and local black residents.

Watts sparked national soul-searching and political backlash during the civil rights era. Coming just five days after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, racial violence in Los Angeles moved Martin Luther King Jr. to embrace more radical measures for economic justice, confounded President Lyndon Johnson’s efforts to build a Great Society and helped fuel a conservative backlash led by two future presidents: Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.

Michael Brown—like Trayvon Martin, Sean Bell and so many others—is a son of the Watts rebellion.

During the Jim Crow era, African Americans experienced racial profiling every day, both in and out of black neighborhoods. The hundreds of civil disturbances—which some called race riots and others called political rebellions—that caused parts of the nation to burn during the 1960s were incited, in part, by police brutality and violence.

Almost 50 years later, we have a black president, but the political terror wielded against black communities by law enforcement in the United States goes on unabated—a ritualized expression of fear and loathing that finds black women and men, even our young girls and boys, perpetually brutalized by authorities.

At least the civil rights era gave us the {Kerner Commission}<hyperlink=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerner_Commission>, the presidential “riot” inquiry that issued a scathing report, tracing urban violence back to institutional racism, poverty, police brutality and federal neglect. Of course, President Johnson subsequently refused to meet with the Kerner Commission, announcing a pattern of political denial on race matters that mainstream American politicians continue to mimic until this day.

The outpouring of anger and grief over Brown’s killing {is a good thing}<hyperlink=http://www.laprogressive.com/michael-brown-shooting/>. We’re often rendered numb by racism’s sheer inhumanity. This leads to counterintuitive responses: laughter that masks tears, stoicism that replaces rage, and depression in lieu of hysteria.

It’s important, then, to honor Brown’s life after his unnecessary death. He was just 18 years of age, college-bound and full of promise. His life matters, even in—especially in—a society that is hell-bent on insisting that it doesn’t.

Watts delivered an existential punch in the gut to America. It revealed the limited impact that legal and political legislation had on democracy’s underbelly, where black girls and boys played in trash-strewn neighborhoods, police indiscriminately harassed citizens of color and poverty remained an open secret from coast to coast.

America has collectively forgotten the hard lessons taught by Watts and its sequel, the Los Angeles rebellion of 1992, in the aftermath of the Rodney King verdict. The violence, death and physical destruction that took place were symptoms of a larger, national disease that King diagnosed America as suffering from in the 1960s.

King viewed racism as an all-encompassing illness that infected all facets of American life and distorted democracy and the very meaning of social justice. In truth, he spent the last two years and five months of his life after Watts delivering a powerful indictment against a society that spent more money on war in Vietnam than helping its own citizens at home.

On this score, Brown is simply the latest son of Watts—collateral damage in a war against the black, brown and disenfranchised faces that populate America, increasingly at their own peril.

Absorbing the ongoing news of the investigation Monday morning, I listened to eyewitness interviews and looked on as the media flashed pictures of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old gunned down by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer over the weekend.

The repeated refrain in so many of the accounts is, ""Brown was supposed to start college on Monday."" In the photos accompanying stories from outlets more sympathetic to his plight, he's often pictured in a high school graduation cap and gown. Social media posts use his planned next steps to underscore the tragedy of his life cut short. His educational status even makes its way into headlines, sometimes to the exclusion of his age, his name or the word ""unarmed"":

{""[P]olice Kill College-Bound Kid ... ""}<hyperlink=http://wtvr.com/2014/08/10/michael-brown-police-shooting/>

{""Unarmed Teen Shot By Police Days Before He Was Scheduled to Leave for College""}<hyperlink=http://madamenoire.com/456754/michael-brown/>

OK? And what if Monday was to have been his first day of standing on the corner not doing a damn thing? Would his death be less of a loss?

Let me be clear: Unarmed college hopefuls don't deserve to be shot. Unarmed kids heading to work or trade school don't deserve to be shot. Unarmed kids floundering aimlessly through life don't deserve to be shot. Unarmed kids who have been in trouble—even those who have been nothing but trouble—don't deserve to be shot.

The act of pinning the tragedy of a dead black teen to his potential future success, to his respectability, to his ""good""-ness, is done with all the best intentions. But if you read between the lines, aren't we really saying that had he not been on his way to college, there'd be less to mourn?

That's dead wrong.

After reading the headlines, I logged on to social media and discovered a hashtag following this tragedy. {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=http://www.theroot.com/blogs/the_grapevine/2014/08/_iftheygunnedmedown_shows_how_black_people_are_portrayed_in_mainstream_media.html?wpisrc=mostpopular> had taken on a life of its own. Users frustrated by media portrayals of African-American victims that seem to intentionally make them appear unsavory to white audiences shared split-screen images of themselves in order to make a point: Here's how I really am: Clean, professional, nonthreatening. Here's the photo the media would dig up to make me look like a ""thug."" Isn't that terrible?

I'm sympathetic to that frustration. But I also think we've passed the time where we put any stock in our news media being unbiased and fair, especially in reporting the unjustified deaths of black and brown people. The more horrific part, in my opinion, is that we—people of color—have been exposed to this ""thugs deserve to die"" narrative so frequently that some of us seem to have embraced it ourselves. Instead of arguing that nobody deserves to be shot, we tie ourselves up in knots making the case that the latest victim of a law-enforcement officer's bullet was a good kid, or that the photo the news media selected wasn't the most flattering depiction of him.

Mothers of black and brown children sob to the reporters, ""He was an honor roll student! He wanted to go to college."" Even Brown's grieving mom bought into this: ""Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate?

Brown was unarmed on Aug. 9 when he was fatally shot by a police officer in his hometown of Ferguson, Mo.

Martin noted that when he heard about the events after his son's death, he was left to wonder who, in fact, was being prosecuted. ""At the end of the day, you ask yourself as a parent, in my case, in our case, I sat back and said, 'Is my son on trial or is his killer on trial?' "" Martin told Witt.

""Don't let anyone assassinate your son's character,"" Martin offered to the parents of Brown. ""They have to stand up for their son ... we're with them 110 percent. Protests are going, protests are needed, but peaceful protests.""

Martin also noted that the opportunity in this tragedy is a chance to have an open and honest discussion about race and the value of black lives. ""First, you have to understand that we as an African-American community—we have to break the stigma,"" Martin told Witt. ""We have to come together as human beings and say that African-American lives matter just as much as any other ethnicity [group's] life matters.

TheRoot,root51,http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/where_are_the_good_cops.html,"There are good cops out there, prove it ",Albert L. Butler,08/12/2014,02/17/2016,"There are no good cops.

Yes, you read that right. From where I sit, right now, in this moment in time, in the wake of tragic incidents that have transpired over the last few weeks, there are no good cops in this country. Not when another innocent black man—this time, 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.—is gunned down while minding his damn business and yet another unarmed black teen “suspect” lies dead on a city street.

I didn’t always feel this way. As I started my radio broadcast career, whenever an incident of police misconduct would cross my radar, I would say things on air like, “This isn’t a reflection on all the decent police out there every day serving the public good ... ” or “Let’s not let one bad apple ... ”

But no more.

There are a lot of bad apples out there spoiling bunches of departments, and every incident of police brutality or an unarmed teenager’s death reflects on every police officer in his or her respective ranks. We’ve seen too many incidents, after the fact, of police attacking the reputations of their victims, fabricating reports and planting evidence, all in the name of covering up the truth. And my question is, who’s policing them?

I don’t know exactly when I changed my view. Maybe it was after 92-year-old {Kathryn Johnston}<hyperlink=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/02/24/atlanta.police/> was killed in her home after a drug raid on the wrong house; or maybe when {Sean Bell}<hyperlink=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/nyregion/in-sean-bell-killing-4-officers-to-be-forced-out.html> was shot down the night before his wedding; or maybe it was when a Philly news helicopter taped more than a dozen cops {beating}<hyperlink=http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/Cops-Involved-in-Caught-on-Tape-Beating-Reinstated-87542797.html> three “suspects” after a brief car chase. I’m not sure when it was, but one day I realized I was tired of the silence. And one thing all these incidents and the countless others around the country—reported and unreported—have in common is silence. We don’t hear from the “good cops.”

No press conferences denouncing the actions of a few bad apples. No open letters putting the bad guys on notice that abusing the color of authority will not be tolerated. No public petitions demanding action from higher-ups and local government—and absolutely no change in police-union leadership. Sure, there are the requisite pressers after an incident by a police chief and possibly the mayor, but nothing from the rank and file, nothing from police groups and associations.

The Blue Wall of Silence is deafening.

What we do hear are plenty of excuses—police brass and city officials all but tripping over themselves to get to a microphone to announce, “We thought he had a gun,” “She refused to comply” or “The suspect had priors.”

And before you know it, the police officer in question is the victim and the whole incident becomes the community’s fault or the parents’ fault, until finally it falls on the person in the hospital or the morgue, and now this person is responsible for his or her own condition. And then there’s the catchall phrase you hear from police commissioners everywhere:

“Being a police officer is stressful.”

Maybe. But being an innocent civilian confronted by police is pretty damn stressful, also—especially if you are black or brown. And if it seems as if there’s an uptick in incidents lately, it’s probably because of the sheer number of cameras around and more officers getting caught in the act, but the feeling isn’t purely anecdotal, and police violence isn’t something new.

In 2007, USA Today {reported}<hyperlink=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-12-17-Copmisconduct_N.htm> Justice Department statistics that showed a surge in cases of police brutality since 9/11. In addition, the Cato Institute’s 2010 National Police Misconduct Statistics and Reporting Project {found}<hyperlink=http://www.policemisconduct.net/statistics/2010-annual-report/#_Police_Misconduct_Trending> that “the overall U.S. average police misconduct rate appears to be climbing in comparison to both last year’s rate and the previously reported rate 3 months ago ... ” and “the number of officers involved in excessive force reports appear to be demonstrating an overall trend increase since the beginning of 2010.”

So where is the change? Right now there’s really none, and there will be none as long as so-called good cops stay quiet.

From my own experience taking numerous calls from Philadelphia police over the years, I know there are officers who want to speak out and take action to change the culture. But they’re afraid, afraid of reprisals from higher-ups, afraid of retaliation from their peers. Some were even afraid that cops wouldn’t back them up on the street.

The “bad police” culture is so broad and so deep that even the department designated to go after them is called the “rat squad.” Think about that.

Meanwhile, as we march for justice, police departments demand that we, the citizens, help them solve crimes.

So I’m challenging you, good cops—if you’re out there—show yourselves. You can’t solve crimes without us, and we can’t solve the problem of police brutality without you. We need you.

According to the {New York Daily News}<hyperlink=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/hundreds-protest-lapd-shooting-unarmed-black-man-article-1.1907132>, witnesses claim that Ford was surrendering and was already on the ground when police shot him on Aug. 11, just two days after Brown's shooting death. Ford was rushed to the hospital but died from his injuries.

The Daily News notes that Ford suffered from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. According to relatives, he was seeing a doctor and taking medication for his mental-health issues.

""I'm sick and tired of the police killing our people off,"" one protester, Nicole Tinson, told the {Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hundreds-rally-downtown-20140817-story.html>.

Eyewitnesses told the Los Angeles Times that they saw no struggle between Ford and the officers before he was shot.

""I want to know what probable cause did those gang officers have when they stopped Ford,"" Cheryl Dorsey, 56, a retired LAPD sergeant, told the Los Angeles Times. ""There's been no explanation other than a violent altercation ensued. What does that mean?""

Some marchers who were already out protesting Michael Brown's death joined the Ford demonstrators.

It showed a black woman holding a sign that read, “I cannot believe I still have to protest this s--t,” as she attended a rally being held at Malcolm X Park in Washington, D.C.

That photo was retweeted over 3,000 times and left people wondering, “Who is she?”

{According to Alternet, France Francois}<hyperlink=http://www.alternet.org/woman-behind-powerful-mike-brown-protest-photo-defies-respectability-politics> is the woman behind the iconic photo. The 28-year-old told Alternet that she didn’t realize her photo would resonate with so many people.

“I’m glad it sparked some conversation because I think, throughout the nation, we’re all asking ourselves this question,” she said. “‘How did we come here again? How did we find ourselves in this very same space?’”

Francois’ activism started way before Mike Brown. As a student at Florida State University, Francois protested the brutal killing of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson at the hands of “professionals” at a boot camp he was attending.

Francois told Alternet that she wasn’t even sure if she wanted to take her sign to the #NMOS14 event because she thought it would derail the purpose of the rally and that it would be perceived as rage because of the use of the curse word.

“For me, it goes back to the idea that we’re not allowed to feel these sentiments,” she said. “We always have to be stoic. We always have to make certain people comfortable and I really didn’t want to make anyone comfortable at that time. I felt angry. I felt fearful for my young brother and my younger cousin.”

Francois’ own time line on Twitter reinforces her voice of activism, not only in the United States, but as well as in Haiti.

I made sure to tell my son to call me once he got to his layover, which would have him sitting in an airport by himself for three hours. As this was his second time flying solo, I was still in mother-hen mode:

Turn your phone off on the flight so the battery won’t die.

Turn your phone on, immediately after you get off the plane, so I can call you.

Get your lunch and find an outlet to charge your phone while you wait for your flight.

Don’t talk to anyone.

If something happens, find a cop.

Those were his directions that I gave him. But when I mentioned the “find a cop” if anything happens, it brought me back to a conversation I had with him when he was 9 years old.

“Mommy, how can you tell the difference between a good cop and bad cop?” was what he asked.

As I was reading the news about Brown’s killing, I patiently waited for my son to reach his layover.  I checked the time, and waited 10 minutes after his flight was scheduled to land.

I called his phone. It went straight to voice mail.

I waited another 20 minutes. I called his phone again. Again, I got voice mail.

I’m calling and scrolling through my time line on Twitter and reading the reactions and news about Brown’s death. And then I came across this hashtag: {#thingsitellmyblackson.}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thingsitellmyblackson&src=tyah>

When my son was 9, I had to tell him about police brutality. But he wanted to know if all cops were bad. He wanted to know how to tell the difference. When he asked the question, I wondered if a white mother had had her child ask that question and how she answered it.

Eventually, after 40 minutes, my son’s phone finally started ringing. He picked up, and it took every ounce of energy not to yell and ask what took him so long. He knew from the sound of my voice I was worried, and he asked why. I reminded him of the rules I had given him and that he hadn’t followed them. I also told him about Brown’s death and that I panicked because I thought something happened.

And this is what black men and women have to deal with, every damn day.

Holmes,08/15/2014,02/17/2016,"This is what I do whenever I see flashing lights in my rearview mirror: I put on my hazard lights and pull over as soon as safely possible. Then I put the car in park, roll down both front windows fully, turn off the engine, take the keys out of the ignition and dangle them high in the air out the driver’s side window before placing them on the roof of the car.

Next, I cross my arms at the wrist, spread my fingers and display my empty hands out of the window and wait for the officer to come to the door to give me instructions. When the officer asks for my license and registration, I explain that they are in my pocket and my glove compartment, and I ask if it’s all right to move my hands in order to retrieve them. I don’t make any movement without first getting the officer’s blessing to do so.

The {last time}<hyperlink=http://www.msnbc.com/the-ed-show/television-host-pulled-over-driving> I was pulled over, in the summer of 2012, the officer told me it was to make sure I “had insurance.” I was sure that wasn’t a legitimate reason for stopping me. I was furious. I wanted to curse. I wanted to get belligerent. I wanted to hurl accusations at the officer about his motivation for stopping me. I had done absolutely nothing wrong, and I knew it.

But during that stop, the officer had no idea about the fury inside me. I behaved as a model citizen.  I was cooperative and answered him with only “Yes, sir,” and “No, sir,” followed his every instruction and extended him every courtesy.

I wonder what would have happened had I acted on my emotions. If I had gotten loud or animated. How much could that scene have escalated? How far could it have gone? How would that officer have reacted?

Immediately after the stop, I reached out to friends, including a couple of attorneys, one of them a black attorney from Birmingham, Ala. I was still fuming when I called him and detailed what had just happened. Instead of being sympathetic, he calmly {responded}<hyperlink=http://www.tjholmes.net/flashing-lights/>, “Be glad you made it home.” He was almost dismissive of my experience and my frustration. He was sincere in telling me that I should be grateful for the ultimate outcome of my police interaction: I wasn’t dead.

A subsequent {investigation}<hyperlink=http://www.tjholmes.net/no-reason-to-stop-me/> by the officer’s department determined that the officer had no right to stop me. The department retrained him and other officers on traffic stops. So I won, right?

I am now pleading with young brothers to abandon the idea of winning, fairness, vindication or satisfaction. It won’t come. The No. 1 goal has to be survival. Survive the situation. Just live.  

The reason I go through such painstaking efforts when I deal with police is because I learned from my parents and through experience that you want that officer to feel as calm, comfortable and safe as possible. You don’t want him on edge, nervous or agitated. Stay calm. Breathe. Don’t get animated. Don’t get loud. Don’t be a smart-ass. Don’t even move. Don’t do anything.

It doesn’t matter if you’re 100 percent innocent. You have to try to disarm an armed officer by giving him no excuse to act on what he might already preconceive as a threat: a black man. At that moment, your pride or even your rights cannot be the priority. Your life is. We will send the Rev. Al Sharpton later to fight on your behalf. But if you are up against a police officer who has the law on his side and a gun on his hip, you are going to lose. It’s just not worth it.  

We don’t know all the circumstances surrounding Michael Brown’s interaction with police that ended in his death. I’m not suggesting that he did anything wrong, and he certainly didn’t do anything that warranted being gunned down in the street. The case does, however, painfully illustrate the fragility of the black community’s relationship with police, and apparently, {raising your hands}<hyperlink=http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html> to surrender isn’t even a guarantee of survival.

Not every cop out there is the enemy. But how are we supposed to convince the community of that when we keep compiling stories of young, unarmed black men being gunned down by police? We are at a point where black men understandably feel that their lives are on the line with each police interaction. I can’t argue otherwise. And while we rightly teach our kids to respect authority, in the case of police, do we have to teach them to fear it as well?

To my young brothers, I know what I’m saying is not what you want to hear right now. You’re outraged. You should be. And despite what it may seem at times, I assure you that there actually are people out there who give a damn about whether you live or die. So please, just survive the moment.
