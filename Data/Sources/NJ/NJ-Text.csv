Press conferences, protests, looting and peaceful rallies have followed the death of Michael Brown, but the response from law enforcement on Wednesday night drew attention from the entire nation — including President Obama, who {spoke on the issue Thursday}<hyperlink=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/14/us-usa-missouri-shooting-idUSKBN0GA0Q420140814"">.""There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" the president said.

Tear gas, rubber pellets and stun grenades have since been used on demonstrators by law enforcement — who have been deployed with SWAT vehicles and wearing body armor, gas masks along with other tactical gear.

Missouri State Highway Patrol will be supervising security, per Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday.

The People's Organization For Progress is organizing the march to call for greater accountability in police departments around the country.

""With regard to the killing of Michael Brown, we demand a federal takeover of the Ferguson, Mo. police department,"" said chairman Lawrence Hamm said in a statement.

The march will begin at 5 p.m. near the Essex County Courthouse at the intersection of Springfield Avenue and West Market Street. Protesters plan to walk between the courthouse and the intersection of Market and Broad Streets, the statement said.

The Aug. 9 shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown has sparked nearly a week of volatile protests in the St. Louis suburb.

The situation escalated again Friday night, after Ferguson police released the name of the officer who shot Brown along with video they said showed the teen robbing a store shortly before he was killed. The officer was identified as 28-year-old Darren Wilson.
