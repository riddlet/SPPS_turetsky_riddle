Last week, the actress took to social media to {express outrage}<hyperlink=""http://madamenoire.com/457433/keke-palmers-reaction-mike-browns-death-attracts-mixed-feelings-stop-separating-race/""> over the shooting death of Mike Brown. Though she was criticized by some for her words, Keke doesn’t appear to have allowed her critics to slow her down one bit. Over the weekend, the “Masters of Sex” star and her mother flew out to Ferguson to join those who were protesting to have Mike Brown’s killer, Officer Darren Wilson, arrested and charged in his murder.  She later took to social media to discuss her troubling experience.

In one {Instagram}<hyperlink=""https://www.instagram.com/p/ryo7EtErkI/?modal=true""> post, she shared the story of a woman who said that she was assaulted by officers. In this same post, Keke also revealed that police officers fired “real guns” at them (her and the protesters) and that her mother was even hit with pellets. Her post reads:

“God bless this woman right here! I met her out here in Ferguson tonight, & she was telling me about her violent run in with the police not too long ago. She was in an accident & called the police, & allegedly THIS is what SHE was put through.

She was out here PEACEFULLY protesting, and after they threw tear gas at us, my mom was shot in the neck with pellets, they shot at us with REAL guns(a young man actually got hit), she came back & picked my mom, my friend & I up & took us home. God bless you sister & thank you! When you’re peaceful you play as a mirror to people’s wrong actions, instead of a distraction.”

The “Just Keke” host also shared footage from one of the protests.",50,NA,NA,NA

There have also been people who have criticized President Obama for his response to the riots and unrest in Ferguson, Missouri (and tried to question him for speaking on the death of Robin Williams first), and claimed that his speech last week ({he spoke again yesterday}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-ferguson-20140819-story.html#page=1""> on the situation there) wasn’t “enough.” Someone well-known who is expressing a similar sentiment is Diddy. In a crass manner, he tried to address the President of the United States through Instagram. The mogul posted, “WATCH DIS! DEAR PRESIDENT OBAMA!!!!!! IF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY SEND A VIDEO MESSAGE TO THE PRESIDENT #DEAROBAMA” {before posting the following video:}<hyperlink=""http://instagram.com/p/r3bRFxJly6/?modal=true"">

“Watch Dis”? Really?
As someone making these statements from the comfort of what seemed to be his studio and not in Ferguson, I think it’s clear that Diddy went about expressing his concerns wrong. The mogul’s followers weren’t impressed:

“Everybody expecting for Obama to handle everything that man got so much on his plate right now sometimes it takes the hood to help the hood diddy I challenge you to go out there”

“Why are you watching? You should be there too!!! Those are YOUR people as well.”

“Ughh shut up, you went to Howard..I would expect you to know about the branches of govt & how things operate..why don’t you hop on a plane & go down there”

{This isn’t the first time}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/31/diddy-on-obama-calls-out-president-asks-to-do-better-for-black-people_n_816473.html""> Diddy has criticized President Obama and claimed that he isn’t doing enough for the black community:

“I love the president like most of us. I just want the president to do better. There’s a difference between us voting for somebody and us believing in somebody. He’s the person that we believed in so I pray night and day that he understands how God ordained his presidency. I feel there was a promise made to God to look after people that was less fortunate, and [many] of those people are African-American…”

MadameNoire,mnoire3,http://madamenoire.com/459291/nelly-and-other-celebrities-react-to-mike-brown-shooting/,Nelly and Other Celebs Speak Out On Ferguson and Mike Brown Tragedy,Toya Sharee,08/17/14,02/10/17,"Among the mixed opinions and speculation, celebrities such as David Banner, Common and Keke Palmer have all taken to their social media to state their feelings on the shooting of Mike Brown and the aftermath occurring in Ferguson. T.I. and Nelly are the latest in the line of celebs to make some comments.

Some criticized Nelly’s delayed response to the tragedy in his hometown, but he recently took to Instagram to express his feelings and also sat down with {VIBE}<hyperlink=""http://www.vibe.com/article/nelly-michael-browns-death-ferguson-interview""> for an interview.

In reference to his untimely response, Nelly says:

“When [the shooting] initially happened, I was in Finland. I don’t have enough information. I don’t know what to say so I said, ‘At this time, my blessings and my strength go out to the Brown family’ because at the end of the day, it’s not an injustice, it’s murder. It’s an injustice if [the officer] does not pay for it.”

He also expresses that he doesn’t agree with some of the reactions that have taken place:

“What we need to do is support the Brown family because we don’t know. We [can’t] plan against [the police] that plan and strategize for a living. That’s their job. We got barbers out here. We got fathers. We out here on emotion because these are our babies so you can’t attack from that aspect ’cause you can’t win.”

Nelly says that it isn’t wise to act on our initial feelings:

“We cannot use our last resort first. Now they’re prepared. There is no element of surprise. We the smallest in their world. Black people make up 13 percent of St. Louis. We not making sure we do the right things because we’re so stuck thinking about this shit. We gotta plan ahead. We can’t blame the ones that don’t know better.

There’s three of us in this situation: The ones that don’t know better—can’t blame them ’cause they ain’t seen better—the ones that know better but act like they don’t, and the ones that know better that’s trying to say something but we killing them and they got the best plan.”

Even with all the violence occurring in his hometown, Nelly is trying to stay positive and encouraging everyone else to do the same:

“Keep the peace, keep the focus in mind.”

“The focus is this young man lost his life and he wanted a future, he had a future, so let’s make sure we take the positive out of that, embellish and make sure that young brothers and sisters that came out of this same situation are able to go on and live in his name.”

Rapper T.I. echoed Nelly’s sentiments stating:

“We needed to play chess instead of checkers. We should have waited to see if justice was going to be served first … We shouldn’t have played our strongest hand first.”

I must say the men make a lot of sense. I was very troubled to see people justifying violence and looting because they were angry. Choosing to reflect on the situation and work through your feelings before taking action doesn’t mean you’re defending the police or those who have done wrong in this situation. It simply means that if we hope to make any real change, we can’t keep acting on our feelings destroying our homes, neighborhoods and our culture from the inside out hoping that will make others take notice and change their behavior. I feel like the life of Michael Brown is getting lost in people’s fight for proper media coverage and personal political agendas.

J. Cole and Elle Varner chose not to make any “official” statements, but express their feelings through their art. Check out their singles below:

MadameNoire,mnoire4,http://madamenoire.com/457064/mlk-murder-of-michael-brown/,"What Would Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Say About The Ferguson Riots In Response To Police Killing Michael Brown?",Charing Ball,08/12/14,02/10/17,"Historians and archivists call it Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Beyond Vietnam” speech, which was given in 1967 at the Riverside Church in New York. It is said to be the first time that Dr. King spoke publicly about his opposition to military intervention in Vietnam, as well as elsewhere in the world.

However, it is probably the most poignant thought ever given about how we should feel about violence at home, particularly in the ghettos of America. In particular (as transcribed by {Stanford University’s The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute}<hyperlink=""http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_beyond_vietnam/"">):

“My third reason moves to an even deeper level of awareness, for it grows out of my experience in the ghettos of the North over the last three years, especially the last three summers. As I have walked among the desperate, rejected, and angry young men, I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems. I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action. But they asked, and rightly so, “What about Vietnam?” They asked if our own nation wasn’t using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted. Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.”

You can read the speech in {its entirety here.}<hyperlink=""http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_beyond_vietnam/""> Or if you prefer audio, {YouTube has you covered too.}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qf6x9_MLD0""> And while you are reading the text or listening to his words, reflect on what have largely been haughty reactions in both the media and on social media to reports about rioting and other aggression in Ferguson, Missouri. Over the weekend, the local police took the life of 17-year-old Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, who at the time of his death (as told by witnesses at the scene), allegedly had his arms in the air as a sign of surrender. And on Sunday, riots broke out after the second night of protest proved fruitless in bringing charges against the officer responsible for Brown’s death.

Yet folks don’t get it. For whatever reason, folks just can’t understand why others would be so angry as to tear up things.

Very few people want violence. I know I don’t. As angry as I am that yet another young life has been snatched by the people paid to protect us, I’m not certain the answer to violence committed by the police is more violence. At the same time, I am tired of reading about or even watching video of another unarmed Black person being killed or maimed by the police. I am also tired of watching our government’s lax response to what are clear civil rights violations being committed in police departments nationwide while they talk about the atrocities of others elsewhere in the world. Take for example, the discussion about the Kurdish people {trapped in barren northern Iraqi mountain ranges by ISIS (Islamic State) militant forces.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/middleeast/obama-weighs-military-strikes-to-aid-trapped-iraqis-officials-say.html"">

The situation there is supposedly dire. Various news reports tell us that Yazidi women are being enslaved, men are being killed and children are being beheaded. And last week, in a speech given in the State Dining Room, President Obama explained why the U.S. government couldn’t afford to sit around and wait anymore and opted to intervene with humanitarian airdrops for the trapped citizens and airstrikes against Islamic extremist militants, who have allegedly threatened violence, intimidated and even killed people of minority religious and ethnic groups. In particular, President Obama tells the White House press corp:

“When we are faced with a situation like we do on that mountain, with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale, when we have a mandate to help – in this case a request from the Iraqi government – and when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre than I believe the United States of America can not turn a blind eye.”

And yet the federal government is perfectly okay with sitting on the sidelines as law enforcement representing local municipalities harass, and in some cases, kill citizens just because they happen to be the wrong skin color. And this is not conjecture. Racial profiling is alive and well. In 2012, police shootings rose steadily in New York City, {Boston}<hyperlink=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/01/05/crime-falls-shootings-police-rise/Z6X3lniPeNCLkVc7KaTWNK/story.html""> and {Philadelphia,}<hyperlink=""http://www.philly.com/philly/news/Police_involved_shootings_in_Philly_soar_as_violent_crime_falls.html""> even as crime as a whole declined. According to {a report by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement,}<hyperlink=""http://mxgm.org/operation-ghetto-storm-2012-annual-report-on-the-extrajudicial-killing-of-313-black-people/""> a Black man is killed by law enforcement (or a person acting in the capacity of law enforcement including vigilantes) every 28 hours here in America.

Besides the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Michael Brown, who was shot eight times by police as he walked unarmed in the middle of the road with his hands up, there is also the mind-boggling police execution of John Crawford III, a Dayton, Ohio man murdered by police inside of a Walmart for carrying a toy air pump rifle he was interested in purchasing at the store. And before that, there was the choking death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. And in between all of that, there were countless incidences (sometimes recorded for continuous replay on YouTube and Facebook) of mostly unarmed men, women and yes, even children, being harassed, abused and beaten by the police.

If this was Iraq, President Obama would probably be in the same State Dining Room giving some sort of flowery speech, condemning the perpetrator of this violence against ethnic minorities as enemies of justice, equality and democracy. And he would likely remind us of our role in helping the Iraqi people, considering our role in helping to create the country’s current conditions. But in communities of color, which often find themselves on the end of real abuses by authority figures, there will be no airstrikes and humanitarian drops. Instead, there will be talk of cooler heads prevailing, being a nation of laws and even considering our part in helping the police not shoot us. There will even be talk about being a good {Brother’s Keeper}<hyperlink=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/my-brothers-keeper""> by pulling up our pants, getting a good education and going to college, which is always ironic because that is just what Michael Brown, who was two weeks away from beginning his freshman year in college, was trying to do…

In 2011, {the US Department of Justice announced that it would be opening civil rights investigations}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/us/justice-department-examining-local-police-turns-focus-to-cleveland.html""> into 17 police departments nationwide, all of which had a long history of using excessive force and being accused of corruption. The results of that investigation have been consent decrees and years of court monitoring of several departments (most recently, one in Newark, New Jersey), who have vowed to reform rules, which govern the use of guns and other weaponry against citizens.

However, as {this statement from the ACLU notes,}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu-nj.org/news/2014/02/09/aclu-nj-welcomes-news-reports-federal""> court monitoring is only a first step. We also need citizen review boards that can monitor the police and their policies objectively and away from influences. We also need the prosecution of criminal law enforcement agents and agencies that will stick. We need those at the top in these habitually corrupt departments to be removed from their posts. We need a total eradication of policies which encourage profiling based upon the color of someone’s skin. We need consequences for funding dollars into those departments, which are habitually abusive to citizens, and we need the really bad departments either shut down or taken over completely by the Feds.

Until this happens, I will no longer entertain talk about Black-on-Black crime as a reason why police violence is justified. Or how Black people should dress up more or give their kids proper names to avoid being targets of racism and violence. I will also no longer talk about the proper way for Black folks to deal with the police. In the spirit of Dr. King, I have decided to no longer condemn my community for its collective response to the continued subjugation and aggression it faces – not until the country as a whole is prepared to deal with the violence and aggression that it fosters, creates and provides shelter for, both internationally and domestically.

I don’t know if this is what Dr. King would have said in direct response to the Ferguson riots, but if his previous words are any indication, I suspect that he would not have been surprised by such actions from a weary people.",11,NA,NA,NA

Here are a few updates regarding the Mike Brown case and the situation in Ferguson.

But before you get the details a Facebook video showing the aftermath of Michael’s murder, where officers allowed him to lie in the street uncovered for minutes, his mother and father screaming and asking why the ambulance hadn’t been called. It’s graphic and heartbreaking. Watch with caution.

This morning the Ferguson police department released still images from a surveillance video of Mike Brown in the Quik Trip. In the images we see a man, who Ferguson police claim is Brown, strong-arming the store owner. He allegedly stole a pack of cigarillos. Even if this was indeed the case, the penalty for stealing cigarillos that cost less than a dollar, and even putting their hands on a store clerk is less than being gunned down in the street. But later in the afternoon a video emerged which is far less violent that what the still images depict.

A copy of the police report has been released and obtained by citizens. People are questioning the authenticity of it, considering the report seems to have been filed at 11:51 am, before Brown was shot and killed by Wilson. Even if the store clerk called the police and they filed a report, they wouldn’t have known Brown’s name to include it in the report.

On Wednesday, night you may have seen the city of Ferguson resembling a war zone. There were military tanks, tear gas, rubber bullets and even a few arrests of journalists and even Alderman of the 21st Ward in St. Louis, Antonio French, who had been covering the protests on his Vine account. Surely, you’ve seen the footage, but you can watch some video of the protest on Wednesday night.

Things had gotten so bad in Ferguson, people in Palestine, were tweeting and speaking in solidarity for the people in Ferguson saying they know what it means to be profiled and targeted for their ethnicity. They even offered some tips. Check out a few of them below.

And in case you didn’t know, here are some numbers that accurately depict the racial tension between the Ferguson police and it’s community, which is 60 percent Black.

{According to The Missouri Attorney General, the US Census and other sources}<hyperlink=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/10-insane-numbers-ferguson-killing""> in Ferguson, remember, 60 percent Black, has a police chief and mayor are White. Only one city council member is Black and only one school board member is Black.

Of Ferguson’s 53 police officers, only 3 are Black.

After President Obama released a statement on the Mike Brown shooting, he tapped Attorney General Eric Holder to launch a federal investigation, separate from the one the St. Louis Department is currently pursuing.

This is a portion of the statement {Holder released via the Department of Justice}<hyperlink=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-854.html""> yesterday after meeting with President Obama.

“For one thing, while the vast majority of protests have been peaceful, acts of violence by members of the public cannot be condoned. Looting and willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers who are genuinely trying to protect the public do nothing to remember the young man who has died. Such conduct is unacceptable and must be unequivocally condemned.

“By the same token, the law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them. Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.

“At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message. At my direction, Department officials have conveyed these concerns to local authorities. Also at my direction, the Department is offering – through our COPS office and Office of Justice Programs – technical assistance to local authorities in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force. The local authorities in Missouri have accepted this offer of assistance as of this afternoon. 

“Department officials from the Community Relations Service are also on the ground in Missouri to help convene law enforcement officials and civic and faith leaders to plot out steps to reduce tensions in the community. The latest such meeting was convened in Ferguson as recently as this morning. Over time, these conversations should consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities.

 “All the while, the federal civil rights investigation into the shooting incident itself continues, in parallel with the local investigation into state law violations. Our investigators from the Civil Rights Division and U.S. attorney’s office in Missouri have already conducted interviews with eyewitnesses on the scene at the time of the shooting incident on Saturday. Our review will take time to conduct, but it will be thorough and fair.”

It would seem that it was the initiatives put forth by Holder that calmed the protest scene in Ferguson Thursday evening.

As we mentioned the Ferguson Police Department released surveillance video of Mike Brown in the Quik trip. Brown’s family was not at all happy about that, saying that it seemed like a ploy from the police department to criminalize their son without releasing any details about the man who actual shot and killed Brown, certainly the more egregious crime.

“Michael Brown’s family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piecemeal information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.

There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.

The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.

It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.

The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.”

Earlier this week, Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown during the convenient store altercation and even on the street when Wilson approached the two in the street, spoke to the media about what he saw when Brown was shot. Listen to this video of Johnson speaking about Brown’s last moments.

Today, at 3 pm, the Ferguson police chief hosted a press conference where he spoke to several media officials. During the conference, he said the police don’t have any more information, aside from what has already been released. But there were some key things he said during the conference that are leaving many feeling more angry than they did initially. Police chief Thomas Jackson said officer Wilson”was not aware that Brown was a suspect in a robbery” when he stopped him on the street that afternoon. He said Wilson approached Brown and Johnson because they were “blocking traffic.” Jackson reiterated that the robbery and the altercation were not related. Then when one person asked why the police department released the surveillance video because the media asked for it. But MSNBC correspondent, Trymaine Lee said that media never even knew that there was an alleged robbery so how would they know to ask for a video. You can watch highlights from Jackson’s press conference in the video above.

Rapper J Cole decided to release a song to commemorate Brown’s death. And when he released it, he said, “I’m tired of being desensitized to the nuder of black men. I don’t give a f*ck if it’s by police or peers. This sh*t is not normal.”

It’s called “Be Free.”

Six months before Brown was shot and killed in the street, Wilson received a commendation from the Ferguson police department. A photo of Wilson receiving the award was posted on his father’s now deactivated Facebook page. Yahoo was able to confirm the award from Ferguson City Council meeting minutes.

Along with the photo, Wilson’s father, John, wrote:

“Very proud of my son, Darren Wilson, on his receiving a Commendation from his Police Department. Congratulations Son.” 

In the image on the left, Wilson is shaking hands with a man most of us have seen in recent press conferences, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson.

No word on what Wilson, 28, did to deserve the award.

Last Tuesday, John Wilson reached out to his Facebook friends requesting support for his family, without mentioning the incident or his son’s name specifically.

“Dear FB friends, 

Our family is in need for preyers to be sent up for a family member. Circumstances do not allow for us to say anything further. Please pray with our family in mind. Put a covering of protection over our family member please.”

And then later, after the messages of good will started flooding in, “Please continue to do so as we deal with a family situation that is very challenging.” 

Yahoo reached out to John Wilson and his wife Tonya answered the phone and said, “we’re not talking to anybody–thank you” and then hung up the phone.

Last week, Police chief Jackson, told reporters that officer Wilson was taking the death of Brown pretty hard.

“He never intended for any of this to happen. It’s devastating, absolutely devastating.”

An autopsy, privately requested from Brown’s family, revealed that the teenager was shot at least six times by Wilson, twice in the head.",26,NA,NA,NA

Social media users, including celebrities, took to outlets such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to express their outrage and sorrow behind the loss of the 18-year-old, who was reportedly scheduled to begin college yesterday.

If you want to end racism, start by not generalizing/grouping people with the thought that they all believe the same things.

If you’re tired of the pain, relate to people on something we all have felt. Stop finding ways to separate yourselves. The answer is how we are different, the answer is how we are alike. It’s true that we all don’t understand each other’s plight, but it doesn’t have to end there! Compassion takes you places.

We are all brothers & sisters under his eyes. & even if we don’t always realize that or understand, we have our entire lifetime to wake up.”

Some, however, weren’t in agreement with KeKe’s stance.

“We can’t always ignore racism when it’s right in front of your face,” replied one follower.

“How about speaking on the cops targeting and killing unarmed Black people,” added another.

“Why does KeKe Palmer have a platform? She uses it to say the most illogical things.”

“Girl hush, you play a part in the oppression,” replied another follower.

And then of course, there were more indignant reactions, which we won’t be highlighting here.

You probably also heard that Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has finally identified the cop who shot Brown as Darren Wilson. In response to these recent developments, the grieving parents of the college-bound teen, Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden, have released a statement through their attorney, Benjamin Crump, who {tweeted}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/attorneycrump/status/500334365919170560""> it out. Their full {statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s44se5""> reads:

“Michael Brown’s family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piece mil information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.

There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.

The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.

It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.

The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.”

MadameNoire,mnoire9,http://madamenoire.com/459233/robin-williams-and-mike-brown/,Can Someone Please Explain To Me Why We Keep Comparing Robin Williams And Mike Brown?,Toya Sharee,08/16/14,02/10/17,"Like many people, I’ve found myself extremely disturbed by the tragedies that have taken place over the past week with the deaths of Mike Brown and Robin Williams. Social media has elicited some strong opinions and I’ve engaged in debates over both Twitter and Facebook with people whose logic and point of views I’ve failed to understand.

But what bothered me the most is the meme posted above. It reads:

“Innocent black boys are being murdered by police on the regular and yet Obama feels addressing Robin Williams suicide is more important.  When people show you their true colors…believe them.”

Before Obama publicly addressed the events of Ferguson, he expressed his condolences over the death of comedian and actor Robin Williams. Immediately, people took the action personally and Instagram bred a great deal of social media activists whose actions were limited to posting memes instead of protesting and tweeting rage instead of tolerance. But it makes a depressing statement on our self-expression as a society when we can confidently make statements like, “Robin Williams chose to kill himself. Mike Brown didn’t.”

Ok, so we should mourn Williams a little less because he suffered from depression and committed suicide? It’s easier to blame him than focus on who we really need to confront and come up with a long-term rational plan so that more lives aren’t lost to violence. What bothers me most about the black race at times is the absence of accountability and our failure to admit how we may contribute to the problem. We blame slavery, the government, President Obama, but not once do we take a moment to reassess our contributions. We continuously appear dependent on our historical roles as victims.

I’m not saying that something shouldn’t be said/done about the tragedy in #Ferguson, but what the hell does Robin Williams have to do with it? He didn’t shoot Mike Brown so why are people personally offended at the attention his death is receiving from the media? Both are equally horrific situations, but it seems as if overnight, people became perpetrating social media activists with irrational opinions based on zero logic. People got so caught up in their anger and rage, which is understandable, but at the end of the day no one is actively solving the problem by comparing the two situations.

Families lost loved ones. Can we take five minutes to allow them to grieve without making the death of two men some kind of competition for media coverage? Are you all that fixated on what the media deems important? That’s the problem.  It’s all good when VH1 was peddling Mimi bouncing on shower poles or when we were making catchy tunes featuring Sweet Brown and Antoine Dodson, but now it’s a problem when the media only wants to show us rioting and throwing Molotov cocktails. Wake up, folks. The media has been spreading negative images of us for years now, but no one had a problem with it when it was us that were entertained by it.

And let’s be real: Black people kill and rape each other in cold blood every day and you know what we do? We make memes for Instagram. We get shirts made that say “#Free Big T”. We don’t riot. We don’t protest. But somehow we expect other races to value our lives more than we do. Rapper David Banner recently tweeted:

“Our situation is more psychological than people will admit. Black kids kill black kids for the same reason cops do. They see no value.”

“We must start respecting and protecting our own.”

It’s true, America has some deep seeded issues that keep resulting in assault on our black men, but over time, so have we. And NOW we’re offended because Obama didn’t immediately speak on it and it’s the government that’s taking lives. Now you’re defending the fact that you didn’t rock the vote because he chose to make a statement about Patch Adams? I’m all for the protests, the peace marches, and the genuine desire to spread awareness and fight for change. My point is there are plenty of ways to support the arguments being made besides comparing the two lives.

I think what bothers me most are the countless people I am encountering on-line who have failed to mention anything they know about Mike Brown’s life or who he was as a person. It’s as if he’s merely a symbol for their pent up rage and frustration. But Mike Brown was someone’s son, someone’s best friend, someone’s crush even and more than a point to prove for people’s political agendas.  And it’s not just the media who didn’t give him a chance to be more than that. Everyone who thinks that a hashtag and meme proves their solidarity is to blame as well. It would be just like me talking about “RIP Robin Williams” and having no idea who Mrs. Doubtfire even was. Can people fall back for two seconds and let families grieve in peace without using peoples’ deaths to push their own political agendas? In the past few days people have lost a father, a husband, a son and a friend. I’m pretty sure they’re not checking for your American History lesson right now. Have some respect.",43,NA,NA,NA

In the petition, King also highlights the deaths of men of color who died from police brutality. The petition is directed to President Barack Obama, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Representative John Boehner of Ohio. It states:

We love good police officers. Like all civil servants they are underpaid and under-resourced for a difficult job. 

However, a long and completely avoidable history of violence by police officers has killed too many innocent civilians, caused a destructive level of mistrust in the community, and is causing a rising tide of anger, frustration, and despair among millions of good people. 

This petition is for Amadou Diallo – shot at 41 times. An innocent, hardworking man simply reaching for his wallet, Diallo should be alive today. 

This petition is for Sean Bell – shot at over 50 times and killed on his wedding day. 

This petition is for Oscar Grant – handcuffed with his hands behind his back for breaking a fight on the subway – Oscar was shot in the back and killed by a police officer while sitting down. 

This petition is for Chavis Carter – arrested for marijuana, searched, handcuffed with his hands behind his back, and put into the back of a police car. Chavis is then said to have somehow killed himself with a gun. 

This petition is for Wendell Allen – just 20 years old – police busted into a house and shot him in the heart – killing him. He wasn’t who they were looking for. 

This petition is for Eric Garner – choked to death on YouTube for the entire world to see. While the coroner has deemed his death a homicide, we must change the laws to prevent this from ever happening again. 

This petition is for Mike Brown – unarmed and shot to death in Ferguson, Missouri, we are still waiting for even the basic answers here. 

The other purpose for this petition is to channel the anger caused from these illicit deaths into effective policy solutions for citizens. King also claims the enactment of these federal laws will help restore confidence in law enforcement. What do you think?

On Monday, the LAPD shot and killed Ezell Ford.

Ford, 25, was unarmed and described by his family as having mental complications. He was stopped by police, just blocks from his home, during what they referred to as an investigative stop at around 8:20 p.m.

{According to a press release from the LAPD,}<hyperlink=""http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/56791""> a struggle ensued. The police said an officer-involved shooting occurred and “The suspect was transported to a local hospital and after lifesaving efforts he succumbed to his injuries.” 

Not sure why Ford was labelled as a suspect when he wasn’t the one who did the shooting and was just walking in his own neighborhood.

His family tells a different story.

{His mother, Tritobia Ford told KTLA}<hyperlink=""http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/""> her son was lying down on the ground, on his stomach, complying with officers when he was shot three times in the back.

Another man, a cousin of Ford’s supported her story.

“They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing, mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division, knows that–that this child has mental problems. The excessive force…there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in the back while he’s laying down? No. Then when the mom comes, they don’t try to console her…they pull the billy clubs out.”

No officers were injured during the altercation and the Force’s Investigation Division is set to look into the matter.

Honestly, I tried to avoid writing about this story for as long as I could because yet another heinous killing of an unarmed Black man in this country is taking a severe toll on my spirit. But then again, you all need to know what’s going on in this country of ours.",23,NA,NA,NA

But today the White House Press Secretary released a statement from the president. It read as follows:

“The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time. As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed. I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community deserve.”

MadameNoire,mnoire13,http://madamenoire.com/456874/mike-brown-wasnt-killed-because-black-people-dont-value-themselves/,"Sorry David Banner, Mike Brown Wasn’t Killed Because Black People Don’t Value Themselves",Veronica Wells,08/11/14,02/10/17,"I learned about {the murder of 18-year-old, unarmed and college-bound Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://madamenoire.com/456754/michael-brown/""> a bit late. After an event filled weekend, on Sunday I was scrolling through my Instagram timeline. I’m not from St. Louis but I went to school in Missouri so a lot of people I know from college are from, and many, still live in the city. The first inclination that anything had happened came from one such person who wrote “Last day in #StLouis. I love you but you made me feel sad…”  I thought that’s a weird caption but I kept scrolling. Then I started seeing pictures of riots, a busted window at a Quick Trip, buildings consumed by fire, a line of police officers standing with guns and shields. By this time I learned this was all in reaction to the unjust killing of Mike Brown. It looked like a war zone. In many ways, it is a war zone.

Then I saw another person one of my Instagram followers posted a tweet from David Banner.

Basically, I wanted to ask David Banner what the hell does one thing have to do with the other? Are we somehow saying that the devaluing of Black life is a new phenomena? That before Black on Black crime, as the media has so cleverly labeled it, White people or law enforcement gave a damn about Black life? They didn’t. The fact that many politicians and law enforcement officials were members of the Klan themselves is a very well-documented fact. In fact, the Klan was so powerful and so prevalent, in 1870 and 1871, Congress had to pass {The Enforcement Acts}<hyperlink=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Acts""> just to make sure that states were enforcing the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, (the ones that gave full citizenship to anyone born in the US, including freed slaves and the one that offered suffrage rights to any American citizen, regardless of race.) That was over a 100 years ago, and we know, even today politicians are still introducing stipulations that disenfranchise Black voters.

And I know for a fact that the voting laws are not the only ways in which racist, Klan founded and fueled practices still dominate our law enforcement and justice system. Mistrust and demonization of Black people, men and women, is far from new and has nothing to do with Black people perpetuating violent crimes against each other. It’s an American tradition to kill Black people for no reason. And what we think of ourselves has little bearing on that undeniable fact.

To me, David Banner’s tweet sounds an awful lot like Don Lemon’s list. Pull your pants up and then they’ll respect you. Stop littering and then maybe they won’t {throw you in jail at a rate far higher than any other racial/ethic group in the country.}<hyperlink=""http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2012/03/13/11351/the-top-10-most-startling-facts-about-people-of-color-and-criminal-justice-in-the-united-states/""> Stop using the N-word and they won’t shoot to kill. Banner’s tweet seems to suggest that he’s dealing with some of his own psychological baggage, where no matter what, Black people are always somehow deserving of unethical, inhumane and downright evil treatment. I know I love and value myself and all people. I’ve never committed a crime against a Black person; but I also know that if I do something to somehow displease a White person in power, it could cost me life or limb and that White person could very easily walk away from the ordeal scott-free.

Last night, all I knew is that an unarmed boy was shot and killed by a police officer. This morning I got the full story. First reports claimed that he ran from an officer. But {according to the New York Times,}<hyperlink=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html?_r=1""> officials are now claiming Brown didn’t just attempt to run from the officer, he tussled with him, trying to get his gun. According to officials, a patrol car stopped Brown and another man around noon on Saturday. As the officer was about to exit the vehicle, one of the men pushed him back into the car and physically assaulted him. The claim has been met with outrage from the largely Black community of Ferguson, Missouri (a suburb of St. Louis), resulting in everything from peaceful protests to rioting.

Brown’s stepfather, Louis Head, on the day his son was executed, held a cardboard sign that read “Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son.” But the St. Louis county police chief, Jon Belmar, seems to be spinning a different story. He said “The genesis of this was a physical confrontation.”

Family members of Brown say he was walking to his grandmother’s house when the shooting occurred. {Desiree Harris, Brown’s grandmother told KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/national/270623971.html""> she saw him running in her neighborhood when she passed him in her car. Then minutes later, after she’d gotten home, she heard a commotion and then saw his body lying in the street just two blocks away. His body would remain in the street for some time, guarded by officers while neighbors gathered, many taking pictures. Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden told reporters her son had just graduated from high school and was planning to attend Vatterott College.

Does that not show that he valued himself? But the officer didn’t see that. And sadly, that is the narrative when it comes to Black youth in this country. They’re trouble makers not young people with potential, a life ahead of them. Oftentimes the media is not any better in their opinions of Black youth. We all remember how Trayvon was basically tried for his own murder, being portrayed as a weed smoking, gang affiliated, hoodie wearing thug. It was with this history in mind that several Black people on Twitter and Instagram started the hashtag {and account #IfTheyGunnedMeDown,}<hyperlink=""http://instagram.com/iftheygunnedmedown?modal=true""> where they posted pictures of themselves and how the media would most likely choose to run the stories of their hypothetical and unjust murders with questionable photos rather than ones that show them succeeding, giving back or being loved, treasured and valued by someone.

[instabegin https://www.instagram.com/p/rhyzjum1xx/ instaend]

Sadly, we’ll never know what Brown’s college graduation picture looked like. And I couldn’t state that any more clearly than the way Brown’s mother did in her interview with KMOV.

“You took my son away from me. Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many Black men graduate? Not many. Because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they don’t got nothing to live for anyway. ‘They’re going to try to take me out anyway.’",235,NA,NA,NA

Fox,08/15/14,02/10/17,"In the past few weeks, police brutality has become, seemingly, the biggest concern for American citizens across the country. To change the dynamic between law enforcement and communities, Caleb Christian, a 14-year-old Georgia high school freshman created an app that will allow citizens to rate and leave reviews of their police districts. Named Five-O, Christian along with his two sisters programmed the app so citizens can input details of every interaction they have with the police officers they encounter.

{For Harriet}<hyperlink=""http://www.forharriet.com/2014/08/georgia-teens-develop-app-to-document.html""> reports, the app allows for citizens to rate individual police officers based on their professionalism. The app review allows for “citizens to store the details of each encounter with law enforcement; this provides convenient access to critical information needed for legal action or commendation.”

Christian’s older sister, Ima who is a high school senior told {PineTartInc:}<hyperlink=""http://pinetartinc.com/?p=77"">

“We’d like to know which regions in the US provide horrible law enforcement services as well as highlight the agencies that are highly rated by their citizens. In addition to putting more power into the hands of citizens when interacting with law enforcement, we believe that highly rated police departments should be used as models for those that fail at providing quality law enforcement services.”

Christian’s 15-year-old sister, Asha also confirmed: “We expect that all parents will want this app for themselves and their kids.  We hope it will be one of the must have apps on your mobile devices.  Our goal is to make the app available to anyone, anywhere in the United States.” The Five-O app is currently in its Alpha testing stage but will be available to the public on August 18, 2014. The app will be available for both Andriod and IOS devices.

Below is a promotion video for the Five-O app.

In an equally hi-tech move, there are some who say police officers should be required to wear cameras to monitor their treatment of the public they’re meant to serve. The sight in Ferguson, MO of local police armed to the teeth, dressed like soldiers and tossing people in jail — peaceful protesters and journalists among them — has people questioning how police officers think they should conduct themselves when they engage with citizens.

One city in California, Rialto, is already doing this, outfitting officers with a $900 camera. {The study that ensued}<hyperlink=""http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/08/americas-weaponized-police-force-could-benefit-from-one-more-weapon-cameras/376063/""> found that complaints against police officers fell by 88 percent once the cameras were in place and the “use of force” fell by 59 percent. Both the officers and the public behaved better knowing their behavior were being documented. However there are questions of cost (for large cities, the price tag could go into the millions), privacy and even the results of the study.

The world watched, sympathized and protested with her when her son, Trayvon Martin, was gunned down in 2012. Seeing the uproar that the killing of Brown has caused in Ferguson, Missouri and worldwide, Fulton took the time to write {an open letter in TIME}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3136685/travyon-sybrina-fulton-ferguson/""> for his parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Sr., offering them her support. She also encouraged them to keep fighting for their son, something she hasn’t stopped doing for Martin.

To The Brown Family,

I wish I had a word of automatic comfort but I don’t. I wish I could say that it will be alright on a certain or specific day but I can’t. I wish that all of the pain that I have endured could possibly ease some of yours but it won’t. What I can do for you is what has been done for me: pray for you then share my continuing journey as you begin yours.

I hate that you and your family must join this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence. Of particular concern is that so many of these gun violence cases involve children far too young. But Michael is much more than a police/gun violence case; Michael is your son. A son that barely had a chance to live. Our children are our future so whenever any of our children – black, white, brown, yellow, or red – are taken from us unnecessarily, it causes a never-ending pain that is unlike anything I could have imagined experiencing.

Further complicating the pain and loss in this tragedy is the fact that the killer of your son is alive, known, and currently free. In fact, he is on paid administrative leave. Your own feelings will bounce between sorrow and anger. Even when you don’t want to think about it because it is so much to bear, you will be forced to by merely turning on your television or answering your cell phone. You may find yourselves pulled in many different directions by strangers who may be well-wishers or detractors. Your circle will necessarily close tighter because the trust you once, if ever, you had in “the system” and their agents are forever changed. Your lives are forever changed.

However with those changes come new challenges and opportunities. You will experience a swell of support from all corners of the world. Many will express their sympathies and encourage you to keep fighting for Michael. You will also, unfortunately, hear character assassinations about Michael which I am certain you already have. This will incense and insult you. All of this will happen before and continue long after you have had the chance to lay your son to rest.

I know this because I lived and continue to live this. I have devoted my life to the comprehensive missions of The Trayvon Martin Foundation – including providing support to families that have lost a young child to senseless gun violence regardless of race, ethnicity or gender. I will support you and your efforts to seek justice for your Michael and the countless other Michaels & Trayvons of our country. The 20 Sandy Hook children. Jordan Davis. Oscar Grant. Kendrick Johnson. Sean Bell. Hadya Pendleton. The Aurora shooting victims. The list is too numerous to adequately mention them all. According to The Children’s Defense Fund, gun violence is the second leading cause of death for children ages 1-19. That is a horrible fact.

Facts, myths, and flat out lies are already out there in Michael’s case. Theories, regardless of how ridiculous, are being pondered by the pundits. My advice is to surround yourselves with proven and trusted support. Through it all, I never let go of my faith, my family, or my friends. Long after the overwhelming media attention is gone, you will need those three entities to find your ‘new normal.’ Honor your son and his life, not the circumstances of his alleged transgressions. I have always said that Trayvon was not perfect. But no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed.

But know this: neither of their lives shall be in vain. The galvanizations of our communities must be continued beyond the tragedies. While we fight injustice, we will also hold ourselves to an appropriate level of intelligent advocacy. If they refuse to hear us, we will make them feel us. Some will mistake that last statement as being negatively provocative. But feeling us means feeling our pain; imagining our plight as parents of slain children. We will no longer be ignored. We will bond, continue our fights for justice, and make them remember our children in an appropriate light. I would hate to think that our lawmakers and leaders would need to lose a child before protecting the rest of them and making the necessary changes NOW…

With Heartfelt Support,

Sybrina D. Fulton

I’m gonna be honest here, when I found out I was having a boy, my heart sank a little. It’s not that my husband and I didn’t want a boy – in fact we were thrilled to have our first child be a boy so he could assume the role of an older brother, something my guy enjoyed growing up in a home with sisters. Yet I couldn’t help but think about all of the “what if” scenarios that come with raising a young black man. What if he is one of the only children of color among his friends? What if the cops stop him because he fits a certain profile? As much as I will try my best to protect him from the evils of life, you just can’t stop every bad thing from occurring. My own husband has been pulled over a couple of times by our local police and he wears a polo and Dickies for heaven’s sake! Granted, it can happen to anyone, I can’t help but think about those routine situations that turn for the worst when people are caught off guard.

Thankfully, I am the daughter of a now-retired police sergeant who can not only give me advice on how to be a good parent, but the skinny from a cop’s perspective on how his grandson can handle run-ins with the police. Obviously, home training will come into play as some do bring it on themselves, but I am talking about those times when a young man did nothing wrong.

10 Tips and Takeaways for Dealing with Police

- Limit your contact. Whether you were stopped because you were at fault or not, get in and get out. The more contact a police officer has with you, the more time they have to find something.
- Watch what you say. “First and foremost, you cannot let it become confrontational,” notes my father. Why argue? Cops also write down what you say. “Oh yeah, I have used the ignorant things people have said to me in court.”
- Be respectful. “Yes sir, no ma’am” – home training and respect can get you far. Try to make the situation as comfortable as possible. “You start off nice, you don’t start off ignorant.”
- SHUT UP! If you are driving with others in the car, tell them to shut up as their mouth can get everyone in trouble. “Now you allow me access to everybody,” my dad notes.
- Don’t make it personal. Simply put, let the cop do his/her job and be cooperative. In the words of Denzel in Training Day, “you wanna go to jail or you wanna go home?”

MadameNoire,mnoire17,http://madamenoire.com/458813/hip-hop-and-social-change/,We Can’t Hear You: Why Those In Hip-Hop With The Most Influence Need To Start Speaking Up About Social Injustices,Alexandra Olivier,08/15/14,02/10/17,"Hip-hop is protest, or at least, that’s what it used to be. The beauty of its art is that on a piano-driven or drum-fueled beat, someone who isn’t a politician, teacher or authority figure can reach the masses and educate.

The lessons aren’t conventional.

The lessons aren’t sugarcoated.

The lessons aren’t often very nice.

Despite the fact that we would like to believe that in 2014, black bodies are equally valued considering that this great nation elected a black president, that is simply not the case. Instead, everytime we look up, young black men are being killed by the police, and one another, with no justice being served. Most recently, 18-year-old Michael Brown lost his life at the hands of police officer {Darren Wilson,}<hyperlink=""http://madamenoire.com/458804/ferguson-police-chief-names-darren-wilson-as-officer-who-shot-killed-michael-brown/""> shot multiple times while unarmed, his hands in the air. At the core of hip-hop, records like N.W.A’s “F**k The Police” and Nas’ “Sly Fox” never felt more fitting.

Despite what we see now and hear on the radio, hip-hop has a conscience. It is a genre that can provide a platform for those to represent the unheard in times of great unrest. While Ferguson, Missouri transformed into a war zone earlier this week, tracks like Twista and Faith Evans’ “Hope” and Jadakiss’ “Why” fit the startling images of chaos in the city as calls for peace are heard from Brown’s parents and President Obama.

In a time where we need people with influence to speak, I’m wondering, where have records like Tupac’s “Changes” retreated to? The records that explicitly detail a struggle that is still felt today? It appears strategic brand management has made artists fall quiet until the dust completely clears before they speak out about anything, or better yet, they say nothing at all. In a social media-driven society, it takes more than a tweet in solidarity to reach the masses.

Our lyricists shouldn’t shy away from stirring the pot with records directly influenced by the harsh realities of injustice. Jay Z penned records like “Minority Report” reflecting the everyday man’s trials, but now the genre as a whole has become consumed by Shmoney dances and lavish living. There is no sense of balance when it comes to popping bottles and dealing with everyday issues of the world we live in. What has changed us from being a culture of impact?

I get it. Rappers didn’t rise to fame to become activists. But for a genre to be so fundamentally based in social commentary, the disconnect these days is discouraging. Just like Game, Prodigy and 50 Cent communicated their discontent about Trayvon Martin’s death and David Banner has been vocal with his views about the killing of Brown, there is a need for others with great influence to speak  up, and to record songs that stand the test of time, speak to the people and reach beyond the Twittersphere.

J. Cole has done just that. In his video for “Crooked Smile,” he dedicated the clip to 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones, who was killed during a police raid on her home in 2010, and the imagery is based on her life and death. And he’s done it again with the release of his song {“Be Free,”}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KSqLQKLkAo""> sending this message about the song dedicated to Michael Brown:

“Rest in Peace to Michael Brown and to every young black man murdered in America, whether by the hands of white or black. I pray that one day the world will be filled with peace and rid of injustice. Only then will we all Be Free”

Thank you J. Cole for rising to the plate and detailing the pain felt throughout the nation at the unfortunate death of Michael Brown. All we want to do is be free, and what we need is people to speak out about these injustices in any and every way possible.",28,NA,NA,NA
MadameNoire,mnoire18,http://madamenoire.com/458516/10-armed-white-men-die-police/,10 Armed White Men Who Did Not Die By the Police,Charing Ball,08/16/14,02/10/17,"The headlines have almost become a weekly occurrence: Black person shot and killed by the police.

Usually it is Black men. But sometimes it is women.

In the majority of times, they are unarmed. And most of the time, their deaths were for no damn justifiable reason at all.

Yet, despite the video evidence and eye witnesses accounts and just flat-out appreciation of history in this country, some folks still don’t believe race is a factor.

So let’s play a game. It’s a game I created based around my favorite scene from the film A Time to Kill (based on the John Grisham book of the same name) when Jake Tyler Brigance, a young snappy lawyer (played by Matthew McConaughey) defending Carl Lee Hailey (played by Samuel L. Jackson), who is on trial for the murder of the two White men, who raped his 10-year-old daughter, tells the all-White Mississippi jury to close its eyes and imagine that the little girl victim is White. For those who haven’t seen the film, the scene is pretty climatic as it is supposed to be the moment when the all White jury has an epitome about their own biases against Black people.

I’m not going to tell you to close your eyes and imagine anything – or else how would you read the rest of this essay/list?

But I’m going to tell you that during this slideshow of 10 White Armed Men NOT Killed By the Police, in hopes that it inspires some of y’all to take off your rose colored glasses and put away your colorblind blinders and ask yourself in the most serious tones: what would happen if these men were Black.

Derrick Daniel Thomas

White Privilege Pass: According {to Nola.com,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2014/04/suspect_who_terrorized_7th_war.html""> 32-year old Thomas barged into a strangers home with a handgun, robbed the house and it’s inhabitants, shot at the house before fleeing on foot, where he threatened some construction workers, shot at the contractor five times, and then led police on a chase. After cornering the White man, the police allegedly told Thomas to drop his weapon. However Thomas refused and instead pointed the gun at the cops and allegedly responded: “No, you drop your (expletive) gun!”

Despite many threats to the police safety, Thomas was eventually taken into custody alive and without a single bullet hole to the body, where he was able to face five counts of aggravated assault, three counts of aggravated assault on a police officer, one count of criminal damage to property and a $500,000 bond – of course, this happened after the officers got his real name because originally, Thomas gave them an alias at booking, which they accepted as the truth.

Had He Been Black: Six feet under by the time he said, “No, yo-” Burial and all.

Cliven Bundy

White Privilege Pass: The 67-year old Mormon and Nevada cattle rancher with over 50 grandchildren garnered national attention when he and his supporters got into a 8-day armed standoff with the federal government following a 20-year battle over $1.1 million dollars in unpaid grazing fees the Federal Bureau of Land Management said he owed for allowing his cattle to eat off of federal land. Despite pointing guns at federal agents, Bundy, who was known for riding around the standoff site on a horse, carrying the American flag, would become a folk hero for the conservative anti-government Right and would even gain some allies within the actual government, in particular Sen. Rand Paul and Nevada Sen. Dean Heller. However some of his supporters would jump ship when Bundy, who again was accused of letting his cattle roam for free for 20 years on government land, accused Blacks of living off of government subsidies and saying that we would have been better off picking cotton in slavery.

According to {ABC News,}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/nevada-cattle-rancher-wins-range-war-federal-government/story?id=23302610""> the standoff ended when the BLM backed down and said that it would no longer attempt to seize Bundy’s cattle. Not only would Bundy not spend a minute in jail, some of his comrades would get tazed and arrested. However they all were eventually released back into the comfort and security of White privilege.

Had He Been Black: WHEN they were black, they were called MOVE and in the summer of 1985 Philadelphia local police (not even the feds) ended it’s standoff with the back-to-nature liberation group by dropping two one-pound bombs on their Osage Avenue rowhouse compound, killing 11 people including five children and destroying 60 nearby residencies. For a more detailed explanation of events, I suggest you check out the documentary “Let The Fire Burn,” which is available to stream on Netflix.

Open Carry Texas

White Privilege Pass: Its’ {Facebook page says that Open Carry}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/OpenCarryTexas/info""> is “an organization dedicated to the safe and legal carry of firearms openly in the State of Texas in accordance with the United States and Texas Constitution and applicable laws.” However you all might recall {seeing headlines and tons of pictures}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/moms-versus-assault-weapons-in-target""> of this merrily band of assault-rifle wielding buying Oreo cookies and checking out the latest in Fisher Price toys at Target.

Had They Been Black: If the recent tragic case of John Crawford is any indicator, he wouldn’t have needed a real gun; just an air rifle. And he probably wouldn’t have even made it to the register.

Steve Lohner

White Privilege Pass: The name doesn’t ring familiar but the 18-year old kid from Aurora, Colorado tells a Denver Fox 31 News that he believes police are unfairly targeting simply because he is walking around town with a shotgun. Lohner is so incensed by his violation of his constitutional right, he has started to record his encounters with police including one video, which lasts for over seven minutes and involves him not getting shot. The station also reports about this kid’s grave injustice:

“Police who were called to the scene say they weren’t able to determine if he was doing it legally. Lohner refused to show them an ID to prove he’s 18.“I simply carry this for the protection of myself and those around me,” Lohner says. His shotgun is a Stoeger P-350 12 gauge.“I’ve been stopped close to a dozen times for this and this is actually the first time I’ve been forced to provide ID,” he says. The teen says he’s on a campaign to call attention to open carry laws. “I feel like a lot of people now they see a weapon like that and they think, you know, James Holmes or Sandy Hook,”

Had They Been Black: If ever you needed definite proof of two Americas, here is it. And truthfully, the kid has a point. However, I just can’t with this kid’s righteous indignation about rights and shit in the wake of all the horrible and exact outcomes of what would have definitely transpired had this been a Black kid parading around town with a gun. Black kids are just not afforded that many lives.

Joseph Houseman

White Privilege Pass: Here is another law abiding citizen expressing his 2nd amendment right to act like a moron while simultaneously scaring the crap out of people. According {to published reports,}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/joseph-houseman-police-standoff""> the 63-year old patriot likes to stand on the corners in Kalamazoo, Michigan holding his rifle and pondering on what it would be like to actually have real manly sized balls, so he wouldn’t have to overcompensate any longer. Anyway, Houseman would find himself in a standoff with police earlier this year after residents complained about the nut on the corner with the rifle. According to the Talking Point Memo:

“Houseman refused to comply with requests that he put the rifle down and talk to the officers. During the negotiations, Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety Lt. Stacey Geik, who took over as commanding officer on the scene, told a dispatcher that Houseman was “exercising his open carry rights, however, he has certainly overextended them at this point.”

After a 40-minute standoff, in which Houseman had a heart-to-heart with police about the revolution and gun rights, the police negotiator was able to cox the gun out of Houseman’s hand and end the siege on a peaceful note. The following day after the standoff, the police officially declined misdemeanor charges against Houseman and even returned his gun to him.

Had He Been Black: And Female, she might have been {93-year old Pearlie Golden,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/texas-shoots-death-93-year-old-woman-answering-911-complaint-article-1.1783289""> who was shot and killed by police for allegedly waving her revolver at them. According to the New York Daily News, Officer Stephen Stem asked the 93-year-old to “put down the weapon and then ultimately fired his own sidearm, wounding Miss Golden” who later died at a local hospital…” The officer in question was suspended without pay and eventually fired. However, Golden is still dead.

White Privilege Pass: But Charing, isn’t this one half of the Boston Marathon Bombing Terrorist suspects (still not convicted in the court of law), who shot at police and were too shot at by police? Isn’t it true that he shot by the police upon apprehension? Where exactly is his White privilege in any of this?

He’s alive ain’t he? And looking all boy band sexy on {the cover of The Rolling Stones,}<hyperlink=""http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/jahars-world-20130717""> I might add.

Had He Been Black: Whereas Christopher Dorner, the ex-LAPD cop turned angry Black man with a manifesto, a gun and a a vendetta against the po-po, was burnt to the jerky in a log cabin out in the San Bernardino Mountains.

I mean, they were not even trying to put out that fire.

Adam Kokesh

White Privilege Pass: Remember last year when a bunch of gun-loving nuts were planning to have an Open Carry on Washington march and rally but opted against it because the local D.C. Police said if they tried it, he would throw all their behinds in jail? Well Kokesh, a gun rights advocate and lead organizer of the failed march, {decided to continue on exercising his freedom and on July 4th,}<hyperlink=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kokesh""> posted a video of himself on YouTube, loading a double pump action shotgun in Freedom Plaza, which is between the White House and The Capital – and doing so without get shot down. Four days later, Kokesh would be picked up on the US Parks SWAT Team and plead guilty to carrying a rifle or shotgun, possession of an unregistered firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition in the District. His sentencing on those charges is in September and he could be looking up to 15 years in prison.

However, he is still alive. And out on bail. Touring the country and sh*t.

Had He’d Been Black: I would have to go with him being dead the moment he thought organizing that march was a good idea. Yup, just like in the film, The Minority Report. Black folks get gunned down all the time based upon what law enforcement and other vigilantes think they are about to do. Seriously, White guys do not know how how many benefits of doubts – and of life – they are given compared to the rest of society.

Joseph Clifford Reel

White Privilege Pass: Speaking of about nation’s capital, {33-year old Joseph Clifford Reel}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/ohio-man-sentenced-to-prison-for-launching-driverless-jeep-at-white-house/2014/01/10/24a843fc-7a20-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html""> was sentenced to three years in prison earlier this year for crashing a driverless Jeep into a White House security gate at 40 mph, hoping the White House fence and attempting to spray paint a giant snake on the side of the White House building, to symbol “Don’t Tread On Me” mantra of the Tea Party.

Did I also fail to mention that Reel will be doing only three years in prison – alive?

Had He’d Been Black: His name would have been Miriam Carey, the 34-year old Black woman from Connecticut, who tried to ram her car through a barricade at the White House and was shot and killed by Secret Service while her baby was in the back seat – and as she was fled on foot away from the incident, this {according to USA Today.}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/03/uscapitol-lockdown/2916679/"">

But you know, Don’t Tread on Me.

Officers John Wrigley, Eric White, Timothy Finley and Nicolas Olsen

White Privilege Pass: On February 21st 2005, Officers Wrigley, White, Finley and Olsen pumped over 28 rounds of live ammunition into retired police detective Howard Morgan as he laid on the ground during a “routine” traffic stop. According to the police, Morgan, who was driving home from work as a railroad patrolman, was going the wrong way up a one way block. After being pulled over, the officers alleged that Morgan sprang from his vehicle, wrestled with them as they attempted to subdue and handcuff him, and pulled a gun from his waistband and licked off 17 shots.

However Morgan’s version of the traffic stop differs in that he alleges that he identified himself as an officer however they didn’t believe him. And {as the Grio reports:}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2014/01/14/howard-morgan-appeal/#s:howard-morgan-16x9""> “Morgan says he was dragged out of  his van and forced to the ground as he tried to produce his identification, and that one of the officers noticed his service revolver, a Glock 9mm pistol, and yelled “gun!” After the gun was taken from his waistband by one of the officers, Morgan says the shooting began.”

Morgan would be hit 21 times in the back and 7 times in the front. Three out of the four officers were also hit with gunfire during the incident: a bullet to the upper right arm for Olsen; White in the right calf; and Wrigley in the left arm, but ultimately survived and got to go home with no real suspicions and questions about their conduct that night. They each would also {receive awards from the Award of Valor during the department’s Police Recognition Ceremony.}<hyperlink=""http://www.chicagopolice.org/MailingList/PressAttachment/release.AWARDS06.pdf"">

Had They Been Black: They would be Howard Morgan, who miraculously survived being shot at 28 times by the police, was then charged with four counts each of attempted murder and aggravated battery of a police officer as well as two counts of discharging a firearm. The trial would end in mistrial, he would be tried again in 2012. And {although the only witness to that night’s event pretty much collaborated his testimony}<hyperlink=""http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2009AppellateCourtDecision_0.pdf""> that he was pulled out his vehicle and shot by cops, the jury found Morgan guilty on of attempted murder. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison.

George Zimmerman

White Privilege Pass: Oh yeah, like there aren’t color privileges in the Hispanic community and world?

And while he may not be able to reap all the benefits of his daddy’s side of the family (thanks Mom!), it certainly was enough to get him out of trouble for the murder of Trayvon Martin. Even after his acquittal, Zimmerman has found himself involved in two domestic violence incidences – one of which involved a report of a gun on the premise. And yet nobody freaked out and shot him for the suspicions of being a threat to anyone’s safety.

Had He’d Been Black: Most definitely, OJ Simpson. He too beat a murder rap he probably should have gone to jail for. However in 2008, {Simpson was sentenced to nine years in prison}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28067187/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/oj-simpson-sentenced-long-prison-term/#.U-zzjLxdVXM""> for allegedly strong arm robbing two alleged drug dealers, who Simpson alleges stole his stuff. He was simply trying to get his stuff back is what he told the judge. But the system didn’t let that happened twice.

So what have we learned from this exercise in White privilege? Hopefully that there are very real double standards in not the laws but how we apply and enforce laws in this country.

If you didn’t learn that, well it is probably because you are racist against Black people.",81,NA,NA,NA
