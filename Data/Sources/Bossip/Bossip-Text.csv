KeKe Palmer Wears High Heels To Ferguson

On Sunday however when photos were released of KeKe, people noticed that instead of dressing down to march for justice, KeKe looked like she was ready for a night at the club complete with a short skirt and high heels.

But wait, not so fast…KeKe apparently wasn’t marching in her heels, she was reportedly leaving church and stopped to give a fan an autograph.

Twitter (OF COURSE) reacted to the photos not knowing that she wasn’t marching for the people in her summer sandals and slammed the talk show host for getting her photo opp on.

SMH…

What do YOU think about KeKe’s march attire??? Are people being too harsh on her considering that other celebrities aren’t even there????",138,NA,NA,No social media info on Bossip.

Veteran rapper and St. Louis native Nelly is speaking out with his two cents on how the city of Ferguson has reacted to the unjust killing of Mike Brown. Nelly, along with long-time friend and fellow rapper T.I. feel that the residents may have reacted too soon. 

via {TMZ}<hyperlink=”http://www.tmz.com/2014/08/16/nelly-st-louis-riots-michael-brown-shooting-death-protesters/”> 

Nelly has a message for protesters in his hometown … cut the crap! 

The King of St. Louis finally talked publicly about the shooting death of Michael Brown … saying the people of Ferguson jumped the gun by protesting too early, contributing to the violence. 

Nelly tells TMZ … “I understand the frustration, but we have to strategize before we overreact … We don’t get no do-over on sh*t like this, so we have to do it right the first time.” 

The rapper adds, “Ain’t nothing happen no different that hasn’t been happening … At the end of the day, we should have waited to strategize first and take all the right steps to organize.” 

T.I. had similar thoughts, telling us … “We needed to play chess instead of checkers. We should have waited to see if justice was going to be served first … We shouldn’t have played our strongest hand first.” 

Nelly tells us he wants to do something constructive, so he’s starting a scholarship fund in Michael Brown’s name. Nelly, T.I., Kevin Hart and NBA star Al Jefferson are the first 4 celebs pledging $15,000 a year in college tuition to teens chosen by the Brown family.

Last night, Twitter was emotionally charged over a variety of issues. While some mourned Robin Williams, others opined on the situation in Gaza and Iraq, but the most compelling content came via the angry black men and women in Ferguson, MO where Mike Brown was senselessly gunned down by police. After ugly incidents of rioting and looting that occurred the day previous in the St. Louis suburb, the emotions of the community were still brimming and they again took the streets to voice their displeasure. This time in a more peaceful manner.

Unfortunately, the effort to maintain peace and obey the law was no consolation to the Ferguson Police, they came to the party heavily armed with machine guns, tear gas, and tanks in an hyperbolic effort to establish control and in some cases inflict pain on those “animals” (see, “black people”) who were attempting to exercise their first amendment rights.

While most mainstream media spent the night talking about depression and President Obama, Twitter, Vine, and Instagram acted as the hood news network and provided us with an excellent perspective on the tension on the streets of Ferguson.

This brotha took a rubber bullet to the face as the Ferguson Police tried to put the kibosh on the peaceful protest. Sadly, he wasn’t the only one injured and/or threatened by a police department that appeared to be doing a lot more “serving” than “protecting”.

It’s only right we take a moment to recognize Antonio French, Alderman of the 21st Ward in St. Louis, who risked arrest, bodily harm, and worse in order to document the night’s activities.

Mike Brown Shot At Least Six Times By Ferguson Police

Via {NY Times}<hyperlink=”https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?smid=tw-bna&_r=0&referrer=”> reports:

One of the bullets entered the top of Mr. Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury, according to Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, who flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family’s request to conduct the separate autopsy. It was likely the last of bullets to hit him, he said.

Mr. Brown, 18, was also shot four times in the right arm, he said, adding that all the bullets were fired into his front.

The bullets did not appear to have been shot from very close range because no gunpowder was present on his body. However, that determination could change if it turns out that there is gunshot residue on Mr. Brown’s clothing, to which Dr. Baden did not have access.

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said Sunday that the Justice Department would conduct its own autopsy, in addition to the one performed by local officials and this private one because, a department spokesman said, of “the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family.”

The preliminary autopsy results are the first time that some of the critical information resulting in Mr. Brown’s death has been made public. Thousands of protesters demanding information and justice for what was widely viewed as a reckless shooting took to the streets here in rallies that ranged from peaceful to violent.

Mr. Brown died last week in a confrontation with a police officer here in this suburb of St. Louis. The police department has come under harsh criticism for refusing to clarify the circumstances of the shooting and for responding to protests with military-style operational gear.

“People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day 1,” Dr. Baden said in an interview after performing the autopsy. “They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.”

Dr. Baden said that while Mr. Brown was shot at least six times, only three bullets were recovered from his body. But he has not yet seen the X-rays showing where the bullets were found, which would clarify the autopsy results. Nor has he had access to witness and police statements.

Dr. Baden provided a diagram of the entry wounds, and noted that the six shots produced numerous wounds. Some of the bullets entered and exited several times, including one that left at least five different wounds.

“This one here looks like his head was bent downward,” he said, indicating the wound at the very top of Mr. Brown’s head. “It can be because he’s giving up, or because he’s charging forward at the officer.”

He stressed that his information does not assign blame or justify the shooting.

“We need more information; for example, the police should be examining the automobile to see if there is gunshot residue in the police car,” he said.

Dr. Baden, 80, is a well-known New York-based medical examiner, who is one of only about 400 board-certified forensic pathologists in the nation. He reviewed the autopsies of both President John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and has performed more than 20,000 autopsies himself.

Dr. Baden said that because of the tremendous attention to the case, he waived his $10,000 fee.

Prof. Shawn L. Parcells, a pathologist assistant based in Kansas, assisted Dr. Baden.

“You do this for the families,” Mr. Parcells said.

Mike Brown has been dead for over a week, and we know exactly who slaughtered him yet there have no resolutions or indictments brought forth. Will there ever been justice for Michael??",399,NA,NA,NA

Obama Slammed For Not Speaking About Ferguson Riots

As the black community watched the armor-clad, tear gas tossin’, gun totin’ police department in the town of Ferguson, Missouri time-warp back to the 1950’s last night, many voices were heard via television and social media. One very conspicuously absent voice was that of our 44th President, Barack Hussein Obama.

We’re still not sure what he was doing that was more important, but apparently he’ll be made aware of the state of his country today.

{Via ABC}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Election”>

The White House says President Barack Obama is being briefed on the situation in a St. Louis suburb where police used tear gas and smoke bombs to repel protesters.

The protests in Ferguson, Missouri, have been sparked by the death of an unarmed teenager who was shot by a police officer. The officer is white and 18-year-old Michael Brown was black.

The White House says Obama was briefed late Wednesday night by Attorney General Eric Holder and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. Obama is vacationing on the Massachusetts island of Martha’s Vineyard, as are Holder and Jarrett.

The White House says Obama has another briefing scheduled for Thursday morning.

Earlier in the week, the president issued a statement saying that Brown’s death is stirring “strong passions,” and he appealed for reflection.

Yeah, well, the only thing “reflecting” was the flash from the tear gas grenades that police hurled at the enraged-yet-peaceful people of Ferguson.

Criticism of the President ranged from vitriolic to despondent, but the underlying sentiment was “where IS Barack Obama when we need him?!?”

According to {Raw Story}<hyperlink=”http://www.rawstory.com/2014/08/klan-heading-to-ferguson-to-guard-white-businesses-back-shooting-of-ngger-criminal/”>:

Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members from three different states are reportedly traveling to Ohio to hold a two-day fundraiser for the officer who shot unarmed teen Michael Brown, and to “guard white businesses.”

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) first reported last week that that the New Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan had begun raising money in support of the Ferguson police officer who killed Brown. “With the police state in Ferguson, we will be holding our fundraiser in Sullivan City, MO,” the announcement said. “Donations of $10 and up. All money will go to the cop who did his job against the negro criminal.” And to anyone thinking of trying to get in the way, Murray warned, “we have guns (and more).”

“We are raising money for a cop who shot a n*gger criminal,” he explained. On Monday, the New Empire Knights issued a statement about plans to “guard white businesses near Ferguson.”

“With blacks out of control, we have our Missouri Realm going to areas near Ferguson,” the statement said. “We can’t have blacks robbing and murdering innocent whites. I am on my way down along with members from three different states and members from the Southern Mountain Knights.”

As the turmoil in Ferguson enters its 10th day and businesses along West Florissant Avenue are picking up from another night of looting following the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. The landscape for protestors has dramatically changed.
Demonstrators were informed Monday that they will no longer be able to march on West Florissant, stand in the turning lane and must keep moving during rallies. Protesters will also no longer be permitted to gather at the burned out QuikTrip on West Florissant which has become ground zero for protesters.
Governor Jay Nixon ordered the Missouri National Guard was deployed to help law enforcement officials regain control over West Florissant Avenue and protesters at night.
The guard will handle security at the police command center, freeing up more police for protection of property and crowd control on West Florissant.

Looters in Ferguson, Mo., were met with little police resistance Friday night and store owners say they were forced to protect their businesses with their own guns, Fox2Now.com reported.

“I think the first message is to remind all law enforcement that they are hired to serve and protect and if they’re going to sit back and watch looting, they’re not serving us; they’re not protecting us,” Pastor Robert White told the station.

A reporter from the station tweeted that police cars were seen driving past some of the stores being looted and did not respond. It rained in Ferguson Friday night and protesters could be seen outside until 6 a.m.

Two store owners, standing outside their business holding guns, told Fox2Now.com that when they called 911, they were sent from one police agency to another, and got no response.

One of the owners, with a large black gun resting on his shoulder, told the station that police were lined up blocks from the looting, and did not engage looters making off with large boxes from these stores.

“There’s no police,” he said. “We trusted the police to keep it peaceful; they didn’t do their job.”

Former St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch tweeted: “You did not see “police restraint” overnight. You saw police reluctant to act. We cannot keep stoning the keepers at the gate.”

Just before midnight, some in what had been a large and rowdy but mostly well-behaved crowd broke in a convenience store that police accused 18-year-old Michael Brown of robbing minutes before he was fatally shot by an officer, and began looting it, said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson.

Some in the crowd of about 200 began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Johnson said. One officer was hurt but details on the injury were not immediately available.",559,NA,NA,NA

The media will have you believe that these protesters are looters and criminals.

This is certainly not the case.

As we’ve seen tonight with our own eyes, the police began preemptively striking the protesters with tear gas, rubber bullets, and flash bangs.

We’ve seen journalists assaulted and arrested, targeted by tear gas and rubber bullets, and told to turn off their cameras and move away or be subject to arrest.

We witnessed as police threatened demonstrators to DISPERSE AND RETURN TO THEIR HOMES, and then firing tear gas in people’s own yards.

We cannot sit still and watch this happen.

It is our time to get off our chairs, turn off the TV, and make ourselves heard. Let us all stand in solidarity with Mike Brown, the people of Ferguson, and every single person that was brutalized, and brutally murdered by so-called authorities.

Martin Baker became a Twitter target as the only {African-American to support Darren Wilson, the Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=”https://bossip.com/?s=mike+brown&x=0&y=0”>, police officer who fatally shot unarmed teen Michael Brown. There were about 125 people in attendance at a pro-Wilson protest and 124 of them were white. Then there was Baker, Guardian reporter Jon Swaine tweeted.

He was one of the people who bought a dark blue shirt with a police-style badge that said: “Officer Darren Wilson — I stand by you,” the Guardian reported.

“People are too quick to play the race card,” Baker, 44, told the British newspaper. “Lawlessness knows no color.”

He said the demonstrators in Ferguson “want to see more crime, they want to see things get disrespectful. And there are some of us who refuse to allow it to happen.” He also accused Brown of having a “criminalistic bent” after police revealed the teen allegedly stole cigars before he was killed.

Baker’s stance on Brown’s death ultimately led to ridicule from Twitter users. They took jabs at the 44-year-old and created memes with his picture that were shared hundreds of times.

Black Twitter was on the job and hunted the cornball brotha quick, fast and in a hurry!

Police Claim Mike Brown Robbed Store Before Being Killed By Cop

Police revealed the identity Friday of the officer who shot and {killed unarmed teen Michael Brown, along with a report indicating that Brow}<hyperlink=”https://bossip.com/?s=mike+brown&x=0&y=0”>n and a friend had been involved in a theft at a convenience store shortly before the shooting occurred.

Via {MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ferguson-police-name-michael-brown”> reports:
According to the police report, video surveillance allegedly showed Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, in an altercation with a store employee on Aug. 9. Brown and Johnson grabbed cigars from the store and behind the counter, the police report said. Before they left the store, the employee attempted to stop Brown from taking the merchandise, according to the report. Brown grabbed the employee by the shirt and pushed him into a display rack in the store, the report said, and Brown and Johnson left the store with the cigars.

The report released Friday does not appear to shed light on the details of Brown’s death, and it is unclear how the officer could have been certain of Brown’s involvement in the robbery earlier that morning.

In an interview with msnbc shortly after the report was released, Johnson’s lawyer confirmed that Brown had taken cigars from the store.

“We see that there’s tape, that they claim they got a tape that shows there was some sort of strong-armed robbery,” said Freeman Bosley, Johnson’s attorney. “We need to see that tape, my client did tell us and told the FBI that they went into the store. He told FBI that he did take cigarillos, he told that to the DOJ and the St. Louis County Police.”

In an interview earlier this week, Johnson described the events of the shooting but did not mention that he and Brown had been in a convenience store just before, or that Brown had stolen anything.

According to the police report, the officer who shot Brown was responding to a description provided by police dispatch searching for a suspect in the robbery nearby. The officer was identified as Darren Wilson, who is white, and has been on the police force for six years. He is currently on paid administrative leave.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who made the details public Friday morning, declined to answer questions from the media, but said he would provide an update later in the day.

“The [officer’s] name in and of itself doesn’t let us know a whole lot,” Bosley said. “The next step is: what do we know about the officer? We’d like to see his personnel file and if any disciplinary action has been taken against him, and how long he has been an officer.”

In his brief appearance before the media, Jackson said that no disciplinary action had been taken against Wilson. Brown was not believed to have a criminal record, either.

Residents of Ferguson had been demanding the release of the officer’s name and details about the shooting. Many questions remain unanswered regarding Brown’s death. Ferguson had been engulfed in tensions and aggressive police tactics toward the community in the wake of Brown’s killing, but the climate has cooled since President Obama and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon urged calm Thursday.

“I’m pleased that the people of Ferguson and the region began to get some long-overdue information today, and I will continue to call for openness and transparency as the parallel investigations into this tragedy proceed to their necessary conclusions,” Nixon said Friday in a statement.

“For the sake of the family, the citizens of Ferguson, and the entire region, it is vital that the investigations into the shooting death of Michael Brown move forward in a thorough, open and transparent manner to ensure that trust is restored and justice is done,” he added. The Democratic governor previously faced criticism for his response to the police shooting.

Following a violent night of clashes between protesters and police on Wednesday, Nixon sought to return peace to the town of 20,000 by putting the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge of security. Hundreds of demonstrators peacefully rallied Thursday on the streets in Ferguson, and local reports said no one was arrested overnight.

Police say that Mike Brown assaulted the clerk of the convenience star before allegedly tking the cigarillos. The Ferguson Police is calling it a ‘strong-arm robbery’ but no robbery was reported from the store. And even if Mike Brown was involved in some form of robbery at the store, did that one instance have to result in his death?

Why is Mike Brown having to defend his tragic murder in the afterlife??

The “Just KeKe” host who previously said that the teen’s death wasn’t about race, recently dished on the RELENTLESS backlash she got for her statements and compared fighting brutality with violence, to having sex for virginity.

Ma’am…

{The Huffington Post reports}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/keke-palmer-ferguson-twitter-backlash_n_5682551.html?&”>:

Earlier this week, the 21-year-old actress-singer took to her Twitter and Instagram account posting a string of comments urging for unity and nonviolence during the outbreaks of national protests for Brown. And though Palmer’s inspirational messages were intended to uplift her followers, some slammed her thoughts as naïve.

“Being naïve is never anything to be ashamed of, because I believe me being naïve is what has allowed me to do all the things that I can because if I believe in and quote what’s realistic then I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing right now,” Palmer admitted Thursday during an interview with The Huffington Post.

“I simply wouldn’t be ‘Cinderella’ on Broadway, I wouldn’t have ‘Just KeKe,’”

“As far as what’s going on with Mike Brown, I spoke up on that, because unproductive outrage has never gotten us anywhere,” she continued.

“Even with MLK and everything that he did for black people…all he spoke about was unity, because throwing hate and being angry, and violence, that doesn’t give us peace and equality. That’s like having sex in order to get your virginity. It’s just the complete opposite thing to do.”

“I don’t have all the answers and there are no quick fixes for things like this.

But uniting and coming together on one clear message and trying to get that message across is much better than us all being everywhere and fighting against one another and coming from all different sides. That’s never going to get us anywhere.”

Despite her sometimes naive azz comments, the talk show host did do some good in the hood by traveling to Ferguson to actually march with the protestors.

While there she took video of the crowd and said she saw the man who was {shot last night in the stomach by authorities}<hyperlink=”https://bossip.com/1017165/seven-people-arrested-one-person-shot-during-ferguson-curfew/”>.

More than half of black Americans think Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson should be convicted of murdering Michael Brown – compared to just 17 per cent of white Americans.

The results from a survey carried out by Rasmussen reveal a stark difference in attitudes towards the death of the black teenager, which has sparked riots in the Missouri city and across the U.S.

Nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of the 1,000 American adults surveyed believe Wilson should be found guilty of murder, while another quarter (26 per cent) thought he was acting in self defense when he gunned down the unarmed teenager in broad daylight on August 9.

But 57 per cent of black adults think he should be convicted compared to only 17 per cent of white Americans and 24 per cent of other minority Americans.

Of those who are undecided about what should happened to Wilson, most – 56 per cent – are white.

The survey results also show that black Americans are more convinced that the violent riots since the killing are legitimate outrage rather than criminal activity.

Police have said they fired tear gas and rubber bullets in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails over the weekend.

Exactly a quarter of all those surveyed said they believed the protests have mostly been legitimate outrage, whereas 52 per cent think the riots have been carried out by criminals taking advantage of the situation.

Among these, 54 per cent of white Americans and 53 per cent of other minorities think the violence is mostly down to criminals, compared to 35 per cent of black people surveyed.

In addition, black Americans are more likely to think the protests are legitimate anger.

As tension grows in Ferguson, the Missouri State Police and the state National Guard have been called in to help deal with the violence.

Of those who took part in the survey, 27 per cent believe the police have responded well, while a similar percentage – 28 – call their response ‘poor’.

The results also showed that black Americans were more than twice as likely as whites and other minority adults to rate the police response as poor.

And while 68 per cent of Americans say they have been following the new reports very closely, black Americans are far more likely to be following it, the survey revealed.

The racial divide apparent in the survey results is reminiscent of the trial of George Zimmerman, who shot dead an unarmed African-American teenager in Florida in 2012. Zimmerman was found not guilty at a trial last year.

This latest survey shows that eight out of ten black voters believe the system is unfair to minorities.

So essentially…Black people are the only ones truly concerned when a killing like this happens — and not even an overwhelming majority of us. Sadly, these numbers aren’t even a little bit shocking.",196,NA,NA,NA

Residents of Ferguson, Missouri are in an uproar after police shot down 18-year-old unarmed teen Michael Brown Saturday. Brown who was scheduled to start college Monday, was reportedly shot 10 times by an officer even after surrendering and putting his hands up.

The fatal shooting of a teen Saturday afternoon by a Ferguson police officer outside an apartment complex sent angry residents into the street, taunting police and firing shots.

Michael Brown, 18, was shot at approximately 2:15 p.m. in the 2900 block of Canfield Drive.

His mother, Lesley McSpadden, said the shooting took place as her son was walking to his grandmother’s residence.

Piaget Crenshaw, 19, said she was waiting for a ride to work when she saw a police officer attempting to place Brown in the squad car.

She then said she saw the teen, hands in the air, attempt to flee. Several shots hit Brown as he ran, Crenshaw said.

She complied with a request that she give photos of the scene to authorities.

Brown, a 2014 Normandy High School graduate, was scheduled to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday.

The shooting sparked a furious backlash.

Louis Head, Brown’s stepfather, held a sign that said: “Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!”

Tension flared off and on through the evening.

A calm settled over the area after mourners gathered at a prayer circle — watched over by a St. Louis County police officer sitting atop a SWAT vehicle — and then a candlelight vigil as darkness fell.

The acrimony briefly resurfaced about 8:30 p.m. as demonstrators again swarmed the street chanting, “We Are Michael Brown” as wary police officers stood nearby with assault rifles.

At one point, residents held up their hands, saying, “Don’t shoot me!” as police officers with barking dogs tried to keep order.

Approximately 100 protesters then went to the street outside Ferguson police headquarters and chanted, “No Justice! No Peace!”

McSpadden appeared at the shooting scene sporadically, comforted by friends and neighbors.

“I know they killed my son,” McSpadden was heard telling an acquaintance. “This was wrong and it was cold-hearted.”

Her son, she continued, “doesn’t kill, steal or rob. He doesn’t do any of that.”

This is TERRIBLE news and it’s stirring up strong reactions online.

Some people have wondered what Brown did to “deserve” the shooting, as if a teenager with NO WEAPON deserves 10 bullets.

Cop Who Killed Mike Brown Went Into Hiding With Family After Shooting

According to {Mediaite reports}<hyperlink=”http://www.mediaite.com/online/officer-who-shot-michael-brown-reportedly-left-town-days-ago/”>:

Ferguson police this morning identified the police officer who shot Michael Brown as Darren Wilson. And when reporters knocked on the door of Wilson’s residence today, they discovered he apparently left town days ago.

USA Today reports that no one answered at his home, and a cop watching the house said “Wilson and his family left days ago.”

They also got testimonials from neighbors, including this woman’s description of Wilson:

A neighbor, who did not want to be identified, said that Wilson had moved into the neighborhood less than a year ago. She described him as ” tall and slim” and that she would see him walking his dog in the neighborhood of mostly single-story brick homes. She said she didn’t know he was the cop until this morning when Crestwood police informed residents that he was involved and the neighborhood would be getting attention.

According to the Ferguson police chief’s comments earlier today, Wilson was unaware that Brown was a robbery suspect when he confronted him.

Isn’t it ironic? Just six months ago the {officer who killed Mike Brown}<hyperlink=”https://bossip.com/1016622/breaking-news-ferguson-police-release-name-of-officer-who-killed-mike-brown-video/”> was honored for his police work.

According to {Yahoo! Reports}<hyperlink=”https://www.yahoo.com/news/photos-ferguson-officer-darren-wilson-received-police-award-earlier-this-year-021255893.html?ref=gs”>:

Six months before he shot and killed an unarmed teenager, police Officer Darren Wilson earned a commendation for his “extraordinary effort in the line of duty.”

Yahoo News confirmed the award through the February 11 Ferguson City Council meeting minutes and photos Wilson’s father posted to his Facebook page.

“Very proud of my son, Darren Wilson on his receiving a Commendation from his Police Department,” John Wilson wrote on February 11. “Congratulations Son.”

One image shows Wilson shaking hands and receiving the commendation from Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson. In a second photo, the tall and slender Wilson brandishes smile as he returns to his seat with his honor.

Details of what the 28-year-old officer did to earn the commendation weren’t immediately available. (The Facebook page for the officer’s father appears to have been deactivated shortly after Yahoo News first published this story on Saturday morning.)

Yahoo News tried to reach John Wilson by phone late Friday. Tonya Wilson, his wife and the officer’s stepmother, answered and said “we’re not talking to anybody — thank you” before hanging up. A text message seeking the name of Wilson’s attorney wasn’t returned.

Four days ago John Wilson turned to Facebook for support without mentioning his son by name.

“Dear FB friends, Our family is in need for prayers to be sent up for a family member,” John Wilson wrote. “Circumstances do not allow for us to say anything further. Please pray with our family in mind. Put a covering of protection over our family member please.”

John Wilson thanked his many friends who were quick to offer encouragement.

“Please continue to do so as we deal with a family situation that is very challenging,” he wrote.

In his last post this week, John Wilson shared a saying from a Texas evangelical pastor: “When something is ‘out of control’ it is merely out of your control — not God’s!”

On Friday, Chief Jackson told reporters that the young officer was taking the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown very hard.

“He never intended for any of this to happen,” Jackson said. “It’s devastating, absolutely devastating.”

Utah Cop Kills Unarmed Man Wearing Headphones

Police shot and killed a 20-year-old Monday who was wanted for probation violation, but the man’s brother said he was wearing headphones and could not hear officers’ orders.

Via {Raw Story}<hyperlink=”http://www.rawstory.com/2014/08/cops-gun-down-headphones-wearing-utah-man-because-he-wouldnt-comply-with-orders/”> reports:

Officers were called about 7 p.m. to a 7-Eleven store in Salt Lake City after witnesses reported a man waving a gun around.

Dillon Taylor was walking out of the convenience store with his brother and cousin when officers arrived, and police said Taylor matched a description of the suspect.

Three officers said they ordered Taylor to reveal his hands, but they said he ignored their commands and was “visibly upset.”

Taylor was then shot by police and was pronounced dead at the scene.

His brother said Taylor was wearing headphones and did not hear the officers until they surrounded him.

“He couldn’t hear them, so he just kept walking,” said Jerrail Taylor. “(Then) they had guns pointed at his face. That’s when he turned off the music. I saw them point guns at my brother’s face, and I knew what was going to happen.”

One officer told Dillon Taylor to get on the ground, but another told him to place his hands on top of his head.

“He got confused, he went to pull up his pants to get on the ground, and they shot him,” Jerrail Taylor said.

Police have not said whether Taylor was armed at the time, but his brother insists he didn’t have a gun.

“All this complaining about one of us having a gun, I’m kind of lost at because none of us had a gun,” said Jerrail Taylor.

A warrant was issued last week for Dillon Taylor, who said on his Facebook page that he did not want to go back to jail.

“I feel my time is coming soon, my nightmears are telling me,” he posted. “im gonna have warrnts out for my arrest soon. ALL my family has turned and snitched on me. ill die before I go do a lot of time in a cell,” he wrote. “I feel like god cant even save me on this one … this time coming its me and the demons im fighting.”

But police said officers did not likely know who Taylor was or that he was wanted on an open warrant.

Investigators disputed a witness claim that Taylor apparently tried to run away from police.

“There’s not any initial indication that he was necessarily fleeing,” said Sgt. Darin Sweeten, of Salt Lake City police. “He was not complying with the officers’ orders that they were giving him. It still needs to be investigated.”

Taylor pleaded guilty in 2012 to robbery and obstructing justice after he and another person stole a tip jar from a restaurant and then a 30-pack of beer about an hour later.

He threatened to shoot a witness to the theft, and then he threatened to shoot one of his accomplices and their wife or daughter about a month after the incident.

Taylor, whose fiancée was three months pregnant at the time of his death, served about 14 months in the Salt Lake County Jail in connection with those cases.

The officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave during the investigation.

Kansas City Cop Investigated For Racist Mike Brown Posts

A racist Kansas City police officer is getting (rightfully) blasted for confusing unarmed teen Michael Brown with an accused murderer and posting about him on his Facebook page.

“I’m sure young Michael Brown is innocent and just misunderstood,” he sarcastically captioned the mixed up photo.

{KCTV reports}<hyperlink=”http://www.kctv5.com/story/26310700/kansas-city-officer-faces-review-for-michael-brown-facebook-posts”>:

Kansas City Police Department officer vented on Facebook about the Michael Brown shooting, and now he faces an internal review.

Officer Marc Catron’s postings have produced outrage on social media, particularly because he made strong comments about Michael Brown.

He shared a picture that he and others have claimed is Brown in a compromising position, but it’s actually an accused killer from Oregon.

A spokesman for the Kansas City Police Department said this is a personnel issue that will be addressed with the officer.

The department also provided a copy of the department’s eight-page social media policy.

“Because members of this department are held to a higher standard than general members of the public, the online activities of members of this department shall reflect such professional expectations and standards,” the department policy states.

Two cousins were accused in Oregon of using a sledge hammer to kill their great-grandmother last year.

In one of the photos, Joda Cain has a wad of money stuffed in his mouth while pointing a gun at the camera.

People have posted this photo of Cain to Facebook, including KCTV5’s Facebook page, claiming that it’s Brown, when it’s not.

Catron posted the photo of Cain to his Facebook page and wrote, “I’m sure young Michael Brown is innocent and just misunderstood. I’m sure he is a pillar of the Ferguson community.”

Catron also spoke about the violence that has rocked Ferguson over the past week since a police officer shot the unarmed teen.

“Remember how white people rioted after OJ’s acquittal? Me neither,” according to a Facebook post that Catron shared on his own Facebook page.

Some outraged residents shared their posts on KCTV5’s Facebook page.

Draya Talks Race And Says Mike Brown’s Murder Was An Accidental Death

We recently have reported on the senseless murder of {Missouri teenager Mike Brown who was gunned down by local police}<hyperlink=”https://bossip.com/1013800/justice-for-mikebrown-new-petition-asks-federal-laws-to-protect-all-citizens-from-racist-police-violence/”>. After ugly incidents of rioting and looting occurred in the St. Louis suburb, the emotions ran raw as the entire community took to the streets to voice their collective anger and frustration with the racist police force.

Via {AJC}<hyperlink=”http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/jay-bookman/2014/aug/13/mike-brown-dead-st-louis/”> reports:

Mike Brown, an 18-year-old black man from the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, just a few days from starting technical school, was walking down the street with a friend on Saturday afternoon. A few minutes later, Brown lay dead, killed by multiple gunshots fired by a police officer. Brown was unarmed, and according to witnesses he had raised his hands to surrender when the final, fatal shots were fired.

The police version of events is that Brown and his friend were stopped by a police officer in a car. The police officer attempted to leave the car, but Brown or his friend pushed the car door closed. A physical struggle ensued; Brown supposedly reached for the officer’s gun, the officer fired the gun and wounded Brown. Brown then fled. I’ve seen no attempted explanation for why the final shots were fired.

Since then, a familiar scene has unfolded. Protests have broken out; the FBI and the county police have been called in to investigate. Small-scale rioting and looting have occurred, and the situation between local law enforcement and the black community is tense. Al Sharpton is on the scene, and the attorney who represented the family of Trayvon Martin now represents the Brown family.

Many celebrities have lent their voice to bring more attention to the outrage in Ferguson, but with all the intelligent discourse happening on social media, someone decided to add their unneeded two cents to the race debate and Mike Brown conversation.

Don Lemon Takes White People To Task For Being In Denial About Racial Inequality

After interviewing witnesses to {Mike Brown’s murder}<hyperlink=”https://bossip.com/1016120/president-obama-addresses-mike-brown-killing-by-dirty-ferguson-police-video/”>, Don Lemon issued the following statement on the Tom Joyner Morning show, which we’re sharing here via {Black America Web}<hyperlink=”https://blackamericaweb.com/2014/08/14/don-lemon-says-its-time-for-white-people-to-be-their-black-brothers-keeper/”>:

It’s been almost a week since unarmed teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, and still no answers.

More eyewitnesses are coming forward, like Piaget Crenshaw and Tiffany Mitchell who in an exclusive live interview with CNN told me they saw Brown standing outside the police car trying to wrest his arm away from the officer’s grip.

The officer, they say, was still inside the police car.

The young lady’s attorney, Peter Cohen, who happens to be white, conveyed to me in the same interview what is perhaps the most simple and sensible statement I’ve heard thus far.

We need to address the fact that in Ferguson, Missouri black drivers and people are stopped more often than whites even though the whites who are stopped are more often carrying illegal contraband.

We need to address the fact that Ferguson, Missouri is not an outlier.

Official government statistics show that the same thing happens in cities and towns all over the United States.

We need to address the fact while we don’t know exactly what went down between Brown and the officer that many people in this country are more likely to give the officer the benefit of the doubt rather than an unarmed black teenager.

“He must have been doing something or the officer would not have stopped him or killed him.”

How many times have you heard that, especially from white people in this country?

We need to address the fact that many white people in this country refuse to even allow the possibility that there is a double standard when it comes to the way black men are perceived and treated in American society on a daily basis, on the street, at work, at the grocery store, at the mall, everywhere.

Earlier this year President Barack Obama launched a nationwide imitative called ‘My Brother’s Keeper’ to address the issues facing black men in America.

That program isn’t just for black people to help black men.

It’s for all people to help black men.

It’s time for the white people who are in willful denial to break the cycle and become their black brother’s keeper.

(slow claps for Don Lemon) Homeboy finally gets it. He’s actually not gonna blame young black men for their own deaths because they were sagging… or black violence… or single black mothers.

Report Shows White Cops Killed A Black Person Twice A Week For Years

{Nearly two times a week in the United States, a white police officer killed a black person}<hyperlink=”https://bossip.com/951237/eff-yo-hashtag-trending-topic-mynypd-goes-left-fast-as-black-twitter-commandeers-it-to-highlight-police-brutality-43081/”> during a seven-year period ending in 2012, according to the most recent accounts of justifiable homicide reported to the FBI.

Via {USA Today}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/police-killings-data/14060357/”> reports:

On average, there were 96 such incidents among at least 400 police killings each year that were reported to the FBI by local police. The numbers appear to show that the shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., last Saturday was not an isolated event in American policing.

The reports show that 18% of the blacks killed during those seven years were under age 21, compared to 8.7% of whites. The victim in Ferguson was 18-year-old Michael Brown. Police have yet to identify the officer who shot him; witnesses have said the officer was white.

While the racial analysis is striking, the database it’s based on has been long considered flawed and largely incomplete. The killings are self-reported by law enforcement and not all police departments participate so the database undercounts the actual number of deaths. Plus, the numbers are not audited after they are submitted to the FBI and the statistics on “justifiable” homicides have conflicted with independent measures of fatalities at the hands of police.

About 750 agencies contribute to the database, a fraction of the 17,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States.

University of South Carolina criminologist Geoff Alpert, who has long studied police use of deadly force, said the FBI’s limited database underscores a gaping hole in the nation’s understanding of how often local police take a life on America’s streets — and under what circumstances.

”There is no national database for this type of information, and that is so crazy,” said Alpert. “We’ve been trying for years, but nobody wanted to fund it and the (police) departments didn’t want it. They were concerned with their image and liability. They don’t want to bother with it.”

Alpert said the database can confirm that a death has occurred but is good for little else.

“I’ve looked at records in hundreds of departments,” Alpert said, “and it is very rare that you find someone saying, ‘Oh, gosh, we used excessive force.’ In 98.9% of the cases, they are stamped as justified and sent along.”

Despite those flaws, the FBI records remain the most complete nationwide accounting of people killed by the police.

The International Association of Chiefs of Police, the nation’s largest group of police officials, has maintained that police use of force is rare. Citing data gathered by the Bureau of Justices Statistics in 2008, the IACP said less than 2% of the 40 million people who had contact with police reported the use of force or threatened use of force.

“In large part, the public perception of police use of force is framed and influenced by the media depictions which present unrealistic and often outlandish representations of law enforcement and the policing profession,” the group said in a 2012 report.

And in a written statement Thursday, IACP President Yost Zakhary said the group “remains committed to studying police use of force issues.”

But University of Nebraska criminologist Samuel Walker, who has conducted extensive research on police force issues, called the lack of a national repository tracking such incidents a “major failure” of the criminal justice system.

That doesn’t mean that all incidents have escaped scrutiny. In addition to federal and state prosecutions of individual officers, seven U.S. police departments have been the subject of reviews by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division in the wake of fatal police shootings since 2010, according to Justice records.

Just days after {Mike Brown}<hyperlink=”https://bossip.com/1014558/st-louis-police-delay-releasing-name-of-mike-brown-shooter/”> was shot multiple times by police in Ferguson, an unarmed California man has been killed by authorities.

{KTLA reports}<hyperlink=”http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/”>:

Family members said Tuesday that a 25-year-old man was complying with police orders when he was fatally shot by LAPD officers in the Florence neighborhood South Los Angeles.

Patrol officers had “conducted an investigative stop” in the 200 block of 65th Street, and “during the stop a struggle ensued” and police opened fire, an LAPD news release issued midmorning Tuesday stated.

The man was transported to a hospital where he underwent surgery, according to Officer Sara Faden, spokeswoman for the LAPD.

He later succumbed to his injuries, police confirmed.

Police were being tight-lipped with details about the incident because of a “gathering” at the scene of the shooting, Faden said.

A woman who said she was the deceased man’s mother identified him in a phone call to KTLA as Ezell Ford.

“My heart is so heavy,” Tritobia Ford said in an interview Tuesday evening. “My son was a good kid. He didn’t deserve to die the way he did.”

Her son was lying on the ground and complying with the officers’ commands when he was shot three times, Tritobia Ford said.

In the aftermath of the shooting, she said, police refused to inform her of where Ezell Ford was hospitalized.

An LAPD supervisor at the scene of the shooting was unaware of anyone being denied information, Faden said Tuesday.

The victim’s family members interviewed on camera at the scene of the shooting on Monday night supported Tritobia Ford’s account.

A man who did not give his name and identified himself only as a cousin of the victim described what he witnessed, saying he had been around the corner when the altercation first occurred.

“They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division, knows that — that this child has mental problems,” the man said.

“The excessive force … there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in the back while he’s laying down? No. Then when the mom comes, they don’t try to console her … they pull the billy clubs out.”

White On White Crime Just As Prevalent As Black On Black Crime

Can anyone shed light on the media’s fixation with so-called “Black on Black” homicide?

Via {Breaking Brown}<hyperlink=”http://breakingbrown.com/2014/03/white-on-white-crime-is-on-the-rise-so-wheres-the-outrage/”> reports:

Black on Black homicide has dropped from a high of {94% in the 1990s to 91.3% in 2012}<hyperlink=”https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf”>. This may not seem significant, until you realize that White on White homicide has risen during the same period.

In addition, if you listen to the likes of Fox News, Blacks are not only murdering each other, but they are killing off the White race in their spare time. However, statistics clearly show that while Blacks may be murdering each other, Whites are engaged in the same behavior.

James S. Robbins’ response to the Zimmerman trial uses FBI data to prove this fact. In his article, “White on Black Murder: Who Really is Killing Whom?” he states the following: According to the most recent (2011) FBI statistics, of the 2,695 murders in which the victim was black, 91% were committed by people of the same race. Odds are if the victim was wearing a hoodie, the perp was too. The same pattern of interracial violence holds for whites. 83 percent of white murders in 2011 were within-race killings, and only 14% were black on white. These data tell us that murder in America is decidedly not a matter of racial hatred.”

This misrepresentation about crime only breeds more unfounded fear of Black America. Whites are more likely to respond with fear to Blacks and respond with force, even when they are in no immediate danger themselves. The recent shootings of Jonathan Ferrell and Renisha McBride show the danger of being Black while seeking help. In both cases, they were k¡lled by frightened Whites.

There are intellectuals who are attempting to wake up White America such as Tim Wise, who points out to his fellow White Americans that they are more in danger of being killed by another White person than a Black Person. He delves specifically into this issue with his article “Nazis Can’t do Math Reflections of Racism Crime and the Illiteracy of Right Wing Statistical Analysis”.

In 2010, for instance, whites killed whites 3,252 times: 4.6 times more than the number of whites killed by blacks.

Why no generalized fear of white people then? Why assume that black-on-white murder (which occurs about one-fifth as often) somehow portends some larger social trend, while white-on-white murder is merely random, individual, and signifies nothing more important, socially, at all? Why? Because racists are racists, that’s why.

As if the racial slur wasn’t enough, Arenas added, “#AL ur like a #THOT in the club,lookn for attention what u said at trayvons rally #enoughisenough ur right were tired of u PRETENDING.”

If you don’t know … THOT is another term for ho. It appears Arenas took down the original attack, but he rips Sharpton for not showing up in St. Louis until the national media showed up there too.
