Mostly peaceful protesters in the St. Louis suburb, symbolically holding their hands in the air, were met with tear gas and smoke bombs fired so regularly that several reporters on scene noted it was hard to breathe. “Shit, shit,” shouted msnbc.com’s Trymaine Lee, as his network attempted to reach him amid an onslaught late in the evening. Stun grenades were fired, and police wearing camouflage fatigues and riot gear formed lines in the streets.

A group of at least {70 heavily armed SWAT officers}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/ferguson-protest-swat-team_n_5676690.html""> with armored vehicles responded to an apparently peaceful protest Wednesday afternoon and ordered the crowd to disperse, HuffPost’s Ryan J. Reilly reported. The sight of camouflaged officers training automatic weapons at unarmed civilians focused unprecedented attention on the increasing militarization of policing in America.

Reporters saw an {unidentified man screaming}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/huffington-post-reporter-arrested-ferguson_n_5676829.html""> for medical assistance in the back of a police truck. Police on the scene {ignored his cries for help}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/WesleyLowery/status/499718358817075200"">.

On Thursday afternoon, President Barack Obama addressed the situation in {remarks from Martha’s Vineyard}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/obama-ferguson_n_5678593.html?1408035771"">, where he is on vacation. He also weighed in on the topic of heavy-handed police tactics. “There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism and looting,” Obama said. “There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.”

He said he had asked the Department of Justice and the FBI to launch an investigation into Michael Brown’s death.

Shortly before Obama’s remarks, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced that he would be instituting changes in the way the Ferguson protests are policed, saying that that there would be new, “operational shifts” among officers.

At least two reporters were assaulted and detained by police, and {a St. Louis alderman was arrested}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/antonio-french_n_5677157.html""> for what police said was unlawful assembly.

Police slammed Lowery into a drink machine and pushed Reilly’s head against the glass on the way out of the restaurant.

“They essentially acted as a military force. It was incredible,” Reilly said.

Tear gas and rubber bullets were fired in the proximity of a crew from the TV network Al Jazeera America. In a {statement}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/mlcalderone/status/499906107926917121"">, the network said that “Al Jazeera is stunned by this egregious assault on freedom of the press that was clearly intended to have a chilling effect on our ability to cover this important story.”

Ferguson McDonald’s manager Keith Eyers, who has worked for the company for 34 years, was shaken after the clashes that unfolded Wednesday evening in front of him and his staff.

“It’s just a terrible thing what happened,” he said later. “It’s a bad thing. It’s just not good...It’s a rough time but I really think the city will get through it and make it stronger.”

Support for the arrested reporters came from quarters as diverse as the Department of Justice and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). “Just want to praise @WesleyLowery and [Ryan Reilly] for their dedication in bringing us the stories from Ferguson.

Ryan Reilly, the justice correspondent for The Huffington Post, and Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery were working in a McDonald’s when a SWAT team suddenly invaded the restaurant. After being told to stop recording the proceedings, and refusing, both men were then violently arrested. (Recording police officers {is a legal act}<hyperlink=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/13/6000833/you-have-a-right-to-record-the-police"">.) Lowery was shoved into a soda machine.

Reilly and Lowery were released shortly after news of their arrest broke.

He said that police ordered him to stop filming them, and that, when his bag fell off his shoulders, they suddenly seized him and accused him of resisting arrest, even though his hands were behind his back. That, he said, made him “more afraid than of the tear gas and rubber bullets.”

Later, Lowery had this exchange:

“I hope you’re happy with yourself,” one officer told me. And I responded: “This story’s going to get out there. It’s going to be on the front page of The Washington Post tomorrow.”
And he said, “Yeah, well, you’re going to be in my jail cell tonight.”

Speaking to MSNBC, Reilly told a similar story. He said that the officers “essentially acted as a military force.”

HuffPost,huff3,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/ferguson-eddie-boyd_n_5682454.html,Ferguson Hired Officer With History Of Allegedly Hitting Children,Matt Sledge,08/19/14,09/28/16,"He resigned from St. Louis city police under a cloud of suspicion. Missouri tried to make sure he couldn’t walk the beat. But one officer with a history of allegations of hitting children found a willing employer in the Ferguson Police Department.

The saga of Eddie Boyd III underlines the troubles surrounding Ferguson’s tiny police force, which has been engulfed in controversy ever since one of its officers shot 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9.

In a city where the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a white cop has revealed profound racial tensions, Boyd’s story represents an anomaly: he is one of just three African-American police officers in a department of 53.

But that doesn’t mean he’s an exception in other ways. Citing Boyd {and other examples}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html”>, critics claim that Ferguson and the St. Louis area in general have serious problems with police accountability.

“Americans love a second chance,” said Matthew Devoti, a civil rights lawyer who represented one teen in a failed lawsuit against Boyd. “The question, I guess, is ‘When is enough, enough?’”

In the city of St. Louis, the complaints against Boyd started rolling in nearly a decade ago, not long after he left the police academy. The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department’s internal affairs division investigated two allegations of physical abuse against children in 2004 and 2005 but did not sustain them, meaning that the investigation did not reveal sufficient evidence to support the allegations.

Internal affairs did sustain the third serious complaint against Boyd, however. In April 2006, Boyd got into an argument with 12-year-old Jerica Thornton while following the girl and her brother home from school, according to a judge’s summary of the investigation.

After a verbal altercation turned physical, Boyd tackled the brother to the ground. When Jerica came to his aid, Boyd struck her in the head with his gun.

Boyd later claimed that he had pistol-whipped the girl “accidentally.” Internal affairs disagreed, recommending that Boyd be dropped from the department’s rolls.

But instead of firing him, in November 2006, the St. Louis police demoted Boyd to the status of a probationary police officer. They also apparently failed to give him additional supervision — a mistake that would cost them.

The trouble started in April 2007, when a fight erupted outside Sumner High School and freshman Christopher Dixon took off running. He wasn’t a part of the fight, but he was afraid he would be arrested anyway, according to his testimony in a deposition.

Responding to a call, Boyd came upon Dixon leaving the scene. He said in a deposition that he tried to detain Dixon, but he slipped and “inadvertently” hit the boy in the face with his handcuffs.

Dixon offered a different version of events. He claimed that as he left the scene, Boyd drove up in his car and pointed his gun. “Freeze, if you move, I’ll shoot,” he shouted, according to Dixon. Boyd then left the car and suddenly whipped his gun across Dixon’s nose and left eye.

“I moved my hand from my face,” Dixon said. “I just saw blood just pouring out of my face.”

When backup came, he overheard two other officers talking about Boyd as though the incident had “happened before or something.”

“They just kept saying, ‘Boyd again?’” Dixon said.

Doctor glued Dixon’s nose back together and gave him stitches. Boyd resigned from the force.

“Just didn’t feel like dealing with the red tape and bureaucracy,” he said in the deposition, when asked why he resigned.

The St. Louis police, for their part, did not seem sad to see Boyd go. They refused to pay for his defense in Dixon’s ensuing lawsuit.

Meanwhile, in January 2008, the state’s public safety department began the lengthy process of petitioning to have Boyd’s police officer license revoked, {citing both the Dixon and the Thornton cases}<hyperlink=”http://168.166.15.111/DataTier/Documents/Repository/0/0/4/3/55b7bf38-6314-49ef-8ea6-7a8d4a2f8024.tif”>. An administrative judge {ruled against Boyd in October 2009}<hyperlink=”http://168.166.15.111/DataTier/Documents/Repository/0/0/9/6/428f8876-3476-4ea5-a124-9261d7f08495.rtf”>.

In 2010, the St. Louis city police — also a defendant in Dixon’s lawsuit — settled with the teen for $35,000. Dixon had sued them for allegedly failing to supervise Boyd despite his probationary status.

Boyd, on the other hand, hashed it out with Dixon in court. The two-day trial in July 2010 hinged on whether Boyd used too much force and an exchange during the teenager’s deposition about whether Boyd had “intended” to hit him. Dixon said in the deposition that he didn’t know if Boyd had intended to strike him in the face, but in a later affidavit he said that he believed that Boyd intended to strike him somewhere. The vagueness in the first statement was enough to lead to Boyd’s acquittal.

Vindicated by the jury, Boyd succeeded in stopping the state’s effort to revoke his license in August 2010. He also sued the St. Louis police for the roughly $65,000 in legal costs he had racked up. The case was settled out of court.

After leaving the St. Louis city police in 2007, Boyd worked as an officer for the small suburb of St. Ann. Sometime between July 2009 and December 2010, he became an officer in Ferguson.

Ferguson Police spokesman Tim Zoll declined to comment on Boyd’s hiring, calling it “an internal matter.”

Despite the lawsuit, Ferguson may have had a simple motivation in hiring Boyd. Speaking generally, St. Louis University law professor Roger Goldman said departments save money on training by hiring officers who are already licensed.

“Why are you willing to overlook that previous misconduct?” he asked. “You might not have that much money.”

Goldman said this happens in “case after case,” particularly in “an area like St. Louis, where you’ve got something like 55 departments.”

“It’s called the ‘muni shuffle,’” he said.

If Ferguson was hoping to save money on Boyd’s training, it might wind up spending more in the end. The city is currently defending another lawsuit against Boyd.

It began with a wild car chase in January 2011. Eugene McAllister III, 16, {was riding in a stolen Dodge Stratus}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-county-teen-charged-in-police-chase-from-january/article_3a8bc66c-6236-11e0-925b-0019bb30f31a.html”>. From the back seat of the speeding car, he shot off at least one round at the cops from a Smith and Wesson revolver. The chase ended when the car’s tires were damaged.

In {a handwritten complaint}<hyperlink=”http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/mcallister-complaint.pdf”> that he filed in March on his own behalf in federal court, McAllister alleges that Boyd, by then a Ferguson officer, beat him.

McAllister claims that after the car was stopped, officers converged on the car, smashed in its windows, and attacked him.

In striking resemblance to eyewitness accounts of the Michael Brown shooting, McAllister says that he raised his hands above his head and repeatedly shouted “I give up!”

Boyd then allegedly beat McAllister “over and over.”

Attorney Peter Dunne, who is representing Boyd on behalf of Ferguson, told HuffPost that Boyd has had “zero” disciplinary problems since joining the Ferguson police force. Boyd was the recipient of an award in 2012 for his actions in a separate pursuit and shooting.

“We’ve denied the allegations that have been brought against him and we’re looking forward to the matter being exonerated when he’s finally tried,” Dunne said.

Unlike Brown, McAllister survived his encounter with a Ferguson police officer. He is currently serving a 20-year sentence for the incident at the South Central Correctional Center in Licking, Missouri.",150,2000,NA,NA

HuffPost,huff5,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/ferguson-rise-poverty_n_5689124.html,Poor Population In Ferguson Doubled In A Decade: Study (How To Help),Eleanor Goldberg,08/19/14,09/29/16,"Since a white officer shot and killed an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri, more than a week ago, the small town has been rocked by contentious clashes, and its roots stretch much further beyond the events of Aug. 9.

The exact details of that night remain unclear, but the reason for the latest flare up is fairly understandable, experts say. Over a period of three years, {Ferguson’s poverty rate doubled}<hyperlink=”http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/the-avenue/posts/2014/08/15-ferguson-suburban-poverty#.U-5z7Ce2biq.twitter”>, a devastating figure that inevitably leads to poorer education and health outcomes, and higher crime rates — and a system incapable of effectively thwarting these outcomes, according to a recent Brookings study.

On Aug. 9, Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, after police say {he was injured in a scuffle with the teen}<hyperlink-”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/michael-brown-autopsy_n_5686672.html”>. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

A preliminary autopsy report concluded that {Brown was shot at least six times}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/michael-brown-autopsy_n_5686672.html”>, the Associated Press reports.

The {streets soon erupted in riots}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/michael-brown-family-autopsy_n_5687898.html#498_un-chief-calls-on-us-to-ensure-rights-to-peaceful-assembly-are-protected”> in the immediate aftermath and even peaceful protests didn’t stand a chance. Tensions continued to pick up over the weekend after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon imposed a curfew.

But even before Brown was shot and killed, Ferguson had already become a breeding ground for such senseless deaths to occur.

Taking a look at how the city plummeted so rapidly into suburban poverty is key to understanding why.

Between 2000 and 2010-2012, Ferguson’s poor population doubled. By the end of that period, about one in four residents lived below the federal poverty line, according to the Brookings study.

The city’s {unemployment rate rose from less than 5 percent in 2000 to over 13 percent}<hyperlink=”http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/the-avenue/posts/2014/08/15-ferguson-suburban-poverty#.U-5z7Ce2biq.twitter”> between 2010 and 2012.

For residents who had secured employment, inflation-adjusted average earnings fell by one-third. The number of households relying on federal Housing Choice Vouchers jumped from roughly 300 in 2000 to more than 800 by the end of the decade.

So what happens when a once predominantly white suburb evolves into a community heavily populated by minorities struggling to get by? The power structures need to adapt to the drastically changing demographic.

But in Ferguson, they haven’t.

This all began when an unarmed, black teenager was gunned down by a police officer in broad daylight. Although we do not know all of the details, we have been at this moment far too many times before, and sadly the death of Mike Brown feels all too familiar.

We cannot live in the past, but history can give us perspective to move forward constructively. The only way to stop this vicious cycle is to change the mentality of the perpetrators and the reaction by the community. Police in general get a bad rap, and the vast majority are good, loyal souls. But their training and the institutional mentality they come from often leads to a warped perspective of how they function within communities that they do not live in. If we are to truly create a solution to this long-ignored problem, we must demand that every police department in America mandate sensitivity training for their officers. Lack of empathy from authority creates pessimism that engulfs a community. This is the heart of the issue. This makes the “us” versus “them” mentality more apparent, changing the notion of “protect and serve” to something more similar to “search and destroy.” Our ideas of acceptance begin to fit into a small worldview, unable or unwilling to understand the unfamiliar. The kids in baggy shorts become an “other,” police clueless to the fact that hip-hop had crossed continents and infiltrated the suburbs decades ago. Their understanding of who the “bad guy” is or might be is dictated by an institution that is completely disconnected from the community it is ordered to serve. When a Ferguson police department have 53 officers, and only three are black, in a city that is 65 percent African-American, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to do that math.

These protests don’t occur in a vacuum by some “animals” filled with random hatred. I certainly don’t condone any violent behavior or destruction of property, but this anger comes from somewhere. Built over years because of the lack of trust between police departments and black communities since the formation of this nation. When the first response by police is to show their military muscle, this overblown reaction actually encourages more dissent, because it reaffirms the thought that they are not on “our” side. If the police won’t look out for us, who will?

The job of a police officer is difficult, this much I know. But, excessive force and the lack of cultural awareness, like bringing K-9s to a protest of black people, make the work of police officers even more difficult. Sensitivity training teaches the officers that the citizens are not the enemy. The community must also receive training on how to deal with the police, as the relationship is broken from both sides.

As I write this, the governor of Missouri decided to put a different captain in charge tonight, an African-American from the state police, a native to Ferguson, who when speaking to the crowd tonight said, “I am a black man with black sons... This is personal.” He left the armored vehicles and gas canisters at the station. There are no dogs, no rubber bullets and loud noises. And thus far, there is peace in the streets and people are allowed to exercise their first amendment right without any threat by the police. This is the way forward.

If we are to evolve to a better place in America, and arrive at a day that a family never has to lay their child to rest, we must demand that police departments make drastic changes to the way they approach our community. We failed far too many for far too long, and the death of Mike Brown is evidence of that. In his memory, let us fix this problem now.",NA,350,NA,NA

HuffPost,huff10,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-r-tyler/the-lessons-of-ferguson-m_b_5689080.html,"The Lessons of Ferguson, Missouri: Teachable Moments About Policing",Tom R. Tyler,08/18/14,09/29/16,"Ferguson represents another step in the escalating failure of the “broken windows” view of crime that has gained ascendancy during the past generation. Under this approach, the police seek to maintain order by focusing upon arresting those who are committing minor crimes. This justifies the widespread practice of repeatedly stopping, questioning, frisking and often detaining and arresting members of the community, in particular the African-American community, and leads to the same type of hostility toward police officers that has become so visible in New York City in recent years. Worse yet, it seems the police in cities like Ferguson have moved beyond the original broken windows model which focuses upon arresting people committing life-style crimes and have dropped any pretext of stopping only those who are actually involved in criminal activity. Instead the police repeatedly stop innocent community residents on the streets to create feelings of fear, which they believe deters criminal behavior. Why is this bad?

First, because these practices have been shown not to lower the rate of crime. My {research}<hyperlink=”http://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/tax-policy/files/LTW/police_stops_and_legitimacy_january_22_2014.pdf”> and that of other social scientists shows that a key factor shaping whether people obey the law is whether they view it as legitimate, i.e. whether they trust the law and legal authorities. Studies of the police in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Oakland all indicate that whether people break the law and commit crimes is more strongly shaped by whether people trust the police than by whether people believe that they are likely to be caught and punished if they break the law. Distrust also makes controlling crime more difficult because it lowers the willingness of community members to help the police solve crimes or identify criminals. Rather than working with the police the public either takes the law into its own hands or acquiesces to victimization leading to the types of social disorder the police were created to prevent.

Sadly therefore, the police are creating the crime they seek to control by alienating large segments of the minority community. In addition, the police are undermining the trust that is needed to hopefully prevent and if necessary respond to tragic events, such as the shooting of Michael Brown. The police need to be given the benefit of the doubt to be able to do their jobs, but without trust people question police motives and are suspicious of seemingly reasonable requests, such as giving the police time to conduct an investigation. In the absence of trust events of this type too often devolve into riots. Lacking faith in the intentions of the authorities people give in to expressions of frustration and anger.

How can the police build trust? I have conducted a number of studies of popular legitimacy which examine why people do or do not trust the police in their community. These studies consistently show that the most important issue to public evaluations of the police is whether they believe that the police are exercising their authority fairly. This means that they are not making decisions about who to stop based upon race; that they are willing to listen to people when they stop them; apply the law consistently and without prejudice and take time to explain the reasons for their actions. Most importantly, the police need to treat people in the community respectfully and with courtesy. When the police do these things they build trust. In other words, we know how the police can build trust in communities, White or minority. If people see the police acting with justice, they respond with trust.

Of course, there are limits, and even respectful treatment gives way to distrust in the face of repeated stops when people are not engaged in wrongdoing. Two facts emerge from empirical research on the impact of policies involving widespread street stops. First, such stop, question and frisk policies increase crime by undermining police legitimacy. Jeffrey Fagan and I {recently studied young men}<hyperlink=”http://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/tax-policy/files/LTW/police_stops_and_legitimacy_january_22_2014.pdf”> in New York City and found that those who mistrusted the police were twice as likely to be engaged in criminal activity. Second they increase hostility and lead to a greater likelihood of conflict when the police deal with community members on the street and when the community reacts to police actions such as the Brown shooting. Such anger produces precisely the type of unrest so visible in Ferguson. As so many of the marchers in that community have suggested, if people do not experience justice when they deal with the police, there will be no peace.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Still, community members have “expressed gratitude” that McDonald’s has stayed open to serve them throughout the conflict, company spokesperson Lisa McComb said.

“We’ll continue to monitor the situation and adjust operational hours accordingly, with a focus on the safety of our employees and customers,” McComb said.

McDonald’s has to walk a careful line in Ferguson between providing a space for protesters and protecting customers trying to avoid the unrest and grab a meal, said Chris Bernardo, the founder of Commercial District Services, a company that manages public spaces.

It’s a little hard to tell whether we should be glad that McDonald’s is serving a useful public cause, or utterly depressed that traditional meeting places like libraries and local sandwich shops have been replaced by a corporate behemoths like McDonald’s and Starbucks.

“When a McDonald’s is becoming your primary gathering place, that might suggest that there’s a shortage of appropriate public spaces that allow for people to exercise their First Amendment rights,” Bernardo said.

When the public spaces are overrun with a heavily militarized police force, perhaps we should be glad for an alternative.",7,260,NA,NA

A county police tactical operations armored vehicle was deployed at the demonstration site for most of the night.
Protected by body armor, police sat atop the vehicle methodically fitting high-caliber automatic weapons into tripods which were then trained on the crowd.
...Wesley Lowery, a reporter with the Washington Post, was arrested Wednesday evening along with Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, according to a Twitter post by Lowery.
He wrote that police came into the McDonald’s on West Florissant where the two were working, and tried “to kick everyone out.”
“Officers decided we weren’t leaving McDonald’s quickly enough, shouldn’t have been taping them,” he tweeted.
“Officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking me to walk out of,” he wrote.
He said that he was detained, booked, “given answers to no questions. Then just let out.”
Reilly tweeted that a SWAT team invaded the McDonald’s where he was working and recharging his phone, and asked for identification when he took a photo. They tried to kick everyone out, he wrote. He wrote that he was “assaulted” by an officer.

When American journalists are detained and assaulted by militarized American police who deem even people in McDonald’s as a dire threat to a city’s security, this country sends a dangerous message to other nations. The Huffington Post’s Christine Conneta’s tweet, {“Just got his with tear gas, hard to see or breath,”}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/huffington-post-reporter-arrested-ferguson_n_5676829.html”> and Wesley Lowery’s tweet, {“But the residents have not been “rioting.” It just isn’t true.

Nobody is arguing that people shouldn’t riot or that protests shouldn’t end at some point in the day. Common sense, however, should dictate that journalists eating a Big Mac aren’t rioting or looting, nor should they be arrested and assaulted in the name of safety. Also, armored vehicles and riot police are needed when rioting is taking place to end mayhem, but keeping these forces within the city to intimidate a peaceful citizens is another story.

As stated by Todd C. Frankel in The Washington Post, {“Maybe it was how police reacted to what initially was a peaceful memorial service for Brown...Maybe the crowd sensed police weren’t taking their concerns seriously.”}<hyperlink=”http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/08/12/why-the-police-shooting-riots-in-ferguson-mo-had-little-to-do-with-ferguson/”> What if the police chief had attended the memorial service to show some semblance of solidarity with the family and some level of empathy? Would this have done more to prevent violence and deflate tensions? Doing so would have showed the community that real amends were being made for a tragedy, whether or not the police officer was justified in shooting Michael Brown, an unarmed young black man.

All of this hurts the United State’s ability to condemn Russia and other countries for targeting journalists, suppressing the free flow of information, intimidating local populations, imposing harsh tactics upon the majority of peaceful citizens because of the actions of a few miscreants, and other ways to describe the events at Ferguson. A 2012 Guardian {article}<hyperlink=”http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/11/putin-win-russian-free-press?guni=Article:in%20body%20link”> describes a Russian society where journalists risk their lives with every story:

In 2011, three journalists dead (including newspaper editor Khadzhimurad Kamalov, shot 14 times as he left his office). In 2010, two killed; in 2009, five more (including a young reporter from Novaya Gazeta, caught in a hail of bullets). Add four for 2008, one in 2007 and then 2006 as Anna Politkovskaya, the most famous victim of them all, is murdered. But she wouldn’t forget Yevgeny Gerasimenko - found in his Saratov flat with a plastic bag pulled over his head and computer missing - and nor should we.
Two Russian journalists died in 2005, and three in both 2004 and 2003; but 2002 was a wicked year, with eight lost (including Valery Ivanov, battling editor, shot in the head) and 2001 added another victim. Putin’s reign of power in 2000 began with six dead reporters and editors: a grim portent, looking back, of bad things to come.
There are other countries in the world where journalists repeatedly perish in the course of duty, to be sure: Pakistan, Afghanistan, Colombia, Mexico. And Russia has terrorists and rebellions of its own to deal with as well. But the drip, drip, drip of journalists’ blood, year in and year out, crimes scantily investigated and rarely brought to any conclusion, is still deeply dismaying.

No, the events at Ferguson don’t make the U.S. another despotic regime intent on silencing critics, but do you think Vladimir Putin cares? How about politicians in Mexico, Columbia, Nigeria and countries around the world where journalists risk their lives to write a story of events that people in power might not appreciate? The truth is American journalists were assaulted and detained in an American city and when this happens, along with the overly militarized response to an overwhelmingly peaceful protest, the world correlates our advocacy for democratic ideals with our deeds.

As stated by Ryan J. Reilly, {“This cop ignored over a dozen of my requests for his name or badge number”}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/499870873147699200”> and {“After slamming my head on the door, he sarcastically apologized,”}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/499870873147699200”> there’s something wrong in our democracy when law and order come before the rights of citizens. When the people who are supposed to protect you are instead assaulting you in the name of security, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Il, Robert Mugabe, Omar Hassan Al Bashir, and every other despot in the world say, “See, America does what it has to do to keep order, so will we.” It doesn’t matter that Ferguson is nothing like North Korea and the police force there doesn’t normally target journalists. What matters is Vladimir Putin and despots around the world just read, {“Apparently, in America, in 2014, police can manhandle you, take you into custody, put you in cell & then open the door like it didn’t happen”}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/WesleyLowery/status/499725487078641665”> and thinks one thing: “America is full of a bunch of hypocrites, let’s target anyone we want.”",0,NA,NA,NA

It has also touched off debates throughout the United States on racial harassment by the police and the increasing militarization of ordinary law enforcement after 9/11. Those conversations are important ones for Americans to have. Lost in the discussion, however, has been the role guns played in creating the environment of hostility between police and communities like Ferguson.

The problems of racial harassment and police militarization are exacerbated by the fact that America has a heavily-armed civilian population. While there are no official totals, there are an estimated 320 million guns in the United States, approximately one per person. It is often said that America has a gun culture, one that some celebrate and others bemoan. Whatever one’s personal views about guns, there is no denying their presence in every American city, from Philadelphia to Ferguson. Nor should we fail to recognize the profound impact this has on law enforcement.

“The problems of racial harassment and police militarization are exacerbated by the fact that America has a heavily-armed civilian population.”

Because there are so many guns out there, police officers are trained to live in fear of the very people they are supposed to protect and serve. Anytime a police officer pulls over a car, he or she must worry that the person inside that car will have a gun that could be turned on them. At training academies throughout the nation, new recruits are taught that cop-killers need two things: a will to kill and an opportunity to act. There’s little an officer can do about will; anyone can have it without anyone else knowing. Officers can, however, limit the opportunities for a cop-killer to act by being prepared and quick to defend themselves.

In many police departments, the training involves the use of high-tech video simulations that put prospective officers in real-life situations where they’ll have to decide whether to use force. A recruit will be shown a video of an encounter, shot from the point of view of the officer. In one, an officer will approach a vehicle pulled over for speeding when suddenly the driver pulls a gun and shoots. In another, an officer responding to a report of an armed robbery will enter a store when a potential suspect approaches and unexpectedly pulls what could be a gun out of his back pocket, only this time the gun is a wallet. The training is designed to prepare officers for a career on streets where a lot of people are armed and police have to make split-second decisions about the use of force. Police are trained, in other words, to be on edge.

The facts of the Brown shooting remain murky but the protests are motivated by a larger pattern: harassment of minorities by police. Communities of color know well that edgy cops and racial prejudice can be a dangerous brew. While inexcusable, racial stereotypes are predictably part of policing. Cops are taught to mistrust for self-protection, yet the vast majority of civilians they encounter are peaceful. It is little surprise that officers often fall back on racial or other stereotypes when faced with the difficult task of quickly determining who is a threat. Officers look for shortcuts to simplify high-pressure decisions. Such stereotypes are often misleading, reflecting the officer’s biases especially in matters of race. They also endanger officers who lower their guard against people who don’t fit the stereotypes and threaten civilians who do fit them.

“It is little surprise that officers often fall back on racial or other stereotypes when faced with the difficult task of quickly determining who is a threat.”

The Brown protests have also set off a debate about militarization of the police since 9/11. That militarization is partially a result of our heavily-armed civilian population. The armored vehicles that have become the symbol of militarization are being purchased by law enforcement agencies to protect officers against gunfire. Police are equipping themselves with a variety of high-powered firearms because they feel outgunned by the criminals they have to defend themselves against. For some Americans, a high-powered weapon is just a fun toy to use at the gun range. For police officers, it is a threat that must be taken seriously.

As guns are part of the source of these law enforcement problems, no doubt some will suggest that gun regulation must also be part of the solution. Universal background checks, for example, can help keep guns out of the hands of those people who are more likely to threaten officers and other civilians. Restricting unusually high-powered weaponry reduces the need for the police to have even more powerful weapons for protection. Gun control, however, is no panacea and we should be realistic about what can be accomplished. This is not just a political question - whether the votes are there to support new laws - but a practical one. With so many guns already in circulation, police officers will not stop worrying about being shot and killed anytime soon.

Americans strongly support civilian gun ownership, and the right to keep and bear arms is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. There are some benefits to having this right, including the ability of people to defend themselves from criminals. Yet the shooting in Ferguson should also be cause to recognize how a heavily-armed civilian population adversely impacts policing and our communities.",NA,1300,NA,NA

HuffPost,huff16,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nusrat-choudhury/ferguson-is-everytown-usa_b_5689547.html,"Ferguson Is Everytown, U.S.A.",Nusrat Choudhury,08/18/14,10/05/16,"The tragic killing of college-bound teenager Michael Brown has raised questions about the frequency with which police kill unarmed black men in America. The answer, unfortunately, is far too often.

Just three months ago, on a warm April afternoon, a white police officer shot and killed Dontre Hamilton, a 31-year-old black man, in downtown Milwaukee’s Red Arrow Park. According to the Milwaukee police chief, the officer was “{defending himself in a violent situation}<hyperlink=”http://fox6now.com/2014/05/05/witness-account-of-officer-involved-shooting-is-very-different-from-police-account/”>.” But the eyewitness report of a Starbucks barista paints a very different picture.

{According to the barista}<hyperlink=”http://occupyriverwest.com/us/why-was-dontre-killed”>, Hamilton had been sleeping on the concrete sidewalk next to Starbucks when two police officers approached him, asked him questions, and left after determining that he was doing nothing wrong. But an hour or so later, she heard yelling. Looking out the Starbucks window, she saw a different white police officer standing up against Hamilton, “who was holding the officer’s own baton in a defense posture.” The officer “lunged” at Hamilton in an attempt to get the baton, but failed. The barista watched in horror as the officer stood 10 feet away from Hamilton, pulled out a gun, and shot Hamilton 10 times in quick succession without issuing any verbal warnings. The barista reports that she never saw Hamilton hit the officer with the baton.

The tragic killing of Hamilton bears a striking — and deeply troubling — resemblance to the killing of Michael Brown, who was shot by an officer six times, including twice in the head, after being stopped for walking down the middle of a street. Including Hamilton and Brown, at least six black men were shot and killed by police since April in circumstances that suggest the unjustified use of excessive force and possible racial profiling.

In July, Eric Garner was killed in New York by officers who {placed him in a chokehold}<hyperlink=”http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/staten-island-da-man-death-nypd-chokehold-article-1.1871946”> — a banned tactic — and slammed his head into a sidewalk during an attempt to arrest him for allegedly selling illegal cigarettes.

In early August, police in Beavercreek, Ohio, fatally shot John Crawford III in a Walmart, where Crawford had been holding a BB gun that he had picked up on a store shelf.

Just days after the killing of Brown, Ezell Ford was killed by police on a Los Angeles sidewalk during an investigative stop. While police contend that officers opened fire after a “struggle,” Ford’s mother {reports}<hyperlink=”http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/”> that he was lying on the ground complying with the officers’ order when he was shot three times in the back.

And the very next day, pressman Dante Parker {was killed}<hyperlink=”http://www.vvdailypress.com/article/20140813/NEWS/140819920”> in Victorville, California, after being repeatedly shocked with a stun gun by police attempting to arrest him as a suspect in a nearby robbery. Apparently, police suspected him because he was riding a bicycle, and the robbery suspect was reported to have fled on a bike.

The stories of these six people make one thing painfully clear: The killing of black men in incidents that begin as investigatory police stops are anything but unusual in America. In this sense, Ferguson is Everytown, U.S.A.

There is a reason for this. More than 240 years of slavery and 90 years of legal segregation in this country have created a legacy of racialized policing. Killings and beatings lie at one end of a spectrum in which black people ­— and young black men in particular — are routinely stigmatized, humiliated, and harassed as targets for police stops, frisks, and searches, even when they are doing nothing wrong.

The numbers show the reality.

Studies of {Rhode Island}<hyperlink=”http://www.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/content/20140116-new-study-shows-racial-disparities-in-rhode-island-traffic-stops.ece#study”> traffic stops and {New York}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/07/11/nyregion/20100711-stop-and-frisk.html”> pedestrian stops confirm that police stop blacks at higher rates than whites. Even more troubling is that the New York study determined that a {neighborhood’s racial composition}<hyperlink=”https://ccrjustice.org/files/Expert_Report_JeffreyFagan.pdf”> was the main factor for determining NYPD stop rates, above and beyond the “role of crime, social conditions, or the allocation of police resources.” In other words, New York cops targeted blacks because of their race — not because they happened to live in a dangerous place or in an area flooded by police.

Data from Ferguson mirror these racial disparities. Last year, blacks not only accounted for 86 percent of stops, 92 percent of searches, and 93 percent of arrests by Ferguson police, the state attorney general’s office calculated that blacks {were overrepresented}<hyperlink=”http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf”> in these encounters in light of their population figures. Even more damning is the fact that although police were twice as likely to search blacks than whites after initiating a stop, whites were far more likely to be found with contraband.

It is not a leap to conclude that the same biases that cause those racial disparities also make it more likely that black men will die during the course of police arrests. According to the {Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics}<hyperlink=”http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ard0309st.pdf”>, although black men made up only 27.8 percent of all persons arrested from 2003-2009, they made up 31.8 percent of all persons who died in the course of arrest, and the majority of these deaths were homicides.

Why does racialized policing persist despite the end of slavery and Jim Crow? While explicit racial bias may be less prominent today (albeit anything but eliminated), implicit racial biases plague all of us, including those charged with keeping our streets safe. A large body of compelling research has demonstrated how these unconscious, automatically activated, and pervasive mental processes translate into action with devastating consequences for black people.

In particular, researchers have well-documented shooter bias. One {video game study}<hyperlink=”http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/docs/SOTS-Implicit_Bias.pdf”> simulated the nearly instantaneous decisions made by police officers to shoot armed individuals and to refrain from shooting the unarmed. The study revealed that participants were more likely to shoot black people than white people in error.

Both explicit and implicit biases lead far too often to the killing of black men in police-civilian encounters. And they undergird the daily indignity and humiliation experienced by blacks who are stopped, questioned, and searched by police when they have done nothing wrong.

Police are sworn to serve and protect everyone equally, not disproportionately stop and harass only certain communities. Rather than express surprise and shock during a summer where six black men have been killed by police in highly questionable circumstances, it is up to us to do something.

The single most important first step is to provide {accountability}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform-racial-justice/joint-statement-action-promote-reform-and-stop-police-abuse”> — including through the Attorney General’s issuance of a comprehensive ban on racial profiling.

The Anonymous member “katanon” told HuffPost the group’s main goal was to bring more attention to the shooting.

“Personally, I would like nationwide protests and the issue to not be swept under the rug yet again,” the member said. “‘Just another dead black kid’ is getting very, very old.”

Anonymous has joined previous protests triggered by allegations of police brutality. In 2011, the group hacked {myBart.org}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2011/08/15/bart-anonymous-attack/”>, a website for San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit riders, and leaked personal information of users. The attack was in retaliation for a decision by BART to cut off underground cellphone service to shut down a protest against police violence.

Gabriella Coleman, a professor of anthropology at McGill University who studies Anonymous, said the group had largely been quiet over the past year.

“Anonymous has been on hiatus,” said Coleman, author of the forthcoming book Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: the Many Faces of Anonymous.

But Coleman said the group’s involvement in the Ferguson protests may signal the hacker collective is back — “at least for awhile.”

“They’ve gotten so much attention,” she said, “and that emboldens them.”",330,5900,NA,NA

Goodman,08/15/14,10/05/16,"The primary causes of inner-city poverty don’t make for good television, nor do they translate to concise political talking points. For this reason, conservative pundits and politicians focus on simple explanations to a riddle that most sociologists have spent their entire lives trying to solve. Sparked by the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed young black man, the current unrest in Ferguson is primarily the result of nationwide economic neglect and disinterest toward overwhelmingly African-American areas of the country.

In an attempt to narrow down volumes of research into one emotional charged sound bite, Bill O’Reilly {once declared}<hyperlink=”http://www.billoreilly.com/site/rd?satype=13&said=12&url=%2Fnewslettercolumn%3Fpid%3D43010”>, “If you really want poor black children to have a better shot in life, why not send a three-word text to Jay-Z: ‘Knock it off!’” Like O’Reilly, Rep.

Will manufacturing jobs return to the inner cities and would unemployment decrease? While simplifying the plight of urban citizens to the sexual habits of teenage mothers or Beyoncé’s latest album appeases the conscience of Republican voters, a closer and more thoughtful examination exposes the real causes of inner-city poverty.

People like Rep. Ryan would benefit from reading the research of the University of Wisconsin’s Center for Economic Development. While he’s quick to bemoan a “tailspin of culture,” the Wisconsin congressman fails to address the economic tailspin of inner-city residents within his home state. According to Marc V. Levine, director for the {Center for Economic Development}<hyperlink=”http://www4.uwm.edu/ced/publications/black-employment_2012.pdf”> at the University of Wisconsin, certain social structures and employment trends affecting black citizens are the primary reason for inner city joblessness:

For black Milwaukee, even before the Great Recession of 2007, there had already been over two decades of a “stealth depression”... Perhaps no statistic better epitomizes the severity of Milwaukee’s black male employment crisis: by 2010, barely more than half of African American males in their prime working years were employed, compared to 85 percent almost forty years ago... Thus, as manufacturing employment in Milwaukee declined, or shifted to suburbs that were generally inaccessible to Milwaukee’s blacks in a highly segregated metropolis, or as black males were displaced to some extent by other ethnic groups in manufacturing employment, the overall black male employment rate in metro Milwaukee plunged.

According to the statement above, the loss of manufacturing jobs experienced by the black citizens of Milwaukee is a travesty that began long before Beyoncé and other hip-hop stars were even born. Also, if Bill O’Reilly can find data indicating that single mothers caused the “stealth depression” faced by black males in Milwaukee, or that these women caused the close to 50 percent unemployment of black males, then there could be some basis for his constant pontification. Moreover, the University of Wisconsin study {goes on to state that}<hyperlink=”http://www4.uwm.edu/ced/publications/black-employment_2012.pdf”>, “In metro Milwaukee, all of the region’s net job growth since the1980s has occurred in the suburbs, where few working-age black males live and where transportation links between the central city and suburban jobs are poor (and increasingly facing service cutbacks).” Not only have black males suffered high unemployment rates in the nation’s largest metropolitan areas, but they also suffer the lowest employment rates in Milwaukee-while the suburbs have seen the all the job growth. 

As for the financial strain imposed upon the U.S. by inner-city welfare recipients, the rhetoric blaming these urban centers for immense government debt doesn’t correlate with fact. David T. Ellwood, dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, {explains that}<hyperlink=”http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc121b.pdf”> “less than 10 percent of welfare recipients live in big-city ghettos, so the bulk of the welfare problem cannot be attributed to the demoralizing effects of these communities.” In Elwood’s “The origins of “dependency”: Choices, confidence, or culture?” the Harvard professor {explains}<hyperlink=”http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc121b.pdf”> that not only do inner cities represent a small portion of the federal welfare budget, but they face extreme levels of social ills:

Ghettos are disastrous places to live. The worst problems of the society are found in very disproportionate numbers there. The ethnographic literature leaves no doubt about the desperation one finds there. Therefore the ghetto, while not a huge part of the welfare problem, is nonetheless a major social problem, and one about which information is sporadic and somewhat inconsistent.

Not only is it unfair to blame single mothers for America’s budgetary problems, it’s also unrealistic to claim that these women and other inner-city citizens are the cause of their own problems. Also, the racist euphemism of “welfare queen” first uttered by Ronal Reagan is not only offensive; it simply isn’t rooted in economic realty.

As illustrated by the depth and scope of research within this area of sociology, serious attempts at investigating inner-city poverty don’t sound like an episode of O’Reilly’s radio show or a Paul Ryan interview. According to sociologists, there are a variety of factors far more relevant than culture or single parent households when explaining the state of our inner cities. First, the definition of “inner city” states nothing about young women or rap lyrics. Harvard’s Michael E. Porter defines inner cities as “core urban areas that are economically depressed” accounting for 7 percent of the U.S. population (within the 100 largest inner cities). These regions of the U.S. have a minority population of 81 percent while also facing an unemployment rate of over 20 percent. The national average currently is 6.2 percent. Second, because of the concentration of an overwhelmingly minority population, high unemployment, and social isolation from more affluent areas, these regions suffer from the effects of segregation. According to Michael B. Teitz and Karen Chapple of the University of California, Berkley, inner-city poverty is a {direct consequence of economic segregation}<hyperlink=”http://www.huduser.org/periodicals/cityscpe/vol3num3/article3.pdf”>:

Segregation itself causes poverty because it increases, by as much as 33 percent, the probability that a young black man does not work (Massey et al., 1991). If segregation were to decrease, so would the poverty rate, the high school dropout rate, and the homicide rate (Galster and Keeney, 1988; Galster, 1991b; Peterson and Krivo, 1993). In fact, recent research has shown that as little as a 1-standard-deviation decrease in segregation would eliminate one-third of the black-white differences in life experiences, such as dropping out of high school, lacking a job, or becoming a single parent (Cutler and Glaeser,1997).

Conservatives should address the statement: “If segregation were to decrease, so would the poverty rate, the high school dropout rate, and the homicide rate.” This direct link to poverty — a link that is far more relevant to unemployment and crime — is rarely mentioned by radio pundits extolling the virtues of marriage.

Finally, in a 2008 National Institute of Health study, titled “The International Child Poverty Gap: Does Demography Matter?,” Patrick Heuveline and Matthew Weinshenker dispel the notion that marriage alone will cure poverty. {As stated in their study}<hyperlink=”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831375/”>, “We conclude that high child poverty in the United States is not primarily driven by the prevalence of single mother-headed families.” They also explain that although the children of single mother households indeed face higher poverty rates, these economic conditions are the result of a variety of factors and can’t simply be blamed on the mother.

Rather than pandering to the passions of conservative voters and television viewers by blaming teenage mothers (who chose life rather than an abortion), Republicans should explain poverty using more words than “single mother” and “culture.” The unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, a town with 75 percent African-American citizens and {double the poverty rate}<hyperlink=”http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/08/12/why-the-police-shooting-riots-in-ferguson-mo-had-little-to-do-with-ferguson/”> of Missouri, is a testament to the economic segregation faced by black citizens.",NA,260,NA,NA

The American Society of News Editors (ASNE) {said}<hyperlink=”http://asne.org/blog_home.asp?Display=1743”> Thursday that it is “especially disturbed by the events taking place this week in Ferguson” and called on the US Department of Justice to take action.

“From the beginning of this situation, the police have made conscious decisions to restrict information and images coming from Ferguson,” ASNE President David Boardman said, adding that he believes that police attempts to silence the media and violate press freedom will be unsuccessful.

“For every reporter they arrest, every image they block, every citizen they censor, another will still write, photograph and speak,” he said.

The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the intimidation methods being used against journalists, including tear gas and rubber bullets.

“We are concerned by the detention and harassment of reporters trying to cover the news in Ferguson,” CPJ’s deputy director Robert Mahoney said. “Journalists have a right to work freely on the streets of any American city, and authorities in Ferguson have a duty to ensure that they can do so there too.”

The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press {called}<hyperlink=”http://rcfp.org/reporters-committee-statement-arrest-journalists-ferguson”> the actions that took place Wednesday night “unthinkable.”

“The unwarranted arrest of reporters from The Washington Post and Huffington Post in Ferguson, Mo., last night is outrageous and unacceptable in a nation that cherishes a free press,” Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press executive director Bruce D. Brown said.

The National Association of Hispanic Journalists {added}<hyperlink=”http://nahj.org/nahj-condemns-reporter-arrests/”> that the situation in Ferguson is “unacceptable.”

“The constitution protects journalists to do their job without government or police interference,” , NAHJ president Mekahlo Medina said. “This is unacceptable and as journalists and Americans, we deserve better.

“I write to express our strong objections to the actions of your police officers for the unwarranted arrest and detention of Ryan Reilly and Wesley Lowery,” General Counsel Mickey H.

CNN’s Don Lemon is one of them, but even before he arrived in Ferguson on Thursday, the host spoke out on air about the clashes between police and a community outraged by the killing of Michael Brown.

“This is about people not realizing that there is a double standard that people live in a different world,” {Lemon said last Monday}<hyperlink=”http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1408/11/cnr.05.html”>. “And, quite frankly, for white people to realize that black people, especially black men, are treated differently. It is a double standard. Until people realize that, nothing is going to change. Nothing is going to happen.”

On Monday, Lemon spoke to The Huffington Post about what it’s like to be a black journalist covering the aftermath of Brown’s death.

“I’m a journalist first and foremost and I have an obligation to report the facts and report the truth,” he said. “But every journalist is a human being. I am a journalist, I am an American and I am a man of color who lives in America and so, there are times in my reporting where I can give a point of view coming from my experience.”

He also stressed that as a journalist, he “cannot be biased” and must give others the opportunity to disagree with him.

On Monday, Lemon’s coverage included interviews with the president of Black Lawyers for Justice, as well as a protester demonstrating in support of the police. Still, he said that allegations of bias have come “from both sides,” and described the situation in Ferguson as being “tough” to cover because race is at the heart of it.

It is not the first time he has had to cover the killing of a black teenager and the subsequent response by the police. When asked about similar cases, including the {trials of George Zimmerman}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/13/george-zimmerman-not-guilty_n_3588743.html”> and {Michael Dunn}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/15/michael-dunn-verdict_n_4796068.html”>, Lemon observed a “disconnect between law enforcement and men of color,” and “to a certain extent, between whites and blacks in this country.”

“The only way that we are going to bridge that divide is if we stop judging each other when we talk about it, and for people to stop saying, ‘If you speak about this issue, you are race-baiting,’” Lemon offered. “You have to call people out on certain occasions, but you also have to allow them to speak to understand where they’re coming from.”

Besides clashing with residents in Ferguson, police have also { threatened}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/police-threaten-reporters-ferguson_n_5686674.html”> and {arrested journalists }<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/reporters-arrested-ferguson-ryan-reilly-wesley-lowery_n_5676841.html”>in town to cover the story. Lemon was not targeted by police, but recalled one encounter with officers. He said that he went to speak with Captain Ron Johnson and was greeted “as suspicious” by off-duty officers at the command center, until Johnson instructed for Lemon and his colleagues to be let in.

“There’s a difference between someone who gets it, like Captain Johnson... [and how] local police departments operate and treat people, not only African-Africans, but most people — as if they are immediately in a position of power to do whatever they want to do with you,” Lemon said.

“It’s especially different with African-Americans and especially different with men,” he added. “I can’t imagine being a person who grows up in this community and feeling like you are occupied or being intimidated by police officers.”

He went on to criticize people who have looted businesses.

“You’re distracting from the legacy of this young man, you’re distracting from the bigger issue of a police department who are disconnected from the people they’re supposed to protect and serve.”

The CNN host is no stranger to talking about race on air, and he has sparked plenty of controversy in the past. Last year, for example, he said that{ Bill O’Reilly had “a point” }<hyperlink=”http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/07/27/cnns_don_lemon_bill_oreillys_criticism_of_black_community_doesnt_go_far_enough.html”>when the Fox News host went on a rant about problems in the black community, and chimed in with five things he said people of color should be doing.

On Monday, he dismissed the criticism he received over the segment, and said that it had not led to any changes in the way he approached the Ferguson story, adding that it “says more about the consumer of that conversation and their assumptions.”

His comments, he said, had “nothing to do with racism” or “with what white people think of you. It has to do with what you think about yourself and what you can do to better yourself.”",246,1100,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff23,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/argus-radio-ferguson-protests_n_5679149.html,How Volunteer-Run Argus Radio Broadcast Ferguson Protests Live To The World,Michael Calderone,08/14/14,10/06/16,"NEW YORK — On Wednesday night, about half a million people watched online as a militarized police force in in Ferguson, Missouri, squared off with largely peaceful crowds protesting the killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown.

“We’ve just been told by the St. Louis Police Department to turn off our cameras,” said the voice on {KARG Argus Radio’s livestream broadcast}<hyperlink=”http://www.argusradio.com/”>. “We will not be turning off our cameras. We will continue to broadcast, even if it is at our own peril.”

That voice belonged to Mustafa Hussein, a political science student who volunteers at the small, urban music station based in nearby Maplewood.

Hussein told The Huffington Post that Argus Radio, which launched online a year ago and is run by five volunteers, recently purchased video equipment so it could livestream concerts. But the station decided to use the equipment for the first time Wednesday to cover the interaction between police and protesters, which it was worried local affiliates would not continue to cover through the night.

For several days, protesters in Ferguson have been demanding answers to why a police officer shot and killed Brown last week. The police response to protests intensified Wednesday night, with heavily armed SWAT teams {shooting tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-protests-police-response_n_5677741.html”>.

Hussein filmed the confrontation, operating the camera alone on foot even as he ran from the tear gas and projectiles. Some local affiliates also provided streaming coverage online, but TV satellite trucks did not have Hussein’s ability to maneuver around police roadblocks. Hussein managed to get ground-level footage that major cable networks didn’t have, and both CNN and MSNBC aired his footage throughout the day Thursday.

Police on Wednesday night also cracked down hard on the press, on several occasions trying to prevent journalists from recording their actions. Police {arrested}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/reporters-arrested-ferguson-ryan-reilly-wesley-lowery_n_5676841.html?utm_hp_ref=media”> The Huffington Post’s Ryan Reilly and The Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery, and objected to the reporters recording them or asking for their names and badge numbers.

Hussein, who is working on his master’s degree with a focus on constitutional law at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said police may not be “intentionally infringing upon the constitutional rights of protesters.”

“There is a longstanding history in this county of the officers themselves being uneducated on what the constitutional rights of civilians are,” he said.

Hussein said he is physically fine, despite being “hit in the back with a canister or something.” But the station’s camera was damaged, and Argus Radio is now {seeking donations}<hyperlink=”http://www.gofundme.com/d0cerw”> for a new one.

As many as half a million people simultaneously watched Wednesday night’s livestream, and about 1.2 million people in total watched it, Hussein said. This included several thousand still viewing the footage Thursday afternoon.

Argus Radio did not run into server problems, despite the uptick in web traffic — but the station will have to borrow a camera to continue the livestream it has dubbed “I am Mike Brown Live from Ferguson, MO.”

“The reason we named it Mike Brown is because that is the sentiment of the community,” Hussein said. “Every person who lives in that community feels that they could be the next Mike Brown. Their children could be the next Mike Brown. Since Mike Brown’s voice was taken from him, we are the voice of Mike Brown.”",1,590,NA,NA

Le Monde, a leading French newspaper, called the Michael Brown case {the “affair that’s shaken the U.S.”}<hyperlink=”http://www.lemonde.fr/ameriques/article/2014/08/14/meurtre-de-michael-brown-tout-comprendre-de-l-affaire-qui-secoue-l-amerique_4471464_3222.html”> on its landing page. Even the normally sober BBC gave its social media roundup post on the ongoing crisis a jarring headline: “From Ferguson to ‘Fergustan.’”

The BBC later changed that to the comparatively tame “{Military tactics in ‘US war zone.’}<hyperlink=”http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-28782308”>“

As numerous social media users and commentators pointed out, the world was watching as one part of the U.S. began to resemble, per the BBC and {a Toronto Star report}<hyperlink=”http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/08/14/teens_shooting_shows_simmering_tension_between_police_community.html”>, a “warzone.”

International condemnation of American violence at home isn’t something new. It pops up each time there’s a widely publicized shooting, as commentators race {to note}<hyperlink=”http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/14/america-mass-murder-australia-gun-control-saves-lives”> that the U.S. has looser gun laws than most other industrialized Western economies.

But the Ferguson chaos offered international observers the kind of American crisis they haven’t seen for decades. The scenes of police in paramilitary gear, unarmed protesters with their hands up and civilians being subjected to tear gas — which is {banned in international warfare}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6001995/ferguson-missouri-tear-gas-painful”> — have made news around the globe.

Well-meaning as they are, the expressions of solidarity are also surreal: Citizens of some of the world’s poorest countries are now in a position to pity and advise those in its richest. As the Post noted, Palestinian journalist Mariam Barghouti tweeted a series of tips on how to deal with tear gas based on her own experience in the West Bank. Using the popular hashtag #Ferguson, she suggested ways for protesters to clean off their faces. She also pointed out that the Ferguson police used American-made tear gas just as Israel has in Palestine.

To some observers on social media, the entire situation seemed more Middle Eastern than American. The hashtag #Fergustan spread to suggest that similarity, the eerie blurring of lines between U.S. battlefields and the U.S. homeland — right down to weaponry — that RT identified with its {“Iraq? Afghanistan?” headline}<hyperlink=”https://www.dropbox.com/s/oqq0dsal3xao1nl/Screenshot%202014-08-15%2011.07.46.png”>. Jeremy Scahill, a national security correspondent for The Nation and The Intercept, took the #Fergustan idea one step further:

[tweetbegin 499963366493147136 tweetend]

But that logic irked other social media users. Adding “-stan” to the name of an American town to emphasize its chaos implies this kind of violence is the norm in those countries whose names end in -stan, they pointed out. Straightforwardly acknowledging that this violence has happened in the U.S., they suggest, is the only way to address its root causes.

When you joke about “Fergustan”, you attach police state identity to other places. We need to accept this is our identity too. {#Ferguson}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ferguson?src=hash”>

From digital activism that echoes local demands for police accountability, to the humbling bravery of Black bloggers that have traveled to Ferguson to speak truth to power—the open Internet is a critical battleground where Black communities can connect across geographic lines, fight media misrepresentation, and oppose the police violence we find in every city, in our own voices.

From Truth to Power: Fighting Anti-Black Brutality in a Digital Age

#Ferguson, and moments like this one that lay this nation’s greatest contradictions at our feet, is the reason a new generation of African American change-makers are demanding that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reclassify the Internet as a common carrier service. Too often, our lives depend on our ability to tell stories of the abuse of power, without interference from corporate gatekeepers.

As the people of Ferguson join the ranks of cities across the country raising their hands in civil disobedience against the systemic abuse of Black bodies by law enforcement agencies, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is considering {network neutrality}<hyperlink=”http://www.internetvoices.org/voices-faq”> rules that would force Black Twitter and Black blogs to enter the conversation on police brutality through a digital “poor door”; their content tracked into a digital slow lane by expedient, piecemeal regulation that lets the largest Internet Service Providers (ISPs) discriminate through a pay-to-play scheme called paid prioritization.

I would ask you to imagine the impact of an Internet with the legal right to discriminate; if you’re Black, though, I think you already know. Black cable isn’t bringing the story of police brutality in Ferguson to your kitchen table, {the Black Internet}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/black-twitter-a-virtual-community-ready-to-hashtag-out-a-response-to-cultural-issues/2014/01/20/41ddacf6-7ec5-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84_story.html”> is.

A New Generation of Civil Rights Leaders

Black bloggers, photojournalists, digital organizers, and citizen journalists are a new generation of civil rights leaders. Reminiscent of the Freedom Summer activists who put their bodies on the line fifty years ago to defend the Black right to vote, these strategic griots and community storytellers are a critical line of defense as increasing police violence, mass incarceration, environment disaster, and economic corruption devastate Black communities. Building off the incredible leadership of the legacy civil rights community, these 21st century change-makers are using the open Internet to shine sunlight in the darkened corners where anti-Black violence thrives. We need them to tell our stories, and they need a fully non-discriminatory Internet to do it.

In fact, Black Twitter is quickly becoming a major driver of {civil rights activism}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/11/black-twitter-civil-rights_n_4940473.html”> in the 21st century, bringing a necessary dialogue about the systematic murder of African Americans by police and their proxies to the national political stage, using the open Internet.

When a juror in the Trayvon Martin case sought to capitalize on the suffering of Martin’s family by securing a book deal, {Black Twitter pushed back}<hyperlink=”http://www.buzzfeed.com/shani/the-secret-power-of-black-twitter#1vomikb”> and the deal was DOA, real quick.

When first-degree murder charges against the killer of Jordan Davis were dismissed earlier this year, communities used the {#DangerousBlackKids}<hyperlink=”http://thegrio.com/2014/02/18/dangerousblackkids-black-twitter-challenges-the-criminalization-of-black-youth/”> hashtag to challenge the blanket stereotypes and criminalization of Black children. Again, the Internet gave voice to those without a cable outlet or newspaper to speak for them.

Black Twitter used the funny and yet deadly serious hashtag #APHeadlines to {hold the Associated Press accountable}<hyperlink=”http://madamenoire.com/456149/apheadlines-black-twitter-clowns-the-associated-press-after-biased-renisha-mcbride-tweet/”> when it posted what many considered a racially charged tweet about the conviction of Theodore Wafer for the murder of Black Detroit teenager, Renisha McBride.

And, most recently, Black Twitter gave Tyler Atkins, an eighteen-year-old Black teenager from Houston, the space to use the hashtag {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=”http://www.theroot.com/blogs/the_grapevine/2014/08/_iftheygunnedmedown_shows_how_black_people_are_portrayed_in_mainstream_media.html”>, to protest against what he saw as misleading photographs used by the media following the murder of Ferguson’s Michael Brown.

Twitter, the company, isn’t responsible for the Black genius blossoming online. Black Twitter is backed and fueled by the hundreds of independent and emerging Black blogs that turned to the open Internet to bypass patterns of misrepresentation and exclusion of Black people in mainstream cable and print news. They’re flexing their digital muscles to help the nation, and the world see, that racism is still alive and well.

Black netroots activist websites like {ColorofChange.org}<hyperlink=”http://www.colorofchange.org/”> acknowledge our voices and give us more ears, allowing a wider audience to hear what has been said by Black communities for centuries, and is now hosted on Tumblr: {#BlackLivesMatter}<hyperlink=”http://blacklivesmatter.tumblr.com/”>.

Together, Black social media, blogs, websites and our digital allies give Black communities the means to bypass a discriminatory press that seems to hunt even our dead bodies down.

As Ferguson police {block journalists}<hyperlink=”http://groupthink.jezebel.com/hands-up-in-ferguson-journalists-blocked-from-reportin-1620050191”> from reporting at the scene, even mainstream news has had to rely on the open Internet to report on the heinous attacks by police against Ferguson residents.

An Open Internet for #Ferguson

The truth is, the debate over the Internet pales in comparison to the suffering in Ferguson. As a Black person living in at time of escalating white American vigilantism, I am more concerned with living than with communicating. But anti-Black police violence thrives in the absence of a watchdog, making the fight to keep the Internet open a 21st century civil rights issue that no one should ignore.

I hate it, though. This isn’t the first time Black communities across the United States have mourned and fought back as police or proxy violence ended the lives of people that could have been, or were, members of our families; and it won’t be the last. I hate how often we are forced to be witnesses to the murders of our kin. But, I need a platform that let’s me see it. We all do. Media audiences need the clear and cogent analysis of an emerging Black digital voice to remind us that even as we are surely attacked, we are not alone. On the open Internet, our movement for change finds both witnesses and partners, across the lines that divide.

Still, some think we shouldn’t do everything possible to protect the Open Internet from the predatory schemes of big ISPs. I disagree. I think we should protect Black independent digital voices, by any means necessary.

Fists Up for Black Voices

Instead of siding with ISPs, 100% of which are led by white CEO’s, perhaps we would would do better to consider tech policies that strengthen the Black blogosphere, Black organizations, and Black communities. Reclassifying broadband, and ensuring strong network neutrality rules, would do just that.

#Ferguson is why Black people need a truly open Internet, and so is every city is which the extermination of Black life is considered routine. As my brothers and sisters in Ferguson raise hands in the air, saying “don’t shoot”, I’ll keep my Black power fist raised along with them; both in homage to their survival, and in thanks to the Black bloggers and ordinary people who’s voices are bringing us the story when MSNBC and other mainstream media outlets can’t, or won’t.

The “small content providers” of the Black Internet will lose if the FCC allows pay for play deals instead of a level digital playing field. And they aren’t the only ones. We all lose when evidence of brutality, stories of resistance, and stakeholder voices are tracked into a digital slow lane.

Invisibility is a price Black communities can’t afford to pay.

Luckily, at least until the FCC makes a decision to either reclassify broadband and ensure the open Internet remains a viable platform for independent Black voices to communicate, or turns the web into a highly lucrative playground for ISPs, we have the digital voices of the Black blogosphere and independent Black outlets to guide us through the storm.

Our Black “netroots” nation deserves our greatest thanks. Black leaders should support them by fighting like hell for the strongest possible protections against broadband discrimination; not the most expedient, halfway measures money can buy.

The shooting of teenager Mike Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri has mutated from a tragic local killing to a national crisis. The Ferguson police, operating with incompetence worthy of the film Police Academy and the aggression of an occupying army have turned a possible criminal act by a cop into a human rights crisis in America’s heartland. Activists and organizations from Al Sharpton and the ACLU to new NAACP president Cornell Brooks {descended upon the town}<hyperlink=”http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/11/naacp-hosts-public-meeting-in-wake-of-shooting/13887011/”> to express outrage, call for justice and fight for solutions. While it helps for many of these civil rights organizations to be at ground zero, what would really make a big impact on Ferguson and other cities in racial strife should happen back in Washington DC. If the NAACP and other civil rights organizations really care about justice, accountability and activism, they’ll change their bizarre stance on net neutrality. We would never know what was going on in Ferguson without a free and open Internet and for some reason the NAACP is fighting to shut that down.

Let’s step back a few weeks. On July 18, Michael Brown was still alive, Darren Wilson was patrolling the streets like a white Eddie Walker, and the most important national story out of the St. Louis metro area was whether {Michael Sam}<hyperlink=”http://tbo.com/sports/bucs/nfl-holding-players-to-higher-standard-20140720/”> could make the Tony Dungy All-Star squad. What escaped the attention of all but a few tech media was that on that day the NAACP, the National Action Network, the Urban League, 100 Black Men, the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators, the Council of Korean Americans, Rainbow PUSH and about a dozen other civil rights organizations filed a brief to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) basically begging to end net neutrality.

What does net neutrality have to do with Ferguson, Missouri? Everything. Net neutrality means all content on the Internet has to be treated equally. So your Mom’s blog about her Florida vacation loads at the same rate as when you binge watch House of Cards. In January, the U.S. appeals court ruled that big Internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast could {charge different rates}<hyperlink=”http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304049704579320500441593462”> to different content providers online. Which means now an ISP could charge Netflix or Twitter more to make them run “faster” and content providers who aren’t willing to pay may load content slower, or lose the ability entirely. This is not just some doomsday conspiracy theory either. Everyone from Amazon, Ebay, Linked In, Kickstarter, Google and even Twitter have warned the FCC that ending net neutrality will block content, stifle debate, harm citizen journalism and pretty much {screw up the Internet}<hyperlink=”http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/05/08/amazon-facebook-google-microsoft-twitter-others-band-together-defend-net-neutrality/”>.

Which brings us back to Ferguson. Local and national civil rights groups were dependent on hashtag activism and social media to know what was really going on during those first violent nights of protest. While many cable networks covered the unrest like it was the “No Church in the Wild” {video}<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M37VucWh06Y”>, the real story on the ground was reported on Twitter and Vine by Ferguson Alderman {Antonio French}<hyperlink=”http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/who-is-antonio-french-the-alderman-providing-updates-from-ferguson/”>, {Yamiche Alcindor}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/16/ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-rally-protests/14160469/”> at USA Today, {Wesley Lowery}<hyperlink=”http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html”> at Washington Post, or {Ryan Reilly}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/huffington-post-reporter-arrested-ferguson_n_5676829.html”> at The Huffington Post. Not to mention organizations that dared to {livestream}<hyperlink=”http://new.livestream.com/timcast/events/3295551”> from Ferguson in the face of police harassment. This all happened in realtime, information, fact-checking and oversight provided almost instantaneously by equally supported tweets, vines, posts and livestreams. If net neutrality ends we could see an end to that type of reporting and information. Imagine if AT&T ran Twitter slower than Verizon? Would civil rights groups have known Ferguson police {were using tear gas}<hyperlink=”http://www.startribune.com/nation/271532291.html”> while claiming they were only using smoke bombs? What if Time Warner didn’t carry livestreams for nonprofit sites? What if some content was simply blocked by Comcast, do we ever find out what happened to journalists who were harassed by cops? Would America be better served by getting spoon-fed information about riots from a local police department that has lied, defied FOIA requests and {isn’t even trusted}<hyperlink=”http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/215336-doj-announces-feds-will-perform-second-autopsy-in-ferguson-case”> by the Department of Justice? When threats to Internet freedom happened in Turkey, Americans were {up in arms}<hyperlink=”http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister”>. The fact that we’re possibly months away from the same fate here should scare the apathy out of everyone in this country who is concerned about when the next three Ferguson’s might happen.

This all begs the question, why would the nation’s oldest, most influential civil rights organization side with Comcast, CenturyLink and Verizon over the tools of modern activism like Reddit, Tumbler, Facebook, and Twitter? Do they really believe the big telecoms will play fair on the {information superhighway}<hyperlink=”http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7521706977”>? Probably not, but a {few million dollars in donations}<hyperlink=”http://www.republicreport.org/2014/leading-civil-rights-groups-just-sold-out-on-net-neutrality/”> from AT&T has a way of changing even the most dedicated social justice organization. Let’s not pretend the NAACP can’t be bought. Just ask Donald Sterling. Telecom lobbyists know that the FCC listens to minority rights organizations, so with a few well-publicized donations here and there, Big Telecom knows some civil rights groups will fall all over themselves to destroy the Internet, the great equalizer in the battle for social justice.

There are literally dozens of things that will be coming in the aftermath of the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson. More civil rights lawsuits than you can count, a new police chief, and serious federal level discussions about the militarization of police. The NAACP will play a large role in those discussions and other organizations will follow their lead. No one can ignore the role the Internet plays in shining a light on the horrific tragedies perpetuated by Ferguson Missouri cops as they goose-step over the U.S. Constitution. Without a free and open Internet this would not happen. If these civil rights organizations truly care about the future of justice in this country, they MUST change their stance on net neutrality. To do otherwise is to admit that corporate dollars mean more than constitutional rights.",NA,450,NA,NA

“I’m about to fill up the back of my Suburban with a whole bunch of handguns and shotguns,” Walsh added. “Because of the rioting, everyone’s nervous up here now.”

The trouble in Ferguson appears to be sending area residents to the gun shops. “These are people who are in fear of their lives,” said Steven King, who owns Metro Shooting Supplies, a gun store and shooting range in Bridgeton, Missouri, about nine miles from Ferguson.

Metro Shooting Supplies has another location 35 miles away in Belleville, Illinois. Normally, King said, the shops do about the same amount in sales, but not this week.

According to King, the Bridgeton store on Wednesday did “eight times what our other store did. The day before that it was 10 times. To put it in perspective, the sales we’re seeing now are like what we see around Christmas time.”

King said his shop has sold shotguns, semi-automatic rifles and handguns for home defense and concealed carry. He said his customers have included families, single mothers, the elderly and other business owners. “They’re getting prepared, and it’s not that they’re vigilantes or something. They wouldn’t be doing this if they didn’t feel it was a life-or-death situation,” King said, adding that the store’s gun training classes are almost totally booked for the next six weeks.

Both stores refused to talk to HuffPost.

(RNS) On the fourth morning after Michael Brown’s death, residents from different parts of the region came together to pick up the pieces.

Some were young, some old. The majority arrived as part of the faithful. Others trickled in after spotting volunteers marching up and down West Florissant under the hot sun. Carrying brooms and large garbage bags, they collected whatever they could find: rubber bullets, broken glass, liquor bottles, tear gas grenades.

“I needed to come out today just to get some stability,” said Gary Park, 34, an auto mechanic who lives near the area in Ferguson where Brown was shot and protests erupted. Close by is the looted and burned QuikTrip that sits as a symbol of the severity of the unrest that resulted from an unnamed cop fatally shooting an unarmed 18-year-old.

“I wanted some encouragement,” Park said.

Park is a member of Passage Community Church in Florissant, which together with a few other local congregations, organized the Wednesday morning cleanup. Pastor Joe Costephens said that although the trash-collecting effort was a last-minute plan, more than 100 people joined the endeavor.

It was a simple act but not an insignificant one, especially since authorities reported two shootings only the night before. In fact, the continued violence has put future volunteer efforts on hold, Costephens said.

Elise Park, 31, a stay-at-home mom, arrived with her two young children who were excited by the novelty of using garbage pickers.

“I was very encouraged coming out here today, seeing all the groups helping,” Park said. “It’s an opportunity for me to invest and really become part of the community.”

Others, including a group of 20 somethings, came out to help on their own.

Larry Fellows, 28, of Ferguson, said that since the shooting he’s been doing what he can to spread a little cheer. Together with a group of friends, Fellows walks the neighborhood’s roads, handing out free water, snacks and cleaning supplies.

Fellows, who works for a health care company, said recent demonstrations aren’t just about the Michael Brown shooting.

“This has been building up for years,” he said.

He said he’s even offered supplies to police, but authorities rebuffed his offers.

Fellows believes that attitude is part of the reason the community remains angry.

“We’re the enemy.”

In an attempt to inspire compassion, another volunteer, Derrick Spencer of St. Louis, said he planned to return a sign to his truck’s windshield that recites a line from the New Testament: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”

“We can’t take justice into our own hands,” Spencer said. Those who loot businesses are doing so at the expense of Michael Brown, he said.

After working for two hours, nearly 20 people gathered in the parking lot of First Baptist Church in Ferguson and held hands in prayer. They prayed for the family of Michael Brown and for businesses in the area that have been damaged by the riots.

Michael Williams of St. Louis, who described himself as a troubled individual who had managed to reset his life, was among those in the crowd. He said he wanted to show that “everybody is not about the rioting. Everybody is not about the destruction.”

Williams said he knows there are good police officers out there. “Most of us believe in doing the right thing, but this came to a boiling point,” he said.",1,190,NA,NA

Meanwhile, police in Ferguson look like they’re armed for combat.

Egypt said it’s keeping a close eye on the whole thing. Here’s a translation of the full Arabic statement from Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

“In response to a question by the Middle East News Agency on the escalating protests in the city of Ferguson in the state of Missouri as a result of the killing of the young American Michael Brown by police:
The Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that we are closely following the escalation of protests and demonstrations in the city of Ferguson and the reactions to them. He pointed out U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s statements, which reflect the international community’s stance toward these events, especially what the secretary general mentioned in regard to restraint and respect for the right of assembly and peaceful expression of opinion and his hope that ongoing investigations shed light on the killing of the American youth and that justice will be enforced, in addition to him urging authorities to deal with the protests according to American and international standards.”

HuffPost,huff37,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-rather/history-and-ferguson-miss_b_5686252.html,"History and Ferguson, Missouri",Dan Rather,08/18/14,10/19/16,"As I watched with a sickening sense of deja vu the images coming out of Ferguson, Missouri this week, I couldn’t help but come to this conclusion: we have allowed a pernicious historical revisionism to undermine the legacy of the civil rights movement.

A half century ago, after covering datelines like Birmingham, Alabama and Oxford, Mississippi and men like Dr. Martin Luther King and Medgar Evers, I came to Washington as the CBS News White House Correspondent to report on the Johnson administration. Some of the successes from the front lines in the civil rights struggle I had covered as a field reporter were just being codified into groundbreaking legislation — the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. If you had asked me then what America would look like in 50 years, namely now in our present time, there were two vision I would never have believed. I never would have dreamed that we would elect an African American president. That seemed a leap forward that would take at least a century. On the other hand, I didn’t think we would see voting rights rolled back, de facto school resegregation in much of the nation, and scenes like we saw this week of an almost all-white police force in a majority African-American town facing off against peaceful marchers in military-style gear and heavy weaponry... But both President Obama and Ferguson, Missouri are the realities of race in 21st Century America.

I have wondered the last few days what Dr. King and his fellow leaders would have made of a nation of such seeming contradictions. I would never have the audacity to attempt to speak for Dr. King, but I think he would challenge us by saying something like, “you have achieved much but you only focused on half of my message.”

The way the civil rights movement largely lives in our national consciousness is that it was all about race. But that is only part of the story. It was as much about the powerful and the powerless. The rich and the poor. Those who have opportunity and those of whom the circumstances of birth allowed for very little reason for hope. In short, it is about true equality of opportunity for ALL Americans, or as close as is humanly possible to come to that.

I would respectfully suggest that we focus at looking at Ferguson, Missouri through a broader prism of civil rights. We don’t really know everything that took place during that tragic and fateful encounter between a young, unarmed black man and the police. Indeed that is part of the frustration. There needs to be a full and impartial investigation with deliberate speed. Yes, you have to see the scenes from Ferguson in the lens of race. The pictures and video capture well the differences in skin color between those marching and those holding the guns. But that is not the only divide. If somehow there was a camera that could capture life stories, you would see other lines of partition between those who hold the power in Ferguson and many of those marching. You would see divisions along economic lines, educational opportunities, access to health care, and so many others. We can and should debate policy in this country but we should not debate the facts of so much inequality. So debate the role of unions, but don’t debate that many workers are suffering with low pay and poor working conditions. Debate the role of charter schools and the Common Core, but do not debate whether there is inequality in our education system. Debate how to best deal with our immigration problems, but do not debate that millions of men, women, and children are living in the shadows amongst us.

Addressing these economic and social ills, which disproportionately affect communities of color, must be just as much a part of Dr. King’s legacy as racial equality. We remember and laud the march on Washington and the “I Have a Dream” speech, but at the time of Dr. King’s assassination, he was leading what was known as the “Poor Person’s Campaign.” He described it as “the beginning of a new co-operation, understanding, and a determination by poor people of all colors and backgrounds to assert and win their right to a decent life and respect for their culture and dignity.” (Emphasis mine).

Dr. King was vague about how he would have the country accomplish this. And whatever proposed solutions from that time would likely be dated today. That’s not the point. Ultimately civil rights is not a black-and-white issue, literally or figuratively. It’s about liberty and justice for all. With Ferguson, there are worthy discussions about race in America, and whether the police are too militarized. Yet we must see that even these important topics fit into a larger narrative. This nation has perilous fault lines between its citizens. Race is part of the story, but so too are questions of economic and social justice. Dr. King saw these divisions and worried about them. We must as well, if we care, really care, about what is to become of our country.",NA,1100,NA,NA

HuffPost,huff39,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/heather-ann-thompson/the-fury-in-ferguson_b_5668846.html,The Fury in Ferguson and Our Forgotten Lessons From History,Heather Ann Thompson,08/18/14,10/19/16,"August 9, 2014, was a summer day that began like any other. It was hot and humid. Chores had to be done. Errands had to be run. For 18-year-old Michael Brown the day was also just normal. He was enjoying finally being done with high school. He was supposed to go see his grandma. And, of course, there was always the possibility that at some point he would be stopped and hassled by the police since that seemed to happen to quite frequently to the young men in his neighborhood.

But at 2:15 p.m., the normalcy of Brown’s day was shattered when, on his way to visit his grandmother, not only did police officers stop him, but one of them also shot him multiple times. His hands, according to witnesses, were in the air.

Within 24 hours Brown’s overwhelmingly black and poor neighborhood near St. Louis, Missouri, had taken to the streets. People came out in droves to march together in protest of yet another police killing of a young black boy in America. As they marched the community’s pain was palpable — so many tears, so much anger, and so much bitterness. As Brown’s mother {tried desperately to explain}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/opinion/charles-blow-michael-brown-and-black-men.html?_r=0”> it to the media in the midst of her anguish, “Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Now many, because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they don’t got nothing to live for anyway. ‘They’re going to try to take me out anyway.’”

No, most of America does not seem to know. Indeed TV newscasters’ original sympathy for Michael Brown has already begun to sour — particularly as the peaceful protests to decry his killing have become more heated and passionate. Indeed, as community grief has understandably and inevitably turned to community rage, the media have not at all interpreted the growing frustration on the ground as either desperate outrage or forgivable fury. Reporters see only troublemakers and looters — people who need to calm down and take the time to work through the system to get their grievances addressed. As {ABC news}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/US/vandalism-looting-reported-vigil-missouri-man-killed-cop/story?id=24923516”> pointed out as police began pouring into Brown’s neighborhood in the wake of his killing, the officers were there “to keep the situation under control,” which, it noted, also “entailed bringing police dogs in to the area.”

And, so, seemingly overnight, the police who had been the bad guys in Ferguson are, now, the possible good guys — the ones merely trying to keep the peace, the ones simply trying to keep violence under control. In short order this might not be a story about an officer who shot an unarmed teenager to death; it will instead be a story about the {“fucking animals”}<hyperlink=”http://colorlines.com/archives/2014/08/police_officer_calls_ferguson_protestors_animals.html”> in this community.

Sadly, tragically, incredibly, we have been here before and, clearly, we learned absolutely nothing. Fifty years ago, almost exactly this week, the black residents of {Harlem erupted}<hyperlink=”http://crdl.usg.edu/events/ny_race_riots/?Welcome&Welcome”> when 15-year-old James {Powell was shot}<hyperlink=”https://urbanhistorians.wordpress.com/tag/alexander-elkins/”> and killed by a police Lieutenant in front of countless witnesses. Then, little more than a week later, {Rochester,}<hyperlink=”http://www.itvs.org/films/july-64”> New York, also exploded — this time after the police beating of 20-year-old Randy Manigault at a community dance.

And, then, there was Philadelphia. From August 28 to August 30, 1964, this city too was rocked by {massive protests}<hyperlink=”http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14176.html”>. And these too also led eventually to everything from looting to the lighting of fires. Yes, relentless police harassment and brutality is what initially ignited the rebellion there; but it was the deep-seated and smoldering anger at never-ending and relentless poverty along with precious few opportunities for children that kept it burning.

1964 was, of course, just the beginning. By 1968, and in the wake of yet another murder of a black man — this time the {shooting of Dr. King}<hyperlink=”http://www.amazon.com/April-1968-Martin-Changed-America/dp/0465012868”> on April 4, 1968 — this nation had witnessed more than 150 urban rebellions. Each and every one of these had originated in the fact that we had not yet really addressed, let alone fully censured and actually stopped, the physical and economic violence experienced by black people all across this country.

And, we still haven’t. Despite the crystal-clear conclusions drawn by the {Kerner Commission}<hyperlink=”http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6545/”> about why the ‘60s had seen so much urban unrest, and what would happen if we ignored the lessons of the these rebellions, we are right back where we were 50 years ago. As this Commission noted without equivocation: The urban rebellions of the 1960s stemmed from specific triggers such as police brutality and, more generally, because “discrimination and segregation have long permeated much of American life; they now threaten the future of every American.” Indeed, this group of experts warned, if this nation doesn’t “press for a national resolution” to discrimination, it will become “two Societies, One Black, One White — Separate and Unequal.”

These chickens have indeed come home to roost. If we don’t fully understand the fury in Ferguson, rather than dismiss it as senseless urban violence, and if we don’t move swiftly and concretely to ensure justice for the family of Michael Brown — making clear whose violence started this — then we are in for many more long, hot summers.

“It was a gesture of surrender to God. So we’re going to invite you to pray in this ancient prayer position this week, which happens to also be the position that some witnesses say that Michael Brown was in when he was shot.”

The posture, known as the ‘orans position’ is common in religious art and depicts a figure praying with outstretched arms. According to {Catholic Encyclopedia}<hyperlink=”http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11269a.htm”>, “The custom of praying in antiquity with outstretched, raised arms was common to both Jews and Gentiles.”

During the sermon, Thorne prayed for peace all over the world as well as for communities in the United States. “We surrender, but we do not give up hope,” she said.

From the use of riot gear designed to make police officers look more like soldiers than law enforcers, to the arrest of journalists, the blind tear gassing of protesters {including one state senator}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/state-senator-ferguson_n_5676766.html”> and the establishment of a no-fly zone over the region, Ferguson looks more like “Fergustan,” to use {Anupe Kaphle’s term}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/AnupKaphle/status/499299362082934784”>.

Ferguson and the Middle East do have one striking commonality, but it has less to do with armored vehicles in the streets than with the way in which the media assigns culpability to black and brown bodies for the violence perpetrated against them. The media’s criminalization of victims, and their subsequent degradation and dehumanization, is what Ferguson and the Middle East really have in common.

By drawing a further comparison between Ferguson and the Middle East, my intention is not to blur the unique oppression faced by African Americans in this country, nor compare distinct systems of oppression as they operate. However, the solidarity between Palestinians and protestors in Ferguson is worth noting, and speaks to not only a shared experience of oppression, but also a shared understanding that the media tends to back the claims of the oppressors in each of these situations. This occurs when the media begins to report Ferguson Police Department claims as absolute facts or when anchors parrot the Israel government’s rationale without criticism. When protestors in Ferguson hold up Palestinian flags or signs thanking Palestinians for their advice, they are acknowledging not only that both groups are working against their own respective systems of oppression, but also that the grievances of the oppressed receive far less air-time in the 24-hour news cycles than their oppressors’ rationale for their violence.

When media outlets do acknowledge the commonalities between Ferguson and Palestine or Syria or Iraq, they choose to focus on images of military power being used against civilians. However, this drive to compare the events in Ferguson with repressive governments abroad is disingenuous to the long history of militarized policing in the United States, especially within minority areas. Though police officers of the Civil Rights era {may have dressed in civilian clothes}<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/08/ferguson-police-face-civil-rights-protest-dressed-for-military-combat/375962/”>, the use of fire hoses to quell protesters in Birmingham represents the instinct to use asymmetrical force against a minority population in a thoroughly dehumanizing display, mirroring what we currently see in Ferguson.

It is absolutely valid to oppose the fact that the government funnels truckloads of surplus military equipment to police officers that have a far less stringent vetting process and generally work under less supervision than the soldiers that carry the same weapons. However, the focus on militarization in Ferguson and the comparisons to repressive regimes and governments abroad shifts the discourse away from the real problem of the racism that motivated the shooting of 18-year old Michael Brown, and towards what might (sadly) be a more broadly acceptable outrage.

Nearly everyone can agree that policemen rolling down a city street in an MRAP carrying machine guns is a terrifying scene, even if only {17 percent of whites compared to 70 percent of blacks}<hyperlink=”http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/22/white-people-believe-the-justice-system-is-color-blind-black-people-really-dont/”> believe that it is a “serious problem” that police “stop and question blacks far more often than whites” or that police “care more about crimes against whites than minorities.” The fact that Michael Brown’s name is omitted from many reports discussing Ferguson as the most recent and perhaps most prominent example of post-9/11 police militarization can be read as evidence that some writers are catering to white sensibilities and readers who fail to see the discrimination inherent in the US Criminal Justice system.

When Michael Brown’s name does appear in reports, more often than not, he is criminalized. {According to Rashad Robinson}<hyperlink=”http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/8/14/ferguson-media-iftheygunnedmedown.html”>, executive director of Color of Change, criminalization occurs when the media consciously or unconsciously creates a justification for why people of color are killed. Commentators have criticized the media’s use of a photo of Brown in a red jersey holding up what some viewers could interpret as a “gang sign,” rather than his high school graduation photo. Others have made the valid point that black victims {need not be college bound for their deaths to be tragic}<hyperlink=”http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/michael_brown_and_our_obsession_with_respectable_black_victims.html”>. But on August 15th, when police named Brown as a suspect in a robbery that occurred moments before his shooting, the media no longer needed to make a choice between photos to criminalize Brown. Rather than critique the {grainy surveillance photos}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/CNNJason/status/500282989482618880/photo/1”>, immediately headlines claimed “{Mike Brown Videotaped in Possible Store Robbery Ahead of Ferguson Shooting}<hyperlink=”http://www.ibtimes.com/mike-brown-videotaped-possible-store-robbery-ahead-ferguson-shooting-1659782”>,” a linguistic choice that may as well be an indictment.

The report that Brown was a suspect in the robbery is not even a “big-if-true” story. Michael Brown is dead and will never have the opportunity to defend himself in a court of law. Whether or not he stole a box of cigars would not merit his execution. Michael Brown shares the fate of Renisha McBride, Jordan Davis and Trayvon Martin, all black teenagers who were put on trial after their deaths, their behavior, personalities, and mental states scrutinized endlessly to justify why their assailants found them suspicious and thus, acceptable targets.

This same criminalization of victims is what links coverage of the events in Ferguson to the Middle East. The most recent and highly apparent example of media degradation of victims is the ongoing crisis in Gaza where Netanyahu’s dehumanizing description of Palestinian victims as {“telegenically dead”}<hyperlink=”http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-hamas-wants-telegenically-dead-palestinians/”> garners far less criticism than the Hamas charter or that Gazans voted terrorists into office. There are endless segments of reporters touring so-called “Hamas terror tunnels,” but little investigation into the claims by the {doctors treating patients in Gaza}<hyperlink=”http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/rania-khalek/israel-firing-experimental-weapons-gazas-civilians-say-doctors”> that the injuries of victims indicate the use of banned weapons such as dense inert metal explosives (DIME).

The horrifying Wall Street Journal op-ed by {Thane Rosenbaum}<hyperlink=”http://online.wsj.com/articles/thane-rosenbaum-civilian-casualties-in-gaza-1405970362”> claims civilian status is ambiguous in the context of Gaza, writing: “on some basic level, you forfeit your right to be called civilians when you freely elect members of a terrorist organization as statesmen, invite them to dinner with blood on their hands and allow them to set up shop in your living room as their base of operations.” Though the Rosenbaum piece did receive a fair amount of {criticism from mainstream sources}<hyperlink=”http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/07/23/the-most-vile-op-ed-you-will-read-about-gaza/”>, there does seem to be a level of dehumanization and victim blaming that the media is willing to endorse. As Deanna Othman {writes}<hyperlink=”http://www.suntimes.com/news/otherviews/28809686-452/where-are-the-voices-of-gazas-victims.html#.U-5NsPldVIM”>, “Anchors on CNN and MSNBC tout Israel as raising the standards of moral warfare, praising it for giving families 58-second warnings before demolishing their homes, reducing these people to stereotypes, equating all with Hamas — denying their humanity and legitimacy.”

While protesters in Ferguson with “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” signs are told “Well, don’t loot,” Gazans are told if they stop hiding rockets in their homes, Israel will not target civilian structures. Both of these responses assign blame to members of an underprivileged group for the attacks waged against them by police and military forces, not on the basis of any evidence of culpability, but on the basis of a shared identity. When news networks play endless footage of looting in Ferguson or the convenience store surveillance tape on loop or radical statements from Hamas leaders paired with the last election results, they create this notion that the victims of violence truly deserve what happened to them. If we are going to compare Ferguson to Palestine, two situations where the systems of oppression are unique and deserving of their own study and understanding, let’s focus on the ways in which the racism seeping through the media coverage of both events denies victims their humanity.",NA,190,NA,NA

The last thing a preacher wants to do on a Saturday night is to log into Facebook.

I exaggerate, of course, but I found myself scrambling last week when I learned of Michael Brown’s shooting last Saturday. My sermon for Sunday morning was ready to go. But I had to reassess all my work when I heard the witness of so many African American friends in particular as the news from Ferguson began spreading across social media. The frustration and disbelief, rage and disappointment, resignation and passion I heard moved me. But even more convicting was the fact that so many others were simply unaware of this event at the moment and unfazed by its repercussions.

In certain communities, no one had to pay attention to Michael Brown. In certain communities, his death did not resonate with significance. In certain communities, no one would confront the preacher and ask why she did not respond to the death of this young person.

And yet in other communities, his death was a touchstone, a cause for prayer and lament and righteous anger and faithful expectation.

These distinct reactions are a raw reminder that our communities of faith remain largely segregated. Though we worship the same God, the contexts within which we seek God’s face are radically different. In such a divided context, what does it look like to love your neighbor? What does it look like to be “one” church even as we are profoundly divided?

In Luke 15, Jesus weaves together three powerful parables. One is about a lost sheep, the second about a lost coin, the third about a lost son. We often read these stories as parables about God seeking us out, about God’s relentless love for the sinner. While this is certainly true, this is not the primary impetus for Jesus’ telling of these stories. Instead, he was motivated by the grumbling of certain authorities that Jesus shared meals with sinners and tax collectors. In short, Jesus was eating with “those” people, people we don’t actually value as children of God.

These parables are about those of us on the inside more than it is about those on the “outside.” The parables are about the “found” more than they are about the “lost.” In fact, it may be the “found” and “righteous” who are most lost and mired in sin. As long as that one coin is lost, as long as that one sheep is wandering in the wilderness, as long as our ungrateful brother is squandering his inheritance, we are not we.

We are not complete as long as our sisters and brothers are not in our lives, as long as their voices and cries, insights and anxieties are unheeded. These parables demand that we turn to those neighbors we blithely neglect or purposefully avoid. These parables call us to a radical love.

In other words, God is drawing us to our neighbors near and far. This is one of the gifts and delightful burdens of social media. Our neighbors are no longer just next door or even in our neighborhood. Our neighbors are here and there and in places we have never imagined. God is calling us to listen to them. Our preaching should do likewise this Sunday and every one after.

Admittedly, in the spirit of the late Reverend Dr. Vernon Johns who once preached the sermon “It’s safe to murder Negroes,” I was quite tempted this coming Sunday to preach a sermon of my own, titled “It’s Still Safe to Murder Negroes.” But upon further reflection I’ve chosen to homiletically respond to the police shooting of young Michael Brown and the ensuing outrage of the Ferguson black community with a sermon titled “Confessions of a Tired Black Preacher.”

Generally speaking the sermon will invite hearers into my struggle as a young black male preacher in the United of States America, as I try to understand what the message of the Christian gospel has to say to the perils of racial prejudice in our times. The substance of the sermon will be my attempt to show that the Christian gospel calls us to directly confront racial and ethnic prejudice in all of its various forms. Though I will use various historical, theological, and artistic sources to make this point, my primary source will be the New Testament Book of Acts (chapter 10, verses 9-35). By using these verses which contain the story of how the Apostle Peter was confronted and then convicted by the Spirit about his prejudice against all non-Jews, I hope to inspire listeners to confront the prejudice in their own hearts and communities. I also hope to show through these verses that the gospel requires us to confront and change systems of racial and social privilege that continue foster feelings of mistrust and animus among various groups.

Finally, I hope to encourage the hearers not to give up or get weary. But to keep fighting the good fight until justice rolls down like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!

“Wounded for Us”

....But he was wounded for our transgressions,

crushed for our iniquities....

- From Isaiah 53:1-8 (NRSV)

Known as one of the “suffering” servants” passages, Isaiah 53:1-8 is considered by many Christians to be a prophetic utterance about Jesus’ passion. Jewish interpreters, for whom these passages were first written, do not think of them this way of course. For them, these texts are about a Messiah to come who will bear away all offense so that the people of God may be redeemed. Some scholars have said that the suffering servant is in fact the whole “chosen people” collectively.

But I am struck by this text in the wake of Michael Brown’s killing in Ferguson, MO.

Brown was cut down at age 18 when bullets shot by a police officer riddled his surrendering body. We have the testimonies of at least two eyewitnesses and a slowly developing story from the police of what happened. But from where I sit, no matter which story one is inclined to believe, Michael Brown has become a symbol, a scapegoat really, of our diseased society, of the U.S. body politick.

We were subjected to the sight of his body uncovered and surrounded by police. Witnesses say it was there for four hours (though the official state-sanctioned account is that he was covered after 15 minutes). One witness said the officer just kept shooting him and never attended his felled body. He was struck down. And some sectors of our society believe he was slaughtered like an animal; others, that he was struck down “by God” (i.e., a agent of the God-ordained or even divine state).

Michael Brown’s death has exposed our transgressions and our iniquities as a country and a culture. The centuries’ old illness of racism and dehumanizing black bodies reared its head this past week. Black citizens saw police strapped for war zone combat in the face of their grief and protests.

Enough!

These Ferguson citizens screamed in the face of police who trained their military-grade weapons on the crowds. Wounded. And Michael Brown became the symbol of a community’s rejection, of black communities — not just in Ferguson, but throughout the country — being despised.

I know. Slowly, we are hearing that Michael wasn’t “innocent,” that he had stolen cigars. But we will not know that from him, and it is hard for some of us to trust any report from those who have taken more than four days to give an account. Michael was crushed and bore the punishment for being black in the USA for us all.

It’s not the typical “Jesus reading” of this text, is it? But “by a perversion of justice,” Michael’s life was snuffed out; he was “cut off from the land of the living.” And we have been left to ponder how we will be a people of a different Realm, one that does not need a scapegoat, one that does not despise or reject ANYONE. We are left to ask of God, “Why are the Michaels of our communities bearing all our iniquities?”

And dear God, how do we repent so that it never happens again?

This week many churches will read Matthew 15:21-28, the story of the Canaanite woman who approaches Jesus, as their Gospel lesson. I can’t imagine a richer text that might help congregations grapple with Michael Brown’s shooting and the intense conflicts that have followed it.

I find the Canaanite woman’s story hard to hear. Here’s a woman who needs help for her daughter, yet she just doesn’t count as a real person. Nor does her daughter. Jesus’ disciples want Jesus to send her away, and Jesus seems to agree. Jesus refuses to meet her, dismissing her because she is not an Israelite: “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel” (15:24). She kneels before Jesus, and he calls her a dog. Jesus and his disciples deny this woman’s humanity.

People are angry in Ferguson, and around the country, because their humanity has been denied. Witnesses say Michael Brown was shot after he stopped and put his hands in the air. We’ve heard too many stories of unarmed black men being killed or beaten when they pose no real danger to anyone.

One key dimension in our society’s race struggles involves the failure of white people to hear - and believe — {the experiences of our non-white neighbors}<hyperlink=”http://sojo.net/blogs/2014/08/14/when-terror-wears-badge”>. The Canaanite woman struggles to be heard. She cries out. That doesn’t work. She kneels and begs. Jesus rejects her. Finally, she says something so clever that Jesus relents and grants her request — the only person who wins an argument with Jesus. What does it take to be heard?

The Canaanite woman’s story shows us what it looks like when someone’s humanity is denied and what it sounds like when no one will listen. Congregations need time to reflect on these realities — and how they play out in our society.

One of the most important things in preaching is addressing the particular context of the specific day, place, and time for your preaching. On this upcoming Sunday there is no doubt that the issues around the tragic death of Michael Brown should be addressed in any and all contexts. Being sensitive to the needs of your particular context in regards to race, violence, oppression, police intervention, the nature of peaceful protests, the cry for justice, and the dramatic fear for the children, especially sons, within the African American community is vital.

Some congregations, unfortunately, live this reality day in and day out. Addressing another child taken by violence will be regrettable, but imperative and natural. The outrage will be very visceral and real. The cry for justice for all persons in these communities is part of the witness of faith.

Some congregations, however, will feel as if this is an event affecting others — someone unlike themselves. Addressing this situation with them is even more imperative, in my opinion. We have to find ways to relate to, understand, connect to, and empathize with our brothers and sisters of color. Finding connective moments in the texts and stories to help your listeners relate in more personal ways will be important.

Our Christian faith and our human morality implore us to see the world not as the priest or Levite walking by the one on the side of the road, but, instead, to view the world through the eyes of the broken and battered one on the side of the road. This takes work on all our parts, more for some than others since their life experiences are more in line with the “walkers” than with the “side of a road” person’s reality.

The lectionary reading for this week, Matthew 15: (10-20), 21-28, reminds us that even Jesus had to be pushed to open up to ALL persons. The cultural and social standards of the day excluded Canaanites. But the mother in this text refused to accept Jesus’ first response of exclusion. She pushed and persisted until he relented. This moment opens up Jesus’ ministry to all persons in powerful ways. We, too, regardless of our contexts need to persist in calling for justice — for all persons. Keep on pushing for change.

“For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who observes his natural face in a mirror; for he observes himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.” (James 1:23)

There is no justice without sight

How can we begin to see what justice might look like if we cannot acknowledge our nation’s cataracts? How does a nation that perpetually responds to threats to its “security” with tens of thousands of troops, drones, and other murderous technologies begin to speak peace in its own cities and suburbs? We are so drunk with our own power that we see even the smallest affront as having murderous intent and respond with a force inflated with the steroids of wealth and fear, killing the guilty and the innocent alike all the while imagining ourselves as the innocent victims.

When will America begin to see itself as it is? When will it flee from its self-deception and remember its legacy? We are a nation built upon a color line. It is a line that does not need to be spoken, but winds itself around the necks of the dark peoples of this nation with distorted images and “probable cause” and “diseased” illegal aliens and the presumption of black criminality that defunds schools and builds prisons.

We cannot know justice until we can begin to see ourselves as we are: a nation that does not see itself as it is. Do we have the courage to glance at the mirror again? What will we see in our schools, in our neighborhoods, in our cities and our workplaces? Can we begin to see ourselves in the words spoken to us by those who have been killed, jailed, and oppressed for so long?

In {a Friday letter to Holder}<hyperlink=”http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/commisionholderleterr234.pdf”>, the commission expressed support for the Department of Justice’s investigation of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed African American teenager killed by a Ferguson police officer on Aug. 9, but called for more extensive scrutiny of the excessive police response to the subsequent protests.

In particular, the commission requested that the Department of Justice examine the racial discrepancies between Ferguson’s residents and the city’s police force, writing that they “may be related, directly or indirectly, to the tension between concerned citizens and local government.” While over 60 percent of Ferguson’s residents are black, only {three out of its 53 police officers}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/racial-disparities-ferguson-missouri_n_5671891.html”> and only one of its six city council members are black.

“Tear gas attacks, mass arrests, and assaults on accredited journalists do not respect the right of assembly and the First Amendment rights of the press. They are wholly inappropriate in our democracy,” the commission wrote in the letter. “Consequently, we urge strongly that the Department and the local U.S. Attorney’s office are empowered to take whatever steps are necessary and appropriate to protect the constitutional rights of the citizens of Ferguson.”

Below is {the letter approved by the commission}<hyperlink=”http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/commisionholderleterr234.pdf”>, a bipartisan agency dedicated to investigating and advancing civil rights issues:

Dear Attorney General Holder:
The United States Commission on Civil Rights (hereafter “the Commission”) has profound concerns regarding the recent and continuing events in Ferguson, Missouri, and urge strong and bold action by the Department to protect the civil rights of the citizens of Ferguson.
We understand that the Department has opened an investigation into the police shooting death of Michael Brown, who witnesses say was an unarmed African American man. We strongly support your Department’s inquiry into the circumstances of his shooting. We also commend the efforts of the Department’s Community Relations Service to work with city officials and the community to help calm tensions in Ferguson.
We urge the Department to insist on full transparency and disclosure by the Ferguson police department to the citizens of Ferguson on all aspects of the investigation. In addition, we are also concerned about reports of other potential violations of civil liberties and civil rights in Ferguson over the past few days. Tear gas attacks, mass arrests, and assaults on accredited journalists do not respect the right of assembly and the First Amendment rights of the press. They are wholly inappropriate in our democracy. Consequently, we strongly urge that the Department and the local U.S. Attorney’s office are empowered to take whatever steps are necessary and appropriate to protect the constitutional rights of the citizens of Ferguson.
In addition, we request that the Justice Department examine the apparent lack of representation of the City’s majority African American community in the police department and local government. If media reports are correct that there are only 3 African American police officers in the Ferguson police force and only 1 African American city councilman out of 6, we believe this warrants intensive and close scrutiny by the Civil Rights Division. The disproportionate lack of representation in the police force and local government are not only a cause of concern, but may be related, directly or indirectly, to the tension between concerned citizens and local government.
We applaud the statements made by President Obama on August 14, 2014. All Americans are concerned with the events in Ferguson and desire that justice be done in accordance with fundamental principles of civil liberties and civil rights.

“My fear has been, throughout this whole process, that everyone believes that there’s not a true sense of community here in Ferguson, and there is,” Necole Powell, a volunteer, told KSDK

Brown’s fatal shooting comes only weeks after a police officer killed another unarmed man, Eric Garner, in New York City, by allegedly subjecting him to an illegal chokehold. While it is important to wait for the results of an investigation into the Brown shooting, many Ferguson residents lack faith in the local police department to conduct an impartial investigation into the circumstances surrounding Brown’s death.

Federal intervention needed

The circumstances in Ferguson exemplify the special circumstances that justify federal intervention into what would typically be a local criminal justice issues. The Ferguson police department has a history of disproportionately stopping racial minorities, and this undoubtedly fuels some of the animosity local residents have exhibited against police when discussing the recent events in Ferguson. According to a report issued by the Missouri State Attorney General’s office, while blacks make up {67 percent}<hyperlink=”http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/10-insane-numbers-ferguson-killing”> of Ferguson’s residents, in 2013, they represented 86 percent of those stopped by officers. Although white residents comprise a third of town’s population, only 12 percent were stopped by police. Officer Darren Wilson’s fatal shooting of an unarmed teen exacerbated the already tense relationship between police and citizens in that community, and many citizens have come forth to discuss the ongoing problems residents have had with the police force.

Furthermore, many commentators have recently criticized the department’s lack of diversity. For example, black residents represent a majority of the town, yet the police force employs only three black police officers. A lack of diversity is a problem nationwide, and most police departments fail to reflect the cultural diversity of the communities they serve.

The police department’s handling of the aftermath of Brown’s death has also demonstrated the failures of the local police department and the need for the federal government to participate in an investigation. Early in the investigation of Brown’s death, the local police department has made several missteps that have called its integrity into question. Those actions include failing to quickly release the officer’s name; releasing video of Brown that was not connected to his shooting death; and failing to provide information about how many times he was shot or the location of his wounds. The heavy-handed approach that the Ferguson police initially took toward the peaceful protestors immediately following the shooting has prompted Missouri’s governor to turn over security to the State Highway Patrol. 

The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into Wilson’s fatal shooting of Brown, and the U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has plans to visit Ferguson. The federal government’s presence will hopefully restore legitimacy to a police department that has completely lost the trust of the community it serves.

The federal government has already authorized an independent autopsy to determine the cause of death. This will also be important to determine whether Brown was fleeing or surrendering when Wilson fired upon him. The federal government’s investigation will help assure Brown’s family and the residents of Ferguson that a complete and thorough investigation will occur.

Concern regarding police response to protestors

The right to assemble peacefully, the freedom to protest government actions, and the freedom of the press to cover these events are essential to our democracy and are embedded into our constitution. It is important to identify the two distinct groups of protesters in Ferguson. The majority of protestors are rightfully frustrated by yet another shooting of an unarmed black teen and the questionable police investigation following his death. They are attempting to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights to express their condemnation of these events. There also seems to be a second, smaller group whose own tactics are a distraction from the serious issues that precipitated the events in the first place. Many leaders, including several members of Congress and Missouri’s governor have criticized the initial local police response calling it “imbalanced” or “”aggressive,” and it is these tactics that have further angered residents reeling from Brown’s death. As vigils and protests occur nationwide in response to the events in Ferguson, peaceful protests must be allowed to continue. At the same time, residents and businesses must be protected from any group of people who are unwilling to properly honor Brown’s memory and his family members, who are still grieving their loss.

Lessons from Ferguson

The events in Ferguson remind us that it important to address allegations of police brutality and to assess the underlying causes of the subsequent violence that continues to occur in that community. The tensions in Ferguson that have sparked the protests and the ensuing violence are not unique to that city. The major instances of civil unrest in this nation are all linked to allegations of police brutality against unarmed black men. In 1965, the arrest of Marquette Frye sparked the Watts rebellion in 1965. In 1992, violence erupted in Los Angeles in 1992 following the acquittal of officers who were videotaped viciously beating Rodney King. In 2001, Cincinnati experienced several days of unrest followed the shooting death of 19-year-old Timothy Thomas, who was the fifteenth African American man shot in that city between 1995 and 2001. In Oakland, protests erupted in 2010 when a Bay Area Transit officer shot and killed Oscar Grant on the subway platform. Given this history, community leaders and elected officials must pay attention to the aggressive law enforcement tactics used in urban communities. After the unrest in Watts, President Johnson established the Kerner Commission to study the causes of violence. Since the findings of the Kerner Commission, there have been many improvements in policing. Many major police departments have successfully implemented community-policing programs and have discarded aggressive police tactics, such as those initially used against peaceful protestors in Ferguson, to alleviate these tensions. However, many of the problems identified by that Commission’s report in 1968, such as economic inequality and the need for more diverse police departments that were sensitive to community needs, continue to persist in 2014 and can no longer be ignored.

This is a pivotal moment in our nation’s history, and every police chief in America should be asking: “How do I ensure that I maintain the integrity of my department and earn the trust and legitimacy of my community so that we don’t have another Ferguson?”",NA,0,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff48,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-lyon/behind-the-veil-ferguson-_b_5684045.html,Behind the Veil: Ferguson and the Reign of God,Trey Lyon,08/19/14,10/20/16,"“It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness — an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.” — W.E.B. DuBois, The Souls of Black Folk

In the computer lab of our after-school program is a cluster of pictures of famous and inspiring folks who at one point or another made Georgia their home. Next to the portrait of Ambassador Andrew Young and to the right of Flannery O’Connor hangs a pensive-looking portrait of W.E.B. DuBois.

I have often looked at that picture and wondered if DuBois would wish to be thought of, in any context, as a “Georgian”. DuBois weathered horrific racism in Atlanta, including the 1906 race riots where 10,000 white men beat, killed and attacked black families indiscriminately, all due to fallacious and fabricated headlines {meant to sabotage a white politician}<hyperlink=”http://sweetauburn.us/rings/raceriot.htm”>. He resolved to not remain “a calm, cool, and detached scientist” when he saw the knuckles of Sam Hose on display in a store-front window in Atlanta-a reminder of the {recent lynching of a young black laborer}<hyperlink=”http://blog.loa.org/2011/03/how-sam-hose-lynching-became-awakening.html”> who had killed his employer in an act of self-defense. DuBois channeled that rage into writing — eventually producing one of the greatest works of American non-fiction-{The Souls of Black Folk}<hyperlink=”http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_souls.html”>. DuBois’ son, Burghardt, {fell ill at age two with diphtheria}<hyperlink=”http://scua.library.umass.edu/duboisopedia/doku.php?id=about:du_bois_burghardt”>. When no white doctors would treat his son and the lone African-American doctor in Atlanta failed to respond, Burghardt died, crushing DuBois and his wife Nina.

In many ways his experience in Georgia gave DuBois the courage, passion and fire to write his most profound works, and yet it took pounds of flesh and blood in the process. As I look at his picture on the wall, my eyes fall to the children seated below it each week — third graders, seventh graders, seniors in high school. I realize that a hundred years later this city is doing the same thing to them.

DuBois wrote of the Veil between White Americans and Black Americans — that invisible scrim that allows the Souls of White Folk to waltz and wander, work and fall in love in complete security and freedom, hampered only by the fear of personal harm by an act of malice and even then with the promise of swift justice for the offender. Meanwhile, as DuBois rightly notes, African-Americans move about in the shadows beyond the Veil, a mystery barely worth noting for those on the other side, who carry on their revelry in complete security. This Veil leads to an awareness of two selves — a “double consciousness” — whereby the African-American is aware of both his or her American-ness and their black identity.

As a white, middle-class male who grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta, I first learned of this concept of double consciousness somewhere between middle school and high school. I confess, I did not understand it then, and aside from intellectual curiosity, I had no reason to — I could keep dancing behind the veil and ask my fellow revelers, conjecturing about what life must be like on the other side.

In my current context, it is far more difficult. The majority of the children and families who are our friends and neighbors bear the brunt of hundreds of years of racial and systemic oppression. Most of them rarely speak of the pain this has inflicted and rarely let it show (further evidence that DuBois was spot on — most of the time those dancing within the veil have no idea the folks on the other side have any cause for grievance). Every once in awhile though, there are glimpses behind the Veil. Like when a 16-year-old asks me “Trey, what’s it like to be white?” or when the local public school hangs up a giant portrait of a “founding father” and my friend says “that man owned slaves — {what is that telling our kids at this school}<hyperlink=”http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/america-is-not-for-black-people-1620169913?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&utm_source=deadspin_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow”>?” I get a glimpse behind the Veil when a friend posts a video to Facebook of him being detained by police in Washington D.C. because he “fit the description” of an African-American male in a suit. And then there are the times — rare, but significant — when we all get a glimpse behind the Veil.

Trayvon Martin. Oscar Grant. Michael Brown. Too many others. Too many “next ones”. These instances are real for me because they could just as easily be any of the gifted, hilarious, gregarious teens who we see week in and week out.  These tragically famous names are examples for all of us, but often they are relegated to whispered conversations while the waltz of the White, Wealthy and Powerful  saunters on. “Tragedy about that. Just awful. Think of the parents. Someone really should do something.” And the conversation turns quicker than the news cycle, the stories of children little more than conversational anecdotes on current events.

But then there are the large moments. Montgomery. Birmingham. Selma. Ferguson. The ones where the Veil is lifted — even, perhaps especially when there is something people don’t want you to see. These are the moments when the music stops and the dance ends. These are the moments when one can keep humming the tune and twirling like nothing has changed or stop to realize that those beyond the Veil have no cause for dancing.

It is in these places that the Veil becomes visible, and, for those with ears to hear, a new song emerges—one forged of rage, pain and indefatigable hope. This is the song I heard when a friend and colleague, in the wake of the endless footage of arrests, sniper rifles aimed at unarmed citizens and a pastor with a bullet wound, wrote these words: “As an African-American male in this country I feel that I am being tolerated, not accepted.” Like a glimpse behind the veil, I asked my friend to explain this dichotomy. In his words:

Being TOLERATED means something that has more power than me is allowing me to be a part of it or be in it’s presence. I am TOLERATED, as long as I stay in line of what is expected by the majority that is in power. My differences are not seen as positives, but as a detriment to the existing power. If I was ACCEPTED, I would be seen as equal.

 I cannot deny the veracity of those words and I grieve for my friend’s experience. I grieve because this is not an experience I can share. I can never fully comprehend his experience behind the Veil, but I can believe him when he tells me it exists and I can choose to recognize that the music has stopped and not everyone is attending the same party. And that means I have to do something.

Cornel West famously says “Justice is what love looks like in public.” As a Christian minister, I cling to an ideal of justice — the kind Dr. King called down when he quoted the prophet Amos, the kind that rolls down like rushing water, the kind that we are called to pursue for the widow, the poor, the marginalized, the outcast, the estranged, the oppressed. I believe God’s justice is the rule of God’s Kingdom. This Reign of God surpasses human understandings of gender, governance and polity. It is a bold vision of equality and resources for all, not just a select few. This is what we speak of as the essence of faith.

When justice fails as it has in Ferguson, when justice {fails an entire population}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/14/ferguson-police-department-details/14064451/”> because it is unfairly and unreasonably targeted, {exploited}<hyperlink=”http://www.theroot.com/blogs/the_grapevine/2014/08/_iftheygunnedmedown_shows_how_black_people_are_portrayed_in_mainstream_media.html”> and {deprived of basic human rights}<hyperlink=”http://newjimcrow.com/”>, it is tempting to {take justice into our own hands.}<hyperlink=”http://www.govtech.com/local/How-computer-hackers-changed-the-Ferguson-protests.html”> Personally, there is a part of me that delights in the creative ways people have found to challenge injustice, but at my very core, injustice reminds me most of all that the Reign of God isn’t here yet.

Because in the Reign of God there are no Veils. In the Reign of God there is justice. In the Reign of God there is redistribution of resources but, as Dr. King reminded us the night before injustice claimed his life, there is also a {redistribution of pain}<hyperlink=”http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkivebeentothemountaintop.htm”>. This is the Reign of God. And we are not there yet.

If we are to work to see the Reign of God here and now then it is my duty to dismantle the principalities and structures that perpetuate double consciousness, knowing that if we never see if fully removed we were part of dismantling it for good. These glimpses are not for our intellectual curiosity or entertainment — they are to compel us to labor and work, to stand alongside. To ask to see and to begin to see the world through eyes not our own the self-limiting, disabling, bigoted, oppressive systems we ourselves have helped build. These glimpses are an opportunity for repentance and for rebuilding. For preparing and throwing a new party, one where the music is loud and all are treated as equal and fully beloved of God — a vision of a new kind of life beyond the Veil.",NA,0,NA,NA

“Being naïve is never anything to be ashamed of, because I believe me being naïve is what has allowed me to do all the things that I can because if I believe in and quote what’s realistic then I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing right now,” Palmer admitted Thursday during an interview with The Huffington Post. “I simply wouldn’t be ‘Cinderella’ on Broadway, I wouldn’t have ‘Just KeKe,’”

“I wouldn’t have done any of the things that I’ve done. So I think that’s a play on people’s ideas of what they can’t do and what they believe is possible. And for me, I believe everything is possible. That’s the way that I was raised, and from what I’ve been able to do I’ve seen that to be true that your reality is what you make it.”

The star also shared her thoughts on the Michael Brown incident and why she chose to speak up.

“As far as what’s going on with Mike Brown, I spoke up on that, because unproductive outrage has never gotten us anywhere,” she continued. “Even with MLK and everything that he did for black people...all he spoke about was unity, because throwing hate and being angry, and violence, that doesn’t give us peace and equality. That’s like having sex in order to get your virginity. It’s just the complete opposite thing to do.”

“I don’t have all the answers and there are no quick fixes for things like this. But uniting and coming together on one clear message and trying to get that message across is much better than us all being everywhere and fighting against one another and coming from all different sides. That’s never going to get us anywhere.”

After defending her thoughts against the hailstorm of criticism, Palmer also encouraged her {followers on Instagram to “take it to the streets” and “off Twitter”}<hyperlink=”http://instagram.com/p/riTWJgkrpm”> if they really want to contribute to positive change. All of which has prompted the Illinois-native to visit Ferguson this weekend.

“I’m very excited to see what can be done and if I can really get involved, and how we can unite one another,” she said during the interview. “That’s what I always believe is the way to go. Uniting us all. Not just black people, but everybody that’s coming to talk the same message.

“No one person can do anything. So, going further into my statement of ‘taking it to the streets,’ if you feel strongly, organize things that can best execute your message.

As an African American male, I don’t even know what to say about the recent tragedy that has rocked your community. My heart breaks as I watch the developments of this story. I cannot imagine what Michael Brown’s grandmother must feel like. How do you process finding your grandson’s dead body in the street? More importantly, what does it feel like to be grieving a loss and to have no answers? Michael Brown was a promising young man and I believe he had a great future ahead of him. As a community struggles to deal with such a tragic loss, I want the people of Ferguson to know that we are standing with you.

We have hit a tipping point in America and enough is enough! While violence is not the solution to rectify this problem, I believe that vigilance and accountability are a great start. It’s time for all Americans to stand up and say ‘not on our watch.’ If it takes communities uniting and forming watches in the community then so be it. If it takes demonstrations in every city in America then so be it. If it takes interviews on every major television network in the world then so be it.

I remember watching the Trayvon Martin situation and just feeling overwhelmed. That could have very well been me or my brother. In fact, I could think of a long list of individuals that could have been in the same situation.

All I know is that something has to change. I believe that if we all use the power of our collective voices we can propel change. Not another young African American male. Too much promise and potential is going to the grave prematurely. Too many mothers are hurting and grieving the loss of their young sons. Too many fathers are in pain and hopeless even though they tried so desperately to protect their sons.

Ferguson, you are not alone. This is not just an African American issue. It’s time for this to become a world issue. I know you are in pain and shock right now. I know that some wounds will never heal. I know that you are struggling to answer the why of this situation. However, let’s shift the narrative to what can be done. I believe that together we can make a difference. I believe that if we use the power of our collective voices we can make a difference. My mind keeps going back to the image of Michael Brown’s father. That image brings up deep pain and hurts me to my core. We have to do something. This has to stop. We must keep demonstrating, keep speaking and keep uniting because we have to the power to bring about change.

Ferguson, you have the attention of the whole world right now. We feel your pain and we are committed to working together to bring about change. We must demand answers and we must hold the justice system accountable. If we demand answers they have no choice but to hear us. We demand justice!

For days now, as I have been reading, watching, crying, and talking with others; I have been thinking about you. I have been thinking of Michael Brown’s family and friends, of course, but I have also been thinking about you, fellow educators.

I do not know what it is like to have a tragedy of the scope of Michael Brown’s killing happen in my community. I do not know what it is like to see police marching in riot gear and riding in tanks down my neighborhood streets that should be filled with school buses. I do not know what it is like to delay the opening of school because of these tremendous injustices that the rest of the world can only watch on television. But, like far too many teachers around the country, I know what it is like to see the children who are entrusted to you have their lives and their futures taken from them. I know what it is like to see an empty desk and remember... whether the student sat it in recently or years before, because it will always be that student’s desk to you.

Then I started to wonder: is anyone writing to you, teachers of Ferguson? Is anyone thinking about how you are sleeping, what you are telling your own children, and how you are going to greet a new group of students in the morning? I hope so. I hope there are many, and mine is just one more voice in a chorus of supporters. I hope that this chorus is loud enough to overpower other voices that marginalize people of color in your community or that ignore what is happening in Ferguson.

Michael was a recent graduate, destined for college this month. But I do not think it matters that he was no longer technically a student in your schools. As teacher-blogger Peter Greene {wrote}<hyperlink=” http://curmudgucation.blogspot.com/2014/08/for-some-of-children.html”>:

And as any high school teacher would immediately recognize, Michael Brown was undoubtedly still part of his high school community. He would have still been known, been the guy who younger teens knew as one of the ‘big kids.’ Any death of a recent high school grad resonates through the students who are still there and about to start the new year.

And, of course, it resonates through the teachers, too. I imagine there is nothing I can say that will ease your understandable confusion, anger, grief, and frustration. Perhaps the grief counselors who (I hope) will join you and your students can help you begin to heal. I feel brokenhearted for you and your community and yet unable to do anything of consequence. Yet since I’ve sat on the other side and seen the empty desk, this is what I felt like I had to say, to someone. I hope it reaches you.

So, in the absence of any solutions, here is what I do know: on Monday morning and throughout this year, there will be thousands of teachers around the country — indeed around the world — who are standing with you in solidarity. Educators in K-12 schools and universities will be talking about Michael with our own students, like we talked about Sean and Jordan and Trayvon and Renisha.

Sure, there may be some people who will say we shouldn’t talk about “things like this” in schools, especially at the beginning of the year. It’s too intense, they’ll say. It’s not in the curriculum, they’ll say. There’s no time, they’ll say. But to them I would say, if not now, then when? If not us, then who?

As you attempt to build a safe space in your classrooms, I will try to do the same in my university classroom for future teachers. Many of my students may be White, in line with the current demographics of U.S. teachers, and may be resistant to talking about issues of race and privilege. Nonetheless, we will talk about how what happened in Ferguson is reflective of historical, political, and social conditions. We will name it as {racism}<hyperlink=” http://www.salon.com/2014/08/15/10_ways_racism_killed_michael_brown_and_eric_garner/”> (rather than, as fellow educator Katy Swalwell pointed out, couching it as “race relations”), and we’ll talk about why those with White privilege need to be {allies}<hyperlink=” https://janeewoods.com/2014/08/14/becoming-a-white-ally-to-black-people-in-the-aftermath-of-the-michael-brown-murder/”> in the struggle for justice inside and outside of our classrooms. When I challenge them to consider that “{the struggle for justice does not end when the school bell rings}<hyperlink=” http://www.nycore.org/#sthash.fKdegpcG.dpbs”>,” I will be thinking of you, of Michael, and of the Ferguson protestors. In all of our spaces, as we work to combat the “{danger of a single story}<hyperlink=” http://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story”>,” I hope educators can honor the memory of Michael and all our youth who we’ve lost too soon.

Every day, it takes great strength to be a teacher. Thank you for being models of this strength as you begin your new school year this week.

He also appeared to have little sympathy for individuals who were caught up in the melee, essentially saying it was their own fault for being out.

“If individuals are in a crowd that’s attacking the police, they need to get out of that crowd,” Jackson said during a Thursday afternoon press conference. “We can’t individually go in and say, ‘Excuse me sir, are you peacefully protesting? Are you throwing rocks? Are you throwing a Molotov cocktail?’ It’s a crowd. If the crowd is getting violent and you don’t want to be violent, get out of the crowd.”

The Ferguson Police Department has been under fire since one of its officers shot and killed Brown, an unarmed African American teenager, on Aug. 9. The police department has refused to release the name of the officer or give more details about the incident, and there have been nightly protests by community members who are frustrated by the lack of justice.

The police department’s response to the protests has escalated racial tensions in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb.

The Huffington Post’s Christine Conetta and MSNBC’s Trymaine Lee were also caught in crowds of tear gas while out covering the protests in Ferguson Wednesday night. In an interview Thursday on MSBNC, Lee took issue with Jackson’s contention that officers fired tear gas in response to violence from protesters.

“I was standing just about 35 feet away from the armored vehicles when they first fired off those canisters of tear gas,” Lee said. “Somebody did throw a bottle or something off one of those trucks. But I didn’t hear any gunfire. I didn’t see any molotov cocktails, any rocks being flung. Within 20 seconds of whatever did hit one of the police vehicles, the police said, this is no longer a peaceful protest. You must disperse immediately. Within 15 seconds, the first canister started to be fired into the crowd.”",144,2000,NA,NA

Up to 11 reporters have been arrested or detained by police in the Missouri town, which has seen days of protests and violence following the police killing of Michael Brown.

Speaking at a press conference, Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson told reporters that, if police can’t tell that they’re members of the media, they could be detained.

Journalist Matthew Keys recorded Johnson’s comments.

“When officers are running around, we’re not sure who’s a journalist and who’s not,” he {said}<hyperlink=”https://soundcloud.com/producermatthew/mshp-capt-johnson-police-will-continue-to-arrest-journalists”>. “Yes, if I see somebody with a $50,000 camera on their shoulder, I’m pretty sure.

Johnson’s comments came before The Intercept’s Ryan Deveraux was {detained}<hyperlink=”https://theintercept.com/2014/08/19/intercept-reporter-detained-covering-ferguson-protests/”> and held for hours in Ferguson.

There is nothing more American than a community uniting in the face of tragedy, than ordinary people organizing to peacefully protest injustice. The police reaction—to protests of their own violence—has been more violence, less transparency, and an active suppression of first amendment freedoms. The police and government of Ferguson must be held accountable, and we call on the Department of Justice to take immediate action.

The struggle for peace, for belonging, and for justice in the working-class community of Ferguson matters to every American. At Demos, we believe that the American experiment of a multiracial democracy requires us to actively define “we, the people” to include us all. Ours is a nation of ancestral strangers who have yet to overcome our inheritance of state-sanctioned violence and a hierarchy that dehumanizes people of color. When a government does not represent its people—and worse yet, when government actions allow us to question whether officials believe their community members are truly people at all—we have no demos, and therefore no democracy.

But at this moment, young people are standing up for each other across the country, asserting their citizenship and their humanity. Their generation holds the promise of America: millennials are the most diverse generation in our history and also the most civic-minded, progressive and welcoming of difference. At Demos, we believe that this generation will live to see our democratic experiment finally succeed. But they must live.

Michael Brown was headed for college this week. We say this after every one, but may this murder be the last.

And may his life—and Trayvon’s life, and Renisha’s life, and Oscar’s life, and the too-short lives of so many children—become part of the story of how we healed, and truly became one nation.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Carlos F. Torres",08/18/14,02/06/17,"The real Ferguson‬ story is about a community that’s grown so fed up with being pushed around that they’ve decided to fight back against what amounts to an invading army.

It is a confrontation for justice in the best tradition of Ghandi, the Civil Rights Movement and Tahir Square.

A community armed with little less than their deep sense of indignation saying “enough is enough” and defying a deeply unjust and increasingly violent system.

It goes far beyond the atrocious killing by the Ferguson police of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black male, because depressingly so, such killings happen all the time. Melissa Harris Perry, in her moving {MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/no-rights-which-the-white-man-was-bound-respect”> piece, pointed out that:

From 2006 to 2012, a white police officer killed a black person at least twice a week in this country. Which brings us back to Ferguson, Missouri, where according to a report in The Daily Beast, in 2009 police officers charged a man for property damage because he bled on their uniforms while they arrested him-and allegedly beat him bloody.

It is not about character assassination — vilifying the victim in an attempt to justify the killing, because it’s been done for ever. Most recently in the case of Trayvon Martin. Historically, it was a tool {routinely used by Rudolph W.

Neither it is about institutionalized racism that, 60 years after signing of the Civil Rights Bill and 6 into the presidency of the first African American, nails shut most doors to the black and brown people of this land, because people like Tavis Smiley have been saying it for long.

Kraska estimates the total number of SWAT deployments per year in the U.S. may now top 60,000, or more than 160 per day.

Nor was it about the detention and roughing up of reporters Wesley Lowery, from the Washington Post, and Ryan Reilly, from the Huffington Post. It was certainly a First Amendement rights violation, an egregious abuse by the police, but these reporters never for one minute lost the backing of powerful organizations that, in the end, would guarantee them their freedom and safety.

For those reasons, in my opinion, the real story is one of courage.

Tremendous courage.

The same courage shown by Ghandi in his famous Salt Satyagraha, in April 1930, where thousands of Hindis started a campaign of civil disobedience against the powerful British Empire. Explains Kenneth Pletcher of {Encyclopaedia Britannica.}<hyperlink=”https://www.britannica.com/event/Salt-March”>

The march on the saltworks went ahead as planned on May 21, led by the poet Sarojini Naidu, and many of the some 2,500 peaceful marchers were attacked and beaten by police. By the end of the year, some 60,000 people were in jail.

Courage like that displayed by the civil rights marchers in their historic march from Montgomery to Selma. From the National Archives:

In 1965, at the height of the modern civil rights movement, activists organized a march for voting rights, from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, the state capital. On March 7, some 600 people assembled at a downtown church, knelt briefly in prayer, and began walking silently, two-by-two through the city streets.

With Hosea Williams of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) leading the demonstration, and John Lewis, Chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), at his side, the marchers were stopped as they were leaving Selma, at the end of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, by some 150 Alabama state troopers, sheriff ‘s deputies, and possemen, who ordered the demonstrators to disperse.

One minute and five seconds after a two-minute warning was announced, the troops advanced, wielding clubs, bullwhips, and tear gas. John Lewis, who suffered a skull fracture, was one of fifty-eight people treated for injuries at the local hospital. The day is remembered in history as “Bloody Sunday.”

Or the courage of shown by South Africans in Soweto township protesting the forced teaching of the language Afrikaans in 1976 that killed an estimated 500 residents. The {BBC}<hyperlink=”http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5038312.stm”> remembers:

About 50 police arrived, and confronted the demonstrations. At first they used tear gas, but soon shots were fired.
Running clashes with the police erupted, with the children replying to the live rounds with stones.

“All of a sudden about six policemen armed with sten guns and rifles turned onto the crowd and most of them fired shots into the air,” Nat Serache, a reporter with the Rand Daily Mail, recalled.

“But unfortunately one of them fired into the crowd and two kids were hit: One a five-year-old girl who was hit in the head and died on the spot, and a nine-year-old boy who was shot through the chest and also died on the spot.”

Police and the military were brought into Soweto.

Army helicopters were seen over the township. The rioting spread. Buses were burnt and shops looted. Adults joined in the protests.

And to the degree that courage and defiance breeds more courage and more defiance, it is likely that the example of Ferguson will be noticed across this great country of ours, where people’s grievances range from decreasing opportunities for the many to increased wealth accumulation in the hands of fewer and fewer.

Just in the past week, we’ve seen solidarity rallies — from Howard University to Times Square, and across the nation.

While pledging non violence, many are coming to the conclusion that it’s time to take a stand against an unabated offensive targeting working people and other minorities that has systematically eroded their rights, their livelihoods, their future. And few have resisted.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson held a press conference Wednesday, telling reporters that he is working with the NAACP and the Department of Justice to set up the meeting.

Since Brown was killed, there have been protests around the city from members of the city’s African American community who believe that the shooting was unjustified.

Jackson said Wednesday it’s been a “struggle” to diversify the police force, but he’s been trying to do so during his tenure as chief.

The police force’s response to the protests — and the ensuing looting and vandalism — has sparked anger, with videos showing an officer calling protesters “{fucking animals}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/michael-brown-protests_n_5672163.html”> “ and {firing tear gas}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-tear-gas_n_5671811.html”> at people standing in their own backyards.

Jackson acknowledged the problems during Wednesday’s press conference. “Race relations is a top priority right now, and as I said, I’m working with the Department of Justice to improve it,” he said.

Melissa Jun Rowley",08/18/14,02/08/17,"Since the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown took place in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, a heated conflict between the police and demonstrators in the area has escalated to the point of national emergency. On August 16, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a curfew beginning at midnight and stressed that police enforce the rule by communication only. However, {reports}<hyperlink=””> that police officers fired tear gas at protestors in the streets flooded Twitter last night. Accounts of protestors throwing {Molotov cocktails}<hyperlink=””> at officers, looting businesses, and blocking roads have also been cited. Attempting to quell the chaos, Nixon called in the National Guard today to “help restore peace and order and to protect the citizens of Ferguson.” Last week, {Amnesty International}<hyperlink=””> sent a 12-person delegation to the St. Louis County city to observe police and protester activity and train local activists on non-violent demonstrating.

Adding fuel to the fire, the {New York Times}<hyperlink=””> reported that Brown’s autopsy shows he was shot at least six times, including two shots in the head. No gun powder was found in Brown’s body, which suggests that he was not shot at close range. Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for New York City, flew to Missouri on Sunday to conduct the autopsy at the Brown family’s request. According to the NYT, he reviewed the autopsies of President John F. Kennedy and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and has performed more than 20,000 autopsies throughout his career.

During times of crisis, trusted new sources can be hard to come by. The race for breaking stories and accumulating page views takes precedence in most media circles. Not being in Ferguson myself to witness how this story is developing, I’m not sure what to do other than try to inform people of the tools available to help them share firsthand accounts of what’s happening on the ground and to inform them of their human rights.

Here are some digital tools to aid residents and empower citizen journalists in their hour of need in Ferguson and beyond.

{I’m Getting Arrested}<hyperlink=””> does exactly what it sounds like it does. The mobile app enables anyone, with one click, to broadcast a custom message to SMS numbers in the event they are arrested. 


{StoryMaker}<hyperlink=””> is an open source app that enables journalists to produce and publish professional-grade news with their Android phone as safely and securely as possible.

{Informacam}<hyperlink=””> creates a snapshot of the environment in which an image or video was captured to answer questions regarding the “who,” “where” and “when” of an incident, and then encrypts and sends the files to a trusted source.

{Panic Button}<hyperlink=””>, which was developed by Amnesty International, turns your smartphone into a secret alarm for when you’re in trouble. Features include emergency SMS, a location map, rapid and discrete alerts, and data protection.


{The UDHR Universal Declaration of Human Rights app}<hyperlink=””> provides important human rights information in multiple languages, and allows users to share articles via e-email, SMS and social media.

Andrew Guthrie Ferguson",08/17/14,02/08/17,"The events in Ferguson, Missouri between Officer Darren Wilson and Michael Brown are tragic, chaotic, and unfortunately part of a larger pattern of police-citizen conflict that occasionally escalates into deadly force. These events are also not simply about what happened on August 9, 2014, but about the growing distrust between citizens and the police who patrol that community. Ferguson has resonated across the country, not because of the merits of this one particular interaction — where the facts are still uncertain — but because of other similar, but less deadly policing tactics in certain urban communities.

Calls for better police training, body-worn cameras, new racial profiling legislation, and/or federal investigations are welcome steps, but they all fail to capture the simmering day-to-day tension that is created by certain types of stop and frisk patrols. At their core, the Ferguson protests are not just about a death, but about the day-to-day life of people of color who share a growing resentment for perceived police harassment.

How can police and communities track this tension before it boils over into riots and civil unrest? How can we measure the cost/benefit of certain types of stop and frisk practices, with metrics including community sentiment as well as community safety?

Interestingly, new crime mapping and predictive technologies ordinarily used to prevent crime can be adapted to identify patterns of problematic police-citizen interaction. While the technologies are only just being made available to better-funded police departments, this “stop and track” solution does offer an additional remedy for those searching for an answer to prevent the next Ferguson situation.

In jurisdictions like New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles, police are employing sophisticated crime mapping technologies to map crime. Police track each reported crime, call for service, and arrest in terms of date, time, and event. In cities required to keep track of each police-citizen encounter, the data is even more granular. In New York City, for example, we know exactly where each stop took place because a UF-250 police form is filled out, uploaded into a computer and then mapped.

This crime mapping technology has proved quite effective in reducing crime rates in certain neighborhoods, shifting scarce police resources to areas of higher crime, and organizing the rather chaotic reality of urban street policing. Yet, because it is police technology, it necessarily focuses on crime (it is “crime mapping” after all), and not the conduct of police officers in relation to the crime. So, we know a burglary happened on a particular block, but not necessarily where the police were patrolling when they failed to prevent that burglary. Obviously, to stop the next burglary, understanding why that “missed opportunity” occurred would be important. Or, we know that a police officer encountered a suspect and did not arrest him, but not the qualitative nature of the encounter. Essentially, the crime mapping software used in areas like New York City only tells us half the equation — we know where the crime is and where police interact with citizens, but we do not know where the police were located when crime occurred or the nature of their interactions with citizens. Simply put, we are missing half of the picture that might provide a warning sign of increasing tension between the community and the police or even about individual police officers.

Community distrust of police grows from two contradictory, but interlocking sources. First, certain communities are subject to more crime due to inadequate police intervention. Second, in an attempt to aggressively respond to crime, innocent people in those communities may be stopped and questioned without any accountability for the police error. As can be seen in the outpouring of stories after Ferguson, certain communities, thus, feel that the police are not on their side, and only out to harass them.

If crime mapping technologies were redirected to also capture information about the conduct of the police important insights might emerge. First, understanding where police officers are in relation to the location of crime should improve police efficiency. Most police cars are (or soon will be) fitted with GPS technology. Some departments have begun adding RFID chips to police badges to map police officer movement throughout the day. These innovations, while obviously invasive to the police officer’s personal freedom, would allow police administrators to map police patterns throughout the day. Overlaying the crime reports, police administrators would be able to more effectively utilize their officers to respond in real time to crime patterns.",NA,NA,NA,51 likes

Marina Fang",08/14/14,02/08/17,"Speaking on conservative network {Newsmax TV on Wednesday}<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nApmxuOJlY&feature=youtu.be”>, King disagreed that racial profiling played a role in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown or the targeting of those protesting his death because, King claims, everyone protesting the situation is black.

“This idea of no racial profiling ... I’ve seen the video. It looks to me like you don’t need to bother with that particular factor because they all appear to be of a single origin, I should say, a continental origin might be the way to phrase that,” he said.

King was responding to the {Congressional Black Caucus’ demand}<hyperlink=”http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/214911-lawmakers-call-on-doj-to-expand-probe-of-slain-missouri-teen”> for the Department of Justice to conduct an extensive investigation into questionable actions of the St. Louis County Police Department in response to the largely peaceful protests in Ferguson. The CBC expressed concern that the police may have a history of racial profiling.

On Monday, Attorney General Eric Holder said the situation {deserves a full review}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/eric-holder-michael-brown_n_5669766.html”> and announced that the FBI plans to investigate possible civil rights violations.

King, however, accused the CBC of using race to politicize the situation.

“I just reject race-based politics, identity politics,” he said. “I think we’re all God’s children. We all should be held to the same standards and the same level of behavior.”

The situation in Ferguson has reignited debate over {rampant racial profiling by law enforcement}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/michael-brown-killing_n_5675001.html?1407948267”>. {The Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html#page=1”> noted that in Ferguson, blacks are “twice as likely to be stopped by police as whites,” according to a review by Missouri’s attorney general.

Sasha Belenky",08/19/14,02/08/17,"Even as Ferguson, Missouri, has been rocked by night after night of protests and police clashes, Patricia Bynes, Democratic committeewoman for the town, said that many local residents have come together to help each other and try to prevent further violence.

“I saw a woman walking around last night during the protests, and do you know what she had in her hands? A gallon of milk,” Bynes told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. “And people were like, ‘What are you doing with that milk?’ And she said, ‘This is to help people who get tear-gassed.’”

“Everybody has their weapon of choice,” Bynes said. For some, it’s waving protest signs. For others, it’s providing food or car rides. For others, it’s helping those who have been tear-gassed.
“Last night, she was my hero,” Bynes said, “the lady with the milk.”

It’s been “heart-wrenching” to watch police {fire tear gas and smoke bombs}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/ferguson-protests_n_5689963.html”> into the {backyards}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-tear-gas_n_5671811.html?ir=Black+Voices”> of her constituents, Bynes said.

“I’ve lived in the area for about 14 years,” she added. “These are my stores that I go to, my gas station that I frequent. They’re part of my every day. And the people who work in these places are familiar faces.”

Yet the response by the community, she said, has been inspiring. “This has brought out the best in the community. I’ve seen people without even thinking just step up and start doing the right thing.”

When tensions flare, Bynes said, residents have worked to keep the peace. “Sometimes there are people who start arguing amongst themselves, fighting,” she said. “And then I’ve seen people just step in and say, ‘Stop, this isn’t about Mike Brown.’ So whatever their differences were, they were arguing to the point where it was going to be a physical altercation. Other people have stepped in and said, ‘Hey, no, stop it.’”

Others have fed people and swept up the damage after the nightly clashes. “I’ve gotten countless, countless phone calls from people saying, ‘Hey, how can we help? We want to donate food for the protesters,’” Bynes said. “I even saw a Domino’s down the street — they donated pizzas one day for people to eat while they’re protesting. People come out and volunteer and clean up the streets in the morning every day.”

“There’s something remarkable going on,” she continued. “I’m not surprised because I live here, and I know that we have great people here. So during times like this, this is when those people just step up and just fill the need.”

Bynes herself has lent a helping hand on a number of occasions, {offering rides to strangers}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/PatriciaBynes/status/501223373318672386”> who couldn’t reach their cars because streets were blocked off or who otherwise didn’t know how to get back home.

“I just felt an obligation to help people, because I knew the side streets and the layout of the land and the shortcuts to be able to get people safely to their cars,” she said. “Especially if they’re black, because I don’t want them to be caught walking the street in the dark and the police think that they’re trying to do something.”

As the violence has continued, however, her friends pushed her to obtain a gas mask and a bulletproof vest. She was reluctant, but finally did so on Sunday.

“Some of my friends, they’re funny. They said, ‘Patricia, we know you’re not going to stop going out there. You’re committed to your community.’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, so don’t tell me to stay home, because I’m not going to listen to you,’” she said.",5,280,NA,NA

Ronda Lee",08/19/14,02/14/17,"I approach this topic as a woman of color. I grew up in racially segregated Chicago. Although it was not the South, there were still neighborhoods where blacks were not welcomed. My first encounter with racism was as an 8-year-old on a family vacation to visit relatives in the South. It soured me on returning, and whenever I hear a certain drawl, it instantly revives memories of our almost-encounter with the KKK. When I was a preteen shopping for an eighth-grade graduation dress in the Chicago suburbs, a white sales associate {refused to serve me and my mom}<hyperlink=”http://ronda-isms.com/2014/03/womens-history-feminism-race-part-2/”>. She told us, “We don’t have anything for boys.” My mom responded, “She is not a boy.” The saleswoman replied, “We don’t have anything for you here.”

Growing up on the far South Side, I recall hearing my dad and other male relatives warn about the danger of being pulled over by police from a certain precinct. {It was notorious}<hyperlink=”http://rondaisms.kinja.com/chicago-at-a-crossroad-1611371057”> for police torture under Police Commander Jon Burge. Many black men were tortured into confessing to crimes they never committed. {They served time for crimes}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/g-flint-taylor/darrell-cannon-case_b_1762150.html”> all under the guise of a traffic-violation pullover.

During my senior year in high school, my family bought a home in a working-class and lower-middle-class neighborhood near Marquette Park. (Marquette Park was {infamous}<hyperlink=”http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-martinlutherking-story-story.html”> for its treatment of Dr. Martin Luther King on his visit to the city.) It was 1988, and we were the first African-American family on the block. It might as well had been the 1960s, because it felt reminiscent of Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun. Our family’s car frequently had slashed tires courtesy of an Archie Bunker-type neighbor. Shortly after moving on the block, while coming home from Sunday evening’s church service, we were pulled over a block from the house. My dad was driving, with Mom in passenger seat and me and my sisters in the back. Dad instructed us to keep quiet and make no sudden movements. The cop approached my dad’s window and asked, “What are you doing in this neighborhood?” My dad explained that we were heading home and lived around the corner. The cop reviewed my dad’s license. He then claimed that he’d pulled my dad over for driving erratically and alleged that my father was drunk. My father had stopped drinking after joining church years earlier. I was 16 and yelled from the back seat, “You’re lying. My dad does not drink or smoke.” My parents shot me a look as if I had just endangered the family. Fortunately my outburst worked. The cop did not give my dad a ticket. He said, “Well, be careful driving.”

When my sister had her boys, I worried for them. Being a black male in the city meant that targeting or profiling by police would be a reality regardless of what you wore or how articulately you spoke. One nephew was tall for his age. By the time he was 11, he was already 6 feet tall. I knew the police would not see an 11-year-old boy but a 6-foot-tall black thug. I began putting my attorney business cards in my nephew’s jackets, backpacks, and jeans. I told him, “If the cops stop you, tell them your name and your address and that your aunt is a lawyer and that you want to speak to your lawyer now. You keep repeating that like you are Rain Man wanting to see Judge Wapner at 3 p.m.”

Shortly after passing the bar exam, I came home from work and changed out of my suit into casual attire. I was living with my parents while apartment hunting. A few minutes after I undressed, there was a knock at the door. Our neighbor, a single mother and practicing nurse, was upset. The cops had shown up and taken her 13-year-old son to the police station and would not let her see him. By this time, the neighborhood was more diverse. The kids on the block were a motley crew of blacks, Hispanics, and whites who played on the sidewalk. They’d been playing football in the street when the cops had arrived, broken up the game, and taken our neighbor’s son to the precinct. I grabbed my attorney credentials and went to the station with the neighbor. Even though I followed protocol, showing my attorney credentials, the cops were rude and belligerent and refused to grant me access to the boy. At that point I told the cop that I wanted his badge number and that of his supervisor to report them. I also let it drop that I worked with Johnnie Cochran. After a few moments the supervising youth officer came and apologized. Why did I have to go through that?!

My personal encounters with the police have not been pleasant, especially when “driving while black.” It usually takes me using the “attorney card” before I am free to go. I recall visits in grammar school from “Officer Friendly.” He would give us tips on how to be safe when walking to and from school. Officer Friendly told us that in an emergency, we should seek out a police officer, because their job was to serve and protect. What ever happened to Officer Friendly?

In Chicago I lived in the South Loop, a few blocks from former Mayor Daley’s residence. One evening I walked into my apartment as it was being robbed. I encountered the robber head-on, and instead of running, I interrogated him. Do not ever do this! Fortunately, I was not injured, but he walked away with my valuables (jewelry given as gifts for graduation and passing the bar). However, the response by police left me speechless. First the cops said that since I was not injured, there was no need for them to come; I could just file a report over the phone. After I insisted, two cops showed up. My white neighbor witnessed part of the robbery and was there when the cops arrived. The cops asked for a description of the robber. As soon as I said, “African-American male about 5-foot-3,” the cops interrupted me, and one cop asked, “Are you sure your boyfriend did not do it?” At that point I was ready to turn into an angry black woman. My neighbor pulled the cops aside and said, “Do you see that degree on the wall? She’s a lawyer. See that picture? That’s her and Johnnie Cochran. I suggest you change your line of questioning.”

Emmett Till, Sean Bell, Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, Michael Brown, Ezell Ford.... When will it stop?! As a black woman I am fearful of giving birth to a son. If my son became a victim of police brutality, it would take all of heaven to stop me from going to the dark side. As an attorney, I know that justice is not blind; it is biased.

It does not matter if people of color are well-dressed or wearing hoodies. There is a societal acceptance of the belief that underneath the suit or hoodie, we are prone to bad behavior.

Yet Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin are a threat to society. Officer Friendly decided not to ruin college for privileged drinking and drugging teens, but ruining the college plans of Michael Brown is OK?

Ferguson police released a video allegedly showing Michael Brown engaged in an aggressive robbery. Even assuming that the person in the video is Michael Brown, that does not negate the wrong done by police. Ferguson police, against DOJ advice, released the video because the press wanted it. Yet when the press wanted the name of the officer who shot Michael Brown six times for walking in the street, they refused to release that information. Let us not forget that a kid is dead for walking in the street!

Since 9/11, we’ve accepted changes in what we will tolerate in government intrusion in our daily lives. There’s been no sustained outcry against government collection of the speech and communications of Americans. Stop-and-frisk had fairly broad support, even within minority communities. And we seem to have collectively shrugged about the way private corporations collect our data and control our communications.

I suspect that we will understand the depth of change in American society only over time, and as a consequence of fear, vigilance, surrender — call it what you will.

Then comes Ferguson.

Suddenly, we see images of police/citizen interaction and we are appalled. No one yet knows how or why Mr. Brown was shot to death. It’s also hard to understand whether the police’s initial refusal to name the shooter was a justified protection in the face of threats, or a double-standard by which police protect their own. But watching police in the dress of soldiers pointing rifles at peaceful protestors, or rousting reporters in a McDonalds, or tear gassing TV cameramen, that hit like a bolt from the blue.

The depth of the reaction is not that we have an isolated example of police excess. It’s that we’ve quietly and without examination created a system of military policing, and bam, we’re watching a new kind of America.

The comparisons with the days of Bull Conner and Selma are inevitable. But this is a new kind of problem as well. We’ve trained our police forces, given them military uniforms and equipment, and encouraged a new kind of relationship between government and governed. And, bam, we don’t like it very much.

How much of this has happened across the nation is unknown. Which departments have tanks and other military paraphernalia? What plans have been developed for their use? Who decides when and how to deploy? What the hell is going on?

This goes much deeper than it first appears. Individual police officers and departments should be held accountable for their mistakes. But the implications of what we’ve done can’t be worked through in the context of an individual tragedy. The president and his congressional supporters like Rand Paul (?) are stepping forward, talking about “demilitarizing” American police. The ironies of this are rare and special. There has always been a connection between the grass-roots Tea Party concerns and progressive values. Limitations on government overreach, as it affects police or government surveillance, are ingrained in the ideology of both movements. An alliance can be forged on this issue if both men and both movements have the courage to work alongside each other.

Political change never comes on a smooth curve. Specific events create almost instantaneous changes in public perception and action follows. That’s what’s going on in Ferguson and across America. We don’t want or need our police to treat citizens the way they are treated in Egypt or Moscow. We, citizens and political leaders, can seize the moment, and reach a new consensus on how to organize our lives in a post-9/11 era, consistent with the constitutional and social genius of the American experience.",NA,NA,NA,54 likes
HuffPost,huff67,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-gershgorn/ferguson-families-look-fo_b_5688854.html,Ferguson Families Look for Their Voice Amid Protest Frenzy,"
Dave Gershgorn",08/18/14,02/14/17,"Ferguson, Mo. — As the roar of protests echoes down W. Florissant Ave., one group struggles to make its voice heard from churches and outside police lines — families of Ferguson.

Bandana-covered faces and militaristic police forces wallpaper national press, but community members looking for meaningful dialogue are often not on the same street. They hold vigils at local churches or wait at home, hoping for a time where they do not need to fear police reprisal.

“You can’t talk about making something better if the people having difficulty are not involved in the process,” county executive Charlie A. Doolie said Friday. Instead of taking to the streets Thursday night, Doolie lead a peaceful march at a local church, where youths shared their thoughts amongst themselves. Police were stationed elsewhere.

It’s important to keep in mind that looters and late-night opportunists clashing with police are a small minority of protesters. Many Ferguson and Florissant residents say that they don’t recognize those who come out after dark, and have been seen looting and throwing smoke canisters back at police.

Families usually clear the streets around 9 p.m., and organized protests subside around 11 or 12 p.m. Those staying out later, and have seen tear gas and smoke thrown by police, are a mix of impassioned youth protesting police brutality and opportunists looking to smash windows and throw tear gas back at police.

“I am Mike Brown. I could be next,” one young black man shouted at a community organizer, trying to disperse a past-curfew crowd Saturday night

Citizens and community leaders have begun flocking to press conferences to ask questions of their local police and state government. Many have children about to enter school, and some have questions about how their families can trust local police.

“I’m a father of seven children who are scared to death, because they don’t know if they can trust the police to protect them,” one local business owner told Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol at a Friday press conference. “I’m scared to death for my children, to explain to my son why his friend, Mike Mike, isn’t here anymore.”

“That bothers me as a parent,” the local barber said, “it doesn’t matter what color you are.”

Until Friday night, when violence started to reappear between protesters and law enforcement, Johnson had been seen as a shining light to the people of Ferguson, as someone the community feels comfortable attempting a dialogue with.

“Our intent means nothing if those are your feelings,” Capt. Johnson replied to the local barber. “That means we need to do a better job. But I can tell you today whenever we walk away from this, and these cameras are gone, this is our opportunity to show you that you can trust us.”

Johnson’s command came days after initial riots and tenuous relations between the citizens and police, and yet the situation has returned to that state. His repeated message of accountability in law enforcement, coupled with community relations seems to have community support.

Tamar Hodges, a nurse who went to McCluer South-Berkeley High School and current law student at Univ. of Missouri, came to the press conference Friday with her young son, Jake, looking for answers from state and local officials.

“While the St.Louis police department and Ferguson police department investigation is being mishandled, I feel like there are a lot of holes and a lot of questions not being answered, but I do sincerely feel Capt. Johnson and Governor Nixon are trying to fill that void and mend it,” Hodges said.

However, Johnson’s presence in the community during the day has waned—Thursday he marched with protesters, yet each successive day he has spent more time away from the streets, in either bureaucratic or tactical conferences.

He is becoming defined by his quick and grim 2:30 a.m. press conferences, where he tallies damages to property and arrests by police.

No matter Johnson’s words and personal actions, residents of Ferguson who have seen their town overrun by military trucks and littered with tear gas canisters cry out for long-term change to their community—and justice for Mike Brown.",NA,NA,NA,43 likes

Sebastian Murdock",08/15/14,02/14/17,"Nearly a week after unarmed teen Michael Brown was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, a witness is getting lots of attention for apparently live tweeting the shooting.

Emanuel Freeman, who goes by the handle {@TheePharoah}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/TheePharoah”>, tweeted photos Aug. 9 appearing to show Brown, 18, lying dead in the street with an officer standing over him.

Freeman’s first tweet said: “I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE OMFG.”

What followed was a picture taken of a man, presumably Brown, face down in the middle of the road.

A barrage of tweets soon followed, with a clearly shaken Freeman saying he was “about to hyperventilate” and that “police just shot someone dead.”

Freeman claimed that Brown’s parents quickly took to the streets, screaming. Later photos he took show cops, police tape, and a sizable crowd.

A standoff emerged between {protestors and police: }<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/09/ferguson-teen-police-shooting_n_5665305.html”>

A crowd quickly gathered at the scene, as did 100 police cars from 15 departments, according to KSDK. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that protesters came face-to-face with police at the site of the shooting, raising their arms and saying “Please don’t shoot me.” A dumpster was reportedly lit on fire. As tempers cooled, mourners participated in a prayer circle and vigil.

With tensions escalating in the hours after the shooting, Freeman shared a photo of an officer carrying what appears to be an assault rifle in the residential neighborhood.

On Friday morning, Police Chief Thomas Jackson {released an incident report}<hyperlink=”https://www.scribd.com/document/236921898/Michael-Brown-Fatal-Shooting”> alleging that Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before he was killed. He also revealed for the first time the identity of the cop who fatally shot Brown, Officer Darren Wilson.

According to the police report, Brown stole a box of Swisher Sweets and “forcefully pushed [the cashier] back in to a display rack” as he left.

Despite the alleged crime, Jackson said {the robbery was not relevant}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/michael-brown-stole-cigars_n_5682089.html”> to the fatal shooting. Critics fault the police for discussing the alleged robbery while {withholding information}<hyperlink=”http://gawker.com/wheres-the-incident-report-from-michael-browns-killing-1622199327”> about Wilson shooting Brown.

Wilson did not know about Brown’s alleged robbery when he fatally shot him, Jackson said in a press conference on Friday.

Jackson said Brown had been stopped by Wilson for being “in the middle of the street, blocking traffic.”

Wilson, a 28-year-old white man who’s served six years on the force, {has now fled his home}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/”> with his family, according to USA Today.

Basil Kincaid",08/18/14,02/14/17,"Long is the suffering of Open eyes,Ones that see the last flickers of light as another brother dies,taken from the night like a star in broad day.

We are plucked from obscurity like wild flowers upon open fields,to be mist not missed when our blood or pollen spilled.

Longsuffering is Aceboon to the Conscious Coon,up late nights connecting the dots through time, to realize that we are still but strange fruit on the vine.

Sun-ripened, a delicacy, the consumption of whom comes with paid leave, witness protection and organs for collection.

Bodies stuffed with papers, our lungs choked with vapors, gun smoke, tear gas, powder charge,Arteries charred, lips stained with the words: “No,” “Please don’t,” “I’m unarmed,”Bleeding from the back and head, body gone but spirit spread,Through us all, emboldening our spirits to face dread.

Now see black stars swirling as binary and tertiary stars forming systems that undulate, uniting to ancient rhythms.

We all feel it now, it is time to open our eyes, abre los ojos, wake the love inside.

To see through now into the eyes of the past and future,Into the eyes of those that died, all those mothers and brothers and Sisters that shed tears like crystal rain, cutting the eyes and constituent veins, into the eyes of longsuffering and all the rest of the like that grow in fear because I could be next or one of our peers,Sadly we never take it personal until it could happen to any of us individually,What happened to WE?

Humanity, we know the wealth of infinity and the love of community.

The time is now for tired eyes to unite making light the longsuffering,by sharing the weight of the harsh light of day by which my brothers are taken away.

Let the silent ones fall, nay! Let us all raise our voices!

The names, the dates, the places,Let them resound in echo chambers.

Grant our messages of love and unity rides on the wings of butterflies,To the tired eyes of long suffering, that they may rise.

We believe so firmly in this illusion of separation when the times haven’t changed because there is no “time,” this is all an extension of one moment too grand for the confines of our limited perception.The same backs are bent by the barrel, the same bodies slain, severed, lacerated by the swinging bilateral pendulum of hatred and indifference.

Humanity originated in dark majesty, we remember the love of the open plains, all humans know the quiet truth, that we all share an essence, that kernel soul, that seed soul, that beating drum that rings us awake to see the routine nature of this perpetual tragedy throughout time.

No longer do we need nooses and ropes, trees and picnics,We got guns, badges, legal-tricks and twitter pics.

New age nooses and not until now have we seemed to see this nuisance?

In this longsuffering we’d grown numb to the drum bang of that barrel hum,Numb to the cops and the blows of tazer, fist and baton,Numb to the lullaby of sirens we hear every night,halting sleep, boosting fright.

Now we are Awake!Will all of America unite when an innocent American is Killed?A flower plucked from obscurity, a star taken by the light of day.What happens when the cops forget the rules and take the lives of kids coming home from white schools? Death tolls roll as blood poolsLeft for four hours, long enough for the media vultures to attempt to devour, not only his flesh but his Character.

Long is the suffering of a little girl who, on her stoop, writes a poem, shes 13, her third eye say:“They’re killin’ us,” “We’re parasites to them”

The proof of this is in the film, Burning negativity into negatives.

Then once light is shed and the stories read, we see in their combination that nothing has in fact changed except the faces and names, cut, paste, saved, reframed, yet hopefully we are now sufficiently enraged to take NOW into our own hands and raise them! channeling anger into organization, turning desperation into patience, turning beating hearts into drum beats in the streets, Hands Raised, we will change this nation, Hands Raised we will change the station from lies and false creations, in this we are awakened, raise your tongues, your pens and brushes, ready your dancing shoes for the long walk to freedom.

It begins now, in this very moment, in cutting ourselves from the comfort of our current contexts, looking through those residual port holes to see then and them, that fought this fight before us. We are all responsible for our silence in the face of injustice. Rise tired eyes.Rise and unite to light the weight of your longsuffering. Rise!",NA,130,NA,547 likes

Justin C. Young",08/19/14,02/14/17,"I went to sleep with a heavy heart about the events unfolding in Ferguson, Missouri, after the shooting death of Michael Brown and the subsequent aftermath that transformed from peaceful protest to militarized police occupation of this small town in Middle America. I woke up this morning still unsettled as the violence and the occupation continued to progress, with even the National Guard being called in. We heard from the governor of Missouri; the police chief of Ferguson; the captain of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, Ronald S. Johnson; and the president. I’m disheartened and frustrated. What we also heard was the anger, desperation, and pleas for the respect for black life from the people of Ferguson.

I watched President Obama’s press conference the other day waiting to hear what he would say about the situation. It was interesting how the press conference covered two seemingly disparate topics. It was a bizarre parallel of the military effort utilized to rescue Iraqi citizens stranded on a mountaintop while a militarized police force continued to target American citizens here in the United States. It was the typical restrained response on race that we get from the president, but instead uttered by a more tired man with more grey in his hair. He appears to be a man who seems quite weary of a topic that is becoming all too common, yet, again, as if some shared African-American truth is desperately trying to escape his lips, freeing a pained aspect of his psyche not just as a black man but as an American and as the president of a nation in strife. You think his foreign policy is troubled? Think about the challenges of the first black president silenced by political gamesmanship and partisan tactics when it comes to openly discussing the obvious problems with this current racial quagmire in Ferguson.

So if we’re calling in the National Guard and asking the question about how to deescalate this situation in Ferguson and turn the tide, we must find out how to deescalate this ongoing legacy of racism and aggression towards black men in our country. The most poignant thing that President Obama said during {his Ferguson statement last week}<hyperlink=” https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-president-obamas-remarks-on-unrest-in-ferguson-mo-and-iraq/2014/08/14/c8ce971e-23c7-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?utm_term=.9ee8dac0d653”> was:

[L]et’s remember that we’re all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law, basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest, a reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us, and the need for accountability when it comes to our government. So now’s the time for healing.

In another statement, earlier this week, he {reiterated}<hyperlink=” https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000003062330/obama-calls-for-peace-again-in-ferguson.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%222%22%3A%22RI%3A18%22}”>, “Let’s seek to heal.”

How do you convince the people of Ferguson that we’re one American family? How do you convince Michael Brown’s grieving parents of our common values and equality under the law? Does the president even believe that what he said is actually true? The healing hasn’t happened yet because old wounds were never resolved, and much was reopened with the death of another young black man at the hands of a police officer. The struggle is absolutely real, and we will not become post-racial unless we talk about all the issues openly. Some examples of pointed statements that I wish we heard more of are from {Melissa Harris-Perry}<hyperlink=” http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/16/melissa-harris-perry-black-men-killed-by-police_n_5684588.html”> and the actor {Jesse Williams}<hyperlink=” http://jezebel.com/jesse-williams-on-ferguson-we-are-not-treated-like-hum-1623217610”>. Those clips carry a passion that I wish the president could convey, and I hope they encourage others, of all races, to say and do more.

Our metric for equality and improved race relations needs to change, as the current form of racism has mutated into something quite insidious under the guise of political correctness and assumed progress. Much like a virus, as our plans and strategies for combating racism have evolved, the infectious nature of racism has adapted into something more virulent and deadly. As the videos, posts, and tweets come flooding in from Ferguson by civilians and reporters in a flood of collective first-hand reporting, much like in Egypt under its recent revolution and government overthrow, you have to finally start to believe that all of this is not just some figment of black imagination. Our lives as African-Americans are worth more than the irrational fear of us! There are things to be scared of: king cobras, deep space, the growing scourge of obesity, peanut allergies, racism. The irrationality of this phobia and presumed doom at the hands of a black man is now causing harmful and deadly reactions, bolstered by institutionalized, systemic policies of bias and double standards.

As the protests spread across the country, calling for peace, I’m heartened by the variety of faces that are present. Deescalate your fear, deescalate your discomfort, deescalate your white privilege, deescalate your guilt, deescalate your anger, and scale up your courage to take this head-on. We all need to. Just think about it! This should be a national discussion; this should be a unifying national movement.

(Remember the media frenzy around {Baby Jessica}<hyperlink=” http://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-epic-rescue-of-jessica-mcclure-vol-28-no-18/”>?)

What does it say about our country and our cultural blind spot on gun violence and the murder of our children? This leaves us all vulnerable in a way that we have never known. So when a black teenager dies at the hands of a police officer, this is the response and reaction. What if Michael Brown was your brother, your friend, or your son? So, do you feel that?

Meredith Melnick",08/14/14,02/14/17,"Internationally, tear gas is commonly used. Last night on Twitter, for example, residents of Gaza {were offering advice}<hyperlink=” http://www.geek.com/news/thanks-to-social-media-gaza-is-helping-ferguson-protesters-deal-with-tear-gas-1602022/”> to Ferguson’s protestors on how to withstand and protect against injury from the stuff.

“I’m very concerned about the increased use, and the much laxer attitude we’ve developed towards the potential health effects,” Sven-Eric Jordt, a scientist at Duke University who researches tear gas, {told Vox}<hyperlink=” http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6001995/ferguson-missouri-tear-gas-painful/in/5757650”>.

There are a few different types of tear gas, especially if you include in the taxonomy related compounds, like mace and pepper spray, though the two most commonly used for crowd dispersal are referred to as CS and OC, for oleoresin capsicum.

OC, just like pepper spray, is made of chili pepper oil at a concentration so profoundly strong it scores up to 5.3 million Scoville units, as Deborah Blum explains on her PLOS Blog, {Speakeasy Science}<hyperlink=” http://blogs.plos.org/speakeasyscience/2011/11/20/about-pepper-spray/”>. What’s more, OC isn’t just the capsicum oil.

{According to research Blum found}<hyperlink=” http://blogs.plos.org/speakeasyscience/2011/11/20/about-pepper-spray/”>, conducted by scientists at Duke and the University of North Carolina, OC spray also often includes a liquid solvent and a propellant. Options for propellants on the toxic menu include nitrogen, carbon dioxide and halogenated hydrocarbons (like the absolutely icky {Freon}<hyperlink=” https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca”>). “Inhalation of high doses of some of these chemicals can produce adverse cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic effects, including arrhythmias and sudden death,” wrote the researchers.

The tear gas known as CS has a chemical base called 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile. It differs from OC in its 30- to 60-second {delay in setting in}<hyperlink=” http://gizmodo.com/what-tear-gas-does-to-its-victims-1621571660”>, according to Gizmodo. Unlike the capsicum, CS reacts when wetted by the delicate areas of a person’s face — eyes, mouth, respiratory tract, sweating skin — and can amplify the effects of the chemical.
Jordt {told Vox}<hyperlink=” http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6001995/ferguson-missouri-tear-gas-painful/in/5757650”>:

The way these gases work, and this is what we do research on, is that they activate pain receptors — the pain sensing nerves in our body. The cornea is densely covered with these receptors. When tear gas activates these pain receptors, that leads to body reflexes like profuse tear secretion and a muscle cramp in the eyelid that causes them to close. These are all protective responses that the body has to pain, and with the gas they become extremely exaggerated.

There are situations where this can be very dangerous or lethal. If somebody has asthma, for example, or a hypersensitivity or an airwave disease that can be very dangerous.

It should be noted here that the St. Louis metro area {has an adult asthma rate}<hyperlink=” http://health.mo.gov/living/healthcondiseases/chronic/asthma/pdf/StLouisMetroRegion.pdf”> of just over 10 percent and a childhood asthma rate of 14 percent — the highest in the state and {above the national average}<hyperlink=” https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/tables_graphs.htm”>.

Many protestors recommend using milk or Coke to counteract the burning sensation of tear gas, possibly because these contain neutralizing acids, {according to Slate}<hyperlink=” http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/02/numb_and_coke.html”>. A paper published in the BMJ revealed that in extreme cases, those suffering the ill effects of tear gas may require chemical decontamination at a hospital or {even ventilation support}<hyperlink=” http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b2283”> for those with respiratory complications.

In 2012, the organization Physicians for Human Rights {called for a policy group to address the use of tear gas, which is classified as non-lethal}<hyperlink=” http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/press/press-releases/bahrain-uses-tear-gas-as-lethal-weapon.html#sthash.slU3yx7j.dpuf?referrer=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/tear-gas-dangerous_n_5679228.html”>, because of some health concerns.

“It is increasingly evident that tear gas has effects far more severe than commonly understood,” said the organization’s deputy director Richard Sollom at the time. “The tears it produces are not limited to those caused by temporary stinging of the eyes, but flow also from people who receive long-lasting injuries and trauma from its indiscriminate use, and from friends and relatives of tear gas victims left blind, wounded, or dead. The world must consider whether it is appropriate to use such toxic chemical agents at all against unarmed civilian populations.”",2,140,NA,NA

The fact that Mike Brown was shot at least 6 times doesn’t register as overkill, even when two of those shots were in the head. They will also extend effort to paint Ferguson as a ghetto, where this kind of thing happens all the time. Nope. Ferguson, Missouri had zero murders.

The “Police Are the Good Guys” Troll
These folks have a blissfully naïve version of police in their heads, the one fed to them since they were children that says police are the good guys and that no matter what they do, they must have had a reason. These people have no concept — or pretend to have no concept — of the depth of white supremacy and the way it is ingrained in every facet of our culture... even our police. Because they believe the police are always right — and usually because they also believe that groups of black people are inherently violent — they have no qualms about police dressed in military gear, sitting on tanks and tear-gassing American citizens. ‘Murica. You may also hear these trolls say, “What about due process?” Well... we would proceed with due process. If they would actually arrest Darren Wilson. Which they haven’t. So...

The “Violence Just Begets More Violence” Troll
These people are the {riot-shamers}<hyperlink=”http://www.bgdblog.org/2014/08/things-stop-distracted-black-person-gets-murdered-police/”>. They roll out the word “looters!” at every chance and are not interested in the fact that only a small number of people at the protests have actively looted, or that Ferguson protestors actually locked arms to prevent said looting. These trolls hide behind anonymous accounts, they masquerade as sane coworkers, and they work for CNN and other major media outlets. They focus on the “unrest” in Ferguson and talk about it out of context in an attempt to 1) divert attention away from the killing of an unarmed black teenager and/or 2) disguise their lack of critical thought. As Mia McKenzie of Black Girl Dangerous said so well in this {post}<hyperlink=”http://www.bgdblog.org/2014/08/things-stop-distracted-black-person-gets-murdered-police/”>:

“a community pushing back against a murderous police force that is terrorizing them is not a ‘riot.’ It’s an uprising. It’s a rebellion. It’s a community saying We can’t take this anymore. We won’t take it. It’s people who have been dehumanized to the point of rightful rage. And it happens all over the world. Uprisings and rebellions are necessary and inevitable, locally and globally. This is not to say that actual riots don’t happen. White folks riot at sporting events, for example. Riots happen. But people rising up in righteous anger and rage in the face of oppression should not be dismissed as simply a ‘riot.’”

The Concern Troll
These are among the more passive aggressive trolls you will encounter. They not only target victims like Mike Brown with statements like “I wish he hadn’t stolen those cigars: he might be alive,” but target the community as well, saying things like “Should they really be out there protesting with little kids? I worry about that kind of parenting.”

Let me make one thing clear in case you weren’t sure: these people aren’t worried about the children of Ferguson. They’re not actually “concerned” at all,” despite their title. These people employ words like “worry” and “I wish” and “concern” to communicate their disapproval of black people doing anything besides playing the {Martin Baker}<hyperlink=”http://www.ibtimes.com/who-martin-baker-darren-wilson-supporter-faces-twitter-backlash-1660822”> role. If they were actually concerned, they would see the images of police with hidden badge numbers, tear-gassing eight-year old girls, and be concerned about the escalation of violence police in Ferguson are responsible for.

The “But What About Black on Black Crime!” Troll
Yes, 85 percent of violent crime against black people is perpetuated by other black people. But guess what? The exact same is true for violent crime committed against white people: the vast majority of those crimes are committed by other white people. People who use the term “black on black crime” either 1) work for Fox News, 2) are seeking to portray black people as violent and out of control, and/or 3) seek to portray black people as only caring about black lives when there is a way to blame white people. Let’s run that back: 1) If they work for Fox News...you already know. 2) If we’re going to make sweeping statements about people being violent and out of control, perhaps we should focus on young {white males}<hyperlink=”http://www.salon.com/2013/11/01/why_is_always_a_white_guy_the_roots_of_modern_violent_rage/”>. 3) Anyone who would fit with #3 is not interested in facts, otherwise they would be aware of the vast number of organizations and movements to end gun violence in black neighborhoods... spearheaded by black people. The real motivation behind this troll (and all of them really) is to distract from the matter at hand, and that’s that an unarmed black teen is dead.

The “Don’t Make This A Racial Issue!” Troll
These are the pearl-clutchers. “This could have happened to anyone! Let’s not make this a racial issue and instead focus on getting this cop off the street!” Yes, we should focus on getting this cop off the street, but we must also focus on the conditions that made this killing possible, and that is one of racism, white supremacy, and police violence that has been being built and rebuilt since the birth of this country. No, this wouldn’t have just happened to anyone. A black male is killed by police every 28 hours in America. This is a racial issue.

These trolls will also accuse you of being racist for talking about racism and start quoting to you all the times black people perpetuated “reverse racism” against white people. Suggested action? Block and keep it moving.

The Misinformation Bots
These are particularly dangerous and I have seen a lot of them in the past week. I won’t speculate on where they come from — although I have a fairly good idea — but their sole purpose is to spread misinformation about Mike Brown and Darren Wilson, targeting people tweeting under the #Ferguson and #MikeBrown hashtags and sending them to false articles on homemade websites about alternate eyewitnesses that saw Brown attack Wilson, etc. Don’t engage with these people: they likely get paid for it. Report them as spam and, you guessed it: keep it moving.

The “I Wish We Could All Just Get Along” Troll
These trolls might mean well. They might. But that doesn’t mean they’re not trolls. You post/tweet an article and they tweet back, “This is all really bad, but I wish this wasn’t happening. Can’t we all just get along?” They’re trolling you. We all wish we could get along. But right now a boy is dead and is receiving no justice by the system that supposedly exists to protect him. Injecting Pollyanna-isms aren’t helping anyone. If you really want to help and the frontlines aren’t for you, just donate to the {Michael Brown Memorial Fund}<hyperlink=”http://www.salon.com/2013/11/01/why_is_always_a_white_guy_the_roots_of_modern_violent_rage/”>. And stay out of the way.

This isn’t an exhaustive list. When a black person is killed in America, trolls come out of the woodwork in an attempt to justify or distract from the taking of that life. After finishing this post, I’m not even sure “troll” is the right word, but I’m not sure if I have a better one either. Weights, perhaps. Cinder blocks shackled to the rising tide of Americans who want better, believe in better; who see the killing of another black kid in America and say “enough.” These people are not merely trolls. “Troll” implies something harmless, a faceless entity in the underbelly of the Internet. These people are not harmless. They are part of the problem. Unfortunately I don’t have a solution for the problem they pose: they are not interested in self-education. They are not interested in empathy. They are not interested in challenging the worldview that has tucked them in at night and told them the police are here for our protection and that black people deserve what they get. They are interested only in standing very still, while the rest of us move forward. All I can say is this: move on without them. Block, report, and move on without them.

No, it is a police officer. Your local police officer can engage you — one-on-one, every day of the week, anywhere and any place. Your local police officer has the authority and power to take your life; and more often than not, get away with it; particularly if you happen to be a black or brown male in our society.

And how does it, all too often occur, that a police officer — most often a white police office — happens to shoot and kill or otherwise brutalize a black or brown male? Because by doing nothing when our local police officers engage in everyday minor, but insidious wrongdoing — most often directed at black and brown community residents, we enable and embolden all law enforcement personnel to believe that any wrongful conduct is acceptable simply because they wear a badge. They assume and too many in our society accept that, because they are police officers, our Constitutional constraints, under which they are sworn to perform, do not also apply to them even though they apply to each and every other American citizen.

So when I discuss the civil rights issues we tackled yesterday and the civil rights issues we confront today, including those that focus on law enforcement, I constantly advance the position that, while everything has changed, nothing has changed.

When the race riots of the 1960s occurred in communities across the nation, President Lyndon Baines Johnson appointed a commission, chaired by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner. My mentor, the Honorable Nathaniel R. Jones, served as an Assistant Counsel on the staff of this commission before he assumed the position of General Counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and then was appointed by former President Jimmy Carter to the federal Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.The Kerner Commission Report concluded that the trigger for the riots — throughout the country — invariably derived from confrontations between the local police and members of local African-American communities. It also concluded that the residents’ held an often justified perception of the largely white police as an occupying force which was in the community to serve and protect the interests of the privileged white communities rather than to serve and protect the legitimate interests of the local minority residents and that the police inherently harbored racist attitudes toward residents of minority communities that they were also charged to serve.

Moreover, the Commission found that the underlying conditions in the making over decades — in fact, over centuries — in African-American communities provided the context for the precipitating trigger incidents of the unrest in the 1960s: racially segregated communities, inferior schools, high unemployment, and insufficient or inadequate governmental responses and attention to community needs leading those who resided in minority communities to suffer from a societal-imposed color “cast” status. They became victims of what the Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, in her award-winning novel, Americanah, more recently described as the “oppressive lethargy of choicelessness” — a choicelessness growing out of government sanctioned inequality and second-class citizenship and a choicelessness that was waiting to explode.

Do these findings of the 1968 Kerner Commission sound familiar in 2014?

So, I urge President Barack Obama to revisit the Kerner Commission, some 50 years later; and to ascertain where — if anywhere — we have come since the founding of our nation with its original sin (slavery and its ongoing legacy); and where we have yet to go, since we are far, far from having arrived at a “more perfect union.”

What to do?

I propose that President Obama appoint a Commission, chaired by not one governor, but by two former presidents — Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, under the auspices of the Carter Center and the George W. Bush Library; and comprised of distinguished and diverse members such as Governor Deval Patrick, Oprah Winfrey, Henry Cisneros, Retired Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, John Paul Stevens, David Souter, former Attorney General Janet Reno, to be supported by a staff of highly respected and renown professionals from all walks of life to address and to courageously face our past and our present in order to plot our course forward.

While everything changes, the one constant that has not changed is the deeply embedded institutional and individual attitudinal racism that pervades our country. The fact remains that the impetus for local community explosions — racism — almost always is triggered by a confrontation between police officers (most often white) and black and brown males — youth and men, alike.

In 1852, at the Friends House in Rochester, NY, Fredrick Douglass stated in his historic address entitled, What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?, that “We must do with the past only as we make it useful to the present and the future.” Such is as true today as it was in 1852.

 [tweetbegin 498892967231238144 tweetend]

This is by no means standard media protocol, but it happens frequently, deliberately or not. News reports often headline claims from police or other officials that appear unsympathetic or dismissive of black victims. Other times, the headlines seem to suggest that black victims are to blame for their own deaths, engaging in what critics sometimes allege is a form of character assassination. When contrasted with media portrayal of white suspects and accused murderers, the differences are more striking. News outlets often choose to run headlines that exhibit an air of disbelief at an alleged white killer’s supposed actions. Sometimes, they appear to go out of their way to boost the suspect’s character, carrying quotes from relatives or acquaintances that often paint even alleged murderers in a positive light.

Marianne Williamson",08/18/14,02/15/17,"Our current racial dramas have their roots hundreds of years ago, and nothing less than pulling out those roots will heal the situation today. America needs to reconcile with our racial history — seeking genuine atonement and making meaningful amends. Until such time, tortured race relations will continue to plague us with more and more tragic results.

It’s interesting that we even use the phrase “race relations,” given how little we register that this is even about a relationship. The relationship between blacks and whites as groups in America is psychologically and emotionally dysfunctional, to say the least, and until this is dealt with on the level of the cause and not just effects, we will continue to play out over and over again the cycle of violence at its core.

It’s difficult to deal emotionally with the history of slavery in America, which is why many whites have chosen not to. Yet it’s imperative that we do, because until we see clearly the line of development leading from slavery to the Civil War to the Ku Klux Klan to the civil rights movement to “benign neglect” to the “prison-industrial complex,” America will continue to misunderstand the real problem. This is not just about how many bullets were shot into Michael Brown. The shots that matter most here are way, way too many to count.

Slavery existed in slave owning states in America beginning in the 1600s, increased significantly with the expansion of the cotton industry in the early 1800s, and did not end until the passage of the 13th Amendment in 1865. When finally freed, the slave population in America at that time was somewhere around 4 million.

But the legacy of the Civil War did not end at Appomattox. The stroke of a presidential signature on the Emancipation Proclamation, even an amendment to the Constitution, could end the evil of an external institution but not the pathology that produced it. External remedies do not of themselves address internal causes. Slavery ended but the racism that gave rise to it did not, only burrowing more deeply into the fabric of Southern society after the Civil War.

During the Reconstruction Era from 1865 to 1877, with federal troops stationed throughout their states, a vanquished South had to come to terms with the fact that they had lost the war. With Lincoln’s assassination, gone was the voice proclaiming “malice towards none, and charity for all.” Bitterness over having had to go through what they went through to win the war was the main emotional tone of the North, and the humiliation of defeat was the main emotional tone of the South.

With their painful defeat came the eradication of the South’s primary economic engine, all social and political privilege, and an entire way of life. In addition, carpetbaggers descended from the North to loot, manipulate, and take whatever advantage possible of an already devastated population. Had Lincoln lived, things might have gone very differently. But he did not.

Many in the South, not surprisingly, then turned their rage at having lost the war against the people whom they saw as its cause. The last thing certain Southerners were ready to do was concede true equality of social status to blacks. And thus began an era of white supremacy in the American South, which was almost as ugly as slavery itself.

If slavery marked Phase 1 of America’s black-white relationship, then the reign of white supremacy after the Civil War marked Phase 2.

Former slave owners had not necessarily awakened to the deep humanity of African-Americans; they simply could no longer own them. Their sense of entitlement and the violence it spawned simply morphed into new forms. Groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, founded in the 1860s, began a wave of terror in which lynching — hangings carried out by angry mobs — of black Americans as well as of whites seeking to help them became common. Once federal troops were withdrawn from the Southern states in 1877 and White Supremacists regained control of Southern State legislatures, blacks were routinely intimidated and attacked to prevent their voting in state and federal elections. Violence around elections became normal, with lynching reaching a peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the period between 1890 and1908, southern legislatures passed new constitutions and electoral rules to disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites. They enacted a series of segregation and Jim Crow laws to enforce second-class status against blacks.

The horrors of institutionalized white supremacy were ultimately met and repudiated by the rise of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement during the 1960s. Their struggle, of course, was not easy, and Dr. King received both professionally and personally the full force of supremacist rage. From the lynching of integration rights workers, to police brutality, to church bombings, and ultimately the murder of Dr. King, the white supremacist movement did not go down quietly. Love is the only force that is powerful enough to overcome hate, and Dr. King displayed that love with the full force of his being. His non-violent message struck the heart of a nation, ultimately awakening America to the need for federal civil rights legislation. And it came to pass.

A cursory reading of history might lead one to think, “So then it was all handled, right?” But unfortunately the answer is no. The monster of racism clearly has many heads, and every time one has been bitten off, another one has arisen. The hot violence of slavery was replaced by the burrowing violence of white supremacy, which was then replaced by the cold violence of benign neglect.

Thus began Phase 3 of our tortured race relationship. “Benign neglect” is a phrase first articulated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan when he was Urban Affairs Advisor to President Richard Nixon, arguing that the drama of the Civil Rights movement should be followed by a period of more or less quiet in the relationship between blacks and whites. It was not necessarily a proactively racist sentiment on Moynihan’s part, or even on Nixon’s. But it was an abandonment of a healing process nevertheless, and in that sense at least a passive betrayal of the relationship. To say to a formerly enslaved population, “Be glad! You’re not slaves anymore, and you’re not going to be routinely lynched or kept from voting!” — while good, indeed very good — was still not restitution. And nothing short of restitution will constitute a real amends and redeem the soul of America. It wasn’t enough that slaves in America were freed. The question remains: What were they freed to?

Civil rights legislation, with its signature Voting Rights Act, was extremely important in integrating African-Americans into the voting pool. But of itself it did little to integrate African-Americans into America’s economy. And people who are left out economically are left out, period. The era of race relations post-civil rights movement has paralleled the advancement of American society in general, in which a relatively small part of our population — blacks, as well as whites — has done very well, while the majority has hardly moved forward at all. “Blacks go to Harvard; blacks get rich; see, a black man became president!” is now the mantra used to justify a continuation of a policy of benign neglect. The fact that geniuses can make it in America doesn’t of itself mean that social justice exists in America. Not everyone is a genius, but everyone should matter.

Yes, it is true — and very much to be celebrated — that blacks have opportunities in America today unheard of 50 years ago, but that of itself does not constitute full economic justice. The poor in America are all benignly neglected now. As long as 1 percent of our people control 40 percent of our wealth and 60 percent of our people live on 2.3 percent of our wealth, economic justice for the majority of Americans of any color isn’t even on the short list of our national priorities.

One in five American children live in poverty today, making us the second highest child poverty rate in the advanced world. Among black children, however, the poverty rate hovers at 40 percent. A black male has a one in three lifetime probability of incarceration in the United States, lending credence to Michelle Alexander’s description of America’s “cradle to prison pipeline.” These problems are not discreet and newly formed; they are the continuation, the legacies, of a situation that began in the 1600s and still plagues us today. It’s not as though the situation finally erupted into violence on the streets of Ferguson. The situation erupts into violence in the hearts of black mothers and fathers all over America every day, as they teach their children — particularly their sons — how to behave in order to avoid the unequal application of criminal justice in America. For America has fallen into a terrible pattern in the area of race, as in so many others: don’t heal the disease, just suppress or seek to eradicate the systems. The message communicated by most governmental action is this: “Don’t keep blacks down, necessarily — just don’t lift them up. The geniuses among them will make their way. If and when they complain or act out, we have police and prisons to show ‘em who’s boss.”

Yet heal the disease we must. And the most significant healing of any societal woe emerges from justice done. Blacks in America have been trained to ask for so little, as though God knows, we’ve done enough. We’ve done enough, white America..? What, in the name of God, have we done? We spend millions on anti-poverty programs and billions on prisons. In fact, we haven’t even apologized. It’s much easier for someone to forgive you when you’ve had the courtesy to apologize, and much easier for them to get over it if you’ve had the decency to fix the problem.
We need to apologize, and we need to make genuine amends. America needs to pay long overdue war reparations, and until we do, we will not move forward in any meaningful way. America needs more than forgiveness; we need genuine repentance, and restitution for our national sins.

In the 1990s, Bill Clinton suggested we have a “national conversation about race,” suggesting perhaps that if we talk about it enough then maybe the problem will go away. But it’s difficult to have an authentic conversation when half of the people involved in the dialogue have over two hundred years of understandable rage to express. There are situations in life — and race in America is one of them — where talk without action does not heal a wound, but only exacerbates it. Whites and blacks have a relationship in America, but it is an unequal one. One side owes something to the other, and until the debt is paid, the relationship will remain unhealed. The very mention of actually paying something back to people we enslaved for two hundred fifty years is still not on the table, not really. And until it is, then America will not be free.

America spends over $600 billion a year on defense. Over $1 trillion has been spent on the Iraq War, seen now to have been the biggest foreign policy blunder in America’s history. Yet no one ever asked if we “could afford it.” So it should not be considered unreasonable to suggest that America put $200 billion toward a Reparations Plan For African Americans: an educational, economic and cultural fund to be disbursed over a ten year period by a council of esteemed African American leaders. Not piecemeal things, like Affirmative Action. But the real deal — in a big way — with the emotional, economic and social magnitude it deserves. Incremental changes often add up to no fundamental change at all.

Reparations are not a radical idea; they’re considered a basic tenet of social and political policy throughout the world. Why should America not pay reparations to the descendants of slaves who were brought to America against their will, used as slaves to build the Southern economy into a huge economic force, and then freed into a culture of further violence perpetrated against them? It’s not as though all that’s over now; if anything, the problem has grown within the cells and psyches of every generation since. America will continue to waste money on relatively limited fixes, until we buck up and pay this debt in a real way once and for all. Millions are indeed wasted if the billions we owe here are not paid. A Reparations Plan would provide a massive investment in educational and economic opportunities for African Americans — rendered as payment for a long overdue debt. Until that debt is paid, the cycle of violence that began in the 1600s and continues to this day will continue to haunt our psyche and disrupt our social good. It is time for America to atone for our past in both word and deed, and to heal our weary soul.",NA,2700,NA,NA

HuffPost,huff79,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/kids-at-ferguson_n_5688393.html,‘I Want Them To Know They Were There’: Parents And Their Kids At The Ferguson Protests,"
Catherine Pearson",08/18/14,02/15/17,"Kendra Pierson, 36, and her sons, ages 6 and 2, joined a crowd of men, women and families in their hometown of Atlanta on Thursday for a moment of silence to honor Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. earlier this month.

Attending the vigil wasn’t an easy decision for Pierson, and she was uncertain they would go until the last minute. She drove past the crowd first to gauge its safety, and remained on the fringes in case she and her children needed to make a fast exit. Ultimately, however, Pierson felt she and her sons needed to be there.

“My boys are adorable … white ladies say that all the time, but I know they won’t always be ‘adorable,’” Pierson told The Huffington Post. “When they’re 17, people might see them as threats and clutch their purses.”

“It was important for them to be there,” she added. “When they look back, in 10 years or five years, I want them to know they were there.”

In the days and weeks since Brown’s death, protests have spread beyond Ferguson to cities like Atlanta, New York and Los Angeles, where thousands have gathered in solidarity. Many attendees are parents, like Pierson, who have their children in tow and who struggled with the wisdom of that decision.

 “I don’t think that is inherently a good or bad thing,” Jamie Howard, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute in New York City, said of bringing children to protests. “It depends on certain factors, and one is the tone and climate.” If protests are dangerous or aggressive, parents should use their judgement and keep their children away, she urged.

But in Ferguson, where the tone of protests has varied widely, it can be extremely difficult for parents to determine what’s best. “It is not unusual to see some people carrying handguns, while only a block away parents push their toddlers in strollers,” {The New York Times reported on Saturday}<hyperlink=”https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/us/lack-of-leadership-and-a-generational-split-hinder-protests-in-ferguson.html”>. The Huffington Post’s Amanda Terkel {reported an 8-year-old boy}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/ferguson-protests_n_5686601.html”> was hit by tear gas during a rally on Sunday.

Betsy Reznicek, 35, drove 30 minutes from her home in St. Louis County to Ferguson on Saturday afternoon to attend a vigil where Michael Brown was shot to death, as well as a subsequent rally. She brought her 6-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son, as well as a friend who had her children with her.

“I had a conversation with my husband, and we thought Saturday might be a good day,” Reznicek said. “We talked about the possibility of [going sooner], but for a variety of reasons we didn’t.” Reznicek — who has attended rallies and protests with her children in the past — was familiar with the organizers of the event, and knew she would be with friends, in daylight. She said she felt safe.

“We knew what was happening was far too important not to go,” Reznicek said.

Indeed, many parents — having determined an event will be safe, and will not overly expose their child to upsetting news — see attending a protest as an invaluable learning experience, said Dr. Lloyd Sederer, medical director of the New York State Office of Mental Health and The Huffington Post’s mental health editor.

“Is it a teachable moment? Is this something the child’s own moral growth would benefit from?” Sederer asked. “If parents believe it is, then it’s very reasonable to bring a child.”

The key, Sederer said, is for parents to make sure they tailor their explanation to their child’s age. To a younger child, parents might say something along the lines of, “There are some sad, bad things that happen and good people are responding, and you’re with us and we’re going to take care of you,” he suggested.

Children ages 10, 11 and 12 are very concerned with fairness, added Howard, and parents may want to frame the protest in that light, while parents of teenagers can delve into more abstract issues.
“In general, we say to be brief and honest and focus on answering their questions rather than trying to put yourself in their head and figure out what their questions are,” Howard said. “Sometimes we project adult questions into children’s minds.”

Reznicek told her 3-year-old they were going to the vigil to support all kinds of people and to say a prayer for a boy who was killed. She talked to her 6-year-old about “how people are treated differently based on the color of their skin,” and how “we have an opportunity to stand up for other people when we see injustice.” At the vigil, their attention drifted in and out.

“They were really focused on the fact that people were giving out free food,” Reznicek laughed. “But then when certain things happened — a group of guys on motorcycles did a rolling tribute, that got their attention. But then they went back to arguing about who got to ride in the stroller.”

Pierson did not tell either of her sons about what they were doing or why they had attended the Atlanta protest.

“They played in the dirt, they played with friends, they had fun,” Pierson said. “I didn’t impress upon them what was going on.” When they are older, she will talk with them about Michael Brown and the subsequent nationwide unrest, but for now, she said she feels it was enough for them simply to be present.

“It was emotional,” Pierson said. “It was emotional as a mother, it was emotional as a black woman, it was emotional as the daughter of a man who grew up in St. Louis County, it was emotional as the wife of a black man. But for me, the mother part was the most overwhelming emotion I felt.”",5,400,NA,NA

“One of our original sins in this country has been racism and slavery. And we still haven’t figured out how to solve that problem,” Legend said during an on-stage discussion with KCRW Music Director Jason Bentley in between sets. Given the news of this week, it’s no surprise that the fatal shooting of Michael Brown at the hands of a police officer in Ferguson quickly came into the conversation.

“We’ve given our police these military-style weapons, and you know, it’s a mess,” Legend continued. “But this is not new. The weapons are only exacerbating it. But this was happening with Bull Connor in the ‘60s, this was happening with lynchings well before the ‘60s, where there were all kinds of extralegal ways for black folks to get killed and for black bodies to not be valued in this country.”

Legend noted that even today, unarmed black men are shot on a regular basis. “It’s like every 28 hours — some cop or vigilante kills an unarmed black man. It just shows you that we still have a long way to go. We could do better. And hopefully we will.”

Legend will put on an {expansive Marvin Gaye tribute}<hyperlink=”http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/tickets/marvin-gayes-whats-going-on-john-legend/2014-08-20”> at the Hollywood Bowl next week, and Bentley asked him if he feels songs about social issues have lost their place in American society.

“I think there’s less urgency now,” Legend said. “My theory is that the draft makes a difference. Because when each and every person has the potential to be sent off to Vietnam, it gives every young person a greater sense of urgency about what’s going on in politics, what’s going on in the world.”

He continued, “Now that the people who choose to do it are doing it, I think fewer young people feel connected to decisions that politicians make. So I’m not saying we should have the draft. I am saying that because we don’t have the draft, fewer people feel that sense of urgency.”",206,9600,NA,NA

You would think that conservative gun groups like the NRA or the GOA would be rallying around the Brown family, and demand justice.

But they haven’t even mentioned such an event.

The shooting, which took place in a St. Louis Missouri suburb known as Ferguson, has received plenty of media attention, as Brown was gunned down. There are so many angles that gun groups could take. They could condemn the police for killing an unarmed citizen. They could insist that citizens should arm themselves for protection against the government (police).

But they didn’t use either of these arguments.

{Francis Wilkinson, who wrote the article “‘Jack-Booted Thugs’ With NRA Approval” }<hyperlink=”https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-08-13/jack-booted-thugs-with-nra-approval?cmpid=yhoo”> for Bloomberg View, already looked into this, concerning the NRA at least. Here’s some of what he wrote.

“I wonder: Has the shooting death of the Missouri teen traumatized [Wayne] LaPierre into silence? After all, Twitter is full of images of police dressed in camouflage and looking for all the world like a powerful government militia terrorizing the citizens of Ferguson. The NRA has previously lamented “black-suited, masked, massively armed mobs of screaming, swearing agents invading the homes of innocents.” LaPierre has expressed grave concern over “federal agents wearing Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding citizens.” Surely, if anyone in the U.S. is concerned about police forces abusing their lethal powers, it must be LaPierre, self-styled guardian of individual rights, protector of the little guy, scourge of overzealous government agents. Yet once again, an unarmed black boy or man has been shot dead by police, and LaPierre is silent. I just can’t figure it out.”

But Wilkinson may not realize that the NRA is not the real conservative gun group out there. You’d think it was the NRA, but [it is actually the Gun Owners of America (GOA), the group you see bringing heavy weaponry into eateries to make customers feel more safe}<hyperlink=”http://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-open-carry-gun-groups-threaten-to-leave-nra/”>.

I went to the {Gun Owners of America site}<hyperlink=”http://gunowners.org/”> to find outrage over Brown’s shooting by a Ferguson cop. It wasn’t mentioned.

They did have critical “open letters” to politicians they didn’t agree with. There was the “self-defense corner” with stories where someone used a gun to save a life, a gun debate on MSNBC from a few weeks ago, Obama, a UN treaty that would confiscate guns, but nothing about Brown.

{According to the St. Louis media, gun sales have skyrocketed}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/f3e99891-8111-5f3e-a159-c94ad7834a72.html”>. Whether it’s fear of the police or fear of looting from reprisals, those sales have spiked at least 50 percent, and possibly 400 percent. You’d think that would warrant some commentary, if only to stand by Brown, or the police, or residents.

HuffPost,huff84,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/ferguson-shooting-poll_n_5688762.html,Black Americans Much More Likely to See Factor in Michael Brown Shooting,Emily Swanson,08/18/14,02/15/17,"Two new polls show Americans are divided over the role race played in the recent shooting of Michael Brown by police in Ferguson, Missouri. Black Americans are far more likely than white Americans to believe that race played a role or that the shooting raises questions about race. 

According to a {new HuffPost/YouGov poll}<hyperlink=""https://today.yougov.com/news/2014/08/18/ferguson-mo/"">, Americans are divided over whether Brown’s shooting was an isolated incident (35 percent) or part of a broader pattern in the way police treat black men (39 percent). But among black respondents, 76 percent said that the shooting is part of a broader pattern, while only 35 percent of white respondents agreed. 

A {Pew Research Center poll}<hyperlink=""http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/""> released Monday had similar findings. Among all respondents to the Pew survey, 44 percent said that “this case raises important issues about race that need to be discussed,” while 40 percent said the “issue of race is getting more attention in this case than it deserves.” Eighty percent of black respondents, but only 37 percent of white respondents, said that the case raises questions about race.

Both surveys also found a stark racial divide in how Americans expect the investigation of the officer who shot Brown to proceed. The HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 30 percent of all respondents think the officer will be punished too leniently, while 11 percent expect the officer to be punished too harshly and 20 percent think his punishment will be about right. Forty-nine percent of black respondents, but only 28 percent of white respondents, expect the officer’s punishment to be too lenient.
In the Pew survey, 45 percent of all respondents, including 52 percent of whites but only 18 percent of blacks, said they have “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of confidence in the investigation into Brown’s death. 

The HuffPost/YouGov survey finds Americans are divided over whether the police reaction to the protests was reasonable or unreasonable. Thirty-two percent said it was reasonable, 33 percent found it unreasonable, and 35 percent said they weren’t sure. 

Respondents were more likely to say that Ferguson residents’ reactions to the shooting has been unreasonable than reasonable, 45 percent to 25 percent.

But black and white respondents to the survey tended to look at both questions differently. While white respondents were split, 34 percent to 32 percent, on whether the police reaction has been reasonable or unreasonable, black respondents were more likely to say that the police have been unreasonable, 48 percent to 16 percent. 

And while white respondents were more likely to say that residents’ reactions have been unreasonable than reasonable, 48 percent to 21 percent, black respondents tended to say that residents’ reactions have been reasonable, 42 percent to 31 percent. 

In the Pew survey, 40 percent of all respondents said that the police response had gone too far, while 28 percent said it was about right. Sixty-five percent of black respondents, but only 33 percent of white respondents, said the police reaction had gone too far.

Black Americans in the HuffPost/YouGov poll also tended to suspect the media is not being allowed to cover the situation fairly. Forty-seven percent of black respondents said they think the police there have prevented the media from reporting freely on what is happening, while 24 percent said the police have been allowing the media to report freely. Among all respondents, 31 percent said the media is being allowed to report freely and 33 percent said the police are preventing it. 
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that 40 percent of white respondents thought Brown’s shooting was part of a broader pattern in the way police treat black men. That number is 35 percent. 

The Pew Research Center poll was conducted by telephone using live interviews to landlines and cell phones Aug. 14-17 among 1,000 adults. 

The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Aug. 14-17 among 1,000 U.S. adults, including 117 black respondents, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

Brown, 18, was shot multiple times on Saturday by a police officer while he and a friend were walking down the street in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis. Accounts differ on what led to the fatal shooting — the Ferguson Police Department has alleged that Brown assaulted the officer, while eyewitnesses have said Brown was either trying to surrender or leave the scene when he was killed.
Brown’s death has sparked tense protests in Ferguson and an uproar on social media over law enforcement and racial bias. {Some studies have found that}<hyperlink=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119060/michael-brown-studies-show-racial-bias-police-shootings""> police officers are more likely to use excessive force toward black men, and critics are using Brown’s killing as yet another example of the need to revisit law enforcement training and protocol.

In the wake of what President Barack Obama described as Brown’s {“heartbreaking”}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3105013/obama-death-of-michael-brown-heartbreaking/""> death, many are asking: Under what circumstances does the law justify the use of deadly force by a police officer? And should police be subject to more oversight on this issue?
The Justice Department is looking for answers as well. It has opened an inquiry into Brown’s death, but it also announced on Tuesday that it would take a look at the use of deadly force more broadly, as part of an {extensive review of police tactics}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/12/police-force-panel/13951033/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&dlvrit=206567"".

Under current federal standards, police officers can {use deadly force}<hyperlink=""https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/471/471.US.1.83-1070.83-1035.html""> to apprehend criminal suspects in the event of “probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm ... to the officer or to others.” 

Critics argue that officers are applying the deadly force rule too broadly and wind up unnecessarily killing suspects or people who are unarmed and pose no real threat. They’ve also charged that deadly force is more often used against minorities as a result of racial profiling by law enforcement.

In Ferguson alone, statistics point to serious evidence of racial bias in law enforcement practices. “Blacks in Ferguson are twice as likely to be stopped by police as whites, according to an annual report on racial profiling by the Missouri attorney general,” the {LA Times reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html#page=1""> on Monday. “Last year, 93% of arrests following car stops in Ferguson were of blacks. Ninety-two percent of searches and 80% of car stops involved blacks, the report said.”

In his book The Encyclopedia of Police Science, author {William G.

And a 2005 study by researchers at Florida State University, in which police officers participated in simulation exercises, found that a mostly white and mostly male group of Florida cops were {more likely to shoot at unarmed black suspects}<hyperlink=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119060/michael-brown-studies-show-racial-bias-police-shootings"">, while letting white suspects who were armed go.

Samuel Walker, a professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska at Omaha who specializes in police accountability, said the trend of racial profiling has continued for decades because police are rarely made to answer for instances in which they’ve used deadly force. The federal {government does not track}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/21/police-deadly-force-accountability/5697611/""> how many people are killed by police in confrontations, and few officers are prosecuted or convicted unless a case receives national attention.

The American Civil Liberties Union has called for {greater oversight and transparency}<hyperlink=""https://www.acluct.org/issues/police-accountability/""> on the use of deadly force to improve police accountability and better monitor for possible racial bias. Others have pushed for legislative solutions, such as a minimum force bill that would encourage officers to shoot a suspect in the limbs as opposed to areas that could lead to death. Four years ago, a pair of Democratic lawmakers in Brooklyn, New York, introduced such a bill in response to {the case of Sean Bell}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/24/sean-bell-killing-nypd-gescard-isnora-ray-kelly-fired-resigned_n_1377144.html"">, an unarmed black man who was shot dead by the NYPD while leaving his bachelor party.

Whenever the debate over deadly force resurfaces, law enforcement leaders usually argue that shooting to injure, rather than kill, poses more problems than it solves. They’ve argued that it is impractical to stop dangerous behavior by shooting at an arm or a leg, and that aiming at a limb could also result in an inaccurate shot that accidentally hits the wrong person. 
In recent years, more officers have started to use stun guns as an intermediary method to subdue a suspect without causing death or injury, though the tactic is more often used if an individual is refusing to cooperate but not dangerous. Walker also noted that many officers still don’t carry stun guns, and those who do are more likely to reach for their actual gun than a stun gun if they think a suspect poses a significant threat.

In Brown’s case, the teen was not a suspect, and he did not possess a weapon. The justification provided by Ferguson Police does not seem to fit the deadly force protocol, Walker said.
Dorian Johnson, Brown’s friend who was with him when he was shot, told MSNBC that a police officer initiated the altercation.

“His exact words were get the f—k on the sidewalk,” Johnson {told MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri"">.

The only struggle that occurred, according to Johnson, was when the officer grabbed Brown by the neck and Brown tried to pull away from him. Johnson described Brown running from officers, but then putting his hands up and and saying “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!”

He was shot several times soon after, Johnson said.

“I haven’t heard or seen any evidence that it was necessary. There’s been no allegation that he had a gun or a knife or there was any threat to the officer’s life,” Walker said, adding that police have failed to adequately explain the struggle they claim transpired between Brown and the officer before the shooting.

Walker said he’s not optimistic about the local investigation into Brown’s death, based on statements by county officials that appear to side with the police officer. But, he said, he hopes that a federal probe might shine a light on better ways to train officers.

Departments could place more emphasis on behavioral training for confrontations between police and nonviolent individuals, Walker said. The police officer in Ferguson could have approached Brown and Johnson politely rather than possibly seeking a confrontation, he added.

“The officer pulls up and says, ‘Get the eff off the street’ … that right there, that kind of rudeness and disrespect is what people of color in this country experience day in and day out,” Walker said. “That kind of experience which becomes routine undermines trust and respect for the police.”",8,240,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff87,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leland-ware/michael-brown-stereotypes_b_5685712.html,Michael Brown: Stereotypes and Racial Disparities in Police Killings,Leland Ware,08/19/14,02/17/17,"Michael Brown’s death and its violent aftermath have generated international headlines. On August 9, 2014, at approximately 12:01 p.m., police officer Darren Wilson encountered Michael Brown and his friend as they walked down a street in Ferguson, Missouri. A confrontation ensued which ended with Michael Brown being shot several times by officer Wilson. The use of deadly force against Michael Brown, who was not armed, cannot be justified under any of the varying scenarios that have been presented in the reporting on this incident.
 
Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Brown was detained for walking down the middle of a street, blocking traffic. Initially, the police department refused to disclose the name of the shooter. After nearly a week of rioting and an international outcries, the name of the officer was released.
 
On the same day, however, the police released a video which shows an individual being shoved into a rack in a convenience store by an African American male. Chief Jackson also released documents and surveillance video alleging that Mr. Brown was tied to a robbery at the convenience store. Hours later, Jackson held another news conference in which he said officer Wilson was not aware of the robbery when he stopped Mr. Brown.
 
So what happened? Three eyewitnesses {reported}<hyperlink=”http://www.thewrap.com/michael-brown-shooting-witness-releases-video-i-knew-this-was-not-right-video/”> that Brown was shot several times as he ran with his hands raised in a gesture of surrender. One of them, Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown that day, said officer Wilson {confronted them}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/13/ferguson-protests-continue/13989945/”> because they were walking in the middle of the street. Wilson cursed at them and ordered them onto the sidewalk. When they refused to comply, Wilson grabbed Brown through the window of his cruiser, pulled out a pistol, and shot him. Wilson then chased Brown, shot him in the back, and shot him five or six more times.
 
Even if one assumes, for the sake of argument, that Brown robbed the convenience store and was stopped based on a suspicion that he did so, the use of deadly force would not have been justified. A law enforcement officer making an arrest is {justified in using deadly force}<hyperlink=”http://www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2014/08/16/missouris_rule_on_deadly_force_by_cops_1044.html”> only when he reasonably believes that it is necessary to effectuate the arrest.
 
Furthermore, a police officer has the right to shoot a fleeing suspect only if he has reasonable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of serious physical injury to the officer or others. Brown was not armed. The eyewitnesses’ statements indicate that he did not pose a risk of harm to officer Wilson. Did Brown reach for Wilson’s gun as has been suggested; an unarmed man running toward a policeman with a firearm whose deadly shots are tearing through his head and arms? It seems unlikely. And, in any event, the fact that Brown was shot multiple times makes it highly unlikely that there is a credible justification for the {several shots revealed by the autopsy}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/official-autopsy-michael-brown-had-marijuana-in-his-system-was-shot-6-times/2014/08/18/8c016ef8-26f4-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html?utm_term=.dc5a364ab583”>.
 
Michael Brown’s death is the merely the latest in a {long line of episodes}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/police-killings-data/14060357/”> in which white police officers used deadly force against unarmed black men. Studies {prepared by academic researchers}<hyperlink=”https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235256692_Results_from_experimental_trials_testing_participant_responsesto_White_Hispanic_and_Black_suspects_in_high-fidelity_deadlyforce_judgment_and_decision-making_simulations”> have found that African Americans are four times more likely than whites to die during or after an encounter with a law enforcement officer. A number of other studies have examined the influence of a suspect’s race on a research participant’s decision to shoot a suspect. The studies used video simulations in which participants are presented with a series of images of black or white men who are armed (holding a gun) or unarmed (such as holding a wallet or cell phone). Participants were instructed to shoot only if the suspect is armed.
 
The shooting studies conducted by several different groups of researchers all found that shooting behavior differed based on the race of the suspect. The principal finding was that images of unarmed black men were more likely to be shot than were images of unarmed white men. These studies show how unconscious stereotypes operate. A large body of research has shown that racial bias is pervasive among many who consciously subscribe to a belief in racial equality. They harbor unconscious racial prejudices that can cause them to engage in discriminatory conduct without consciously realizing they are doing so.
 
Prejudice and stereotypes are the products of ordinary perceptions, categorization, learning, memory and judgment. Categorization is the process by which ideas and objects are recognized, differentiated and understood. Categorization is an essential cognitive process that allows individuals to relate new experiences to old experiences; the unfamiliar to the familiar. The process is automatic and operates in milliseconds.
 
Categorization can also trigger stereotypes. When an individual is seen as a member of a social group, perceptions about that group’s characteristics and behavior influence judgments made about them. Stereotyping involves the creation of a mental image of a typical member of a particular category. Individuals are perceived as undifferentiated members of a group, lacking any significant differences from other individuals within the group.
 
The stereotype of young black men as dangerous criminals is deeply embedded in the American psyche. It is almost certainly a factor contributing to the stark racial disparities in the killing of unarmed black men by white police officers.",0,NA,NA,NA

Goodman,08/13/14,02/17/17,"First and foremost, I believe most law enforcement officers in this country are good people who care about their families and the citizens they protect. Most want to make a positive impact in the community and enter the police force to guard people from the inevitable threats that exist in all societies. It takes courage to wake up every day knowing that you might not come home to your family and good cops are essential to any healthy society. 

That being said, within law enforcement (as with all professions) there are certain people who bend the rules and perhaps even hide behind the bureaucratic and systemic evils that enable breaches of conduct. Research from Northwestern University {states that}<hyperlink=""http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=6125"">, “More than 10,000 complaints of police abuse were filed with Chicago police between 2002 and 2004, but only 19 resulted in meaningful disciplinary action, a new study asserts.” Also, before Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson, police in Missouri were already grappling with the issue of racial profiling {according}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/racial-profiling-study-begins-at-st-louis-county-police-department/article_99c3e1cf-ea3a-58d2-a5b2-0677ff683e88.html""> to the St. Louis Post Dispatch on May 19, 2014:

Former Police Chief Tim Fitch recommended that UCLA’s researchers visit county police after anonymous letters to the chief last year accused Lt. Patrick “Rick” Hayes of ordering his officers to target blacks at the South County shopping areas. Hayes was fired last May after nine officers said they heard him issuing profiling orders laced with racial slurs. Hayes’ appeal to the police board is still pending...

Undoubtedly, the fact that most complaints against police abuse go unpunished contributes directly to the prevalence of such abuse. However, when both the American public and police departments are aware of the problem, why have the deaths of unarmed black citizens like Eric Garner and Michael Brown become a horrifyingly commonplace news story?
Before any analysis of the legal or political system that fosters a man like Rep. Mo Brooks to claim President Obama has waged {“a war on whites,”}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/mo-brooks-war-on-whites-109703.html""> a closer look at racial bias must be examined from a human perspective. Research by Harvard University’s Jennifer L. Hochschild in The Skin Color Paradox investigates the inherent {bias against dark skinned individuals}<hyperlink=""http://scholar.harvard.edu/jlhochschild/publications/skin-color-paradox-and-american-racial-order""> within the U.S. and how this bias manifests itself within the judicial system and society:

Dark-skinned Blacks in the United States have lower socioeconomic status, more punitive relationships with the criminal justice system, diminished prestige, and less likelihood of holding elective office compared with their lighter counterparts. 

... Consider criminal justice: among 66,927 male felons incarcerated for their first offense in Georgia from 1995 through 2002, the dark-skinned received longer prison sentences. Whites’ sentences averaged 2,689 days, and Blacks’ were longer by 378 days. Within the Black group, those with the lightest skin received prison sentences averaging three and a half months longer than did Whites; medium-skinned Blacks received the average for Blacks and a year more than Whites; and the dark-skinned got hit with 3,250 days -a year and a half longer than Whites. 

... Dark skin evokes fears of criminality or sharper memories of a purportedly criminal face. Even Black first graders are better able to remember stories in which light-skinned individuals are portrayed positively (or dark-skinned people portrayed negatively) than the reverse.

If Travyon Martin, Eric Garner and Michael Brown were white, Harvard research shows that they might have fared better without the “fears of criminality” and “the criminal face” associated with being black. The startling fact that black first graders recalled stories of light skinned individuals in a more positive light emphasizes the profound issue of racial bias in our country. Also, when Harvard research finds that blacks serve 378 days longer in Georgia’s prison system and the variation in skin color actually affected prison sentences, the issue of race is still a real dilemma in American society. 

Even with America’s first black president in the Oval Office, there exists systemic racial bias in the U.S. and this fact is exemplified by the economic, social, and legal disparities found between white and black citizens. According to {The Wall Street Journal}<hyperlink=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324432004578304463789858002"">, “Prison sentences of black men were nearly 20% longer than those of white men for similar crimes in recent years, an analysis by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found.” In terms of capital punishment, David C. Baldus found that {people accused of killing white victims were four times as likely to be sentenced to death as those accused of killing black victims}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/us/15baldus.html"">. This statistic correlates to a {Duke University study}<hyperlink=""http://today.duke.edu/2012/04/jurystudy""> finding that, “In cases with no blacks in the jury pool, blacks were convicted 81 percent of the time, and whites were convicted 66 percent of the time... The findings imply that the application of criminal justice is ‘highly uneven.’” Also, the Brookings Institution {found that}<hyperlink=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2014/05/10-crime-facts""> “There is nearly a 70 percent chance that an African American man without a high school diploma will be imprisoned by his mid-thirties.”

If the Tea Party ever feared a “war on whites,” they should realize that blacks are losing this imaginary war. As for what happens to those who kill blacks in the name of self defense, the jury is tilted in one direction. Research in a {PBS Frontline}<hyperlink=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/criminal-justice/is-there-racial-bias-in-stand-your-ground-laws/""> report indicates that, “the killings of black people by whites were more likely to be considered justified than the killings of white people by blacks... In non-Stand Your Ground states, whites are 250 percent more likely to be found justified in killing a black person than a white person who kills another white person; in Stand Your Ground states, that number jumps to 354 percent.” 

Regarding job opportunities, research compiled by Princeton’s Devah Pager and summarized in Harvard Magazine {states that}<hyperlink=""http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/03/the-prison-problem""> “a black man without a criminal record had about the same chance of being called after applying for a job as a white man with a criminal record.” When a citizen with a criminal record has the same chance of employment as another citizen without a criminal record, race can’t be disregarded as an obsolete part of our history, regardless of claims by Tea Party conservatives. In terms of economic standing, data from the {Pew Research Center}<hyperlink=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/08/22/kings-dream-remains-an-elusive-goal-many-americans-see-racial-disparities/""> correlates directly to Princeton’s Devah Peager’s findings and shows that African-Americans in the U.S. suffer from severe inequality in wealth:

The black unemployment rate also has consistently been about double that of whites since the 1950s...
Since the 1960s the difference in black and white incomes grew from about $19,000 in 1967 to roughly $27,000 in 2011... 
The median household income2 for whites was $67,175 in 2011, as reported in the Census Bureau’s March 2012 Current Population Survey. For blacks, it was $39,760; for Asians, $68,521; and Hispanics $40,007...

Black Americans are nearly three times as likely as white Americans to live in poverty, according to the 2012 March Current Population Survey...
In 2011, the typical white household had a net worth of $91,405, compared with $6,446 for black households, $7,843 for Hispanic households and $91,203 for Asian households... 

Of all the disparities, the Pew findings that net worth of $91,405 for white households compared to $6,446 for black households speak volumes, especially since the wealth gap actually grew from 1960 to 2011. Yes, this data matters when analyzing the recent cases of unarmed blacks being killed by police officers, especially when combined with the psychological and judicial biases faced by African-Americans. Furthermore, when people like Paul Ryan make reference to a {culture of not working}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/22/opinion/blow-paul-ryan-culture-and-poverty.html""> within inner cities, they conveniently fail to mention that blacks have faced double the unemployment rate of whites since 1950. 

The sad reality is that if the unarmed black victims in the news today were white and faced the economic, judicial, and social disparities experienced by African-Americans, we’d be hearing calls similar to Sharon Angle’s {“Second amendment remedies.”}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/16/sharron-angle-floated-2nd_n_614003.html""> While conservatives have deemed a health care act they disagree with as tyranny and bemoaned a “war on whites,” if the tables were turned and white Americans had double the unemployment rate of black Americans, or were more likely to be incarcerated for the same crime, the Tea Party would undoubtedly have a new definition of the word “tyranny.” In reality, it is the tyranny of vast economic, judicial, and social discrepancies still affecting large portions of the African-American community that have fostered a world where unarmed black citizens can be killed with the great likelihood that their deaths will be justified in court.",0,290,NA,NA

Jackson gave no further information about the incident that led to Brown being shot multiple times, but revealed that the 18-year-old was the lead suspect in a strong-arm robbery at a convenience store, where a box of Swisher Sweets cigars {valued at $48.99}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/darren-wilson-identified-killed-18-year-old-michael-brown-article-1.1904539""> was stolen and a clerk was allegedly shoved. Surveillance {photos released by police}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/statuses/500279952160600064""> appear to show a figure that loosely fits Brown’s description.

Wilson was initially thought to be responding to the crime when he confronted Brown, though Jackson {later on Friday}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/tom-jackson-michael-brown_n_5682762.html""> clarified that the teen was stopped because he was “blocking traffic” by walking in the middle of the street, and was not a known suspect at the time.

To be sure, any information at all about the day Brown was killed is useful, though the public way in which the police shared the photos of the incident at the convenience store suggest their motive was {not public service and transparency}<hyperlink=""http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/lawyer_ferguson_police_trying_to_justify_michael_browns_shooting_death.html"">, but an effort to shift the discussion to one about Brown’s character.

But Brown’s character is irrelevant. Brown’s potential involvement in a crime doesn’t answer the questions that citizens of Ferguson have taken to the streets for the past six days to see answered: How and why did Brown end up dead in the middle of the street? Was Wilson justified in shooting down Brown? Did Brown really assault the officer in his vehicle and reach for his gun, as police claim? Did Wilson fire the fatal shot while Brown had his hands up, as other eyewitnesses claim? How does this incident play into the broader trend of police using excessive force on unarmed black males?

This continued failure to provide answers brings up one final question: If Brown did rough up a convenience store clerk and steal a box of smokes, does it mean we should care less about the circumstances of his death?

If you believe the answer to this question is no, then it doesn’t matter if Michael Brown stole a box of cigars.

As {Ezra Klein writes at Vox}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6005861/michael-brown-darren-wilson-ferguson-shooting"">, focusing on Brown’s character obscures the real matter at hand:

This case is not about whether Michael Brown was One Of The Good Ones. It’s not even about whether he robbed a convenience store. The penalty for stealing cigars from a convenience store is not death. This case is about whether Wilson was legally justified in shooting Michael Brown.
This story has been updated to reflect the latest information released by Jackson.

But his recent activism in the real world far outweighs the work of his on-screen alter ego.

Williams, who in February spoke out against the {“criminalization of the black body,”}<hyperlink=""http://www.hlntv.com/video/2014/02/13/greys-anatomy-star-people-should-be-outraged""> appeared on CNN’s “State Of The Union” last week to discuss Michael Brown, {a black teen fatally shot by a police officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/michael-brown-family-autopsy_n_5687898.html""> in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 9.

In the clip, Williams tries to steer the national conversation away from allegations that {Brown had robbed a convenience store prior to being gunned down}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/michael-brown-stole-cigars_n_5682089.html"">.

“You’ll find that the people doing the oppressing always want to start the narrative at a convenient part, or always want to start the story in the middle,” Williams says in the clip. “This started with a kid getting shot and killed and left in the street for four hours.”

The experts who also appeared on the segment nod quietly as he continues. “There’s a lot of bizarre behavior going on, and that is the story, that’s where we need journalism. That’s where we need that element of society to kick into gear and not just keep playing a loop of what the kid may have done in a convenience store,” he said, referring to video footage of the alleged robbery which Ferguson police released last week.

“This is about finding justice for a kid that was shot, an 18-year-old that was shot, period,” he added.

Williams’ objection to airing the robbery video calls to mind {the viral #IfTheyGunnedMeDown hashtag}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/michael-brown-twitter_n_5668437.html"">, which trended on Twitter soon after Brown’s death.

“There’s a complete double standard and a complete different experience that a certain element of this country has the privilege of being treated like human beings, and the rest of us are not treated like human beings. ... That needs to be discussed, that’s the story,” he explains.

St. Louis County Police Department spokesman Brian Schellman told The Huffington Post at approximately 4:45 p.m. EDT that detectives are currently speaking with Dorian Johnson, 22, a friend of Brown’s who disputes the version of events provided by police.

The St. Louis County Police Department, which has been called in to investigate the Aug. 9 shooting by a Ferguson police officer, has stated that Brown was {the aggressor in the situation}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/10/justice/missouri-police-involved-shooting/index.html"">, physically assaulting and trying to grab the gun of the officer, who has yet to be named.

But Johnson says he and Brown were walking in the middle of the street when the officer pulled up in a car and told them to get on the sidewalk. After a verbal disagreement, Johnson says, the officer grabbed Brown by the throat and started shooting at him shortly after.

“My friend stopped running, {his hands went immediately in the air}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/13/dorian-johnson-michael-brown-eyewitness/13986845/""> and he turned around towards the officer, face-to-face,” Johnson said in a recent interview with KSDK in St. Louis. “He started to tell the officer he was unarmed and that you should stop shooting me. Before he can get his second sentence out, the officer fired several more shots into his head and chest areas.”

Many critics of the police department’s handling of the investigation have wondered why Johnson, who has been out there telling his story to the media and seems to be a key witness, had not yet been interviewed by the authorities.

Schellman, the police department spokesman, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the police department had made multiple efforts to speak to Johnson but that his attorney, Freeman Bosley, Jr., had not returned their calls.

Meg Riley,08/14/14,02/17/17,"When I opened my door yesterday morning, there were dozens of police cars and fire engines with lights and sirens blazing. Stunned, I walked out into my sleepy Minneaopolis neighborhood to find clumps of neighbors talking in quiet voices. It appears that one of my neighbors, digging a trench to fix a pipe that leaked last winter when the ground froze very deeply, was sucked into a sinkhole. He was, literally, buried up to his neck in dirt. As we watched, careful digging and eventually a truck with huge suction hoses made it possible for him to be safely and carefully evacuated. It was several hours before the man was taken out on a gurney, conscious and awake. Alive, thanks to the hard work of first responders.

First responders. So often we thank them for the brave work that they do, caring for those who need help. I thanked some folks this morning. Some of you are first responders, and I thank you now. And yet, if I lived in a different neighborhood, one where primarily African American people lived, I might not have walked out sleepily to find out why police were congregated near my house. Rather, I might have chosen to stay inside, fearful not of dangerous criminals on the loose but rather of the police themselves.

Someone I know here in South Minneapolis, an African American woman, attempted to help the police in her neighborhood. They were shouting with bullhorns at the house next door to her. A black youth was inside gazing in terror out the window; they were calling a name and demanding that he come out. This woman, seeing that the name they were calling was not in fact the name of the youth they were yelling at, attempted to tell the police that they had the wrong person, to tell them the name of the youth in the house. Before she knew it, she was arrested for interfering with the law, and spent the night in jail. She sat next to me at church the next morning, still in shock and trauma.

Generally, as a white woman, I expect police to believe me and support me. However, when the Republican Convention took place in St. Paul in 2004, the police terrified me. In full riot gear, they attacked dozens of law-abiding protestors. Mothers of young children. Journalists. Bystanders. I witnessed some of this. I found the riot gear, behind which actual officers were completely invisible, terrifying. Lawsuits are still being settled. People are still healing.

This week, a young African American man, Michael Brown, was walking with friends, unarmed, in Ferguson, Missouri. Stories diverge wildly between the police and the witnesses about what happened next, and the police did not wear cameras, but what we do know is this: Brown was shot with multiple bullets by a reportedly white police officer, and killed. As I write this, Ferguson is still reeling, not only from that shooting, but from the arrival of police in riot gear — just the kind that terrified me in St. Paul — to disrupt a peaceful memorial vigil for Brown. Tanks, curfews, and tear gas are now overrunning the small town, intimidating and brutalizing residents. Journalists are not allowed to document it. People are being told they can’t be in their own yards.

Where do you locate yourself in these stories? Who do you see as dangerous, and who is trustworthy? Where do you locate safety? What would safety look like for the people of Ferguson now, for instance? As a white person in the U.S., I am conditioned from birth to see whiteness as safety — white neighborhoods, white people, white authority figures. My lived experience, my conversations with people of color, and my study of history have shown me over and over that this is a wild and cruel perversion of the truth. But the cultural conditioning is strong. Unless I fight it every day, white superiority seeps into my brain in slow, almost undetectable ways.

As a nation of diverse races striving to be one people, we are buried up to our necks no less than my neighbor, with histories that won’t quit, of violence and brutality against people of color. Where do we look for safety, for help, as we try to excavate ourselves from this sinkhole?

I’m struggling with this. Right now I would locate myself as one of the mostly silent, but increasingly alarmed, white folks, one who has the class and race privilege to be on the sidelines, struggling to discern how to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem. Even as I know that standing silently, trying to figure things out, and not taking action, is a life-threatening course of action when you and your neighbors are buried to your neck.

I don’t know everything, but I do know this: This is a problem for our whole nation, not just for people of color. We are in this together. And riot gear, intimidation, and more brutality from police are not the way forward towards healing. They are, in fact, yet another giant step backwards. As for me, I’m looking on the local level for practical actions I can take. And I refuse to be silent or still any more.",0,1900,NA,NA

Kucinich,08/18/14,02/17/17,"As a former big city mayor of a racially diverse city, Cleveland, Ohio, I can understand the cross currents sweeping through Ferguson, Missouri.

We are at a moment of national crisis in the way our domestic law enforcement is being conducted. The killing of an unarmed civilian by a law enforcement officer is, sadly, not unique. But the police response to the protests has provided a powerful cautionary moment for America. The militarization of local police has led to the arrival today in Ferguson of the actual military, the National Guard.

This crisis comes from:

1) The erosion of a principle in federal law, Posse Comitatus, meant to restrict the use of the military in civilian law enforcement; 
2) The Pentagon’s dispersal of military equipment to domestic police units, which has increased since 9/11;
3) Military-style police training reliant upon weaponry, as opposed to peace keeping, including skills development for de-escalation of violent tensions.

An unarmed, African-American teenager was shot and killed by a policeman. As people protested, the Ferguson police response evoked images of an occupying army come home.

The show of military-style force in an American city has created a huge backlash because the underlying concerns for justice have not been addressed. Moreover, Americans don’t want armies patrolling their streets, attempting to stifle public dissent.

There is something deep in the American psyche which resents and resists military-style force in our neighborhoods. The hard-edged military pose of armored vehicles, heavy duty weaponry, and sound cannons, which can permanently damage hearing, may seem like modern crowd control to some law enforcement officials. But to the people in the community who are on the receiving end, it is an escalation of violence, in real terms and by the law.

A quick review of pertinent American history:

The Boston Massacre of March 5, 1770, was a catalyst toward the American Revolution. Five civilians were killed by the British soldiers. The Declaration of Independence, in condemning the offenses against liberty by George III, stated:

He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislature.

He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:

For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us
For protecting them, by mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states
From our earliest beginnings, when John Adams spoke to “the dangers of standing armies,” Americans have demanded accountability and rejected military presence in our daily lives.

Yet, for purposes of security, the Framers provided Congress with the power “To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.” 

The invocation of that provision has a checkered history: The Army has been involved in enforcing slavery, strike-breaking, and interfering in the 1876 Hayes-Tilden election in the South.

Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, became president in a deal, “The Compromise of 1876,” which led to federal troops being removed from the former Confederate states in the south, ending Reconstruction and dashing the hopes of African Americans for full civil rights. 

Eighty years later the federal government would attempt to acquit itself of that sell-out by using a federalized national guard to challenge segregation, enforcing African-American students’ rights to attend public schools in Little Rock, Arkansas.

In 1877 a law was passed which forbade the use of federal military resources in domestic law enforcement in any manner. The proscription, popularly known as Posse Comitatus, held up for more than a century.

In the past two decades the United States Congress began to chip away at the firewall between democratic policing and militarization, passing legislation authorizing the Department of Defense to give local police information on military training, and to provide equipment and facilities.

Local police departments became the recipients of military-grade weaponry, guns, tanks, armor, planes and the like. With the military equipment came the mind-set of police becoming warfighters, in a hostile environment — in one’s own community. 

The governor of Missouri did not have to invoke martial law in Ferguson for it to look like martial law.

As Americans become aroused over social, economic and political conditions which speak to the failure of government to protect the civil rights of all people and the failure to address the practical aspirations of the American people, this is the time to demand Congress understand the significance of the Declaration when it comes to protecting our freedoms in the 21st century.

Here are some suggestions:

1. Congress must firmly re-establish the firewall between civilian law enforcement and the military by reinstating the intent of the Posse Comitatus law. As member of Congress I {warned in 2007 the dangers of a bill}<hyperlink=""http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r110:H09NO7-0007:""> which permitted the government to put troops on the ground in the US.

2. The Department of Defense must stop providing war-fighting equipment to local law enforcement.

3. All equipment provided to local law enforcement by the Department of Defense, must be inventoried and stored, not used except under an executive order from the top civilian authority in a state, the Governor, or under orders of the President of the United States.

4. The General Accounting Office and the Inspector General of the Department of Defense must be asked by Congress to determine the extent to which the training and equipping of local police by the DOD has created a culture in local law enforcement which is adverse to democratic values.

5. The Justice Department needs to fund programs which will train or retrain local law enforcement in racial sensitivity, constitutional protections of suspects, including the right to freedom of speech and right to assemble.

6. The Justice Department must also fund, support and mandate that all local law enforcement receiving any federal funds whatsoever create community programs for dialogue between local police and people in the neighborhood. Local police become an occupying army through emotional distancing, fear and lack of contact with the community. That can change by having police and the community meet regularly to discuss mutual concerns.

Those who serve in local law enforcement are given special trust, special dispensation to serve and protect. Their work is essential. Local police would like to be supported. But we must demand strict adherence to the Constitution and protection of the freedoms given to us by the Bill of Rights.

Let’s insist on the following principles:

Well trained, culturally diverse, de-militarized local police forces to protect our neighborhoods.
The military to defend our nation.
And a rule of law which applies to a man with a badge and a gun, just as it applies to an unarmed teenager.
The requirements of freedom demand no less.",0,3300,NA,NA

Jakes,08/19/14,02/17/17,"When Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. made plans to drop off their 18 year old son Michael at Vatterott College, a technical school near their Ferguson, Mo. home for the start of his freshman year, never could they have imagined that rather than celebrate his triumphs, these deeply grieved parents would instead be planning his funeral.

As I glance at the 20 candles glistening atop my own son’s birthday cake on a warm August afternoon, the irony is not lost as I too prepare for the trek that millions of parents make ritually each fall, dropping their offspring off at colleges, universities and trade schools across the nation. Yet, unlike the majority of parents, I now have the added burden of knowing that recent events have placed my sons squarely on the endangered list.

It’s becoming an all too familiar vignette of distraught mothers and fathers helpless to shield their sons and daughters against societal woes, and unforeseen circumstances that would find them scanning crime scene photos instead of gleefully posting ‘first day of school’ snapshots on Facebook and Instagram.

The seemingly willful killings of unarmed black men like Michael Brown, Jr. in Missouri, Trayvon Martin in Florida or Eric Garner in New York, all have their origins in the odious practice of racial profiling.

According to U.S. News and World Report, African Americans in Ferguson, Mo. are not only stopped more often, they are also searched and arrested more than whites, even though the data show that whites are more likely to be caught with contraband if searched. In short, whites were stopped for actual suspicious behavior, whereas black were routinely stopped for racially motivated reasons.

Although legislation was put forth to end this heinous exercise, the state of Missouri’s own 2013 statistics show the disproportionate execution of “just-us” Ferguson-style: Of the 5,384 police stops, 686 were white, while 4,632 were black. Of 611 searches, 47 were white, 562 were black. Of 521 arrests, 36 were white, 483 were black.

As a father of three African American sons and a pastor to more than 15,000 black men not to mention the other 23 nationalities that make up The Potter’s House of Dallas, I’m deeply troubled by the constant erosion of the black males whose battle to survive poverty, drugs, violence, dropout rates and other community maladies only to come to such a forlorn and hideous end! We certainly don’t need the added burden of racial profiling or any form of injustice leveled against our already perplexing ills.

And while the exact details of Michael Brown’s death continue to unfold, his parent’s anguished cries on television remind me of how onerous the task is for mothers and fathers in our communities to dodge the bullets of black-on-black crime, disenfranchisement, disillusionment, and a justice system whose own statistics reveal racial disparities and poverty itself as the twin scions of sociological toxicity.

I cringed at the attention that would not likely have been given to this case had the community in one accord not demanded a thorough investigation! Nevertheless, I am grateful for the attention that this outcry has received from the highest levels of government!

With the nation’s outrage in full view, I believe that this case gives an outlet to a rising sense of power felt by parents and youth alike to call into question the questionable behavior exhibited by those who are sworn to protect and serve all citizens.

While I applaud the people’s right exercise their first Amendment right to protest, I strongly urge the anger displayed thus far in the disruptive elements of the protests to be quarantined and channeled away from vandalizing our communities and replaced with a careful scrutiny of how the Attorney General through our judicial system will handle the investigation of this extremely disturbing case and how those responsible will be held accountable for their actions.

My hope is that the glaring lens of media brings enough light to offset the heat of the seething anger that’s rumbling under the skin of a frustrated and enraged community!

I hope too that Governor Nixon will rethink the overnight curfew. I concur with Twitter Co-founder and St. Louis native, Jack Dorsey who best underscored its impact: 
“....this feels like a missed opportunity to trust our people.”

If the allegations leveled by eyewitnesses, together with the physical evidence and the findings of the FBI and others are enough to bring an incitement against Officer Darren Wilson, I hope that we can go beyond the customary “slap on the wrist” that American history both past and recent past have administered in such black and white cases. (Remember Rodney King!)

My prayer for all involved is that indisputable truth resolves the matter without any further reckless abandonment!

We desperately need to know whether the excessive use of lethal force and illegal racial profiling were involved. And we need the authorities to disclose why Michael Brown was shot at least six times including twice in the head for allegedly walking down the middle of a street on a warm August afternoon.

It’s an accepted fact that 100 black men are killed by white police officers in America annually. My hope is that the Michael Brown, Jr. case would become the catalyst for a systemic change that has been long overdue within our judicial system. I hope it moves us a long way forward toward racial equity.

Let us run hard after justice with deliberate haste. We all know from past experience that ‘justice delayed is justice denied.’

We are a far cry from the post-racial, peace and love society envisioned by ‘60s idealists or the melting pot that our forefathers portended. We in desperate need of the kind of cultural sensitivity among our officers that comes with living in the communities that they serve to understand the cultural nuances, share the values of its citizenry and to begin to rebuild trust.

Ferguson is a town with a 67 percent black population, 53 police officers, only three of whom are African Americans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. We need to see an immediate shift in these demographics so that its police force becomes a better reflection of the populous.

What we don’t need is more shameful actions like the police chief’s releasing surveillance footage that shows the victim allegedly stealing from a convenience store immediately prior to his death. Using words like “robbery” (which implies violence) for “petty theft” (e.g., stealing) not only inflames an already incendiary situation, it disparages a victim who can no longer defend himself. While stealing is wrong and indefensible, two wrong acts don’t’ make a right.

As I celebrate my youngest son’s 20th year of life on this warm August afternoon, the sweet taste of birthday cake leaves an acerbic taste in my mouth as I think of Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, and Pinky Garner (wife of Michael Garner,) and her six children, and the many parents who will not get to share a slice of cake with their sons and daughters!

I pray for the many hardworking, God fearing, right-doing police officers who risk their lives every day to try to make our streets safer, to join the outcry for justice. Because justice is the only thing that will thwart the barbaric elements in our criminal justice system and restore a much needed respect for those who serve us honorably every day!

What we don’t need is more mothers and fathers crying over martyred children. For us it’s one more tragic story on the 6 p.m. newscast. For them, it’s a forever reality.

Let us therefore strive for peace in Ferguson and justice for all the Michael Browns in America.

We know from past experiences, where there is no justice, there can be no peace.",0,2700,NA,NA

Reilly arrested Wednesday night while he was covering {protests prompted by the death of Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/ferguson-protest-swat-team_n_5676690.html"">, an unarmed black teenager who was shot to death by a police officer.

Reilly and Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowrey were detained and assaulted after attempting to film a swarm of police officers inside a McDonald’s. An officer slammed Reilly’s head into a glass window, and Lowery was shoved into a soda fountain while wearing press credentials around his neck. Both were later released without being charged with breaking any laws.

“They essentially acted as a military force,” {said Reilly}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/huffington-post-reporter-arrested-ferguson_n_5676829.html"">, who was in the restaurant to charge his phone and computer. “It was incredible.”

In recent years, {there have been countless cases}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/nyregion/suit-seeks-to-establish-right-to-record-new-york-police-officers.html?_r=0""> of police officers ordering people to turn off their cameras, confiscating phones, and, like Reilly, arresting those who attempt to capture footage of them. Despite a common misconception, it’s actually perfectly legal to film police officers on the job.

“There are First Amendment protections for people photographing and recording in public,” Mickey Osterreicher, an attorney with the National Press Photographers Association, told The Huffington Post. According to Osterreicher, as long as you don’t get in their way, it’s perfectly legal to take photos and videos of police officers everywhere in the United States.

Help us spread the truth by sharing the image below:

This misconception is pervasive enough that the New York City Police Department {circulated a memo}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-cops-told-memo-filmed-article-1.1898379""> last week reminding officers.

“Members of the public are legally allowed to record police interactions,” the memo states, according to the Daily News. “Intentional interference such as blocking or obstructing cameras or ordering the person to cease constitutes censorship and also violates the First Amendment.”

The NYPD’s reminder comes as police activity is in the national spotlight. Just two days after Michael Brown’s death, cops in Los Angeles {shot to death an unarmed black man}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/lapd-suggests-mentally-il_0_n_5675782.html""> who allegedly struggled with mental illness. And three weeks ago, a New York City police officer put Eric Garner in an {illegal chokehold}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/01/eric-garner-homicide_n_5642481.html""> that left him dead after gasping “I can’t breathe!” A bystander caught the {entire thing on video}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-chokehold-staten-island-man-eric-garner-stripped-shield-gun-article-1.1873033"">.

Those deaths, along with the arrests of Reilly and Lowrey, have raised questions about what, if anything, individuals can do to hold the police accountable for their actions. But one unquestionable right people have is to capture officers on film.

“There’s no law anywhere in the United States that prohibits people from recording the police on the street, in a park, or any other place where the public is generally allowed,” Osterreicher said.

A number of states do bar people from recording private conversations without consent. But as long as the recording is made “openly and not surreptitiously,” said Osterreicher, it’s fair game. According to Osterreicher, “assuming the position of holding up a camera or phone at arm’s length while looking at the viewing screen should be enough to put someone on notice that they are being photographed or recorded.”

Several high profile court cases have taken up the issue, and in each case, the judge has either struck down the law or ruled that the police can’t reasonably expect privacy while out in public. In March, for example, the Illinois Supreme Court {declared the state’s eavesdropping law unconstitutional}<hyperlink=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/21/us-usa-court-eavesdropping-idUSBREA2K08D20140321"">, saying the law criminalized the recording of conversations that “that cannot be deemed private.”

So why do so many police officers still act like filming them is a crime?

“Probably because they haven’t been trained otherwise,” said Osterreicher. “I think that there are many officers that believe that the minute they tell somebody to do or not do something, that that’s an order. But police can only order somebody to do or not do something based on the law, and there is no law that says you can not record or photograph out in public.”",740,18000,NA,NA

Harris-Perry read the names of some of the hundreds of men who were killed by police across the country “in the past decade alone,” from Sean Bell to Oscar Grant to Eric Garner to Brown. All of the men she mentioned were unarmed at the time of their death.

In the past decade alone, these men and hundreds of others have lost their lives to police.

“From 2006 to 2012 a white police officer killed a black person at least twice a week in this country,” she said.

She then noted that Ferguson, where Brown was shot dead, is close to the place from which the slave Dred Scott waged a legal battle for his freedom. She quoted from the notorious Supreme Court case which rejected Scott’s claim because, in the infamous words of Chief Justice Roger Taney, he had “no rights which the white man was bound to respect.”

The two shootings bear little resemblance to one another. Brown was an unarmed teen who, according to eyewitnesses, was trying to surrender when a police officer shot him at least six times. The man killed on Tuesday, whose name hasn’t been released, was {wielding a knife}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/officer-involved-shooting-st-louis_n_5692160.html"">, according to police. When he refused officers’ orders to put down his weapon and walked toward them, they shot him to death, police said.

As tensions continue to flare over Brown’s death, many question the circumstances under which the law justifies a police officer’s use of deadly force. When faced with a perceived threat, why is it that many officers shoot to kill, rather than simply to wound?

Members of law enforcement are legally permitted to use deadly force when they have probable cause to believe that a suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm either to the officer or to others. In such cases, most officers are trained to shoot at a target’s center mass, where there is a higher concentration of vital areas and major blood vessels, according to a {report by the Force Science Institute}<hyperlink=""http://www.pfoa.co.uk/110/shooting-to-wound"">, a research center that examines deadly force encounters.

John Firman, director of research, programs, and professional services at the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said that shooting at a limb is impractical. Aiming at an arms or legs, which move fast, could result in a misfire that fails to neutralize the threat and may even hit the wrong person, he said. “The likelihood of success is low.”

“That’s a Hollywood myth,” Firman told The Huffington Post when asked why police officers don’t tend to shoot people in the limbs. “In all policy everywhere on force in any law enforcement agency in America, the bottom line statement should read: If you feel sufficiently threatened or if lives are threatened and you feel the need that you must use lethal force, then you must take out the suspect.”

Officers are trained to assess the risk before firing, Firman said, but often a situation escalates quickly. A {guide from his association}<hyperlink=""http://www.theiacp.org/Portals/0/documents/pdfs/OIS_IP_Trifold_Web.pdf""> on officer-involved shootings states that deadly force is legally justified “to protect the officer or others from what is reasonably believed to be a threat of death or serious bodily harm; and to prevent the escape of a fleeing violent felon who the officer has probable cause to believe will pose a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.”

The legal justification for deadly force by police is informed by the 1985 Supreme Court ruling in {Tennessee v. Garner}<hyperlink=""http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/471/1/case.html"">, in which a pair of police officers fatally shot a 15-year-old boy after he fled from a burglary. It turned out the boy had stolen a purse and just $10 from a house, and the Court ruled that a police officer may only use deadly force to prevent the escape of a violent felon.

Some law enforcement officials said the question of whether officers should shoot to wound or kill misses the point. Officers are often forced to make a split-second decision and are trained to try and deescalate the situation before firing.

Troy Church, a former police chief in Maiden, North Carolina, said officers are trained to shoot to stop a suspect who poses an imminent threat. “Can death result? Certainly it can,” Church wrote in an email. “But you are not trained to kill.”

Peter Jirasek, a retired police sergeant and criminal justice educator from Illinois, explained that the concept of shooting to wound would not hold up under Tennessee v. Garner. Jirasek said it’s unfair to simply state that officers are trained to kill when lethal force is justified in some cases and discouraged in others by law.

“If you only seek to wound someone by shooting, you do not have justification to shoot at all,” Jirasek said. “An attempt to shoot to wound all too often can end up in death. It does no good if a police officer says, ‘I was just trying to wound and ended up killing somebody,’ because that officer now faces criminal prosecution, not to mention a civil lawsuit. And the law will say the officer better be justified in using deadly force.”

Jirasek added that tasers and bean bag rounds have been instituted as lesser forms of force if an officer needs to bring a suspect into compliance but has no reason to use deadly force.

Some have argued that {law enforcement protocol and training}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/michael-brown-killing_n_5675001.html""> should be re-examined in the wake of Brown’s death, since he was unarmed and, according to eyewitnesses, wasn’t posing a significant threat to the police officer who shot him. Studies have found that police officers are more likely to {use excessive force toward black men}<hyperlink=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119060/michael-brown-studies-show-racial-bias-police-shootings""> than toward whites.

Both were minorities. In addition, said event organizer Phil Agnew in an email, both young men are “proof that racist police departments around the country will continue to use black and brown bodies for target practice.”

Agnew’s Dream Defenders civil rights organization led a large group of protestors to the lobby of Miami’s federal justice building, {their arms raised in silence}<hyperlink=“http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2014/08/eight_protesters_arrested_at_federal_courthouse_during_demonstration.php”>.

[tweetbegin 500016827704307712 tweetend]

Their aim was a meeting with U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer, who oversees the Southern District of Florida.

“It is time for the federal government to reign in the Miami Beach Police Department, the Ferguson Police Department, and other bigoted departments around the country with an established history of targeting and terrorizing communities of color,” Agnew said in a statement.

But Ferrer did not meet with protestors, and police asked the group to leave as the James Lawrence King Federal Justice Building closed for the day.

Eight activists declined to vacate the lobby and were placed in plastic cuffs.

“We’re the voice of the mothers in our community who live in constant fear of not seeing their children come back,” said Marcia Olivo, one of those detained, according to a release from the Miami Workers Center. “We will continue to hold our hands up and demand justice until those who have sworn to protect and defend us stop killing our children.”

Fellow activist Curtis Hierro was also one of those arrested. “We need more and more folks to take this type of action and {make it very clear that we need action on the part of our elected leadership and the folks in the Department of Justice}<hyperlink=“http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Ferguson-Protesters-Arrested-at-Miami-Federal-Courthouse-271313861.html”>,” he told NBC Miami.

The group were later released with citations, the station reports.

It’s not clear what led police in Ferguson to approach Brown last Saturday afternoon as he walked near an apartment complex in the St. Louis suburb. A friend who was with Brown said an officer pulled up, told the pair to get on the sidewalk and {banged his car door into the men}<hyperlink=“http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-no-record/14041457/”>, before grabbing Brown around the neck and trying to pull him through the window.

Even after Brown turned to face the officer with his arms raised, she told CNN, “the cop continued to come up on him and shoot him until he fell down to the ground.”

{Police say}<hyperlink=“http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-no-record/14041457/”> Brown had reached for the officer’s gun during the struggle through the window. One shot was fired from inside the car, they said, then several more followed.

You see, Sean is black and I am white and Sean was suggesting that we swap races. In his plea, Sean was none-too-subtly commenting that living life as a white man might be easier than living as a black man. In my unwillingness to switch, I acknowledged the privilege — and safety — that comes with being a white person in 21st century America.

There are a lot of events vying to occupy the American mind these days such as Gaza, Iraq, Ukraine, the immigration crisis, hate crimes against Sikhs, Ebola, and Robin Williams’ death. But in one way, the ability to switch among these traumas is a white person’s ‘luxury.’ For Sean, and for many black Americans, the recent spate of black male deaths at the hands of police in America is forced to occupy the primary place.

There is an epidemic in this country and its victims are black men. {Eric Garner}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/eric-garner-death/”> died after being put in a stranglehold in Staten Island in New York City, {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/michael-brown-friend-shooting_n_5675097.html”>, was an 18-year-old teenager killed in Ferguson, MO, and {Ezell Ford}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/lapd-shoot-kill-ezell-ford_n_5674679.html”> was killed while reportedly lying down in the street in Los Angeles.

Black Americans are rightfully outraged, but it will require all Americans to be mobilized before the racism that undergirds these killings will end and the deaths along with it. White Americans like me have to stop channel surfing all the outrageously bad news from around the world and focus on the death that is happening in our own cities to our fellow Americans.

I spoke to {Rev. Tony Lee}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/revtonylee”> who is an African-American pastor at Community of Hope AME Church in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Rev. Tony and I went to seminary together and he has been a colleague I trust to speak the truth to me about race in America. He called the recent deaths ‘disturbing but not surprising.’

“The reason people are responding so strongly is that these are examples of daily antagonisms felt by black people on the street. This is part of a wider school-to-prison pipeline and the ghettoization and de-humanization of black bodies. Social media gets the word out much quicker and people are responding to dead black men on the streets in LA, Ferguson and NYC by saying ‘wait, that is going on in our streets too.’”

But social media is part of the problem according to Rev. Lee. “The challenge is for this to become a movement not just a moment. People are expressing outrage with hashtags but they are not organizing. Movements need organizing.”

Given that we are both pastors, I asked Rev. Lee what the church should do and he offered some very practical steps, including becoming advocates for police training, holding police departments legally accountable for deaths, and connecting with the efforts at a community level. Rev. Lee also pointed out positive organizations that are doing great ‘movement’ work like {Black Youth Project}<hyperlink=“http://www.blackyouthproject.com/”> that churches should be supporting and partnering with.

Rev. Lee was quick to mention that his church has positive relations with the local policing because they have been proactive in creating encounters where police can meet the community and the community can meet police — not only in crucial moments when tensions are high — but also during normal times when the two can see the best of each other.

According to Lee, the church also needs to reclaim and proclaim the narrative about the worth of black lives in the face of the criminalized depiction of black people on TV, movies and in music. The wider church should be involved in the celebration of the breadth and richness of the black experience.

I asked {Rev. John Vaughn}<hyperlink=“http://www.auburnseminary.org/whatshappening/executive-vice-president-rev-john-h-vaughn-stop-and-frisk-ruling?blogsid=77”>, Vice-President of Auburn Seminary, what kind of response he would like to see from white Americans. Rev. Vaughn responded via email that he hoped his white friends would be vocal and articulate why these killings are not ‘yet another isolated incident’ and ‘explore the premise that racism is not a thing of the past.’ Perhaps most importantly: “Listen to your friends and colleagues of color about their experiences and analysis of racism in America.”

I also pressed Rev. Lee on what he would like to tell white Americans on how to show solidarity. I was humbled by his response:

We need to lock arms amidst all of this. If the police feel they are above the law with any one group, they will feel they are above the law with others. We need to learn from the civil rights movement. It wasn’t just black folks, it was everybody, because it wasn’t a black problem it was a moral issue. We are remembering 40 years after the Freedom Summer. That wasn’t just black people risking their lives, it was a community that went down to Mississippi because they knew that when any group within the nation is marginalized then we can’t be the nation we want to be.
The way I translate Rev. Lee’s generous invitation is ‘show up.’ White people need to get off the computer and get involved with our voices, feet, votes and resources to help make sure that this epidemic of black deaths in America ends. This is not a ‘black problem,’ it is an American problem and it will take all of us working together to solve it.",NA,1100,NA,The featured photo at the beginning of the article is no longer there

“You really can’t make sense of it.

Jordan went on to reveal how he manages to strike a balance between being an actor and sharing social awareness on certain political issues.

“Honestly, you have to navigate that way…at the end of the day I express myself through my work,” he said. “When I’m up there on screen that’s not me. That’s whoever I’m portraying at the moment. It’s kind of like, you have to hide the medicine in the food.”",6,850,NA,NA

Gershman,08/15/14,10/12/16,"How far can government go in forcing people to reveal their identities, or protecting people from being forced to reveal their identities?

The decision to keep his identity secret has been a factor in the violent protests in the St. Louis suburb.

A person’s identity ordinarily can be protected from compelled disclosure to protect free speech. The Supreme Court s{truck}<hyperlink=“http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-986.ZO.html”> down an Ohio law that forced protesters and pamphleteers to reveal their identity or face punishment. But political speech is at the core of the First Amendment, and protecting anonymous political speech protects unpopular individuals and their unpopular ideas from retaliation by an intolerant society. To be sure, forced disclosure of the person’s identity can be required in cases of fraud, libel, and false advertising. But as the Court observed, anonymous political speech occupies an honorable tradition of advocacy and dissent. Similarly, rules barring disclosure of a person’s identity appear in other well-known contexts, such as protecting juveniles, victims of sexual abuse, and government informants.

Criminal trials also feature situations in which anonymity is used. The use of “anonymous juries” is employed to protect jurors in controversial trials involving dangerous defendants from having to disclose their identities. Courts recognize that this procedure is a drastic measure that implicates a defendant’s right to the presumption of innocence but is used to protect jurors from a credible fear of retaliation by the defendant. By the same token, the identity of trial witnesses occasionally is withheld, such as child witnesses and undercover police officers.

Is the refusal to keep secret the identity of the police officer who killed Michael Brown permissible? Courts seem to be divided on the question. A {recent case}<hyperlink=“http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S200872.PDF”> from California denied the Long Beach Police Department’s effort to conceal the identity of the officer who killed an unarmed man. The police contended, as in the Ferguson killing, that revealing the name of the officer would expose the officer and his family to harassment because the officer’s home address and other personal information could easily be found using the Internet. The court also was told that officers involved in shootings of gang members faced specific threats, retaliation, and the impact of widespread graffiti reading “Strike Kill a Cop.” The California court, however, found that there was an absence of specific evidence that disclosure would pose a threat to the officer’s safety, such as a case involving disclosure of the identity of an undercover officer. The vague, speculative, and non-particularized claims of safety, the court concluded, were not sufficient to override the fundamental right of the public to have access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business by its government.On the other hand, an Ohio federal court {ruled}<hyperlink=“http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2012/05/11/court-oks-keeping-names-of-police-officers-secret.html”> differently recently in a police shootout with gang members, finding that law enforcement agencies are allowed to withhold the identity of police officers who face substantiated threats of injury or death in retaliation for on-the-job activities. The case involved a police shootout with a notorious gang, and the killing of the gang’s “national enforcer.” The court ruled that the officers involved in the shootout had a fundamental privacy right to personal safety that was not overridden by the public’s right to this information.

Is the decision to conceal the Ferguson police officer’s identity based on specific and credible threats to the officer’s safety? If so, then challenges by the press and public to transparency and forced disclosure probably will fail. If, however, the claims of safety are general, speculative, and non-specific, then the police may be compelled to reveal his name. As the matter continues to percolate, and demands for disclosure intensify, it appears that his identity may have already been discovered by computer hackers, or the government itself.

The concern, of course, is that claims of police safety and potential harm to police may be given undue deference by courts, even if the claims over safety threats are not specific and appear to be speculative and self-serving. Indeed, keeping an officer’s identity a secret will foreclose any effort to learn whether he was involved in previous shootings, or other misconduct, or any other incidents in which race may have mattered. The facts at present are unknown, and contested.

Regrettably, the revelation of some facts appears to be a partisan effort to protect the officer, such as the disclosure by Police Chief Thomas Jackson that the officer who killed Mr. Brown was struck in the face. Such disclosure may simply stoke the community’s already intense anger and distrust. On the other hand, some facts, such as whether the officer had been drinking, will never be known. And if the prosecutor decides that the shooting was justified, the officer’s identity may continue to be kept secret, maybe forever?

To restate the obvious, democracy doesn’t function well when government is allowed to pick and choose which facts it wants to disclose, and which facts it wants to keep secret.",NA,12,NA,NA

Forty-five percent of Americans say they don’t trust the justice system to investigate police shootings properly, while 37 percent do. The remaining 19 percent are undecided. Separately, 43 percent said the police use lethal force too frequently, while 32 percent said they do not.

Democrats were nearly three times more likely than Republicans to think lethal force is used too frequently and to distrust the justice system. Sixty-nine percent of black Americans think the police use lethal force too frequently, compared with just 37 percent of white Americans, and two thirds of blacks don’t trust the justice system to investigate police killings, compared with 40 percent of whites.

When can we accept the pattern before us and move forward to change it?

Why is it not enough to look at the disproportionate numbers of black men in our prisons or the disproportionate numbers of black men who are stopped and frisked on our streets? How about the fact that more black men are charged with drug crimes despite the fact that they use drugs at the same rate as whites? What about the harsher sentences given to black defendants or the disproportionate number of black defendants given the death penalty?What about the disparity in school suspension rates and dropout rates?

What about the inane belief held by some that because Barack Obama is our president we live in a Post-racial America? What about the white privilege of not being harassed or suspected of wrongdoing in our daily lives?

My fellow Americans: look at our segregated lives. Think of your neighborhood, your schools, your places of work, your Facebook friends. How diverse are these places? How many people who have a skin color different than yours are you intimately connected with? How sad is it that we have very few opportunities to reach across the {gulf of race and culture}<hyperlink=“http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/megasahd-race-in-america-its-time-for-the-small-conversations-too/”>?

We (and I mean white folks) may believe we know black people because we listen to black music, but this is feel-good falsity. Indeed, to paraphrase the British critic Charles Shaar Murray, we care far more about black music and culture than black people. This is certainly due in part to our segregated spaces.

But we cannot overlook that our present relationship with black men and black masculinity in this country is based on myths that are centuries old. On the one hand, we all want a piece of the mythical black masculinity (i.e. sexual and physical prowess) that has now been bottled and commodified and sold to us through hip hop culture. All American men seek to emulate this particular brand of masculinity, even though the real power lies in the economic and political prowess which black men are rarely permitted to possess.

On the other hand, we are taught to fear black men who are “dangerous” and violent.” That lesson has been internalized even by civil rights leaders like Jesse Jackson who, when fearful of being robbed on the streets, admitted relief when the footsteps behind him were those of a white person.

So, if we are having this conversation, let’s be honest: We all internalize racism, just as we internalize sexism. We are all indoctrinated to fear and devalue black people. And, in particular we are taught to fear the danger of black men, whether they are Mike Brown or Trayvon Martin or Barack Obama. There are no accidents when it comes to racism and no such thing as an accidental racist. We live in a society where racism is both institutionalized and internalized so that discrimination on the basis of race persists on both a small and large scale. This is our American problem.

It is my hope that we can avoid more tragedies and more deaths and the devaluing of black people by recognizing how these myths about race and masculinity — these social constructs — literally color everything around us. It will take all of us talking and getting involved to repaint our world.",NA,170,NA,NA

For these acts and images to do more than express the release of anger over one more senseless killing — fueled by the invisible crisis in America of a two-tiered economic system, the rage over institutional racism and the persistent harassment of black youth on town and city sidewalks by increasingly militarized police departments — is still another textbook example of America’s racial and class polarization. The looting photos should not be fodder for finger wagging or utterances of “what do you expect?” Rather, as transient reactions to the same impoverished and marginalizing conditions that spawn these meager “convenience” franchises in the first place, acts of violence — sensationalized as they are — are little more than one more (albeit shocking) expression in a constellation of of cause-and-effect.",NA,42,NA,"The photo doesn't match the caption.

HuffPost,huff115,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charlie-nelms-edd/the-reflections-of-a-blac_b_5680693.html,The Reflections of a Black Father,"Charlie Nelms, Ed.D.",08/15/14,10/17/16," The shooting death of eighteen year old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri on Saturday, August 9, 2014, is tragic but not new. Far too frequently, black and brown men have their lives snuffed out by over-aggressive police personnel who seemingly construct scenarios after the fact to justify their use of deadly force. What I find most frightening is the fact that once the public outrage subsides, it is business as usual until the next police shooting or unprofessional conduct. Let’s be clear about this: I am just as saddened by the loss of black life at the hands of other blacks as I am at the loss of life at the hands of police personnel. Police, however, have a sworn duty to serve and protect the lives of all citizens irrespective of race or ethnicity.

As a black father, I worry constantly about the safety of my 35 year old son who lives abroad and has worked for the United Nations World Food Program for nearly a decade and often finds himself in places around the world with an array of safety and security challenges. Sadly, I worry just as much, if not more, about his safety when he’s home for occasional visits with us here in the United States. I also worry about the safety of my nieces and nephews, who, every day, face the potential of negative and dangerous interactions with police personnel and young people who often do not value life to the extent of many others in a civil society. When 200 members of my immediate and extended family assemble for the 63rd consecutive year of my family’s reunion during the Labor Day weekend, my brothers/sisters and I will have a candid conversation with our children about safety in the context of their interactions with police personnel. It’s my prayer that they’ll take to heart our advice and admonitions.

The shooting death of Michael Brown and the death of countless and nameless others, remind me of my days growing up in the Arkansas delta in the 1950s and 1960s, and the warnings from my mother about not giving “the law” (local city police chief or county sheriff) a reason to arrest or worse yet, shoot us. It was the combination of my mother’s constant admonition, prayer and our obedience that contributed to our safety. The shooting death of a fourteen year-old friend of mine in 1960, by a Crittenden County Arkansas deputy sheriff had a chilling and frightening effect on the residents throughout the rural black community along the Buck Lake Road. Although that incident occurred more than fifty years ago, it still invokes in me a combination of fear and sadness. No matter how hard I try, I have not succeeded in erasing this event from my mind. My mama never failed to use that event to remind my siblings and me of what could happen even if we weren’t doing anything wrong.

Like many parents and people of goodwill of all ethnicities, those incidents of black men being killed by police personnel in Ferguson, New York City and Los Angeles and other places during the past two weeks have left me shaken emotionally and asking what can I do to ensure that fairness and equity are practiced rather than simply preached by our civic leaders and others in positions of authority. First, we can each take a more active interest in the civic affairs of the communities in which we live by serving on various committees, commissions and boards charged with oversight for public safety and other areas that contribute toward a civil and safe community. Second, we can insist that best/effective practices be used by public safety officials. Third, as citizens with the power to vote officials in or out of office, we can vote in every election, local and national, rather than sitting out some elections. While citizens generally do not vote for public safety personnel, except for sheriff, they do vote for those who appoint persons to lead community protective services. The bottom line is this, we do not have to wring our hands; we can do something. The question is whether we’ll wring our hands or commit ourselves to making our communities places of inclusive excellence where all citizens are respected and every life is valued.

My mama was correct when she proclaimed that we could change the world.",NA,181,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff116,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/police-militarization-bill_n_5679707.html,House Democrat Readies Bill To Demilitarize Local Police,Jennifer Bendery,08/14/14,10/17/16,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) announced Thursday that he plans to file legislation aimed at stemming the militarization of local police — something on full display this week in Ferguson, Missouri, where officers in riot gear have been showering largely peaceful protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets.

In a letter to his Democratic colleagues, Johnson asked for support for his bill, the {Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act}<hyperlink=“http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/JohnsonBill.pdf”>. The measure would rein in a Defense Department program that provides Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, M16 assault rifles and other surplus military equipment to local law enforcement, free of charge.

“Our main streets should be a place for business, families, and relaxation, not tanks and M16s,” Johnson says in his letter. “Our local police are quickly beginning to resemble paramilitary forces. This bill will end the free transfers of certain aggressive military equipment to local law enforcement and ensure that all equipment can be accounted for.”

Johnson will file his legislation in September. His office said he has been working on it for months but decided to expedite it in light of this week’s events in Ferguson. Protests began there Saturday after a police officer killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager who was walking down the street.

“Before another small town’s police force gets a $700,000 gift from the Defense Department that it can’t maintain or manage, it behooves us to rein in the Pentagon’s 1033 program and revisit the merits of a militarized America,” reads his letter to colleagues. “I hope we can work together on this important issue.”

The Georgia Democrat isn’t the only lawmaker who wants to scale back local police forces’ access to military weapons. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) {said Thursday}<hyperlink=“http://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/media-center/news-releases/mccaskill-in-ferguson-time-to-de-militarize-this-situation”> that it’s “time to demilitarize this situation” in Ferguson, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) wrote {a Thursday op-ed}<hyperlink=“http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”> titled, “We Must Demilitarize The Police.”

Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, joined with two other lawmakers Thursday in calling on chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) to hold a hearing to examine the use of excessive force by local law enforcement.

“In Ferguson, why do local police dress in military-style uniforms and body armor, carry short-barreled 5.56-mm rifles based on the M4 carbine, and patrol neighborhoods in massive armored vehicles?” the lawmakers said in a letter to Goodlatte. “In all likelihood, the decision to adopt a military posture only served to aggravate an already tense situation and to commit the police to a military response.”",261,3600,NA,NA

Inspired by the civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, the three high schoolers from Decatur, Georgia, built “{Five-O}<hyperlink=“http://pinetartinc.com/?p=44”>,” a mobile app that empowers citizens “to record and store data from every encounter with law enforcement.” Those incident reports can then be shared and used by the community to rate individual officers and police departments as a whole.

“We’ve been hearing about the negative instances in the news, for instance most recently the Michael Brown case, and we always talk about these issues with our parents,” {16-year-old Ima Christian — who created the app with siblings Caleb, 14, and Asha, 15 — told Business Insider}<hyperlink=“http://www.businessinsider.com/fiveo-app-built-by-teenagers-to-document-police-abuse-2014-8”>, explaining the inspiration behind the program. “They always try to reinforce that we should focus on solutions.

In addition to the Yelp-like police rating system, the app includes a “know your rights” section, complete with information from the American Civil Liberties Union.

Reilly {experienced first-hand this week}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/ryan-reilly-ferguson-arrest_n_5678528.html”>, police officers often arrest people even if they’re not actually committing a crime.

On Thursday night in Ferguson, Missouri, SWAT officers dispatched to respond to protests in the wake of the police killing of unarmed teen Michael Brown arrested Reilly and The Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery at a McDonald’s. Cops apparently determined the reporters weren’t packing up their stuff fast enough. They were released without charges and given no paperwork or names of arresting officers. That’s probably because what they were doing — which at worst can be described as not showing complete deference to the officer demanding that they vacate the private establishment — is not illegal. For what it’s worth, {arresting officers told them}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html”> they were “trespassing in a McDonald’s,” which they also weren’t doing.

It was a reminder that unlawful arrests happen all the time in the U.S. Here are some of the most common behaviors that get people arrested, even if they aren’t breaking the law.

Direspecting A Cop

In the simplest of terms, it’s not illegal to be a jerk to a police officer, as even impolite speech is protected by the First Amendment. That doesn’t mean it’s a good idea, however, and there are countless instances of cops bending or violating the rights of U.S. citizens in attempts to punish them for perceived disrespect or undermining of their authority. Controversial arrests of this nature are frequently referred to as {“contempt of cop.”}<hyperlink=“https://www.acslaw.org/pdf/C21/Issue%20Briefs/ACS%20Issue%20Brief%20-%20Lopez%20Contempt%20of%20Cop.pdf”> As Jerry L. Steering, a California attorney and police misconduct specialist {writes on his website}<hyperlink=“http://steeringlaw.com/criminal-attorney/”>, these cases “typically involve the police using force upon persons (i.e. beating them) and/or falsely arresting them, and then inventing bogus and ‘creative’ allegations of violations” after the fact.

Imagine you are being aggressively confronted by an officer telling you to leave a public space. It is your right to be there, so you decline. The officer, upset that you are resisting his unlawful command and trying to show him up, decides that you need to be taught a lesson in obedience. So he informs you that you are being arrested, and you, knowing this is a violation of your rights, get upset. But if you lash out, you risk a charge of resisting arrest.

If you make any contact with a cop whatsoever, it could easily invite claims of assaulting an officer. Whatever happens, it will end in a headache for you, and in most cases, any attempt to hold an officer accountable for this misconduct will require a significant investment of time and money to go through the proper legal process.

Being Verbally Abusive To A Cop

You can legally curse at a cop, though as explained in the point above, that doesn’t mean it won’t get you arrested. If you’re lucky, you might get a {small settlement}<hyperlink=“http://blogs.denverpost.com/crime/2011/06/13/the-f-bomb-isnt-polite-or-illegal/48/”> out of the ordeal if a judge is sympathetic to your mistreatment. If you’re unlucky, however, there may be a city ordinance that can be loosely interpreted so that your use of profanity subjects you to another violation, {such as disorderly conduct}<hyperlink=“http://www.salon.com/2014/08/14/mother_arrested_for_dropping_f_bomb_in_front_of_her_kids/”>. While directing the language at a police officer isn’t illegal in itself, using profanity in public at a certain volume or in the presence of other individuals could open you up to trouble.

Flipping Off An Officer

The courts have ruled it’s {perfectly legal}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/03/flip-off-police_n_2403563.html”> to flip the bird at police. But again, that doesn’t mean people haven’t been stopped and arrested for doing so, usually on disorderly conduct or reckless driving charges. Those charges are frequently dropped, but usually not before putting the bird-flipper through a significant ordeal.

Filming Police

As {we’ve explained}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/filming-police-officers_n_5676940.html”> ...

In recent years, there {have been countless cases}<hyperlink=“http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=38395X1020964&site=huffingtonpost.com/crime&xs=1&isjs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2014%2F07%2F16%2Fnyregion%2Fsuit-seeks-to-establish-right-to-record-new-york-police-officers.html%3F_r%3D1&xguid=2e709be97a024c5f7f6e1172c598e66d&xuuid=9e5e9fc22bc2149e682772c0755f60e6&xsessid=502d7e34a61216657440e2d2b98d02a1&xcreo=0&xed=0&sref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2014%2F08%2F15%2Funlawful-arrests-police_n_5678829.html&xtz=240&abp=1”> of police officers ordering people to turn off their cameras, confiscating phones, and, like Reilly, arresting those who attempt to capture footage of them. Despite a common misconception, it’s actually perfectly legal to film police officers on the job.

Drinking At A Bar

{In 2010, Mother Jones}<hyperlink=“http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/03/texas-racist-laws-drinking-while-brown”> reported on a group of Fort Worth police who arrested six people drinking at a bar for public intoxication. It may shock you to find out that it’s perfectly legal to drink inside a private establishment.

Dancing On Subway Platforms

It’s not illegal to perform on subway platforms and mezzanines, yet performers say they are {arrested for doing so}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/subway-dancers_n_5675438.html?utm_hp_ref=new-york&ir=New%20York”> all the time. They’re usually charged with “blocking pedestrian traffic” or “panhandling.” This has led some performers to use subway cars themselves as the stage, which is illegal under NYC law, and can even lead to criminal reckless endangerment charges, which require an arrest and can lead to up to a year in jail.

Possessing Small Amounts Of Marijuana

In New York City, possessing small amounts of marijuana is the equivalent of a parking violation. But having it out in public view is a misdemeanor. So some police in the Big Apple have figured out a way to create criminals by stopping and frisking suspects. When they find marijuana and it gets brought out into plain sight, then it becomes an illegal and arrestable offense. The practice became so widespread that former {NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly}<hyperlink=“http://www.wnyc.org/story/160516-police-commissioner-calls-nypd-stop-improper-marijuana-arrests/”> told his officers to stop these improper arrests.

“I’m here because I live in the neighborhood and because this seems to be some sort of a flash point in terms of people being actually aware of something that’s been going on for a long time, and it’s a systematic problem. I think we as a community need to reject the current narrative of safety and security. Especially we as white people living in diverse communities. Shooting my neighbors, shooting unarmed people on the streets, shooting my friends does not make me safer.” - Josephine Stewart

“I’m from St. Louis so I have a lot of family that’s still there. So this hits close to home. We have to hold police accountable for their actions, just as much as any other person, as any public servant. It’s unfair that black lives have historically been considered less than the lives of specifically white people. It’s painful and I wish this was a peaceful march, perhaps to the police station, of some sorts — a sort of show of solidarity with what’s happening in Ferguson. Because what’s happening in Ferguson is real and dangerous. The police state that exists in Ferguson right now is a real problem. ...This is nothing new. The systematic destruction of the black community by the police is nothing new. So every time this happens, we get together in a rally but then nothing happens. I’m hoping something sticks. We need to remind everyone this is still happening. I don’t want to be peaceful anymore.” - Brandon Burton

“It hits home because of course I’m a black man who grew up in America. It’s come to a point that it’s a slap in the face to us as black people and as black man. It’s at a boiling point and we’re all fed up with it.” - Jelani Brooks

Detroit

Daryl and Kristine Ludy with daughter Isabella, 4, above, attend the Detroit National Moment of Silence vigil. They are holding their Missouri drivers licenses. Their hometown is just miles away from Ferguson, where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot by a police officer this week.

“It’s so powerful to us because we both have been victims of the same type of violence, not to the death, but he’s been harassed,” Kristine said.

Daryl spoke of getting stopped by police as a kid as an ordinary occurrence.

“I can recall just walking from my mother’s house, going to see my friend and just getting stopped at night by an officer,” he said. “Something simple with him just saying, like, ‘Where do you live,you fit the description of a robbery.’ I was always taught to just stay calm ... because things could get out of hand.”

“We didn’t want [our daughter] to see color,” Kristin said. “Even though she will see it, we wanted … to be able to let her grow up and experience people and love them just for them.”

Poet Natasha “T” Miller, above, took the stage in front of a few hundred people to read a poem “for black girls who look like black men,” saying she wanted to speak for the dead that people don’t talk about. The subject resonates in Detroit, where in recent years {several}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/11/shelley-or-treasure-hilliard-henry-hilliard-jr-transgender-teen_n_1088373.html”> {transgender}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/04/coko-williams_n_1403803.html”> {women’s}<hyperlink=“http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2013/12/medical_examiner_identifies_bo.html”> murders have received little media attention.

Before reading, however, Miller prefaced her work with a personal story about how {black victims become vilified in death}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/media-black-victims_n_5673291.html?”>.

“My brother was killed in Detroit, and I showed up to the crime scene and he was still laying up under his truck,” Miller told the crowd. “He had just been killed, maybe like 40 minutes before, and the first thing the officer asked me when I arrived was, ‘What did your brother do for a living?’ and I told the officer, ‘You’re not going to incriminate my brother for his own death while he’s still lying dead up under this truck.’ … I tell that story to say this: nobody wants to be held accountable for the death of black men. And when you leave here, please leave with the desire to hold somebody accountable for the death of my brother, and your brother and so many other brothers.”

Jordan Rome, 21, lives in Chicago but grew up in Detroit. She attended the rally Thursday, in part because she’s “fed up.”

Rome talked about experiencing racism through “microaggressions, simple comments you don’t even realize because we’re so desensitized to racism, being told you don’t act black enough, little comments like that.”

“At the end of the day, I’m still perceived through a certain lens because of my skin color,” Rome said.

Monica Blaire, above, closes her eyes during the moment of silence at the Detroit vigil. Later, she sang the hymn “His Eye Is on the Sparrow” for the hundreds amassed in Hart PlazaThursday night.

Oakland

Approximately 400-500 people showed up at Oakland’s Frank Ogawa Plaza directly next to City Hall on Thursday. Arm bands were given out by activists to crowd along with signs that read, “Jail killer cops” and “Stop police brutality.” The large crowd was most unified and vocal during chants of, “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “Black lives matter.” The event began with organizers calling out names of the victims Michael Brown, Oscar Grant, Eric Garner and others. The audience was then asked to shout out names of other victims of police brutality. Speakers specifically referenced local examples of excessive police force like Oscar Grant and Alan Blueford.

Keisha Eldridge of Alameda, above, brought her 14-year-old-son and 3-year-old daughter.

“I felt like young black men in the streets are not important to police and sometimes to each other,” she said. “This is to remind [my son] that his life is important.”

Her son Jacob Talbot said “I felt like it wasn’t fair and it wasn’t right,” what happened to Brown.

San Francisco

Kristin Vogel is a San Francisco organizer and self-proclaimed “white ally to people of color,” who teaches sixth grade in San Bruno.

“I’m a middle school teacher and teach a lot of students who aren’t that much younger than Mike Brown,” she said “I owe it to them.”

“I had a lot of students come in during the George Zimmerman trial, asking, ‘Why did he shoot that kid? What did that kid do?’ We just had really raw, honest conversations. I told them he didn’t do anything and it was just hate, ignorance, and it was a very difficult topic to talk to 12-year-olds about, but I want my students of color to fully understand that we live in a free country, but some of us are a little bit more free than others. That’s a sad thing to have to tell very optimistic 12-year-old about.”

Savannah McCoy is a 17-year-old black senior at San Rafael High School. She wore a Trayvon Martin shirt and cried while explaining why she attended the vigil.

“Even though I don’t know Trayvon Martin or Eric Garner or Michael Brown, I still relate to them and I feel like in a way that they’re my brother or cousin, and when another one of them is shot, it’s like I’m losing a family member,” she said.

“Everyone knows that Robin Williams just died, but they don’t know that in Ferguson, people are being shot by rubber guns, and they don’t care, and it really bothers me, so I’m having a protest on Saturday (at her high school). ...I do deal with a lot of racism and prejudice pretty much on a daily basis.”

Savannah’s best friend is Kimber Camgros, a 16-year-old student in her last year at San Rafael High School and an “ally to people of color.”

“Robin Williams just killed himself. ...All our schoolmates, that’s all anyone can talk about, and it’s like, when someone commits suicide that’s a terrible thing, but when someone’s being murdered when they’re innocent, for no reason, just on the street, and it’s a kid... people just don’t care enough,” said Camgros.

Chicago

“I feel like it could have been me, actually,” explained Jasmine Lomax, 18, above left, who lives in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood. “I don’t live in that safe of a neighborhood and it would have been so easy for a police officer to stop me and accuse me of doing something wrong even if I was just walking and then just to shoot me dead.”

“There’s so many people around doing horrible things, shooting and killing people, but this kid was going to college, he wasn’t doing anything wrong,” Lamar Gayles, 17, of Woodlawn, said. “He was just going to the store and buying something.”

“The footage reminded me so much of the Martin Luther King marches,” Lomax continued. “If you watch those tapes, it’s the exact same thing. I thought protesting was protected by our constitution and they’re demonstrating peacefully and being attacked. It’s gone too far.”

Netiya Shiner, 20, came to the Chicago vigil with another victim of police brutality on her mind.

“Two years ago, the sister of an acquaintance of mine, Rekia Boyd, was murdered while completely unarmed by the Chicago police,” Shiner told HuffPost.

“People have been blowing up my Facebook feed with these posts about Ferguson which I think is a good thing in the long haul in that it means people are opening up the dialogue about racism and police brutality in this country,” Shiner continued. “But [Boyd’s murder] happened in the city and there was not any kind of response like what’s going on with Ferguson now. The bottom line for me is that it’s awesome that people are waking up and realizing what’s going on but this has been happening for a very long time.”

Martese Chism lives in Chicago and works at Cook County Stroger Hospital, where she’s seen parents going through losing their children to violence. She fears the same thing could happen to her family members.

“I have a lot of young nephews and when I think about Michael Brown, they’re not involved in gangs just like Michael and I’m worried that the same thing could happen to them because they’re always walking to the store alone and I have the thought that someone would pull them over, grab them and kill them. That’s what brought me here.”

“My nephews live in the south and they want to come live with me and I want them to come live with me but I’m afraid for their safety and that’s sad. I’m too afraid to bring them here. When I was a kid growing up we used to come every summer to Chicago, me and my brothers, but now it’s not safe for my nephews to come visit me. That really bothers me.”

“Why I’m so rooted in this is because I have a 19-year-old daughter who’s at the University of Alabama, doing very well. She grew up here in Chicago, and turned down my offer to help connect her with jobs for the summer. She said ‘I don’t want to get shot.’ It’s riveting for me to hear from my own blood that she doesn’t want to come home. These organized efforts need to continue with the young generation. This needs to have not just protest but action steps. I’m very encouraged by the youth here.” - Ernest Sanders, 50, above

“I’m grieving. I’m disturbed. I was on the train three days ago and overheard two white women talk about Ferguson and one said ‘I’m so glad that doesn’t affect us.’ I think I came out because Mike Brown’s murder has a racial dynamic, but we’re also dealing with a police state. How can non-black and non-brown people not think this affects them? We’re all susceptible to it. You don’t know when it’s coming to you. At the end of the day, we’re all complicit with our silence.” - Amanda Lichtenstein, 38, above

“I’m absolutely not surprised [by Ferguson]. We were here a year ago for Trayvon Martin and nothing has changed!.. My grandmother lives in the neighborhood [where the Ferguson protests occurred]. She’s scared to come out of her house because of the military police.” - Brittany Evans, 25

“We’re looking at the situation and we need to stand up and say something. And with social media, people are noticing everything faster and faster.” - Milan Franklin, 26, above

Rose Chavira, 26, is a Chicago Public School teacher who works with kids in grades 3-5 on the city’s West Side.

“I’m a Chicago Public School teacher and I have kids in 3-5 grade. I’ve had a lot of incidents where students have been gunned down — four students this summer alone. We have to be the voice for our kids,” she said.

Milan Franklin, 26, wears a t-shirt blasting the pejorative term “Chiraq” that has been used amid the city’s struggle with gun violence.

“I’ve lived [in Chicago] my whole life. I’ve never had anything escalate that bad — but I have friends who have. But even when I get on the train, people tense up. But, it’s good to see allies [at the vigil]. It’s nice to see people who want to understand. There are even some very privileged people out here — it gives me some hope.” - Thaddeus Tukes, 20

“I think we’re all here because we’re fed up. It still pains you that you have to tell — convince — people that your life is valuable.” - Sierra Boone, 19

Denver

“I have a 5-year-old daughter, and she came to me with tears in her eyes as my grandmother called me from Missouri to let us know that she is alright. And she said, ‘Why are the police trying to kill Grandma? Why are the police trying to kill you?’ And to have that conversation is a difficult one. But I’m happy to say today, that if you look to your left and to your right, that here in Colorado we have community. And that we may not all look alike, we may not believe all of the same things, but our lives matter... If a young 5-year-old comes up to you, and asks you if their life matters, what will you say? Will your actions say the same thing?”

“Being black is not a crime. Being brown is not a crime. Being gay is not a crime. Not believing in the same political beliefs is not a crime. ...Our lives matter. And if we can say it here from the Rocky Mountains, from the Mile High City, that our lives matter, hopefully someone within ear will take heed.” — Reverend Quincy Shannon, above.

“This isn’t about black, this isn’t about white, this isn’t about Mexican. This is about police brutality against us, the people. We vote. We put them in. We pay them. How is it we have to protest?” - Preston Rubit, in black shirt second from right, above

“We’re asking for peace… peace for the people who are hurting. For these mothers and these fathers who will never see their children again. We’re praying for a change in the system. We’re praying for a healing in these communities, because in every one of these deaths, these people belong to a community. We’re also asking for healing. Heal all of our hearts. Heal all of our minds.

“Give us the strength to continue to stand. To stand for justice. To stand as one.” — Reverend Terrence Hughes, above, Greater Denver Ministerial Alliance

“Being black is not a criminal act. That’s the message I want to send to anyone who is fearful of any black skinned person who is living in their own community, enjoying their own life, and stuck in the stereotypes of ignorance. Just because your pants sag does not mean you are guilty of a crime.”

“Greatness comes from our city, and from where we are now. We can lead the way for others… There was a shooting yesterday. There have been shootings all this summer. But guess what? A young man was caught today in the Holly, running from the police, with a gun. And they did not kill that man today. We need to celebrate that. Whatever it was that made a police officer rest on his training, when a man has a gun, that man would be dead under any other circumstances.” - Brother Jeff Fard, above center

“I joined the movement for the National Moment of Silence because I have been saddened and horrified by the rampant examples of police brutality all over the world. I then realized that being sad or upset didn’t mean much unless I followed it up with action.

“There were a series of tweets from four of us in Denver who felt moved to show to ourselves, our city and the country that Denver cares about the victims of police violence. I was particularly attracted to #NMOS14 because of its peaceful, reflective nature, and because these vigils nationwide are, in many cases, being planned by individuals instead of groups, and by people with varying levels of activist experience and community organizing.

“It’s people who care. We care about the victims/memories, we care about honoring them, and we care about sending a quiet, peaceful message that all living beings matter to us. I was inspired by a portion of Dr. King’s Letter from Birmingham Jail in which he called for a ‘positive peace that is the presence of justice’ instead of ‘a negative peace which is the absence of tension.’

“We will be peaceful and reflective, and yet we are still showing up for justice.” - Kenny Wiley, Director of Faith Formation Prairie Unitarian Universalist Church in Parker, CO and co-organizer of event, via email to The Huffington Post)

New York: Harlem

“I’m here tonight because I represent an endangered species, which is black men in America,” Cedrik Blue, a recording artist, told HuffPost Thursday evening in Harlem.

He says police have a long history of harassing him. Just yesterday, he says, NYPD cops singled him out for drinking in the street.

“I broke the law,” he said. “I was drinking a beer in a brown bag standing in front of my studio, while there’s damn near a party going on in someone’s car four or five cars down from me.” Blue said uniformed cops then jumped out of a taxi cab.

“Long story short, I’m glad I made it out alive”, he continued. “Because I’m one of the few out of this endangered species that was breaking the law. I broke the law. I was drinking in public. But when you have guys doing absolutely nothing but leaving their house and going home, or going to work, or breaking up a fight, and they die, it’s disgusting.”

Blue lives with his fiancee, Kali Wilder, in Harlem. On nights that Blue gets home late, Wilder says she gets worried. She gets worried not because of criminals on the street, but because of how police treat young, black men in this country.

Her whole life, Wilder said, her black, male family members and friends have had to fear the police.

When a black boy reaches double digits in this country, she said, “They become a scary black man instead of a 10-year-old who’s going to elementary school. You have to warn your children and say, ‘Listen, watch how you’re acting in the street.’ I don’t think white boys have that speech with their parents.”

HuffPost,huff122,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ian-i-mitroff/crisis-management-101-a-w_b_5689842.html,Crisis Management 101: A Wakeup Call for Law Enforcement Organizations Everywhere,Ian I. Mitroff,08/19/14,10/24/16,"To say the least, the shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager in Ferguson, Missouri raises highly disturbing and troubling issues for law enforcement agencies everywhere. It is imperative that they learn and put into practice immediately, the most critical lessons from Crisis Management. Let us list briefly a few of the many lessons:

1.A crisis is the worst of all possible times to conduct a review of department policies and actions. Indeed, crises generally drag departments through the mud relentlessly with regard to their current and past behavior. The result is that calm, contemplative institutional change gets lost in the din of the crisis. Everything is exposed and criticized for all to see. Long-range damage is done. Affected individuals and communities not only stage legitimate protests, and sadly, violence often erupts as anger towards the police boils over. For this reason, before major crises occur, police agencies need to conduct regular, ongoing Crisis Audits of their strengths and vulnerabilities. They need to imagine the unimaginable. They need to surface and address potential crises long before they occur. They need to bring in outsiders, such as members of police community advisory boards who can perform hard-hitting, no-holds barred assessments of their susceptibilities with regard to potential crises of all kinds. Outsiders also need to be involved in reviewing the lessons that should have been learned and implemented from past crises. It is not that outsiders are perfectly “objective and unbiased,” for no one possess these desirable attributes. Rather, outsiders are indispensable in surfacing and challenging taken-for-granted assumptions and practices that insiders are often reluctant unwilling to face.

2.Again, with the help of outsiders, realistic assessments of the ethnic and racial compositions of law enforcement agencies need to be performed. Members from surrounding communities need to be involved in such assessments and with all aspects of Crisis Management. Outsiders and members need to be involved in plans for correcting ethnic and racial imbalances. This takes transparency and community involvement to new levels.

3.Realistic simulations of worst-case scenarios such as the shootings of unarmed teenagers need to be performed and assessed on a regular basis. The simulations need to cover what can occur before, during, and after such events. Good crisis simulations also cover what happens when any single crisis sets off a chain reaction of other crises. That is, crises virtually never occur in isolation. To be prepared for one and only one type of crisis is not to be prepared at all. Further, no simulation is worthwhile if it doesn’t take a hard look at the assumptions governing when it is allowable to use the various legal and policy approved levels of force in responding to any situation.

4.Finally, Crisis Management needs to be an integral of the “new skill set” of modern policing. Crisis Management needs to be woven seamlessly into day-to-day operations. This means that everyone needs to be trained and evaluated with respect to the best practices of Crisis Management.

The worst form of Crisis Management is reactive, that is, responding without any prior preparation or training. Law enforcement organizations including city, county, state and federal, must learn to practice proactive Crisis Management or things will only get worse. And, if proactive Crisis Management means anything, it’s that plans are not enough. One needs the capabilities to handle crises.

But most of all, good Crisis Management is not just responding well to crises once they’ve occurred. Good Crisis Management is doing everything humanly possible to prevent major crises from happening in the first place. Years of sincere, community based policing built linkages and partnerships can build prevention, proper response and effective containment of even the most difficult crises.",NA,11,NA,NA

His alleged offense was trivial: {walking}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/michael-brown-ferguson-police_n_5683617.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular#498_un-chief-calls-on-us-to-ensure-rights-to-peaceful-assembly-are-protected”> in the middle of the street.

He was unarmed.

The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking. Yet the fact that Michael Brown is dead while Officer Wilson has gotten off scot-free is hardly surprising. Unfortunately, this latest killing fits neatly into an appalling yet resilient pattern of police brutality and deadly violence against men of color in America. It’s a pernicious but predictable process: When police officers racially profile black and Latino men and are subsequently held unaccountable for the unjustifiable killings of these men, another senseless death is mere weeks or days away from happening.

Michael Brown, {Eric Garner}<hyperlink=“http://www.cbsnews.com/news/eric-garner-death-rally-held-after-nyc-man-put-in-police-choke-hold-dies/”>, {Ezell Ford}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/ezell-fords-parents-friends_n_5684961.html”>, {Oscar Grant}<hyperlink=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BART_Police_shooting_of_Oscar_Grant”>, {Sean Bell}<hyperlink=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bell_shooting_incident”>, {Timothy Thomas}<hyperlink=“http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4703574/ns/dateline_nbc-dateline_specials/t/behind-death-timothy-thomas/”>, {Amadou Diallo}<hyperlink=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadou_Diallo”> — these names represent only a few of the unarmed black men killed by police officers in the past two decades. It’s true that our police men and women go out to work dangerous and stressful jobs each day, and it’s true that most of our law enforcement officers serve their communities with a commitment to fairness and safety. But even if most officers are not at fault, the trend of police violence being disproportionately inflicted on men of color is too widespread to be ignored. As Melissa Harris-Perry {observed}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/16/melissa-harris-perry-black-men-killed-by-police_n_5684588.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&ir=Black%20Voices”>, in the six years from 2006 to 2012 a black person died at the hands of a white police officer at least twice every week.

Latinos, too, are profoundly affected by this enduring plague of police brutality.

The American dream is grounded on the promise that anyone who is willing to work hard and play by the rules can make a better life for their self and their family. This can only happen when all Americans enjoy equal opportunity and equal protection under the law — and, in the case of men of color, equal protection from those who we trust to enforce the law.

With each killing in which a police officer is held unaccountable, with each instance of brutality where justice is delayed and perhaps never served, American men of color are reminded that for them, institutional racism is no mere abstraction. For black and Latino men, institutional racism may very well lead to their suffering violence, and death, at the hands of those we trust to protect and serve our communities.

I am not talking about good old-fashioned police work here. Or about militaries who police troubled parts of the world on their country’s behalf and for humanitarian causes. I’m talking about waging and profiting from war. What went down in Stockton, Staten Island and Ferguson are part of a pattern of military responses to what do not begin as military problems. The disturbance is not in the streets. The disturbance is in the minds and hearts of people who profit from military responses to what do not begin as military problems.

In one form or another, wars come home when their soldiers do. That is happening in the U.S. Our wars have come home, and one of the ways this shows itself is when community policing turns into a war on the community’s citizens. That is what we are seeing in Ferguson. What our soldiers brought home from a dozen years of war is beginning to touch us all.

Let’s be specific here, war is fought and paid for by citizens but it is waged by politicians. The people who start wars, who fund them, and ultimately profit from them... the people who set in motion the gears lubricated by lives of young men and women like Eric Garner, Misty Holt-Singh (the innocent hostage killed in the Stockton shootout), and Michael Brown — these are politicians. The gears of war do not lubricate themselves. They are made to mesh smoothly and quietly by politicians, whose own sons and daughters, by the way, are not at risk when the gears of war turn. We can no longer afford to be led by people whose idea of policy is to bring guns to negotiating scenes and war to policing scenes. It does not get us anywhere. In fact it sets us back. By now, way back. We need solutions, not more problems than we had before.

When war comes home, we see pandemonium where deliberation might have saved innocent lives. Heightening the alarm in an already-alarming scene reduces the chances of a peaceful resolution. Any sensible person knows this. When is the last time, in fact or fiction, you saw a hostage negotiator screaming at a hostage-taker? The Stockton police brought their guns and sirens to what could have possibly been a negotiating scene, and made what had already happened worse. Since when did selling contraband cigarettes require a chokehold, or jaywalking require an armed confrontation with a cop? When we get armed responses to jaywalking, the next step is armed responses to nothing at all. In a word, anarchy. And it will be anarchy not arising from citizens, but from the militarized police and the politicians who support their militarization.

What effect do videos of the Stockton police chase, the Eric Garner chokehold, and scenes in the wake of Ferguson have on our minds? They place stories there. The stories are worst-case scenarios regarding our future. Kill-or-be-killed stories, like the one that filled the empty head of George Zimmerman and caused another innocent to lose his life. That was war coming home and squatting in George Zimmerman’s empty head. The worst-case scenarios are not yet truths, but by believing them, we begin to think and expect the worst of our fellow human beings. And when we think and expect things, fictions become facts.

War in a networked world is a meme that must be stopped before it goes any more viral than it already has. In championing war-based or even antagonistic policies that target “the other,” politicians use ancient practices to try to solve brand new problems. This recalls Einstein’s definition of insanity — doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

We live, the artist Clark Ashton says, “in the infrastructure of an uncertain future.” When war comes home it destroys infrastructure. It hardens mutual distrust into manufactured hatred. It turns an uncertain future into certain chaos.

One way to wean ourselves of the war narratives that have pummeled our neurons for the past dozen years is to support {politicians with stories that have better odds}<hyperlink=“http://crooksandliars.com/2014/07/elizabeth-warren-blasts-republicans-hobby”> of positive outcomes., that are not kill-or-be-killed fictions that become facts at the end of a gun barrel. Stories that address the new problems and challenges we face, that work toward solutions by recognizing our commonalities, and building from that. Stories that are nuanced enough to see the difference between policing one’s community, and waging war on its citizens.",NA,12,NA,NA

Black respondents to the poll were three times more likely to say relationships with police have gotten worse rather than better over the past two decades, 42 percent to 12 percent. Thirty-nine percent of blacks said they think relationships have stayed the same over the past 20 years.

Even considering the past half-century, black Americans were evenly split, 34 percent for each, on whether their relationships with police have gotten better or worse. Twenty-five percent of black respondents said they think relationships with police have stayed about the same over the past 50 years.

The poll finds that, among all Americans, 58 percent think relationships between police and black Americans have improved in the past 50 years, but far fewer (29 percent) say there’s been improvement in the past 20 years.

The poll was conducted after Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The death sparked demonstrations and led to clashes between police and protesters this week. Some observers, {including U.S. Rep.

Among black respondents, 86 percent said city police are usually tougher on blacks, while 6 percent said police treat blacks and whites the same. But even white respondents were more likely to say that police are tougher on blacks than that both are treated the same, 47 percent and 36 percent, respectively.

Attendees wore red ribbons to honor Brown, 18, at Thursday (Aug. 14) evening rallies from Maine to Michigan, Florida to New York, Vermont, Colorado and California.

Many shared their stories of alleged police brutality, and called for a new compact between officers and civilians.

Brown, who was black, was shot dead by a police officer Saturday (Aug. 9) in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. While local police have released few details about the circumstances of Brown’s death, his body lay in the street for hours. His death has drawn increasing national attention, first from civil unrest by furious residents, and then an increasingly heavy-handed police presence fueled by heavy social media attention.

Kenny Wiley, a youth minister who helped organize a vigil in Denver said Brown’s death is the most recent demonstration of what he called the “systemic inequality” facing young black men in America. Wiley, who is black, said the system feels stacked against some people who pay the price with their lives.

“It wasn’t in our city, but this is our country, our world,” said Wiley, 26. “We want to stand up and say enough is enough, and to mourn those who have lost their lives.” Wiley led about 100 people through a vigil that included the out-loud listing of names of black men killed by police and chants of “hands up, don’t shoot.”

In Greenville, S.C., about 200 people, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, gathered on a plaza in front of the Peace Center for the Performing Arts.

“This struggle has depth and breadth and history,” Jackson, a Greenville native, told the crowd. “And if the impact of his death wakes you up, he’s made a contribution.”

Jackson recalled as a child the lynching of a black mentally retarded man in 1947 in nearby Pickens County and called the shooting death of Michael Brown “a state execution.”

“If it’s done by an official with a badge on and a gun, it is a state execution,” he said.

Jackson said he was in town to visit his mother when he heard about the rally, organized by two young black men.

“This is a wake-up call,” he said. “I find a certain fascination with watching these young men and women be born again.

“This is the day of your birth,” he told Ricky Pulley, one of the organizers. “You were just now born again.”

Eric Wood, a white 51-year-old business owner from Greenville, held up a sign that said “Remember!” and “Protect & Serve. No one is above the law.”

“I’m a law-and-order guy,” he said. “I believe in the police, but there are bad cops.”

Ryan Thomas, a 31-year-old auto technician from Greenville, said he felt that if he didn’t take a stand here, far from Ferguson, that something like what happened to Brown could happen in Greenville.

“It’s a problem everywhere,” he said. “It’s not just one city, one state.”

At Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., Joann Mitchell, a 53-year-old mother of a young boy, was on the verge of tears imploring the crowd to do more than get angry.

“All this here,” she said, gesturing to poster boards with the faces of some police shooting victims, “is because we didn’t do nothing. You’ve got to stop. You’ve got to hold on to each other.”

She went on, “Vote. Stop letting them do it to us. Go to school, get your education and stop this, because no one else can stop it.”

In Indianapolis, Tiffany Pettiford brought her 8-year-old son, Joseph Duerson, to a rally in downtown’s Monument Circle that drew about 100 people. As the mother of a young black boy, Pettiford said, she lives with worry for her son.

“He could just be walking down the street in 10 years, minding his own business, matching the description of someone who did do something wrong, and all of a sudden it’s ‘Stop! Put your hands in the air!’,” she said. “And with his autism, he might get scared and run.”

In Burlington, Vt., Davaki Chayut said she felt “pretty frustrated and hopeless” over the militarization of police forces.

“I think it’s important as a community to speak for those who are not being heard, to speak for those who are persecuted, and it’s so complicated,” Chayut said.

The vigil in Phoenix took place on a sultry evening at Eastlake Park, a longtime hub for civil rights rallies and African-American events. There was no visible police presence. Names of alleged brutality victims were recited aloud, followed by a moment of silence.

“What’s it really mean to have justice?” asked Tia Oso, a co-organizer. “What’s it really mean to have justice? That’s why we’re here today.”",1,NA,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff128,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/taylor-shaw/the-police-need-to-be-pol_b_5688901.html,The Police Need to be Policed,Taylor Shaw,08/18/14,10/24/16,"Last Wednesday in Ferguson County 24-year-old LaShell Eikerenkoetter spent 18 hours shivering on a thin sheet of plastic, listening to the cries of a man with cancer as he begged police for medication he must take every two hours.

“It is traumatizing. I automatically felt like my life did not matter to them at all. It did not matter that I was cold. It didn’t matter that I was thirsty. It didn’t matter that I was hungry,” LaShell said.

LaShell recalls a line of about 11 officers, the SWAT team, and Army members, walking the streets, antagonizing people. LaShell, a videographer, was jailed because she recorded police harassing a man on crutches who was not moving as fast as they wanted him to.

Officers yanked her, nearly broke her camera, and threw LaShell and several others in an airless, hot, police SUV.

A heavy set man who could not fit in the van was shoved on its floor. He screamed at police, telling them he could not breathe and had no cartilage in his knees. The officers told the man they did not believe him and left him crying on the floor of the van.

LaShell has never taken the stance as someone who hates the police, in fact, she believes there are good cops out there, but she had a revelation while she was jailed; one most black men, jailed without reason, must know.

Within the first two hours of sitting in the jail cell, LaShell realized that if anything were to happen she would have to trust the police with her life, the same police officers who mistakenly cut her while releasing her hands from a plastic wire and mocked her when asked for an apology.

“It’s like how can you be so inhumane?” LaShell said.

The same police officers who refused to give her water and intentionally placed her in a jail cell with a broken water fountain.

When I spoke with LaShell I could tell that she was shaken by her first personal encounter with police brutality but I could also hear her determination to keep fighting for peace.

Her Instagram features a picture of a young boy holding a sign that says:

“Protect and serve? That’s a LIE!!! They don’t care when Black kids DIE”

As she snapped the photograph, LaShell could see the fear in this young boy’s eyes. She believes that young black boys may not fully understand the reality that is police brutality but they do know that they may not make it to 20 years of age. {Every 28 hours a black man is killed by a police officer.}<hyperlink=“http://www.occupy.com/article/black-man-killed-us-every-28-hours-police”> 

On Thursday, Aug. 14 I attended a National Moment of Silence vigil in Chicago honoring Mike Brown and other victims of police brutality.

I wanted to record the footage to help combat the mainstream media’s misleading understanding of who is honoring victims of police brutality. It is not just the people in Ferguson. There are people all over the world — of different races and ages — honoring the civilians that die at the hands of American cops every single day.

As I shouted, “Black lives matter,” in a crowd of beautiful, remarkable souls I realized that police brutality is not only negatively effecting the black community. It is also playing a large role in negatively shaping the mindsets of all members of our society.

LaShell and I had a conversation about how mainstream media is failing us. This is the reason she is not sending her footage to news outlets but is instead, taking the power and putting daily footage on {her Instagram account}<hyperlink=“http://instagram.com/the4th_duck”>.

On one Instagram post she says, “I’ve seen articles, interviews, footage of a whole bunch of bs that is doing nothing but trying to defame this teenager or paint protestors to be an angry mob. Yet, you’re not showing the egotistical, evilness of the some of the police out here. The media is failing us.”

We live in such a politically correct world that our own president cannot openly tell us that he is outraged at the obvious murder of a teenage boy. Our country is so politically correct that media companies are convinced that they will not survive if they openly tell the honest truth.

As a journalist I know a lot about ‘media speak,’ the proper way to speak objectively as a member of the media. ‘Allegedly’ and ‘claim’ are two words we are force fed in journalism school but who made that happen? When did being real stop being an option? Black men are murdered every single day in situations similar to Mike Brown’s and the ‘alleged’ claims, unnecessary speculations, and continued disconnect between the media and the people are key to the maintenance of police brutality. Police officers know how to manipulate the mainstream media. Prime example: It was clearly known by officers that Mike Brown stealing cheap cigars was unrelated to his murder yet that information was released as a tactic to defame him and devalue his life. Now there is an article out {questioning his enrollment in college}<hyperlink=“http://fox2now.com/2014/08/15/was-michael-brown-enrolled-in-college/”>. In my opinion, the media, knowingly or unknowingly, is doing a lot to help police end black lives.

LaShell has taken a lot of footage of the police brutality occurring in Ferguson and even though major outlets have requested the footage none of them have used it. Instead the media is focused on irrelevant details that have nothing to do with the fact that Mike Brown was shot six times, twice in the head, and his body was left outside for four hours then whisked away in a shady van.

In this new, technological age we can capture police brutality on camera but can that really help us combat it? It does not seem like videography provides enough evidence to bring down police brutality. Why is that?

At the vigil in Chicago I raised my hands up with my neighbors for four minutes, one minute for every hour Mike Brown’s body was left lying in the street. After four minutes of having my arms raised high in the air of course they ached. But every single minute was a minute well spent.

The vigil was important, not because we were honoring black life but because we were honoring all life. All life matters. American citizens deserve better.

When LaShell was arrested protesters were being peaceful and praying on the concrete, but the forceful police created a hostile environment.

“They’re treating us like we’re the ones who killed somebody,” LaShell said. “The picture that’s being painted is that it is us but we aren’t the problem. They are.”

LaShell was filming at a peace rally in Ferguson while I interviewed her over the phone and a woman that overheard our interview admitted that the police had gotten violent with her and her company as they marched.

“You have hundreds of people who are out here trying to get justice. I’m just so frustrated because the police and media are hindering the progress that is trying to be made,” LaShell said. “The real revolution isn’t being seen around the world. I’m not counting on the news to know what’s going on because it’s not the truth.”

Last night at 9:30 p.m., LaShell stood on the top of a hill, looking down at tons of police lights flashing. Last Saturday the police enacted a curfew of 12 a.m. but this night they threw bombs at the marchers three hours before the curfew.

“The police is nothing but a gang. They just have each other’s back,” said LaShell.

On her Instagram page LaShell said, “I’m fighting so nobody will be shot down in the street nor abused during an arrest! We’re doing this for you.”

LaShell is now a victim of police brutality but she is also a survivor. She understands the role she must play in order to end police brutality and create peace. A lot of the people reading this article, myself included, have yet to experience police brutality. We do not know that agony or that pain. So what is stopping us from being as brave as LaShell and ensuring that the police are policed?

One of my favorite novels is Black Boy by Richard Wright. It is the tale of Mr. Wright’s childhood, his life growing up in the Jim Crow South. In one scene in the novel Wright describes how he felt submitting to the authority of his oppressors.

“I felt drenched in shame, naked to my soul. The whole of my being felt violated, and I knew that my own fear had helped to violate it. I was breathing hard and struggling to master my feelings.”

If you were to read this quote to a young black man in America and ask him if he could relate I guarantee he would say yes. Before we hire police officers we need to make certain that all officers value all life and that all officers make it a point to end the devaluation of the black man.

The topic of police brutality is popular right now but it has always been an issue.

As a young man from St. Louis exclaimed at the vigil in Chicago, we must capitalize on this moment in history and force change.

In LaShell’s words, “From all this that we’re going through there has to be some type of light at the end of the tunnel.”",NA,130,NA,NA

“Pending further investigative and forensic analysis, the LAPD Force Investigation Division investigators have requested that The Los Angeles County Coroner place an investigative hold on the pending autopsy report,” read an LAPD press release issued Monday.

LAPD Commander Andrew Smith told Southern California public radio station KPCC that {investigative holds are common}<hyperlink=“http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/08/18/46063/ezell-ford-lapd-places-security-hold-on-autopsy-fo/”> in cases that are currently ongoing and and in active investigations, in order to keep witness testimony from being tainted.

“They could use information from the autopsy to give credibility to their story,” Smith said.

Ed Winter, the assistant chief of investigation at the coroner’s office, told The Huffington Post that he didn’t know how long the hold would last.

Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of civil rights community forum the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, questioned the LAPD’s decision to delay the report, and linked Ford’s killing to Brown’s.

“The blocking of the autopsy report of Ford comes on the heels of the release of the autopsy report on Michael Brown which contradicted the police version of how Brown was killed,” Hutchinson said late Monday. “The blocking of the release Ford autopsy report further fuels suspicions about the LAPD’s version of the Ford killing.”

LAPD says that on Aug. 11, shortly after 8:10 p.m., {two anti-gang officers shot Ford}<hyperlink=“http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/56794”> after a struggle ensued during an {“investigative stop”}<hyperlink=“http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/56791”> and Ford tried to grab one of their firearms.

“They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division, knows that — that this child has mental problems,” the man said in an interview with the local network. “The excessive force ... there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in the back while he’s laying down? No. Then when the mom comes, they don’t try to console her ... they pull the billy clubs out.”

Another eyewitness told The Huffington Post that he heard a police officer shout {“shoot him”}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/lapd-suggests-mentally-il_0_n_5675782.html”> before three bullets were unloaded into an unarmed Ezell, who was already on the ground.

Back then, about 15, 16 years ago, it was different. It was headliners and openers.

And when I went out on tour with CeCe Winans in 2001 — literally a month after 9/11, we went out on tour — and my thing to CeCe was, “We can’t do this how the others have done it. Now, if we’re going to tour together, we’re going to be on stage together. And we’re going to enjoy each other, and I’m going to run and interrupt your stuff and you’re going to interrupt my stuff.”

And we formulated this great concert … and now Fred and I are doing the same thing. And with him, it’s going to be different because he has every hit song that every praise and worship team has sung across the country and around the world. It’s going to be a whole lot of musicality. I’m going to sing some of Fred’s songs; he’s going to sing some of mine. And we’re just going to have a wonderful time.

In our black communities, we have a real stigma against dealing with mental sickness and issues. “Why are you depressed? Suck it up.” And we don’t want to acknowledge it. And the same thing in the church, “Just pray and God is going to take it away…” But there’s some things that are really chemical imbalanced, or there’s some kind of a sickness that goes on mentally that needs to be paid attention to. And when we see telltale signs, we need to acknowledge it. When Robin died, it hurt me so badly. And I only met him one time two years ago in D.C. at the hotel that we were staying at. He was so nice and accommodating … and just from that brief moment you would have never known that there was a depression.

And we don’t pay enough attention to our family members, to our friends. We don’t pay enough attention to the telltale signs. And we need to be educated on these things, because it’s not an uncommon thing for people to fight manic depression ... It’s not just “crazy” ... and we need to really clinically and spiritually pay attention to everything going on.

Another sad and unfortunate news story that’s been in the news lately is the ongoing investigation and protests stemming from the Michael Brown shooting. What’s your take on the situation?

This is nothing new. It’s just in the day of the camera phones you can catch it now and immediately have your own news broadcast where it’s not censored, where it’s immediate and it’s undeniable. What happened with Mike Brown, what happened with Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, these are not isolated incidents. These are things that have been happening for a long time. The abuse of power. And it’s not just on minorities; it’s the abusive power all over, inclusive of that. But what happened to Mike Brown was senseless. What happened to Trayvon was senseless. The young man sitting in his car, Jordan Davis, senseless…

I wish I could get all of our gospel artists together and get on a plane and go down to Ferguson like we should’ve done with Trayvon, and just bring peace. Come down there to sing and pray and be at the protests, but bring a scent of religious peace to the unrest and the upset so this way it doesn’t go to too far. Talk to the people who are covering their faces with the red bandanas and causing trouble, and let them know this is not the way to do it. Let’s bring God into this, as well as justice.

The second season of {“Preachers Of L.A.” is set to debut this week}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/24/preachers-of-la-season-two-premiere-date_n_5525337.html”>. Are you a fan of the show?

I was very purposely silent last season, because four of the five of them I know. I am a pastor, I am a preacher, I am a Christian, I am a man who loves integrity and I was brought up and raised in a great home that taught me that what goes on in the home is not public knowledge. And it’s not good to air out … this depiction of people who we deem to be spiritual leaders and people who are supposed to be credible, and people who are supposed to be the strength in the community. We all have natural lives, every one of us, but there are certain things even in our natural lives that we don’t want our employees to see, we don’t want our friends to see. There are things that we keep hidden until we work them out. We would love the luxury of being absolutely transparent, but it will hurt the people who are looking up to us.

Everyone’s entitled to it, but reality TV goes a little too far. And it goes too far especially when it deals with Christianity. With pastors carrying guns to mission work. Then my question is, “Why are you going? I thought you said that you had God? Isn’t God your protection?” And I think it’s more harm than good. Because if you have 1 million people viewing, that gives a bad depiction to 1 million people of the preachers who sacrificed every day and every week for the people. 99% of the preachers are not like that. Flossing their stuff and driving around in their Bentleys and Rolls Royce Phantoms, and living high on the hog. There’s no sin in that, but the Bible said all things are lawful, but it’s not always expedient. The servant lives better than the people he has called to serve. And that gives the wrong depiction.

What do you think about other reality shows that may perpetuate negative stereotypes of African-Americans?

I have a real problem with the stigma that happens … “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” is the same as “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” and the same as “The Real Housewives of New York” and “New Jersey.” It’s all the same script and scenarios. I don’t like things that demean people. Whether it’s black, white, yellow, brown, or red. It’s brought us down to such a base element. It doesn’t work unless it’s controversial, or flinging some wine in each other’s faces. And that’s what America has sunk down to. This voyeuristic type of “oh my God, let’s have some sensationalism.” And we lost quality, we lost morality, and it only makes us worse. So I’m not a fan of too many reality shows at all.

HuffPost,huff133,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lina-srivastava/unhashtagable_b_5688885.html,‘Unhashtagable?’,Lina Srivastava,08/19/14,10/24/16,"Hashtag activism draws on the logic that outrage or heightened audience reaction caused by iconic images can sway public opinion and eventually effect changes in policy, an argument that in its modern context has been documented since at least the Vietnam War era. With the advent of immediate and pervasive circulation through social media, the growing influence of images and short-form collective communication as persuasive media in policy decisions and social impact is undeniable.

But if hashtag activism builds on and replicate this assumed association between moral outrage and social justice through images and short communication, does it further offer the possibility of a more informed and effective strategy for social impact?

In other words, can hashtag activism lead to any kind of real change — or are atrocities the world over, in their essence, unhashtagable?

Hashtags as Slacktivism

There is a strong argument that much of hashtag activism is ineffective, or is merely passive action that substitutes for real change. Take the case of one of the one of the most recent and famous hashtag campaigns, {#BringBackOurGirls}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BringBackOurGirls&src=tyah”>. On April 14, 2014, 276 girls were kidnapped from their school in Nigeria’s Borno State. Outraged Nigerian activists and those affected directly called on the government to take action to both recover the girls and to combat the historic impunity of the alleged kidnappers, Boko Haram. Eight days after the kidnapping, Ibrahim Abdullahi, a lawyer living in Abuja, created the now infamous hashtag. The day after the leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, took responsibility for the kidnapping in a video on May 5, Michelle Obama tweeted a picture of herself with a sign reading #BringBackOurGirls — and the day after that, the hashtag spawned 1 million tweets.

It was nearly a month after the abduction itself that the news went viral on Twitter. With Michelle Obama’s May 6 tweet paving the way, political figures and celebrities came out in support of the hashtag and #BringBackOurGirls became an outlet for individuals to express their own outrage over the kidnapping. While capitalizing on the emotion of the #BringBackOurGirls movement, however, individual tweets began to shift the focus away from the actual girls, or even larger issues of violence, and onto the tweeters themselves. Model Irina Shayk’s apparently topless Instagram photograph where she holds a #BringBackOurGirls sign, for example, generated a mixed response. Some argued it was empowering while others slammed the picture for being culturally insensitive and inconsiderate to the actual issues at stake. In two tweets from the days after the media explosion around #BringBackOurGirls, Ugandan-American writer Teju Cole wrote that Boko Haram’s sustained and escalating violence was “{horrifying and unhashtagable}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/tejucole/status/464240061601812480”>“ — conveying his thoughts that the #BringBackOurGirls movement was an excuse for patronizing and sentimentalizing an issue that African and African-allied activists have been fighting for years.

Along similar lines, ownership of the hashtag and the entire social media movement around the school kidnapping came into question. Organizations Girl Rising and Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls joined forces to organize a Google Hangout on May 6, which focused on the importance of “social media marches” to raise awareness and maintain visibility. Their call to action hinged on the belief that individuals can combat injustice by leveraging social media through a “common voice.” One recommended technique for asserting a “common voice” across social media was for individuals to change their profile pictures to an image of the words “Bring Back Our Girls” in white on a red background. This campaign, which disappeared as quickly as it started, was called out by some as a self-serving promotion aimed at hijacking the excitement around #BringBackOurGirls. Nigerian organizations called out Girl Rising’s drive for $10 donations for a #BringBackOurGirls emergency project as having no established relationship to the original, local campaign. Controversy about ownership of the campaign intensified when one of the director’s of Girl Rising’s 2013 film, Ramaa Mosely, seemed to take the credit for the creation of the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag and its subsequent movement in a series of interviews on USA news networks.

Because of its brief yet intense popularity on Twitter, accusations of co-option and questions about the effectiveness of “raising awareness,” #BringBackOurGirls has been likened to the media campaign Kony 2012 ({#StopKony}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stopkony%20&src=typd”>). While both campaigns gained a tremendous amount of attention, they both failed at engaging sustained activism around their respective causes and at achieving actual success on the ground. Both campaigns were also criticized for encouraging a U.S. military agenda on the African continent when they provoked an international military response.

{In an article for Slate}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/05/20/the_depressing_reason_why_hashtag_campaigns_like_stopkony_and_bringbackourgirls.html”>, Joshua Keating highlights that media campaigns like Kony 2012 and #BringBackOurGirls are popular because they cause a sense of moral outrage via an easily-identifiable villain while glossing over the complexities of the causes they represent. The kidnapped girls and Kony himself became iconic images, but the vast majority of the public consuming these images remains ignorant of the dynamics of the issues at stake, for example, that the girls’ abduction is part of a wider terror program that has seen thousands of people murdered in Nigeria by Boko Haram in the past four years. Against defenders of social media campaigns who claim them as “gateways” for raising deeper awareness for global injustice, Keating argues that more often than not these campaigns lead nowhere because they cannot sustain interest on a personal level:

Viewers get interested when they hear about evil monsters like the Lord’s Resistance Army or Boko Haram who just need to be stopped. When they learn more about the issue and find out that, lo and behold, the world is a complicated place, that killing the monster won’t be so easy and that there are larger issues in play beyond the monster itself, they lose interest.

The co-option of #BringBackOurGirls presents the further question of whether hashtag activism, through its saturation of both formal and social media networks, has the potential to harm the causes it sets out to champion in the first place. Web searches about the kidnapped girls reached their peak from the May 8-10, a total of two days after the hashtag went viral, and interest has dramatically declined since. Between May 2014 and the present, the story of the kidnapped girls evolved for a brief time into a celebrity cause. But a scan of media from May 29 to date indicates a sharp decline in media interest in #BringBackOurGirls, despite the Nigerian government admitting that they know where the girls are yet fear that it is too dangerous for them to retrieve the girls by force. Continued Boko Haram attacks and other on-going atrocities fail to remain hot issues in the {crowded information environment}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/06/26/new-media-old-problems-in-human-rights?utm_content=bufferc5aa9&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer”> of the mass media. Excitement and attention around #BringBackOurGirls has died down, but the girls are still not found. The world’s attention has moved on, despite the fact that nothing has changed vis a vis Boko Haram’s activities in Nigeria or the persistent systemic factors leading to the vulnerability of populations like the 276 girls.

Hashtags as Tools for Activism

There are ways in which hashtag activism can be a useful tool. When used with sensitivity and a clear understanding of its limited reach and impact, it can be a flexible medium for social networking and raising awareness within broader and more sustained advocacy and action.

Localized, community-driven hashtags, such as {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=“http://hyperallergic.com/143645/hashtagging-racism-the-power-of-iftheygunnedmedown/”> and #RIPEricGarner, as well as the appropriation of #MyNYPD to cite examples of police misconduct and brutality, for example, have served as creative vehicles for sharing information, mobilizing opinion, focusing community anger on justice, and sustaining commentary over a defined period of time or over a set of shared goals. In these cases, the hashtags arose specifically from and in support of the African-American community, which is reeling from yet another round of sustained brutality, with {four recent deaths of unarmed black men}<hyperlink=“http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/3-unarmed-black-african-american-men-killed-police”> at the hands of police across the U.S.

The killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, has been met with citizen action on Twitter, driven first through Black Twitter, then more broadly, using the hashtags #Ferguson — through which news and information was gathered and disseminated on the unfolding police reaction and discussions around peaceful protest and the militarization of civilian law enforcement; #MikeBrown — which served as an act of protest and of empathy, to name the victim and remind us of him as a person inherently deserving of justice; and #IfTheyGunnedMeDown — which called out a prejudicial photograph of Mike Brown circulated after his killing and created a call to action around the power of visual culture and our larger perceptions of African-Americans.

As of this writing, the crisis in Ferguson is still unfolding. What appears the case is that the heightened attention on social media, particularly on Twitter, has led to a deeper national discussion of police militarization and law enforcement’s treatment of young black men, though there is still a {fight for media attention}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/malkia-a-cyril/thank-you-black-internet-_b_5680380.html?&ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000051”>. Ultimately the question of whether these hashtag movements will have contributed to any effects on the ground or in long-term perception shifts remains open.

So Which Is It?

Is hashtag activism effective or not? To have comprehensive understanding of this kind of activism, a range of questions needs to be explored: What is the value of imagery in today’s social media networks where a glut of images exists? What is the role of social media in addressing injustice on a global scale? Whose participation is important, or determinative? What standards can we use to gauge the success of a social media hashtag campaign?

Many social media commentators claim that the mere occurrence of heightened awareness in the perceiving and communicating audience is sufficient to count as “impact.” And in the cases where hashtags created a community-driven critique, as in #IfTheyGunnedMeDown or #MyNYPD, the very engagement toward collective identity and organized participation represents a shift that will have ripple effects in similar ways that media and policy critiques do. In contrast, #BringBackOurGirls (like KONY2012 before it), appears to be a classic example of facile and self-validating activism, where people have jumped on the bandwagon for a moment and then quickly lost interest.

Ultimately, until the questions are answered around whose interests are served by hashtag activism and what it actually accomplishes for those directly affected, in both the short- and long-terms, most atrocities will indeed remain “unhashtagable.”",NA,62,NA,NA

Depending upon where you get your news, you’ve either heard about a devastated community trying to peacefully protest the murder of an unarmed black teenager at the hands of police or you’ve heard about violent, angry black people looting and antagonizing police because a gang member reached for a police officer’s gun.

I started shaking in anger typing out the later part of that sentence. This is racism in America.

Mainstream media don’t want to acknowledge the basic humanity of a dead black kid. We see it all the time. Just look at {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/hashtag/iftheygunnedmedown”>.

I’m horrified and outraged that it is not safe to be a black person in America.

What I’ve unfortunately discovered (and because of my white privilege, I remained unaware for too long) is that a whole lot of white people don’t seem to care at all that this is happening. They want to ask what Michael Brown was doing wrong when he was gunned down, unarmed with his hands up, asking the officer not to shoot.

They want to remind me that “most police officers” are good, upstanding people who do their job to uphold the law. They want to say “what about black-on-black crime” as if that is something to excuse murder, as if “white-on-white crime” doesn’t happen. They want to believe he was a gang member, as if that would justify him being gunned down in the middle of the day.

They want to blame black people for the crimes committed against them.

The truth is that no matter how black people behave in America, there are white people who will murder them. And try to cover it up. And {most of the time}<hyperlink=“http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2010/07/when-police-shoot-unarmed-man-oscar-grant-verdict-Mehserle”>, they get away with it.

What that breaks my heart is that this is not news to black people. They deal with this all the time. They have learned to expect the worst out of white people.

It makes me ashamed to be white, and it makes me ashamed to be an American.

I know that there are good white people, people who are educated and who comprehend the systems of oppression that operate against people of color and especially black people in America. I also know that there are good white people who are so bombarded with racist messages that they are unaware of their own ignorance.

I think, or would hope, that with enough educational information and enough patience, the ignorantly ignorant white people can learn to recognize their own racist attitudes and begin to reject them. I think it is possible to educate someone out of ignorance. After all, ignorance just means a lack of knowledge or information. I would hope that people, when educated, would be able to see how horrifying it is that a black man is extrajudicially executed in the United States {every 28 hours}<hyperlink=“http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/1-black-man-killed-every-28-hours-police-or-vigilantes-america-perpetually-war-its”>.

But what do we do about people who are willfully hateful and ignorant?

I don’t have the answer. I’m actually asking.

There are many much more capable and involved people writing about this issue. There are people on the ground protesting, spreading images and video of what’s happening. If you are interested to get involved, to help, or just inform yourself, do some research. Follow #Ferguson #JusticeforMikeBrown and #DontShoot.

For me, for now, I’d just like to take the rest of this space and honor the black lives taken too soon. My heart and thoughts go out to their families and friends, and to our nation, which I hope can come together, address these issues and heal. If you’re a praying person, say a little prayer for those listed here. If you don’t pray, send some love in your thoughts.

We hold our own children close and try to imagine his family’s sorrow, yet cannot.

Today, I write a letter from the jailhouse of race. This jail has no visible walls, but there are walls nonetheless. If we do not rise up against them and tear them down, we will remain trapped and afraid.

Racism continues to plague our nation and communities. Instead of lynchings, we have {prisons}<hyperlink=“http://www.sentencingproject.org/template/page.cfm?id=122”>; instead of segregated schools, we have the systematic {dismemberment of public schools}<hyperlink=“http://www.publicschoolshakedown.org/choosing-to-remain-silent-about-the-dismantling-of-urban-public-education”>. Our prisons, schools, and public works are being signed, sealed, and delivered into the hands of for-profit carpetbaggers of the 21st century, while teachers, parents, and children are left with little or nothing if they are Black, Brown, or poor.

Overwhelmingly, Black and Hispanic students now have a price on their heads. Why? These students have been {promised to the prison system}<hyperlink=“https://www.aclu.org/school-prison-pipeline”> because for-profit prisons and detention centers have contracts that {guarantee filled beds}<hyperlink=“http://www.thenation.com/article/176997/video-why-company-wants-you-prison”>.

Even our churches are not immune.

On August 8, 2014, we learned of the apparent cold-blooded murder of yet another Black teenage boy who had just graduated from high school. From all witness accounts, a policeman reportedly provoked, attacked, and repeatedly shot Michael Brown as he tried to kneel down with his {hands raised in surrender}<hyperlink=“http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/”>. Mike was unarmed.

No letter of sympathy is enough, because there are too many letters of sympathy to write. Michael Brown is just one among countless victims of racism. We must all fall to our knees and confess that we have not done enough to break down the walls of race.

When we get up off our knees, we need to take time to read the Bible with new eyes. Woe to those who let widows and orphans starve! Woe to those who ignore the poor and needy! Woe to those who have power to change things yet do nothing!

People in religious authority and people of faith who could reach out but don’t, will gnash their teeth in the darkness of despair when, one day, they meet their maker and realize they could have loved and served their neighbors, but instead, they washed their hands and pretended they are colorblind with no power.

The time for pretending has long passed. The time for confession and action is now. Racism and a police state targeting people of color are not just in Ferguson, Missouri, or just on the border where {children and their mothers are being treated like criminals}<hyperlink=“http://www.democracynow.org/2014/8/14/new_family_detention_centers_hold_immigrant”> instead of asylum seekers from drug wars.

As I watched the video of militarized police in SWAT teams and armored vehicles attacking citizens of Ferguson, Missouri, with tear gas, rubber bullets, and incendiary devices, I remembered the words of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in his {letter from Birmingham Jail}<hyperlink=“http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/resources/article/annotated_letter_from_birmingham/”>.

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; ... who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action;” ... Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

It is time for us to rise up — not in violence but in creative non-violent action, which pulls back the curtain on the inherent violence of racism and {race-based policing}<hyperlink=“http://www.civilrights.org/publications/justice-on-trial/race.html”>. We remember the words of Jesus and the words of almost every angel in the Bible who upset people’s lives: “Fear not!” You can do this!

Be creative! Today, there are Freedom Schools springing up across this country. Be part of it! Today, there are foster homes in our churches that are opening up to the children crossing the border. Learn Spanish! Put yourself on the path of change. Speak out! Say “Hello” to someone who appears different from you. Start small, but think BIG! Organize! Start where you are. Work as a team. Just start!

War rages on in Israel/Palestine.

Michael Brown was shot and killed in Ferguson.

Robin Williams committed suicide.

One of my friends died of cancer.

Friends are struggling with all kinds of things: relationships, health, work, etc.

Countless others: strangers, friends, enemies and allies around the world and around the corner face the end of life in ways that most will never know.

Death in one form or another surrounds us every day.

And while I do believe in the hope that comes with each new breath in the morning and the promises that God has offered even after death, this is not a post about “Oh, suck it up, I’ll be okay tomorrow.” In fact, I think we have to get better about sitting with death in a social media world. Sure, sometimes I need to be reminded that hope is a powerful force in the world, but sometimes, I also need to also linger a bit longer in the crap pile that is death, helplessness and heartache.

The velocity with which social media allows us to jump from tragedy to tragedy combined with the public ways in which our insensitivities and lack of social nuance are magnified, allows us to gloss over the fact that with every death — EVERY DEATH — there is grief, sadness, and loss. Because of the momentum and volume with which information is delivered, we too often and too easily rank and give import to some human tragedy over another. We bean-count death and our social media influence. Social media gives us amazing connections for healing and support, but it’s important for us to make sure that we do use it to jump too quickly from one human tragedy to another. In all of our actions, we must resist the urge to rank tragedy, for at the table of the grieving, sadness is sadness, suffering is suffering and death is death.

An example of this for me as been with the death of Robin Williams. William’s suicide and documented struggled with mental health issues has brought to the forefront powerful conversations about mental health, depression, and suicide. Being close to these issues in my own communities, I have been uplifted by so many profound and thoughtful words and actions that have been offered to the world.

That said, I was struck by the rapid shift that so many have made from the situation in Israel/Palestine where bombs continue to be launched and in Ferguson, MO where our country’s struggle with racism has been so evident. Yes, Robin Williams was a cultural icon and a human being whose talent and gifts will never be duplicated and his death has presented an opportunity to address depression and suicide. He is certainly worthy of public accolades. I am in no way saying the death of Michael Brown or a child in Palestine should be held in higher regard, only that it seems as if we have done just that with the death of Robin Williams. I am not asking folks to rank one death over another, but I am challenging myself and my community to sit with the death that crosses our eyes a little longer than our newsfeeds would like us to.

Death gives us a chance and a challenge to engage at the deepest and most intimate levels that we can as human beings. In time, death gives us entry into conversations that can transform lives: social injustices can be toppled, cultural fissures healed and new life embodied. In the end, I believe that the ways in which we approach death: the causes, the impact and the heartache informs how we embody life: the systems that surround us, the people with whom we live and our hope for a better tomorrow.

So . . . even as I go about my life, enjoying the final days of summer with my family and communities, I will strive to sit with the many deaths that cross my newsfeeds. For with each death, there is a family, a friend and a community that will be forever changed and they deserve some time. And in respect for the dead, in honor for their communities and with the hope that may be known in the future, I hope you will do the same.",NA,261,NA,NA

On August 24, 1955, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicagoan visiting his grandparents in the Mississippi Delta, allegedly whistled at a white woman while patronizing Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market. Different sources provide conflicting accounts as to why Emmett whistled. Some contend that his whistle derived from a debilitating stutter. Others contest that Emmett’s whistle was deliberate and was coupled with physical groping and verbal vulgarities. History may never know exactly what took place because Emmett is not here to speak for himself.

On February 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Floridian made a short odyssey to purchase Skittles and iced tea at a Sanford convenience store. While returning home at night, Trayvon discovered that he was being followed. Deeply alarmed, Trayvon called a friend and informed her of what was transpiring. Little is known beyond that fateful phone call. History may never know what exactly took place because Trayvon is not here to speak for himself.

On August 9, 2014, Michael Brown, an 18-year-old, college-bound freshman, allegedly entered a Ferguson, Missouri convenience store, assaulted the attending clerk and stole a box of cigars. Like Emmett and Trayvon before him, the surrounding details are disputed. Yet, the final outcome is the same. Moments later, Michael lay dead in a pool of his own blood in the middle of the street. Once again, history may never know what exactly took place because Michael is not here to speak for himself.

While these unarmed teenagers are unable to tell their own stories, the media has conveniently stepped in to offer its own narrative. It is a narrative that we have heard so often and for so many years that we know it by heart. [Insert the name of the deceased here] must be gang-associated, a drug dealer, capable of great violence, and a notable threat to society.

His or her death must be warranted.

For this convenient narrative, the physical attributes of the victims are used to justify the violence that befalls them. Emmett was a stocky, mature-looking young man. Surely, he was capable of sexually harassing this white woman, possibly even threatening her with rape. Trayvon Martin was wearing a hoodie over his head, and he had gold teeth in his mouth. Surely, these are the indisputable markings of a common thug. Michael was a towering and powerful-looking, young man. Surely, he was a threat to the public’s safety.

In the end, this convenient narrative holds that these uncontrollable youths got what they deserved.

In criminalizing the victim, the brutality of the perpetrator is diminished. In the case of Emmett Till, the fact that a child was beaten, castrated, shot in the head and thrown in the river gained no traction in a Southern court. In the case of Trayvon Martin, the fact that his armed assailant, who possessed a violent criminal record, had initiated the pursuit was overshadowed by the marijuana later discovered in Trayvon’s system.

In the wake of Michael Brown’s death, the #ifiwasgunneddown Twitter trend highlighted the historical inconsistencies of the media’s portrayal of unarmed African American youth who are the victims of violent crime. We shall now see how the narrative will unfold for Michael. What we have seen thus far is that images of his unarmed, lifeless body have been replaced with images of an alleged assault and theft of a convenience store. For some, the alleged incident already justifies the final outcome.

Convenience stores are designed to offer rapid entry and departure with selected goods. With convenient narratives such as these, the media is able to lift from the shelves of our nation’s racialized history such labels as thug, sexual deviant, drug dealer, addict and criminal with possible gang ties, then depart quickly to run with the story.

This week in Ferguson, protesters burned down a convenience store. While such violence should not be condoned, the time has come to set this convenient narrative ablaze!",NA,240,NA,NA

Brian Fallon tweeted in support of Huffington Post reporter Ryan J.

Fallon called Reilly “gutsy” for his coverage of the protests and said the DOJ is “lucky” to have him.

The problem, as Tapper pointed out, is that Fallon is currently part of the administration threatening to jail another journalist, James Risen, for doing his job.

Risen has been ordered by the DOJ {to testify against}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/14/james-risen-new-york-times_n_5324303.html”> an alleged source who is believed to have given him classified information about the CIA for his 2006 book State of War.

This is HuffPollster for Thursday, August 14, 2014.

LITTLE TRUST IN JUSTICE SYSTEM’S HANDLING OF KILLINGS BY POLICE - HuffPollster: “Nearly half of Americans don’t trust that justice will be served after police officers kill civilians, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted days after unarmed teenager Michael Brown was fatally shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri. Forty-five percent of Americans say they don’t trust the justice system to investigate police shootings properly, while 37 percent do. The remaining 19 percent are undecided. Separately, 43 percent said the police use lethal force too frequently, while 32 percent said they do not. Responses were divided starkly along partisan and racial lines. Democrats were nearly three times more likely than Republicans to think lethal force is used too frequently and to distrust the justice system. Sixty-nine percent of black Americans think the police use lethal force too frequently, compared with just 37 percent of white Americans, and two thirds of blacks don’t trust the justice system to investigate police killings, compared with 40 percent of whites.” [{HuffPost}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/police-killing-poll_n_5679104.html”>]

Not a new issue - Polls taken after earlier riots showed similar concerns about racial equality and the justice system. From 1992:

-Robin Toner: “Most Americans view the riots in Los Angeles as a ‘warning’ about the state of race relations, and say it is time for a new emphasis on the problems of minorities and the cities, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll…. in general, the survey seemed to catch Americans in a grim mood, with 53 percent of the whites and 55 percent of the blacks saying there will always be ‘a lot of prejudice and discrimination’ in America. Similarly, more than half of both whites and blacks predict that there will still be racial riots in American cities 25 years from now.“ [{NYT}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/11/us/after-the-riots-los-angeles-riots-are-a-warning-americans-fear.html”>, h/t {Kristen Anderson}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/KSoltisAnderson/status/499950522238259200”>)]

-The Washington Post: “Do blacks and other minorities receive equal treatment by the criminal justice system? Yes, said about half of all whites questioned. No, said nine out of 10 black respondents. Nor do blacks believe that they receive equal treatment at the hands of police. More than eight in 10 blacks interviewed disagreed when asked if blacks receive ‘equal treatment as whites from police,’ up from seven in 10 in a Post-ABC News survey conducted two years ago. Among whites, about half said police treat blacks and whites the same way, unchanged from the earlier poll. Eight in 10 blacks also said the federal government only pays attention to black concerns ‘when blacks resort to violent demonstrations or riots,’ a view shared by four in 10 whites.” [{WashPost}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/lariots/stories/poll.htm”>]

HOW DEMOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES AFFECT DEMOCRATS IN THE SOUTH - Nate Cohn: “Democrats have already made big gains in some Southern states, like Virginia and Florida. But Republicans have held firm or even made gains of their own in other states, including Texas, a state where demographic and migration trends seem as if they should be helpful to Democrats. The explanation for the varied pace of Democratic gains in the South, along with the transformation of Dixie more generally, is illustrated with census data compiled by my colleague Rob Gebeloff for The Upshot’s project on migration.…Democrats were able to become competitive so quickly in states like Virginia and North Carolina because they combined a growing nonwhite share of the electorate with gains among white voters, particularly in postindustrial metropolitan areas full of Northern expats. Without additional gains among white voters, Democrats will be forced to wait a long time for the children of foreign-born residents to carry them to competitiveness in Texas, a state that Mr. Obama lost by 17 points in 2012, and where there isn’t a flood of Democratic-leaning voters from New York to bail them out.” [{NYT}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/upshot/changing-south-is-at-intersection-of-demographics-and-politics.html”>]

CANADIAN FIRM ATTEMPTS TO CROWDFUND MAYORAL SURVEY - Winnipeg Sun: “A Winnipeg-based polling firm is hoping locals are so interested in who’s winning the mayoral race that they’ll pay to find out. Probe Research has launched a ‘crowdfunding’ campaign through the website Indiegogo to finance a public opinion survey on Winnipeg’s mayoral race. If people and organizations donate $8,000 by Aug. 27, Probe will launch a survey, with results released to sponsors by Sept. 10.

OBAMA SEEN AS STRONG LEADER BY NEARLY HALF OF AMERICANS Dana Blanton: “President Obama’s job rating has been underwater for over a year. Some people criticize him for exceeding his authority by going around Congress to push his policies through. Others say he is getting little accomplished because of a lack of leadership and willingness to compromise. Well, which is it? The latest Fox News national poll finds that Americans are more likely to think Obama falls in the just-do-it category than the do-nothing camp. Obama is a “strong leader who does what it takes to get his policies enacted,” say 47 percent of voters. Compare that to 39 percent who say he is a “weak leader who doesn’t seem to do much of anything.” Most Democrats say Obama does what it takes, while most Republicans say he can’t get the job done. Still, 20 percent of Republicans (one in five) describe Obama as a leader who does what it takes to push his policies through...Meanwhile, 52 percent of voters see the president as engaged and “on top of things” vs. 44 percent who think Obama is disengaged and “already checked out.” [{Fox}<hyperlink=“http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/14/fox-news-poll-imperial-or-imperiled-mixed-views-on-obama/”>]

ANOTHER NEW POLLSTER CHART FEATURE - We’ve added another small but hopefully useful feature to the HuffPost Pollster charts: The “create your own” view of each chart now allows users to filter polls on the basis of partisanship of the sponsor or pollster. We created three mutually exclusive categories: entirely non-partisan polls; polls with a partisan sponsor like a political campaign, party committee or political action committee; and polls conducted by partisan pollsters (defined as pollsters frequently hired by campaigns or campaign committees) but without partisan sponsorship.",NA,NA,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff140,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-house-phd/dear-michael-brown-if-i-w_b_5682376.html,Dear Michael Brown: If I Were Preaching on Sunday Here Is What I Would Say,"Christopher House, Ph.D.",08/15/14,10/24/16,"I started out in ministry when I was just a teenager. I gave my first sermon, or as is called in my tradition my “trial sermon,” at age 19. When I started preaching I was around the same age that Michael Brown was when he was shot and killed a few days ago in Ferguson, Missouri. I have since gone on to earn several college degrees, to become a college professor, and a chaplain. Michael Brown will not. Had he lived long enough, perhaps I would have been fortunate enough to meet him when he would have presented research at an academic conference. Unfortunately, the college-bound student was gunned downed before he ever stepped foot in a college classroom.

As a young African American male, it is clear to me that my ecclesiastic and socioeconomic standing will not shield me from this reality: Michael’s story could at any given moment become my story. In the eyes of some, we are a burden to our nation and a threat to their existence. In moments of unrest like this we need to hear words that speak healing to our hearts and minds. Words that will guide us through the aftermath of yet another death of an unarmed black male at the hands of those who swore to protect us — deaths that bespeak a deep racial divide in the U.S.

Over the past few days we have heard from local and federal law enforcement officials and attorneys involved in the case. We’ve heard from political figures, civil rights leaders, the bereaved parents of Michael Brown, and even from President Obama regarding this case. These voices are important to hear, and yet and still the exigencies and implications of Brown’s death call for another voice.

Historically, Judeo-Christian traditions and scriptures brim with examples of trusted individuals who were “called” by God to be his spokespersons to stand in sacred spaces and to address exigencies of social ills, social injustice, and the complicity of the privileged in the face of the oppression of others. Anomalously, I am not scheduled to preach in my local church or anywhere in the nation this Sunday. However, if I were, I would present my sermon against the backdrop of an ancient, yet timely, question posed by King Zedekiah as recorded in the book of the prophet Jeremiah. In Jeremiah 37:17, when in the midst of his own national crises Zedekiah asked Jeremiah, “Is there a word from the LORD?...”

As videos of hundreds of protesters being tear-gassed by police flooded Twitter, as Facebook feeds were filled with comments of black mothers who struggle to believe that the U.S. is a safe space in which to raise their black baby boys in, I echo the words of King Zedekiah: “Is there a word from the LORD?” This Sunday and in the weeks to come we need men and women of the faith to effectively articulate how this ancient text speaks to and informs our current lived experiences, especially in increasingly militarized spaces of color.

Is there a word for the family of Michael Brown and for the citizens of Ferguson? Is there a word for a nation that continues to structurally support the devaluation of black life, including that of our Trayvon Martins, Sean Bells, Oscar Grants, Eric Garners, and Renisha McBrides? Is there a word from the Lord for my fellow clergymen and women who continue to preach to parishioners as if they are only members of the church and not members of society? Is there a word for the faithful who safely prefer to stay in our comfortable houses of worship and “pray” for our nation rather than having praying feet that will allow us to form strategic alliances to bring about the kind of spiritual, economic, and political organizing that can tear down racial inequality, among other forces?

Is there a word from the Lord that would challenge my white clergy members who love to simply write off and distance themselves from the racist acts of one of two individuals [i.e., cops] as being the acts of ‘one or two bad apples out there’ but fail to acknowledge how they and their predominantly white congregations benefit from the very same system of white privilege? For some, this privilege will be in full effect on Sunday when they remain homiletically silent about the implications of Brown’s death in relationship to their white privilege. Once again they will fail to acknowledge how their group’s unearned social advantage is directly tied to another group’s social disadvantage. That’s privilege!

Is there a word from the Lord that would speak to the black males of this nation to tell us that our blackness is not the sign of one who is “less than,” “the other,” “savage,” or “animal”? Is there a word that would speak to a colonized mind-set that would have people of color to think that we are anything other than wonderfully and fearfully made like everyone else? Is there a word that would encourage the thousands of foot soldiers of justice whose everyday actions continue to change our nation? Michael, if I were preaching this Sunday I would remind your family that their resources are not limited to what they can see. Those who are on the side of justice are more than those who are against it. We will get through this.

If I were preaching this Sunday, I would preach with a Bible in one hand and a newspaper in the other. As spokespersons for God and ministers of the gospel our job is to find the exegetical answers for the Zedekiahs all across the nation and then to communicate those answers to the masses. No other question is more important to answer at this time. When asked, “Is there a word from the Lord?” Jeremiah responded, “Yes, there is.” In the face of Michael Brown’s death, how will we answer to the same on Sunday?",NA,110,NA,NA

It looks like Mosul or Gaza, or worse, 1963 Birmingham.

It looks like there will be more violence.

It’s time to put down our weapons and promote peace.

An unarmed black teenage boy carrying Skittles walks through a white neighborhood in Florida and is shot and killed.

A black teenage girl has a car accident in the dark of night and knocks on the door of a suburban Michigan home hoping for help, and she is welcomed with a gunshot through the locked screen door that ends her life.

And now another unarmed black teenager is shot to death at a QT in Missouri.

It’s time to put down our weapons of hate and pick up the peace of Jesus.

. . .

I’m sickened by the disgusting killing of children and teenagers in our country. I’m sick of us doing so little to stop all the dying from guns.

So I make an appeal to all: put down your weapons and promote peace.

I know that may sound irrational and fanatical to some, but if you know the Jesus of the Bible then please listen.

When the angels appeared on that first Christmas night they announced, “Peace on earth.” Peace is what Jesus came to bring into our world and our personal lives. The ancient prophet Isaiah named him the Prince of Peace. In his first sermon Jesus said, “Blessed are the peacemakers.” Then he promised that his peace would remain with us even after he left earth.

When I hear churchgoers say things like, “It’s my God-given right to own a gun,” or, “If more people had guns these kinds of tragedies would not happen,” I wonder when in Jesus’ ministry did he ever tell us to take up arms as an answer to the trouble in this world? What does God have to do with anyone’s desire to own a gun?

Jesus never said, “Buy more swords at sword shows, because the Romans may attack.” He never said, “You need a sawed-off sword or an automatic sword to defend your home.” He never said, “Prepare for the end of the world. Buy more swords.”

His answer was never weapons.

His answer was always peace.

Jesus’ kingdom is a kingdom of peace; “blessed are the peacemakers.”

So I ask, is the peace of Jesus only something we experience on the inside? Is his peace only for a kingdom after we die? No. The peace of God is for this world—today.

. . .

When I watched the gut-wrenching news of twenty elementary children and six teachers being savagely gunned down in their classrooms, I wondered, Why do we refuse to put down our guns?

When two teenagers killed eleven in a Colorado high school in 1999, I thought we would put down our guns.

In 2005, after a sixteen-year-old killed nine people in Minnesota, I hoped we would put down our guns.

Just two years later, after thirty-two were massacred on a university campus in Virginia, I was certain we would put down our guns.

When twelve more were gunned down watching a summer movie in Colorado I thought there would be a national cry for people to put down their guns.

We the people have been silent.

. . .

My appeal is first to Christ-followers. If you really follow the Jesus of the Bible, then follow his path of peace. Let’s put down our weapons and instead become apostles of peace.

I hate to say it, but I find the adage “Guns don’t kill people; people kill people” intellectually insulting. It makes no sense. It’s like saying cigarettes don’t cause lung cancer. I’m not saying don’t hunt, if you eat what you kill. But I have to be frank: no one needs a semiautomatic weapon, like the ones that have killed so many in movie theaters, shopping malls, and elementary classrooms.

The fact is there are simply too many guns lying around our homes and country. Practically once a week I read about children accidentally shooting their mother, their brother, their best friend, or themselves. When will everyone wake up to the madness? Guns are made to kill. The more guns we pack in our closets and cars, the more people will die.

I do not make my appeal as any kind of political statement. I’m not asking for anykind of law or vote. I simply hope to remind you that if Jesus was against brutality, violence, and weapons—and for peace—then so should we.

. . .

The fog of war still hung heavy in the air when I returned to my home in Liberia after the civil war, after the killing with guns had stopped.

Peace was precarious.

A cease-fire had been negotiated by a brilliant new president, Ellen Johnson Serlief, the first female head of state in Africa. UN checkpoints littered the roads to keep the peace.
But the boys in the bush still had guns.

Lots of guns.

However, the tribal people of Liberia wanted peace. They wanted the killing to stop. They wanted their children to go back to school. They wanted the guns put down. At the urging of the Liberian government and the United Nations, tribal leaders across the country began asking the boys in the bush to put down their weapons. Their enticement to some was, “Trade your gun for a pair of brand new high-tops.”

The guns began to pile up in gritty war-torn towns like Ghanta and Gbanga. Tribal leaders, mothers, and fathers pleaded with their sons, the boy-soldiers, to turn in their weapons—until an entire nation had put down their guns.

Now there is peace.

. . .

Sometimes we pursue inner personal peace and become okay with no peace in the world. My invitation is for you—all of us—to lead the way to peace on earth. It starts with the church, with Christians everywhere. I invite you to pray for peace. Become a promoter of peace. Teach peace. Model peace. Champion peace as a great godly attribute.

My challenge to you is to be an apostle of peace. Spread peace in your workplace and stop the conflicts. Fill your home with words of peace, not shouting and angry words. Bring peace to your friendships, and help end the slander and backbiting.

. . .

The prophet Isaiah spoke of the kind of people ruled by God: “They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.” What if our churches invited people from their towns and cities to lay down their weapons at the foot of the cross as a statement that we want the peace and love of God to rule our lives and families and communities?

What if we handed brand-new Bibles to every person who came to put down their weapons. Then we took their weapons to a blacksmith who literally beat them into hoes and shears for tribal farmers in places like Liberia.

The good news is a tribe of Christ-followers is forming who are saying, We will put down our weapons and promote peace. I invite you to join the tribe. Because if the peace of God can rule the Liberian jungle it can rule anywhere . . . even the cities and suburbs of America like—Ferguson.",NA,140,NA,NA

The controversial policy, which is expected to go into effect next month, has divided the community over whether or not police are becoming too militarized, especially in light of the recent events in {Ferguson, Missouri, where heavily armed officers have clashed repeatedly with demonstrators}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/ferguson-protests_n_5689963.html”> since a white officer shot and killed an unarmed black teen on Aug. 9.

According to local data aggregator NeighborhoodScout, Compton ranks among the {top 100 most dangerous cities}<hyperlink=“http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/neighborhoods/crime-rates/top100dangerous/”> in America. Those in favor of the new policy say arming school police with semi-automatic weapons could be crucial in preventing school shootings and that the AR-15 rifle is more accurate than other kinds of firearms. Only officers who first “pass an internal selection process” will be permitted to carry the weapon, reports Los Angeles public radio station KPPC.

“Handguns you’d be lucky to hit accurately at 25 yards,” Compton Unified Police Chief William Wu told the news outlet. “With a rifle in the hands of a trained person, you can ... go 50, 100 yards accurately.”

“The AR-15 is, essentially, a gun that was designed to inflict maximum casualties, death, and injury, in close to medium range. That’s what it does,” gun control advocate and former National Rifle Association member Tom Diaz told CNBC. “The real problem is that we allow that kind of firepower to come into a theater or into a first-grade class.”

The {Compton School Police Officers Association took to Facebook to defend the new policy}<hyperlink=“http://laist.com/2014/08/18/compton_school_police_will_be.php”> and the preparation officers will undergo before arming themselves with AR-15s:

If we encounter an active mass murderer on campus with a rifle or body armor, our officers may not adequately be prepared to stop that suspect.

The rifles are designed for increased accuracy and use rifled ammunition than can pierce body armor. The safety of our Students, Staff, and Parents are very important to us.

As a child I was a worrier. I lay in bed and worried. I worried about my family. If anyone went out in the evening, I lay awake and worried until they came home. I worried there would be an accident, a drunk driver, a catastrophic event, a mugging or a murder. My mind went and still goes crazy with worry. I never feel safe until the family is safely tucked in their beds. Even then I plan escape routes in the case that someone breaks into my home. Where do I hide when I dial 9-1-1? Who grabs the children? Where do we wait until the police arrive?

I am a worrier. I worry about crazy things.

Growing up in Boulder, Colorado, my brother and his friends got into the typical teenage mischief, even a little more than the typical mischief. My friends and I did the same. As teenagers, weekend nights were spent drinking beer and schnapps in parks around town. Summer nights we hopped fences and went swimming in private pools. As we got older we crashed college parties. We were typical teenagers participating in typically harmless illegal activity. Most of these nights the cops would come. Sirens piercing the night air, the heavy thud of official fists pounding on front doors. The cops came. We ran. We ran, jumped fences and crossed private property. We sprinted away as fast as we could. Teenagers breaking the law. They shouted at us to stop. Some of my friends laughed. The rebellious shouted profanities in return.

I am a worrier. I worry about everything. I worry about the craziest things. I never worried that a police officer would shoot me. I never worried that an officer would shoot my brother. I never worried that they would shoot any of my rebellious friends. If you asked me if it ever crossed my mind whether an officer might pull his gun and shoot at us?

I’d respond,”ludicrous, inconceivable, crazy” — not something I worried about.

I am a worrier. I worry about crazy things.

I met my husband when we were in our early twenties. His pants sagged below his boxers, a hoody draped over his head. When he walked home from the bars late at night I never worried that police officers might stop and frisk him. I never worried that a neighborhood watchman would follow him and pull out a gun. I never worried that an attitude toward authority would get him shot. His parents never worried about these things.

Even though I am a worrier and I worry about crazy things.

We live in a world that is not color blind. We live in a world of the haves and have-nots. We live in a world where black boys are shot unarmed just for being black boys. We live in a world where an 18-year-old black man is shot multiple times by a police officer weeks before he goes to college. We live in a world where the media criminalizes black victims by memorializing them with photos that make them look like thugs. We live in a world where a neighborhood watchman murders an African American teenager under the guise of “self-defense.” The teenager’s act of aggression — being black.

My daughter starts kindergarten in a couple of weeks and I am sick with worry. The list is long — will she be lost in the classroom, will she speak up for herself, will she make a friend, will she have someone to sit with at lunch and play with at recess? The start of a long list of worries.

But then, I pause to think. I am the mother of a white girl. My worries are drenched in white privilege. If my childrens’ skin were a different color then there would be real worries.

My heart hurts for the mothers of black boys who have to worry about prejudice that I cannot even fathom. A world where police officers don’t represent safety. A world where there is no presumption of innocence. A world where their children must learn to convince people of their good.

I am a worrier. I worry about crazy things.

America has reason to worry.

Racism exists. The world is not color blind. We must not cast a blind eye. How many unarmed black men must die before society makes changes?

HuffPost,huff146,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ace-robinson/why-i-fled-st-louis_b_5683510.html,Why I Fled St. Louis,Ace Robinson,08/15/14,10/25/16,"Why I fled St. Louis at 18 years old and fear for my boys that I left behind:

For the past week, I have not been able to get much sleep since learning of the killing of Michael Brown in broad daylight in the suburbs of St. Louis. Clearly the killing of this unarmed Black boy hit too close to home. Being born and raised in St. Louis and surrounding suburbs, I felt no choice, but to flee St. Louis for the reasons that are self-evident today.

I ran away from that city due to police abuse, constant harassment and seemingly non-stop surveillance more than 15 years before the St. Louis Police were responsible for the death of my cousin in 2012. I ran away before I had to drive his children 600 miles to bury their father who experienced the type of daily mental torture at the hands of police — from his teenage years till his death — that the majority of Black boys and young men experience in that city when they choose to step outside. I ran away before I could fully grasp why I ran without ever looking back and began to strategize how I could keep every Black male that I love out of that town. I was the boy who constantly was harassed by the police. I was the boy who felt safer walking near gang members at the mall than near the police. I was the boy who watched his mother cry herself to sleep after we went to the police station to file an official complaint after my first Driving While Black experience: Stopped and harassed one week after getting my driver’s license for the crime of dropping off my friend at his apartment after dark while having another friend in the car. Yes, all three of us were Black.

I was lucky. I used my academics to get away. In the same way that my mother used her academics to flee the Jim Crow South 35 years prior to my birth. My cousins, unfortunately, did not escape. And with each visit to my hometown, I was reminded through their stories that St. Louis is still not a safe place for a Black man as long as a policeman is nearby. At family reunions, we laugh — cause crying hurts too much — when my aunts tell the stories of having borrowed their respective sons’ cars only to be pulled over immediately on their way to work because the police think that they are their sons.

My unrelenting anger at all that police stand for in this country comes from the perspective of a Black St. Louisan. It will not be quenched even if this killer is actually brought to justice. Nearly all Black people in America doubt that will happen (see: George Zimmerman for a well-known reference.) My oldest St. Louis nephew is almost 12 now. I saw a picture of him a couple of weeks ago, and he is beginning to look like a teenager. My first reaction was sadness. Not because he is no longer the 5-year-old that I would spoil with each visit, but because I know what he is about to experience: countless and unending harassment, and more closed doors to opportunity and more open doors to the criminal justice system.

This past Saturday evening, I celebrated the nuptials of two friends. At the dinner, without knowledge of what had just happened in St. Louis, I engaged in a conversation at my dinner table with Nigerians and White Americans about how dangerous this country is for Black American boys, especially in places like St. Louis. I detailed what actions I learned to protect myself from the police. For example, as a teenager, I never drove without a tape recorder in the car. When I experienced my weekly and often bi-weekly pullover, I would place it on the dashboard and hit record. When the officer walked up to the car, I would say: Good afternoon, Officer Insert name here, announce the date and time and ask kindly why I was being stopped. This script might have saved my life more than once. One thing that Black men all learned from Rodney King, the police are only held responsible when their actions are recorded. And even then, civil disobedience may be necessary even when police abuse is as clear as day.

Today, I have many nephews and godsons who are growing up Black in cities that are notorious for the abuse of Black boys: St. Louis, Los Angeles and my current city of Seattle. I’m just scared. For many of them, I am their big, tough uncle who can protect them from anything whenever I am around. My job is, and always will be, to be their mentor as they grow into adult Black American men. I promise them that I will support them with anything that they dare to dream. But what I cannot promise them is safety from the police. I will not lie.

My truth is based in my experiences, and those of the St. Louisan boys that I accompanied into manhood. The first time in my life that I felt safe from the police as I walked the streets was when I moved to South Africa, four years post-apartheid to do study abroad. I was able to go for a jog during the day or night, hang out with a group of similar-looking friends, drive a fancy car, walk around a mall in peace or even drop a friend off in a wealthy neighborhood. I learned to do all these things without fear of the police. It was such a freeing experience.

Now I am tired. I’m tired, and I fear for the day that my nephews cannot walk the streets of St. Louis together without my fear that a policeman may be nearby.

What are we doing? This is not the world our forefathers conceived when they wrote the Second Amendment. Violence begets violence, and with no reasonable measures for arms control, our country is rapidly becoming militarized. The police are reacting to threats. Every angry or troubled soul could be carrying a concealed weapon and usually is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have the right to bear arms per the {Second Amendmen}<hyperlink=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution”>t, but that was signed into law way before assault rifles were even a glimmer on the horizon. We are at an impasse in our country, society and culture, and must find a way to resolution.

Indeed guns are part of large sectors of our country often passed down through the generations — father to son. But it seems that our reality has changed. Too many novices are running wild and getting access to high powered weaponry. Last week, another young, white, mentally impaired woman was killed by the police right in San Jose, California. The weapon she was brandishing turned out to have been a power drill that had been painted to look like an assault weapon. Maybe, if the culture wasn’t running wild with illegal guns, the murder rate and gang activity so high in this locale — the police would have reacted differently. Yikes we sure don’t know and thank goodness don’t have to make those decisions every day.

Look, the economy is still in the toilet for many Americans. Times are tough and income inequality still prevails. Funds have been cut from mental health services in many states, and unfortunately many are going untreated — proverbially falling through the cracks. Americans are nervous in this world of troubles. What’s going to happen to them? Is the US going back to war? And if so where — Iraq, Afghanistan, the Middle East, or even Russia? Will folks be able to afford gasoline if this happens? Why are hybrids so expensive? Is the next airplane going to fall from the sky and where? What does it take to stay safe and keep your family safe? Sadly, this is the environment that allows racism and prejudice to fester and get a toe hold to dig in.

You know, we lived through Prohibition, and now track liquor and its sale. Marijuana is leaning toward legalization around the country. Can’t we step back from the random acts of violence in our streets, towns and cities?

With each passing day, it seems that the media pulls further away from the catalyzing and most critical event in this series of shootings, protests, and injustices. As groups and organizations with varying agendas continue to dilute and muddle the sharp, inescapable reality of what transpired on the evening of August 9, my anger and sadness continue to build. As I sift through content that focuses on the looters or the shoes that they stole, I wonder, where is Michael Brown in all of this, and where is the man who shot him? As I continue to see posts like the following, my disgust threatens to take over, pushing me to fall for the distractions that we are all being fed: 

I have no useful commentary or information, as I’ve stated. I simply want to take the time and space to say that this is a real tragedy. This tragedy is inextricably tied to who we all are as Americans, the plain, undeniable clothes of racism that we should all be facing right now, and certainties of police brutality that must be addresses on a national level. I could spend plenty of time running through the list of items that anger me about this terrible event, but I have not seen enough content that simply takes a moment to grieve Michael Brown, so I hope that this post merely functions as a small form of grievance for the loss of a young man who did nothing to provoke or call for the cruel end to his life. One of the most powerful images that I’ve come across is the below photograph, which was organized by students at Howard University. The photo speaks for itself:

As the media continues to ravage our information, I hope we don’t forget August 9, and I hope we can process August 9 as it should be: in full form, without distraction, and without unethical reporting.

But for Tritobia and Edsell Ford, both 42, Ezell Ford will always be a beloved eldest son. On Friday, at the home where they raised him and his siblings, dressed in funeral black, they bemoaned their child’s tragic early death.

“We’re so devastated,” Edsell Ford, Ezell’s father, said. “It’s horrible what happened.”

“He was snatched away from us,” Tritobia Ford, his mother, said while shaking her head. “He was so young. I didn’t even get to have grandchildren.”

A basketball net stood unused in front of the family home, in the shadow of the 110 Freeway. Tritobia Ford said her son had loved to play basketball since he was a little boy. She described him as kind and “free-spirited.”

“He didn’t look at life the same way as other people,” she said.

Tritobia Ford said her son’s distance from others grew as he got older. She doesn’t recall anything particularly unusual about his behavior as a young boy, but when he was a teenager, he started to exhibit signs of the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia that run in her family, she said.

“Maybe it was always in him,” she said. “But it peaked when he was about 18.”

Ezell’s friends and neighbors supported this picture with recollections of a sweet boy who became increasingly troubled as he aged. Shirley Benitez, 24, said she has lived two doors down from the Fords since she was 9, and remembers playing with Ezell and his younger brothers constantly when they were kids.

“We used to play in the street together, all of us,” she said. “It was so much fun. We were really close. We all went to middle school together, right in the neighborhood.”

Benitez said she and Ezell drifted apart after middle school because they attended different high schools. She went to Venice High, and he went to University High in West LA, she said. University High Principal Eric Davidson said Ezell attended the school until 10th grade, but he wasn’t sure where he went afterward.

Benitez said she recalled hearing Ezell was having troubles with his mental health in high school, but said she was never clear on exactly what that meant. Ezell continued to greet her warmly whenever they would see each other around the neighborhood, but something seemed different about him, she said.

“He was always so sweet and polite,” she said, “but whenever I would see him, he was almost always by himself.”

Ashanti Harrison, 31, another friend of Ezell’s who lives two blocks away from the family, said he was a popular, normal teenager who loved to dance and play basketball. In more recent years, Harrison said, he had mostly seen Ezell walking around alone.

“He never bothered anybody,” Harrison said. “He would walk up and down the street for hours just asking people for cigarettes.”

Harrison said Ezell was walking alone the last time he saw him. On Monday evening, Harrison said he was showering in his second-floor apartment on 65th Street when he saw Ezell walking down the street. A police car pulled over, and two male cops who were larger than Ezell got out, Harrison said.

Harrison said Ezell looked frightened and confused. A struggled ensued, and the officers ended up wrestling Ezell to the ground and shooting him three times. He was pronounced dead at the hospital that night.

Four days later, Ezell’s parents expressed hope that justice would be served in the case of their son’s death. “We just want to see something done,” Tritobia Ford said.

A protest over Ezell Ford’s death is planned to take place at LAPD headquarters downtown on Sunday at 3 p.m.",1400,10,NA,NA

Gwen Thomas,08/18/14,10/27/16,"My grandson just turned six years old. He’s smart, funny, loving, affectionate and kind. He’s also an African-American male. I remember when his dad, my son, was six. His dad was six and little and cute. I recall his pediatrician in our small Alabama town commenting on how energetic and precocious my son was. That doctor was white and only 15 percent of his patients were black.

Then my son turned nine and his fourth grade teacher in Cobb County Georgia called me and said she was concerned that he was in a gang because he wore a Chicago Bulls athletic outfit too often. He was enamored with Michael Jordon — just like his white classmate was. That teacher was white. And 10 percent of her students were black. When my son was 13 and buying Valentine’s Day candy for the first time for a girl he liked, a policeman followed him around the grocery store until I asked the cop if he had any crime he needed to pursue and assured him my son was spending my hard earned money to buy the three dollar box of chocolates.

As a young adult my son made some unwise (and even dangerous) choices. He was arrested and beaten up by police. Beyond his actual, real mistakes, he has been profiled and harassed for just being. Thank God, he’s lived to find his place in the world and redeem himself of his youthful folly. He and my daughter-in-love are doing a great job rearing my grandson, his sister and their baby brother.

But I am afraid now. One day my grandson won’t be six and little and cute. In fact, in 12 years, he’ll be the age Michael Brown was on the last day of his life. In 11 years, he’ll reach Trayvon Martin’s last age of maturity. And it won’t matter what values his family has instilled in him, nor what the “content of his character” is. That part of The Dream is still a fantasy in America.

I’m really scared. Right now he likes Ninja Turtles, but someday he might prefer music that he plays louder than a person pumping gas near his car may like. I’m worried that he might be coming to visit me in a neighborhood, and because he’s wearing a hoodie or talking trash with his friends, some woman will look out her window, call the cops and say, “I feel threatened.” He might even knock on a neighbor’s door to innocently ask for help, and they won’t wait for the law, they will simply “stand their ground,” shoot first and not ever ask questions.

I’m concerned that even if he makes a juvenile mistake, or commits a petty crime, he won’t get to be admonished or learn from his foolishness. I’m worried I can’t vouch for him. Or his dad and mom can’t protect him from his wayward thinking. Instead he will be gunned downed like his ancestors who were defenseless against unjust laws and lawmen.

I am petrified that someone who has sworn to protect and serve him will instead maim and kill him. I am convinced that unless something changes, the chances of him being a species more endangered than any other is ever increasing at the hand of gun-strapped thugs, racists and maniacs who hide behind government-sanctioned clothing and duties.

And in the midst of the genocide occurring, one life at a time, I watch and listen to pundits on news stories criminalize these victims. In fact, they make sweeping statements that judge and misjudge my culture and make up details about my community that rationalize irrational abuse of power.

And then there is the complexity in my professional life that dictates that I show up in spaces and suppress my pain and anger. Otherwise I too am deemed unsafe and threatening if I dare point out this not at all subtle or disguised vile hateful behavior is indeed a reality for me and those I love. Not to mention, I have to negotiate to protect myself based on which of my identities make those in power feel uncomfortable. Or “threatened.”

AL SHARPTON: CORRECTING THE POLICE FORCE “As I have often stated, not all police officers are bad. In fact, I believe most of them truly are doing their best to protect people and reduce crime. But it is blatantly clear that there are some bad ones who have violated their own policing protocol, and it is those that must be dealt with immediately. Just like police officers don’t think everyone in our community is bad, we don’t believe all of them are bad, but we want to catch the bad ones just like they want to catch the bad ones.” [{HuffPost}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-al-sharpton/become-the-change-you-wan_b_5669118.html?utm_hp_ref=yahoo&ir=Yahoo”>]

HuffPost,huff154,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-anne-franks/presumed-unworthy_b_5673321.html,Presumed Unworthy,Mary Anne Franks,08/13/14,10/27/16,"On August 9, 2014, a black teenager named {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=“http://www.democracynow.org/2014/8/12/the_killing_of_michael_brown_missouri”> was shot to death in broad daylight by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. His dead body lay uncovered in the street for four hours afterwards. News of the killing spread rapidly across social media, and soon began to dominate mainstream news as well. Among the {details}<hyperlink=“http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/justice/michael-brown-missouri-teen-shot/index.html”> to emerge was that Brown was a recent high school graduate who was due to begin college only a few days before his death. Other reports note that Brown was a “gentle giant” who had been in JROTC and loved making music. Media outlets were criticized for circulating a picture of Brown that seemed to portray him as a menacing figure when several other photographs were available, including a picture of Brown in his graduation cap and gown and another of him sitting at a dinner table with a young relative. Similar criticisms were made in the aftermath of Trayvon Martin’s death, and the question of the media’s selective portrayal of black shooting victims sparked the powerfulTwitter hashtag {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=“http://time.com/3100975/iftheygunnedmedown-ferguson-missouri-michael-brown/”>. Twitter users — many of them black and male — post contrasting photos of themselves (e.g. in military dress v. in casual clothing with drinks in their hands) asking “#IfTheyGunnedMeDown which photo would they use?”

The point is obvious and important: to emphasize the humanity of those whose lives have been cruelly taken, to challenge racist stereotypes that clearly play a role in the violence so often aimed at minorities, and to highlight the media’s complicity in after-the-fact rationalizations of unjustified killings.

But this attempt to humanize is fraught with its own dangers. In one of the many insightful and poignant reflections written in the wake of Brown’s death, Roxane Gay {expressed}<hyperlink=“http://roxanegay.tumblr.com/post/94365539485/silence-is-not-an-option”> this stark sentiment:

I don’t care if Mike Brown was going to college soon. This should not matter. We should not have to prove Mike Brown was worthy of living. We should not have to account for the ways in which he is suitably respectable. We should not have to prove that his body did not deserve to be riddled with bullets.

“We should not have to prove Mike Brown was worthy of living.” The truth of this statement cannot — must not — be ignored. This is not simply because, as Gay astutely points out, the worthiness of white male victims of violence rarely needs to be similarly demonstrated. It is also because it leaves undisturbed the deadly presumption that the value of some people — of some lives — is contingent upon a showing of good behavior. It is as though an ever-present question mark is allowed to hover over some people’s lives — in particular, blacks, women, sexual minorities, the poor — calling their very right to exist into question.

Some have called the killing of Michael Brown a {denial of due process}<hyperlink=“http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/the-platform/editorial-michael-brown-and-disparity-of-due-process/article_40bb2d0e-8619-534a-b629-093ebc79f0a6.html”>. Due process may seem like a curiously legalistic term to invoke in this context, but it throws the values at stake into sharp relief: a society that polices, prosecutes, and condemns people based not on objective indications of wrongdoing but on the whims and prejudices of the powerful is a society without due process and without justice. A foundational moral principle echoed everywhere from the Bible to Immanuel Kant to J.S. Mill to the U.S. Constitution is that human beings are presumed worthy of respect and liberty. We do not lose that presumption merely by looking or acting in ways that other people find objectionable or unwise. In the absence of strong evidence of willful wrongdoing, we must be allowed to make our own decisions, our own mistakes, our own lives.

What if {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=“http://abcnews.go.com/US/video/trayvon-martin-texts-reveal-fighting-drug-use-19249306”> sometimes smoked marijuana or if Michael Brown threw gang signs in pictures? What if {Marissa Alexander}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/09/marissa-alexander-prosecutor_n_1504428.html”> was furious and not just frightened when she fired a gun in the direction of her abusive husband? What if {Eric Garner}<hyperlink=“http://time.com/3016326/eric-garner-video-police-chokehold-death/”> got angry at the police as they tried to arrest him? What if {Mark Carson}<hyperlink=“http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/gunman-shoots-32-year-old-man-dead-greenwich-village-bias-attack-officials-article-1.1347776”> was “flaunting” his homosexuality in front of the man who shot him in the face? What if {Christy Mack}<hyperlink=“http://jezebel.com/christy-mack-releases-statement-photos-following-attac-1619896390”> had engaged in infidelity before her MMA fighter boyfriend broke her jaw? What if the unnamed {homeless man}<hyperlink=“http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/2014/07/seattle-firefighters-among-three-charged-with-assault-and-harassment-of-homeless-man/”> sleeping on a memorial in Seattle had been disrespectful to the firefighters that beat and stomped on him? What if, in other words, these people sometimes made mistakes or acted before they thought or experienced strong emotions — what if they were, in short, typical human beings?

Typical, and yet not, because the lives of racial minorities, sexual minorities, women, and the poor are presumed unworthy. Their lives are singled out for constant scrutiny, interrogation, and interference by both state and society, and they are expected to be nothing less than gracious in the face of this. The state regulation of their bodies is reinforced by society’s casual claims to their labor, attention, and deference. This is a social order that carefully measures out the acceptable amounts of anger, resentment, or aggression for these groups and warns them of the consequences for exceeding them. The moment they step out of line or go off script, their fragile claim to basic dignity and security is shattered. The silent message follows them wherever they go: Your claim to existence is contingent on our indulgence. One false move and you will be punished. Or, in Stacia L. Brown’s poignant {words}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stacia-l-brown/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri_b_5668820.html”>, “One false move and their minds or their wills or their ability to feel at all will be gone.”

The possibility of being imperfect — of making mistakes — without dire consequences is in some respects the very definition of privilege. For only some groups need to fear that they may trip the wire of state-sanctioned violence at any moment. Some groups can engage in {armed resistance}<hyperlink=“http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/the-irony-of-cliven-bundys-unconstitutional-stand/360587/”> against the government, walk into department stores with {assault rifles}<hyperlink=“http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/guns-target-open-carry-texas”> slung across their backs, {cheat}<hyperlink=“http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/04/09/an-affair-to-remember-politicians-infidelity-doesnt-matter-to-us-anymore”> on their partners, {flaunt}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/weddings/wedding-proposals-go-from-private-moments-to-public-spectacles/2013/12/26/4de34f40-6cb6-11e3-b405-7e360f7e9fd2_story.html”> their sexual orientation, {destroy the economy}<hyperlink=“http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jan/09/financial-crisis-why-no-executive-prosecutions/”>, and be indulged and even celebrated for it.

Some groups get to proclaim that their actions are uncontrollable or inevitable, practically forces of nature, while others are told that every act they perform is a choice for which they alone can be held responsible.

This dysfunctional state of affairs must be rejected. There is no justice in condemning some people to a perpetual state of cross-examination, tasked with convincing the rest of society that they deserve to move freely, make personal choices, or continue breathing. We cannot continue to subject certain groups to selective scrutiny, seizing on the slightest infraction as a pretext for unleashing our suspicion and hostility..

In a {Facebook post}<hyperlink=“https://www.facebook.com/bobseay/posts/4895459316081”> that went viral in the wake of Trayvon Martin’s death, a man named Bob Seay wrote that he doubted both extremes of the media characterizations of Trayvon Martin: “I’m guessing that neither portrayal — saint or thug — is accurate. People are more complex than that.” How good of a kid Martin was, says Seay, is ultimately beside the point. “None of the Trayvon Martins that I know deserve to die. They may arouse suspicion, but your paranoia is not their crime.” 

As tributes and protests form following Brown’s death, as they did after Trayvon Martin’s killing, there are many proclamations of solidarity: “We are Michael Brown.” But this identification is not the only path to justice, and it may inadvertently obscure other ones. Seay’s Facebook post, provocatively titled “I Am Not Travyon Martin,” suggested that identification is an unstable foundation for revolution. “You don’t have to be Trayvon Martin to know this is wrong. You don’t have to be black, or young, or a ‘troubled student’ or a pot smoker to know this was murder.” Seay concluded, “Let me be more blunt: This type of injustice will continue until enough guys like me — guys who are not Trayvon Martin — have had enough of it and finally say ‘No more.’”

We cannot continue to accept the inverted, discriminatory, deadly logic of our current society. The endless demand for some people to prove the worth of their own lives will take everything they have, and will never be enough.",NA,130,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff155,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/alaska-senate-polls_n_5692876.html,HUFFPOLLSTER: Will The Polls Get It Right In Alaska?,"Mark Blumenthal, Ariel Edwards-Levy",08/19/14,10/27/16,"Alaska holds this year’s last competitive GOP primary. Will the polls accurately forecast the winner? And USA Today teams with Suffolk University to conduct statewide polls in 2014. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, August 19, 2014.

ALASKA AND WYOMING GO TO THE POLLS - Samantha Lachman: “As the midterm elections primary season winds down, the focus turns to Alaska, where voters on Tuesday will decide the last competitive Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. Former Alaska Attorney General and Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Dan Sullivan is the frontrunner to challenge Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) in November — though Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell and tea party favorite and attorney Joe Miller haven’t eased Sullivan’s path. (Sullivan the Senate candidate is not to be confused with Anchorage Mayor Dan Sullivan, who will be on Tuesday’s primary ballot for the Republican lieutenant governor nomination.)....Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), seeking a fourth term, also seems to be secure: When former Vice President Dick Cheney’s daughter Liz withdrew her bid in January, Enzi was left with a substantial war chest and four lesser-known rivals.” [{HuffPost}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/mark-begich-senate-_n_5689807.html?1408454009”>]

HuffPollster’s Alaska Senate chart gives Sullivan a nearly 10-point lead over his rivals, with 36.6 percent to Treadwell’s 27 percent and Miller’s 17.6 percent. John Jaramillo, an Air Force veteran, stands at 2 percent. [{HuffPollster}<hyperlink=“http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-alaska-senate-republican-primary”>]

But primary polls have erred this year... - Harry Enten: “Keep in mind the average polling error in final 3 weeks this year in senate primaries is over 8 points. So Sullivan up 10 isn’t a done deal.” [{@ForecasterEnten}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/501753229605347328”>]

Begich leads Miller, faces bigger challenges from Treadwell, Sullivan - Polling on the three possible general election matchups, per HuffPollster’s model:
-Begich 50.8 percent, Miller 37.5 percent [{Chart}<hyperlink=“http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-alaska-senate-miller-vs-begich”>]

The USA TODAY/Suffolk University polls will gauge public opinion on important statewide issues and its impact on U.S. Senate and Governors’ races. ‘We are pleased that USA TODAY has recognized the Suffolk University Political Research Center’s accuracy and the astute analysis offered by its director, David Paleologos, by selecting Suffolk as a polling partner for the coming election cycle,’ said University President James McCarthy. ‘Our polling serves the electorate by providing perspective on the electoral climate, and the affiliation with USA TODAY provides a wonderful opportunity to disseminate the survey information to its millions of readers.’ Paleologos will provide surveys throughout the mid-term election season on a schedule to be determined by the center and USATODAY.” [{PRNewsWire}<hyperlink=“http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/usa-today-to-team-with-suffolk-university-for-mid-term-election-polling-271840581.html”>]

2012 flashback... HuffPollster, in October 2012: “With a little less than a month until the election, one pollster says the race in three battleground states is over for President Barack Obama. ‘I think in places like North Carolina, Virginia and Florida, we’ve already painted those red,’ David Paleologos, the president of Suffolk University Political Research Center told Fox host Bill O’Reilly on Tuesday. ‘We’re not polling any of those states again. We’re focusing on the remaining states.’...In an email to The Huffington Post, Paleologos said it was an issue of prioritization. ‘With just 5 statewide polls left in 3 1/2 weeks, the choice of which states to poll is always shifting,’ he wrote. ‘As of last night, there were at least five other states that we felt we must poll, many of which have higher head-to-head numbers (49 percent) for Barack Obama and which are more critical to deciding the national election.’” After the election, Business Insider asked him about the prediction, writing that “he didn’t intend for the proclamation to come across as so audacious. In choosing not to enter the field and poll the states, he said he was simply following a rule to which many pollsters subscribe: the incumbent rule.” [{HuffPost}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/10/suffolk-poll_n_1956115.html”>, {Business Insider}<hyperlink=“http://www.businessinsider.com/suffolk-poll-obama-romney-virginia-florida-north-carolina-election-2012-11”>]

Calling Out Racism on the Airwaves,Sharon J. Lettman-Hicks,08/15/14,10/27/16,"Politics isn’t always pretty. In fact, it can get downright nasty. When you work on issues that directly affect people’s lives, it’s easy for passion to overcome politeness. That said, there are some lines you just don’t cross.

Recently, on Tallahassee radio station WFLA, Florida Family Policy Council president John Stemberger crossed one of the most basic lines we have: racism. In an interview about the recent court rulings overturning our state’s ban on same-sex marriage, he said:

Marriage is a unique institution that does many, many things that are productive, so you want to encourage marriage. In the inner city right now we see what happens when marriage is gone. You have almost a barbarian society. It’s a very simple society. When marriage is gone, bad things happen in society.

Listen to the interview as posted by Equality Florida:

As a 25-year Floridian, a mother and a black woman, his comments hit home. When Mr. Stemberger says “the inner city,” he isn’t talking about a neighborhood in Tallahassee or Miami, or in even in his own city of Orlando. He’s talking about communities of color. “Marriage is gone” can only mean the “barbarians” he was referring to include all the single mothers and their children in those communities. The “inner city” euphemism has been around so long that it hardly needs to be explained, but it demands to be acknowledged.

There is simply no excuse for such a racist statement. This is true of anyone, but especially coming from a public figure like John Stemberger. He isn’t a grassroots activist shouting epithets at a rally; he’s the face of a political organization. He’s a lawyer, a lobbyist and a political leader — all professions that depend on the power of the spoken word. He knew exactly what he was saying, which makes it that much more offensive coming from someone who regularly talks about the importance of “traditional values” and “civil society.”

Well, Mr. Stemberger, my values and my understanding of a civil society mean supporting all families, not just those that meet your narrow definition of “traditional.” My values also include the expectation of an apology for an insult. Last week you called millions of Floridians, among them thousands of single mothers and their children, both “simple” and “barbarians.” It was racist and reckless. Systemic racism like this, and the oppressive/biased attitudes that people like you hold, perpetuate the cycle of poverty, the prison pipeline and sometimes — as we see in this week’s awful news from Ferguson, Missouri — brutal violence.

Your comments reveal an ugly attitude that, if ignored, reinforces a culture of racism that, we see today, leads to horrific consequences. I cannot let that stand. For all families living in all communities — in the inner city or anywhere else — we will not accept racism in words or in action.

We’re waiting on your public apology.",NA,192,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff157,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-w-waters/michael-brown-shooting_b_5669693.html,Black Life Is Expendable,Michael W. Waters,08/12/14,10/27/16,"Another day, another unarmed black man killed by police. We grieve their loss and pray God’s strength for their families:

Eric Garner, 43, strangled to death on a Staten Island sidewalk.

John Crawford, 22, shot to death in a Beavercreek Walmart.

Michael Brown, 18, shot to death, reportedly with arms raised, on a Ferguson street.

How often must we drink from this bitter well?

The disturbing nature of the frequency of recent news reports in which unarmed Black men have been killed by law enforcement officers is only exceeded by this fact: the act itself is deeply embedded into the racial fabric of our nation. Fifty years removed from the Freedom Summer murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner — a conspiracy allegedly enacted by Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey — we still face the difficult reality that for generations unarmed Black men have met their demise at the hands of those sworn to serve and to protect all citizens.

On the night of June 21, 1964, a year after the brutal assassination of Medgar Evers, three courageous young men were also killed in Mississippi. The two white men, Goodman, 20, and Schwerner, 24, died of a single gunshot wound to the heart. The lone Black man, Chaney, 21, was tortured, then tied to a tree and beaten with chains, before ultimately being shot three times. Here, even amid brutalities, a clear distinction was made concerning the value of Black life, the white lives ended immediately, with diabolic mercy, the Black life made to suffer greatly before finally being terminated. In the search for these three men after their disappearance, eight more Black bodies were found having been discarded like rubbish across Mississippi lakes, forests, and plains. Undoubtedly, law enforcement had a hand in these deaths as well, Sheriff Rainey notorious for intimidating and killing Blacks.

Mine is not an indictment of all police officers. There are many men and women who put their lives on the line for the public good each day. Some I have been blessed to call mentor or friend. Many officers themselves have lost their lives. I honor their memories and ultimate sacrifice even as I offer gratitude for those who continue to work with great integrity to keep us safe.

Yet, unquestionably, there is cause for great concern as I believe that a critical mass of law enforcement officers find Black lives expendable. Towards this, I see this likely cause: there is a racially-motivated culture of fear that over-assigns threat to Blacks, especially, but not exclusively, to Black males, even when no justifiable threat is present. Recent findings from the American Psychological Association supports this fact stating, “Black boys as young as 10 may not be viewed in the same light of childhood innocence as their white peers, but are instead more likely to be mistaken as older, be perceived as guilty and face police violence if accused of a crime.”

Historically, Black bodies have been considered expendable and easily replaceable. Tens of millions of Africans were brought to this nation as slaves because Black life was considered expendable. If an African became gravely ill or died while in forced voyage to the “New World,” they were just thrown into the sea. While Black life was considered expendable, and the supply of other Africans on the continent was considered inexhaustible. Other Black bodies would substitute for any losses in future voyages.

During American slavery, Black babies and children were used as bait to lure alligators from the swamps for capture. This sometimes resulted in the maiming or death of these Black children because Black life was considered expendable. The United States Public Health Service used Black men to {test the impact of untreated syphilis}<hyperlink=“http://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm”> from 1932-1972 resulting in the death of many Black men and in the infection of their partners because Black life was considered expendable.

Environmental racism places the urban poor near landfills and factories that cause increased rates of cancer and other diseases because Black, and even poor lives, are considered expendable. Levies in New Orleans were poorly maintained and constructed near poor Black communities resulting in massive flooding after Hurricane Katrina because Black lives are considered expendable. Blacks receive harsher penalties for the same crimes, and, according to {a recent Stanford University report}<hyperlink=“http://www.vox.com/2014/8/7/5978551/study-racism-criminal-justice-stop-and-frisk-reform-support”>, the disproportionate rate of Black imprisonment may actually encourage white support of racially-driven tactics such as stop-and-frisk because Black lives are considered expendable.

The expendability of Black life also extends to our national foreign policy. America’s response to acts of genocide, religious persecution, and the spread of infectious disease on the continent of Africa today is oft times delayed, if acted upon at all. When it comes to foreign policy, African Black lives are especially considered expendable, their difficulties rarely considered our priority.

Of course, Black life is not expendable! No life is, for all life has great value. Yet, the treatment of Black life as expendable reveals our deep and abiding malfeasance. We often fail to see the face of God in the face of our neighbor, especially if that neighbor is darkly pigmented. Since all human life was created in the image of God, we are guilty of no less than the desecration of God’s image when we ignore the brutalization of our neighbors, who we are commanded to love as ourselves (Mark 12:31).

It was while traveling the road to Damascus that Saul had an encounter with the resurrected Christ, himself a victim of fatal brutalities at the hands of law enforcement. To Saul, Jesus posed this powerful inquiry; “Why are you persecuting me?” (Acts 9:4)

For the recently fallen, Jesus surely weeps and asks his question, anew; “Why are you persecuting me?” Maybe it is because we see Christ as we increasingly see each other, and Black life; as expendable.",NA,670,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff158,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/neal-wooten/yo-soy-blanco_b_5673393.html,Yo Soy Blanco,Neal Wooten,08/13/14,10/28/16,"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri aggrandizes the question of police actions against minorities. I still remember the Rodney King case. It seems these events will continue to show their ugly heads.

But beyond these horrible headline grabbing scenarios of white-versus-everyone-else situations, I often wonder what it is really like living day-to-day for people in the country who are not white. Recent events have made me realize that the land of the free and the home of the brave offer nothing in the way of comfort or acceptance. We only said you could send us your poor huddled masses; we never said we would make them feel at home.

As Richard Pryor said, “I went to Zimbabwe. I know how white people feel in America now — relaxed.

My wife was born in Chicago but her family came from Mexico. Spanish is still their preferred language amongst themselves and in fact all that her mother speaks. And after nine years of marriage, I still only know one line of Spanish. It’s the only line of Spanish her family jokes that I will ever need to know — “YO soy blanco.”

It means, “I am white.”

That is accurate. I am very white. In fact, if you ever see me in the sunshine, you might need sunglasses to keep the reflection from hurting your eyes. And I have never felt anything but relaxed in this country.

A few nights ago, however, at a Goodwill thrift store, where my wife and I frequent, a Latino couple approached my wife I assume because she looked like she could speak Spanish. They carried an inflatable mattress with them, a very nice one with the built-in pump, but were worried about it all being there. The box was taped up tight.

As my wife translated so I could understand what was going on, I asked them to hand me the box so I could do what they were afraid to do — open it. It was all there and looked brand new, so they thanked us and went to the registers. I knew then something was wrong. How can different people living in the same country have such opposite emotions when it comes to something as common as opening a box at Goodwill?

Two months earlier, at that same Goodwill location, we purchased a wingback recliner and I pulled around to pick it up while my wife continued to shop. Two young boys about 18-years-old, both Caucasian, carried it out for me, loaded it for me, and then brought me a handful of twine to tie my hatch down since the chair didn’t quite fit.

I pulled into a parking spot to wait for my wife, and what I saw next amazed me. A Latino man pulled up to pick up his order, a king-size mattress. The same two boys carried it out for him, but as he motioned for them to put it on top of his SUV, they both dropped it on the ground behind his vehicle and disappeared back into the store. I waited for them to return but they never did.

The man loaded this huge pillow-top mattress himself, with much effort, and pulled into a parking space. When my wife came out, I had her walk over with me to see if he needed assistance. He had two small children in the truck and was on the phone trying to find anyone who could bring him some rope. There was no way he could drive like that.

I told him to wait and I walked into the loading area of the Goodwill and asked for some twine. They gave it to me with no questions asked, so I walked back out and helped him tie down the mattress so he could actually drive home.

But it begs a few questions. Why did they not help him like they helped me? Why did they volunteer twine for me, but didn’t even mention it to him? Why did I feel comfortable walking in and asking for twine but he did not?

When I was in college, I worked at a convenience store, and one of the regulars was a professor of the university, a very distinguished black man. Every day he bought the same item — a snack-size bottle of orange juice. And every day he asked me to put it into a bag because he felt uncomfortable walking out of the store without one.

This is another huge difference. No matter what I purchase, if I can somehow manage to balance it all in my arms, I never use a bag. But again, I don’t expect to be questioned or suspected of anything. I guess we still have a long way to go toward equality in this country. Maybe we’ll get there one day.

Here’s one last example. While in Chicago visiting my wife’s family, one of my brother-in-laws had purchased a new thermostat for their mom, but couldn’t get it to work. He asked me to ride with him to Home Depot to pick out another. When I asked if he was going to return this one, he said he could not because he threw away the original packaging. He still had the receipt, however, so I told him I would take care of it. He laughed.

As we entered the Home Depot, I told him to go pick put another one and I would get his money back. I approached the young Latina at the Customer Service counter, a very pretty young girl about 20-years-old. I handed her the thermostat and receipt, and she promptly informed me that she couldn’t accept it without the box it came in.

“Miss,” I said in my true Southern accent, “if you were to pull up my account, you’ll see that we just purchased over $4000 worth of hardwood flooring. I can’t believe that makes me such a bad customer that I can’t return a $60 item.”

She simply smiled, opened the register, and handed me the cash. I walked back and found my brother-in-law looking at more thermostats. His eyes widened in disbelief as I handed him the money. “What did you say to her?” he asked.

But it may be too late to reverse a decade of bad policy and bad thinking.

Because too many American cops already think of citizens as “The Enemy.” And its not just black citizens. All citizens. Skin color doesn’t matter.

A sea change took place over the last decade that was invisible to most Americans. Across the country, in big cities and small towns, police forces gradually turned into armies. It took the events in Ferguson to blow things wide open. Only now are Senators like Claire McKaskill reckoning with the results of a misguided policy: “The whole country and every representative and senator have seen the visuals, and at some level, it made all of us uncomfortable.” Note her shocking understatement and the typical D.C. focus on “optics.”

The technical term for the change is “militarization,” but it sounds too clinical for what’s been going on. Even before 9/11, the Pentagon was lavishing cops in every state with military equipment, but that’s escalated since 2006 as the Pentagon has unloaded {surplus}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/15/us/surplus-military-equipment-map.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=b-lede-package-region&region=lede-package&WT.nav=lede-package&_r=0”> assault rifles; armored vehicles; planes and helicopters. The total dollar amount has now reached into the billions since that terror attack has made everyone think they’re the next target, now matter how improbable it might seem.

Even tiny towns want armored personnel carriers. And they use them. For things like serving warrants and drug raids. That’s right. For ordinary police work that used to done without military hardware.

45,000 SWAT team raids take place in this country every year. The U.S. is now a {war zone}<hyperlink=“https://www.aclu.org/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing”> and our police have morphed into soldiers. They raid at night for maximum shock and awe, break down doors, use flashbang grenades, shoot people’s dogs, wreck homes, and commit violence on innocent citizens. They often raid {the wrong house}<hyperlink=“http://www.policestateusa.com/2014/handley-family-raid/”> because their information is out of date. Sometimes they even kill {unarmed citizens}<hyperlink=“http://www.copblock.org/1591/swat-murders-68-year-old-grandfather/”>. And they haven’t really been accountable to anyone, despite the string of news stories that have been appearing on local TV stations and in local and national newspapers for years.

I started reading about these epidemic SWAT raids about five years ago and how police forces were recruiting ex-military and radically shifting their consciousness and their perceived mission. Forget serving the public. The public is the enemy, at least potentially, and the enemy has to be crushed. As more ex-soldiers have entered the police force and more cops have been trained by the military, the danger has increased to the general public everywhere.

Nothing’s going to change any time soon despite reviews. As the New York Times reports, GOP Representative Peter T. King, who’s on the Intelligence and Homeland Security committees, doesn’t think the money and equipment should stop flowing to local police forces. Despite the facts, despite the statistics, he insists that there’s no evidence “that giving the police heavy weaponry and equipment [has] led to abuses elsewhere.”

But you know this is a searing problem when organizations as different as the {ACLU}<hyperlink=“https://www.aclu.org/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing”> and {The Heritage Foundation}<hyperlink=“http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/overmilitarization-why-law-enforcement-needs-to-scale-down-its-use-of-military-hardware-and-tactics”> agree that America’s police are out of control.

Because nowadays, none of us are really innocent in the eyes of the law. We’re all criminals, no matter who we are or where we live.

HuffPost,huff160,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/earl-ofari-hutchinson/police-deadly-force-michael-brown_b_5666871.html,Why It’s Nearly Impossible to Nail Cops for Deadly Force,Earl Ofari Hutchinson,08/12/14,10/28/16,"18 year-old Mike Brown is the latest name to add to the again growing list of victims of brazen overuse of deadly force by cops. Brown was allegedly gunned down by a Ferguson, Missouri police officer with his hands raised after a stop. He fit the usual pattern of those killed. In almost all cases, the victims are unarmed, were not charged with having committed a crime, their killings occur in broad daylight, and there are witnesses. The other part of the deeply disturbing familiar pattern is that they are young African-Americans or Hispanics. The officers that commit these deadly acts are placed on paid administrative leave and police officials, when confronted with the pro forma outcry and demands from civil rights and community leaders for an investigation, make solemn promises to do that. They assure that their investigations will be thorough and impartial.

That’s the start of the problem. The police agencies that are on the hot seat for a dubious shooting or another act that results in the death of a civilian investigate themselves. There is almost never an independent, outside agency that will conduct a truly impartial investigation. The one agency that can do that is the Justice Department.

Despite this wave of highly questionable police shootings of mostly young blacks and Latinos the Justice Department has done almost nothing to nail shoot-first cops. Periodic {reports}<hyperlink=“http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/reports98/police/uspo14.htm”> on police misconduct by Human Rights Watch, an international public watchdog group, found that federal prosecutors bring excessive force charges against police officers in less than one percent of the cases investigated by the FBI involving allegations of police abuse. The group also found that there has been almost no increase in the skimpy number of police misconduct cases prosecuted by the Justice Department in the past decade.

Even in the rare cases where cops are hauled into a court docket for overuse of deadly force, it’s near impossible to convict. Their defense lawyers are top guns, with lots of experience defending police officers accused of misconduct. Police unions bankroll their defense and spare no expense. Cops rarely serve any pre-trial jail time, and are released on ridiculously low bail.

If the cops are tried by a jury, police defense attorneys seek to get as many middle class people, whites and even blacks and Latinos, on the jury as possible. The presumption is that they are much more likely to believe the testimony of police and prosecution witnesses than black witnesses, defendants, or even the victims.

It’s an uphill battle for prosecutors to overcome both pro-police attitudes and negative racial stereotypes. Stanford University researchers {recently found}<hyperlink=“http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/august/prison-black-laws-080614.html”> that even when many whites are presented with evidence that the criminal justice system is loaded with racial bias toward blacks they are more likely to support tough, draconian laws such as three strikes, tough sentencing and increased incarceration. The galling conclusion of the researchers was that informing many whites that African-Americans are significantly over-represented in the prison population “may actually bolster support for the very policies that perpetuate the inequality.”

The negative perceptions of blacks, especially black males, by much of the public are not the only problem in effecting effective legal measures against police violence. There is no ironclad standard of what is or isn’t an acceptable use of force in police misconduct cases. It often comes down to a judgment call by the officer. In the Rodney King beating case in 1992 in which four LAPD officers stood trial, defense attorneys painted King as the aggressor and claimed that the level of force used against him was justified. This pattern has been evident in a number of celebrated cases since then. Police claim that they feared for their lives in confronting civilians and they use deadly force solely in self-defense. If brought to trial judges and juries routinely buy this line and acquit.

The code of silence is another powerful obstacle to convicting bad cops. Officers hide behind it and refuse to testify against other officers, or tailor their testimony to put the officer’s action in the best possible light.

Prosecutors often are barred from using statements made during internal investigations of officer misconduct in court proceedings on grounds of self-incrimination. This knocks out another potentially crucial prosecution weapon. Federal prosecutors who re-tried the officers that beat King learned a vital lesson from the abysmal failure of local prosecutors to convict them. They did not rely exclusively on the videotape evidence but on expert testimony on the use of force. That proved that the officers went way over the top against King. Despite the massive time, resources, and care devoted to that case, two of the four officers were still acquitted.

If past history is any guide, the investigations into the killing of Brown and Eric Garner by chokehold by a New York City police officer after months of time passing will go down in the books as justified or within police policy. This again will prove the point that when it comes to nailing cops for deadly force it’s nearly impossible.",NA,740,NA,NA

I wonder if we can create a high throughput economy that provides opportunity for everyone without destroying the planet.

I recognize that my Ivy League graduate students and my daughters may not be typical of all young people, but what strikes me about the world of work that stands before them is how difficult it is to understand and navigate. Naturally, I compare the world in which they are making their way to the world I grew up in, but those worlds are so far removed in time and place that I am not sure the comparison is of much value.

I did not know what a resume was until I graduated from college. Today I know twelve year olds with resumes. I suppose if I had drafted a resume when I was 16 it wouldn’t have looked all that bad. I worked every summer in high school and college (always for one tolerant relative or another). I worked for a bicycle company, a recording studio, and a locksmith. I was very active in student government and the anti-Vietnam War and pro-civil rights movements. I took a course for college credit at the New School — granted, it was a seminar titled “Civil Disobedience.” I sat at tables near the Kings Highway subway station in Brooklyn selling campaign buttons for a bunch of political causes. I was a busy kid, but I never thought of connecting any of this activity to a career. Today’s young people need to calculate every move and work hard to build a record of accomplishment that might help them stand out in the competition for a good job. I never thought about the job market as a competition, just a place I would end up in when I completed school.

While privileged children prepare, make plans and struggle to make their way in a changing world, these kids are the fortunate ones. We must also recognize the utter hopelessness, frustration and even anger of young people raised in poverty, often by single parents. With family structures disintegrating, these young people often do not have the love and support of an extended family to help them. Mentorship is hard to come by, and in the competition for employment with wealthier young people, they find themselves left in the dust.

It is remarkable that in the face of these difficulties we do not see more pessimism and social dysfunction than we do. The frustration we have seen in Ferguson, Missouri in recent days is news because its expression is so unusual. Young people may be deluding themselves, but they remain optimistic about the future. In fact, in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession, a 2012 Pew Research Center study entitled “{Young, Underemployed and Optimistic}<hyperlink=“http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2012/02/young-underemployed-and-optimistic.pdf”>“ noted that:

Despite the Great Recession and the sluggish recovery that followed, young adults remain extremely confident about their financial future. While a large majority of those ages 18 to 34 (whether they are employed or not) say they do not currently have enough money to lead the kind of life they want, most believe they will eventually attain that goal. According to the new Pew Research survey, only 31% of all young adults say they now have enough income to lead the kind of life they want. However, an additional 57% say that while they don’t have enough money now, they think they will in the future. Only one-in-ten (9%) say they don’t have enough now to lead the kind of life they want and don’t believe they ever will.

There is of course something almost classically American about this one-in-ten number. This remains an optimistic culture. Young people today plan for the future in order to influence outcomes they have confidence they can influence. Their belief in a better future remains intact. Americans who are victims refuse to see themselves that way.

As reported by Ms. Kantor, companies seeking to keep labor costs under precise control use advanced software to schedule their employees without concern for the employee’s home life, commute or parenting responsibilities. Ms. Navarro’s remarkable can-do approach to meeting her challenges included no complaint about the system of work she operated within. {As Kantor reported}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/starbucks-workers-scheduling-hours.html”>, “she had a way of flicking away setbacks — such as a missed bus on her three-hour commute — with the phrase, “I’m over it.” Almost as remarkable was the nearly immediate response to the Times story by Starbucks Executive Chris Barrows. {According to Ms. Kantor}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/starbucks-to-revise-work-scheduling-policies.html”>, the next day Mr. Barrows:

...specified that all work hours must be posted at least one week in advance, a policy that has been only loosely followed in the past. Baristas with more than an hour’s commute will be given the option to transfer to more convenient locations, he wrote, adding that scheduling software will be revised to allow more input from managers.

Class warfare has always been a tough sell in this country because everyone thinks they, or their children, will eventually “make it big.” You don’t want to soak the rich if you think that someday you might be the one getting soaked. My generation didn’t bother to plan, but rather simply assumed on faith that when we were ready to get serious and grow up, there’d be a way to do that. We expressed our optimism by assuming things would work out; today’s young people express their optimism by developing and implementing strategies for getting ahead.

As events in Missouri have recently highlighted, young African Americans face additional challenges as they view the world they will come of age within. Nevertheless, a 2011 study by the {Children’s Defense Fund}<hyperlink=“http://www.childrensdefense.org/programs-campaigns/black-community-crusade-for-children-II/bccc-assets/the-state-of-black-children.pdf”> found that:

Black children and young people are generally more optimistic than their adult counterparts when assessing their current circumstances. Two-thirds of Black young people characterize these as very good or okay times for Black children, compared with one-third who characterize them as tough or really bad times.

Like the Pew study, the Children’s Defense Fund study found that young African Americans were optimistic about the future:

Youthful optimism shows when adults and young people are asked to think 15 to 20 years into the future. Black young people are significantly more likely to think that their lives as adults will be easier than those of adults today, with 63% thinking that things will be easier compared with just 34% who think that things will be harder. This optimistic view is held among both boys and girls and older and younger Black children. In contrast, Black adults are much more likely to think things will be more difficult for young people when they reach adulthood, with a majority (54%) thinking things will be harder and just 30% thinking things will be easier compared with the lives of adults today.

None of us is capable of predicting the future, but the optimism of young people is even more impressive to me when we think of the uncertainties of the world to come. These include:

The sustainability challenges of climate change and ecological damage from economic development;
The changing nature of work and the impact of technology on work, families, communities, people and the planet;
The unpredictable impact of a world economy, global media and culture;
Increased sectarianism and tribalism in seeming response to the force of the global mega culture and the seductiveness of modern lifestyles; and,
The ever-increasing technology of destruction, particularly when coupled with evil and terrorism.

The nature of work is changing and the opportunity structure is a moving target that is difficult to understand and advance within. Change can be scary, but seems inevitable. I am comforted by the successful transition of my home city, New York, from industrial era disintegration to today’s post-industrial world capital. It was not a smooth transition, but it worked. I am reassured by the optimism of young people as measured by pollsters. I am impressed by the attitude and ability I see in my students and in everyday heroines like Jannette Navarro and superb reporters like Jodi Kantor. The transition to a sustainable economy will require an optimistic human spirit, ingenuity and creativity. The path and skills needed to get there are still being defined, but perhaps out of this uncertainty our children will find their place in the world and build a world that has places for them to find.",NA,22,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff162,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/media-diversity_n_5675974.html,Something New Is Happening In Cable News,"Ryan Grim, Amanda Terkel",08/14/14,10/28/16,"WASHINGTON — Channel surfers who stopped on MSNBC on July 11 in the 6 p.m. hour would have stumbled on something new in the world of cable news. At first glance, it would have seemed like nothing out of the ordinary: a host and a panel talking about the tragic, much-covered death of an infant left in a car. But after a moment of thought, the difference would have become clear.

Network and cable news have long been a bastion of whitedom, with white hosts and commentators. As the industry began to diversify, black guests were typically brought in to discuss topics traditionally associated with the African-American community: police brutality, voting rights, gun violence and President Barack Obama’s appeal to minority voters. It would be similar to bringing on white guests to discuss only golf, polo or the latest in boat shoe fashion.

But in the July segment, every person on camera — the host and the two guests — was African-American. That such a phenomenon is new, of course, is itself a broad indictment. But on MSNBC and occasionally CNN, black hosts and black guests have been discussing news that is targeted not just at the black community, but at all viewers. It’s finally a recognition that African-Americans are just as interested in and qualified to discuss celebrity gossip, Federal Reserve policy, immigration issues or babies locked in overheated cars as anyone else is. It’s an acknowledgement, at last, that black people are, to put it simply, people.

HuffPost, after anecdotally observing the shift, asked Media Matters, which monitors print and television news for conservative bias and other trends, to track CNN, Fox News and MSNBC over a two-week period, from June 29 to July 12.

Fox News had no all-black segments. That left MSNBC and CNN.

MSNBC had the advantage since it has more shows where an all-African-American segment is possible, with regular hosts Melissa Harris-Perry, Tamron Hall, Al Sharpton and Joy Reid as well as fill-in hosts Michael Eric Dyson, T.J. Holmes, Kristen Welker, Jonathan Capehart and Craig Melvin. The network had 46 segments in that period that featured an African-American host talking exclusively to African-American guests.

CNN had 14 such segments, with hosts Victor Blackwell, Don Lemon, Rene Marsh, Michaela Pereira and Fredricka Whitfield.

Yet, the majority of topics with all-black panels are still on issues that are traditionally tied to the African-American community: gun violence in Chicago, police brutality, the Essence Music Festival, voter ID laws and diversity in entertainment media, as a few examples.

MSNBC had 27 segments on such topics out of the 46 segments it had with all-black panels. CNN, however, did only four of its 14 on similar topics, with the remainder having a broader focus.

These are also topics that don’t get as much coverage when there are white hosts and white guests. It can be a distinct advantage at times like this week, with the nation following the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the subsequent protests, as well as the shooting death in Los Angeles of Ezell Ford earlier this week, both of which followed the chokehold death of Eric Garner. All three were unarmed black men killed by police.

During the two weeks tracked by Media Matters, MSNBC frequently covered the story of the African-American woman beaten on film by a white California Highway Patrol officer.

The study is the first of its kind to go beyond a simple aggregate count of diversity in the media and look at segments as a whole.

The group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting recently looked at {the guests on the top primetime shows}<hyperlink=“http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/who-gets-to-speak-on-cable-news/”> on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC over a five-week period.

A {2013 survey by Media Matters}<hyperlink=“http://mediamatters.org/research/2013/05/13/report-diversity-on-evening-cable-news-in-13-ch/194012”> had similar findings, showing that women accounted for less than 33 percent of the guests on each of the three networks.",110,800,NA,NA

Lowery is a reporter who has been actively covering the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, on the front lines, as opposed to waiting to hear what Chevron thinks about them and then typing it up, for Chevron.

YA CAN’T MAKE IT UP - Wesley Lowrey, 23-year-old Congress/politics reporter for the WashPost, responding on CNN to suggestions that he should have obeyed police amid a riot: “[L]et me be clear about this: I have LITTLE PATIENCE for talking heads.”

Here are a few things that Mike Allen has had two days to get right, but probably struggled with, given the fact that he and Chevron were probably doing some over-the-shirt stuff for the past forty-eight hours.

1. Wesley Lowery’s last name is spelled L-O-W-E-R-Y. Like Camper Van Beethoven’s David Lowery. Or “flowery” with the “f, for failure” removed. It is not spelled L-O-W-R-E-Y, like New York Magazine’s Annie Lowrey. You can just check Wesley Lowery’s Twitter account, where his name is spelled correctly. Or anywhere else his name is mentioned.

2. Wesley Lowery is 24 years old. Not 23. More on this in a moment.

3. Wesley Lowery was not “amid a riot” at the time he was arrested. He was “amid” a McDonald’s. For some, McDonald’s is a “riot of flavor,” or a “riot of savings,” or a “riot of coming gastrointestinal distress.” But there was no other “riot” occurring. Lowery was charging his phone at a McDonald’s. There wasn’t a riot inside the McDonald’s nor was there one outside it. This is not in dispute. Had there been a nearby riot, Lowery would have said, “Hey, I’d better go cover this riot, for the Washington Post.”

4. Wesley Lowery did not fail to “obey” the police. Neither did our own Ryan Reilly (spelled R-E-I-L-L-Y), who was also arrested, for that matter. {As Post Executive Editor Marty Baron notes}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/statement-from-martin-d-baron-on-the-arrest-of-wesley-lowery/2014/08/13/a8dd6e66-235f-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html”>, Lowery was “illegally instructed to stop taking video of officers.” As that instruction was illegal, Lowery didn’t follow it. He did, however, comply with the police’s instructions to vacate the McDonalds. He was given “contradictory instructions on how to exit,” Baron said, and while attempting to make sense of said instructions, he “was slammed against a soda machine and then handcuffed.”

So those are four things Mike Allen got 100 percent wrong. YA CAN’T GET IT RIGHT, apparently.

Why make note of Lowery’s age? This is a thing that Mike Allen likes to do to good reporters when he’s got no real factual claim to back up the notion that they have truly demonstrated they are incompetent and inexperienced. The implication is that had Lowery been older, he would have known better and ... sucked up to the police officers? Been a more terrible journalist? Many journalists mature into even more-seasoned questioners of authority. Not Mike Allen, though. Chevron thanks him.

{This is the same thing Allen did to then-Boston Globe reporter Donovan Slack back in 2011}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/07/mike-allen-cheap-shots_n_999911.html”> — he criticized her work under a heading that read, “MEMO TO YOUNG REPORTERS.” At the time, Slack had worked for the Globe for eight years, during which time she’d received three promotions. {Politico would actually go on to hire Slack}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/30/donovan-slack-politico-mike-allen_n_1120650.html”>. I have fun imagining the meeting between her and Allen. Most of the words that I imagine were exchanged are hilarious, but, alas, unprintable.

Slack and Lowery basically committed the same sin, in Allen’s eyes, which was questioning entrenched power. Slack put a quote from a watchdog agency in the lede of a story that went on to demonstrate that the watchdog agency was correct. Lowery questioned the police’s justification for rousting him from a McDonald’s. These are big no-no’s in Allen’s world, because if you do that enough, you won’t have sponsors {to underwrite your tip-sheet}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/11/20/politicos-mike-allen-native-advertising-pioneer/”> of {yesterday’s stories}<hyperlink=“http://wonkette.com/414964/explosive-article-about-political-websitepaper-to-rock-internets-foundations”>.",38,430,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff164,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-howard/what-i-wish-i-knew-when-i_b_5686693.html,What I Wish I Knew When I Was a Freshman,Charles Howard,08/19/14,10/28/16,"Eighteen years have passed since I was eighteen. Pausing to reflect on this milestone, I wondered what I would say to the younger me if given the opportunity. I share these thoughts with the hope that they will resonate with current freshmen and the eighteen year old freshmen inside many of us.

I would, of course, remind the 18-year-old me to actually go to class (even the 9:00 a.m. ones), to spend less time staying up late playing cards (Spades) with friends and more time doing my homework, to call home more often, to actually do laundry more than once a month, and to stay away from the punch at parties. But the one, less obvious, piece of advice I would offer to the younger, less bald and more in-shape version of me would be: Don’t let your insecurities or your ego keep you from being your best self.

Recently, I traveled to a conference and heard bestselling author and scholar {Karen Armstrong}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-armstrong/”> say to those gathered that “Spiritual and Religious Sages have long known that our egos very often keep us from being our best selves.” Along with ego, I might add “insecurity,” as it was these two twin chains that held me, and I imagine many other students, back.

Starting college is an insecure moment in one’s life. We literally leave the security of home where we know we are loved. We leave the familiar space that was high school. Our friendships there were firmly established with years or trust-building adventures and misadventures. Our social status was built via the teams, clubs, and friendship circles we belonged to. We journeyed day by day with teachers who knew us by name.

In going to college we leave all of that for an insecure place where we are not known. I left a high school, where just months before I was captain of my varsity track team, to become a young freshman on the college team at the very bottom of the depth chart. I remember staring at the older triple jumpers who were jumping several feet beyond my best and realizing that these guys were grown men — some of whom had full beards. I was still a teenager with a thin pirate-like mustache.

I came from a place where I was student council president of my high school only to find out that there were 800 other kids who were high school student council presidents in my freshman class.

After just one semester I would go from being a strong academic student with an “A-“ average in high school to getting my first “D.”

And on top of moving away from friends and family, I moved away from the unwavering support of trusted advisers and mentors. I went from having my high school principal tell me that he believed in me to my college adviser telling me that “as another Black kid from Baltimore, I’d probably fail out too.” Thanks buddy.

The insecurity of freshman year can mess with you. It can make you question whether or not you can make it. The fear-filled voices can begin to get into your head. I remember locking my door and moving between yelling and crying in my dorm room as I heard the echoing comments that different people made.

“You only got in because you are Black. 
They only accepted you because you’re an athlete. 
You took my spot there! 
You’ll probably fail out too.”

If I could talk to my younger self, I would simply hug him. I would tell him that he is going to be just fine. That he should not and should never listen to the voices that cause fear and self-doubt.

I wish I had known then that a lot of us, in fact nearly every freshman, feels that insecurity in some way or another — wondering whether they will succeed, whether people will like them, whether they can do the work. The most successful students walk through those fears knowing that they will take their losses: they might ride the bench for a year or two, they might lose a couple of elections before they win one, they might not have straight “A’s” in college; but they also know that seasons change and the chilly autumn air eventually turns into a fruit bearing spring. No one is a freshman forever.

Looking back, I know that this was true for me. I made new friends — and kept the old ones even over distance and time. I never did become the Olympic triple jumper or pro basketball player that I thought I’d be, but I’ve had other unimagined triumphs over the years. My GPA was never close to the “A-“ it was in high school. Good thing my future employers, wife or kids never asked to see my grades. It was indeed hard for me to leave home, but my dorm and new friends became a home away from home for me with love and unwavering support that never replaced the love of family, but was enough to get me through.

But it’s not just insecurity that hinders us, it is also our egos. I was stubborn and very proud. My ego kept me from getting a tutor when I needed one. It kept me from visiting the counseling center during some particularly low moments. All because I wanted to keep up the appearance of having it all together. How pitiful and how ironically stupid. Ego and the fear of letting people see the real us not only keeps us from being vulnerable, they keep us from being our true selves.

Our egos keep us in majors that we don’t want to be in as opposed to studying that which tugs at our heart and passions. It diverts us into careers that will make others proud of us or jobs that will allow us to attain a certain type of lifestyle rather than allowing us to follow true callings. We appease the needs of our egos and our unhealed insecurities by transient titles and accomplishments.

Popular notions of the word “ego” have changed over time to be almost exclusively related to conceit and an inflated image of self-worth. At one point ego simply was our sense of personal identity or how we view and define our self. I prefer that definition. It’s much simpler and unpolluted by insecurity. This is what I would try to communicate to my younger self — that I should work to be myself.

Over the years I have learned that wrestling with ego and insecurity are life long endeavors and not simply the work of college freshman. Armstrong was right in that our religious and spiritual traditions have long taught this notion of laying down ourselves — and our fears — daily. By doing so we allow our best self to breathe, to thrive, to serve, to love and be loved. That is my prayer for all of those who will be starting college in the upcoming weeks and for all us in whatever season of life we are in — be you.

The first version of this article ended with the last paragraph. But the events of the last several days in Ferguson, Missouri made this feel incomplete. There is something else that I would tell my eighteen-year-old freshman self. I’d tell him that he will survive. But there will be many others who look like him who will not. I’d tell him that he will soon learn the names of other young brothers like Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell, Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. They did not survive. But he would. And the burden/blessing that he will carry with him the rest of his life is that he would survive not for his own sake, but for the sake of future Amadous, Seans, Oscars, Trayvons, and Michaels. This is the last piece of advice I’d give my younger self and all freshmen — that they must have a vision that extends beyond themselves. When one is in school just to get a job or just to get rich or just to have fun, school can get old. It can seem hollow and pointless. But when one has a vision and senses a calling to make this world better in whatever way they feel specifically called, freshmen year and all of college is seen as an important part of the journey to a future vocation of service.

This too is one of those lessons that transcends freshmen year. If we can get beyond ourselves, our egos, our insecurities, and our self prioritization so that we can see the bigger picture — each day, each challenge, and each relationship can shine as not something to simply survive, but rather as an opportunity to serve, to love, and to bring about freedom. Here’s to a great school year. Here’s to a better world.",NA,283,NA,NA

In a world where police brutality, racial profiling and excessive force is normalized, this event is sadly unremarkable. It is unique though, because, among all police-civilian interactions that ended badly, this one was caught on tape. Eyewitness videos show Eric Garner arguing with police, who grab him, bring him the ground and choke him as he protests “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe.” Even then, the story may not have crossed the threshold between everyday tragedy and uncommon outrage if it weren’t for the press conference held by leaders of two NY Police Unions earlier this week. The video is rare chance to witness the candid hypocrisy of the law enforcement establishment. A masterful 30 minute act of deflection and delusion. Yet another atrocity caught on tape.

Rewriting the story of Garner’s Death

Throughout the press conference, police union presidents Pat Lynch and Edward Mullins show that this was not merely an isolated incident, it is the inevitable outcome of a deeply entrenched mindset within law enforcement that cannot begin to understand the people it is charged with protecting. Lynch and Mullins are the leaders of the largest Police labor unions in New York City and in the country. They both influence and reflect the views of the police force. It is as though they are on the wrong end of a two-way mirror, utterly unable to see the people on the other side.

In the wake of Garner’s death, New York City law enforcement has had the heat turned back on itself in a chorus of public outcry. The thick irony of their discomfort in being subjected to the same scrutiny that they apply to others is first amusing, then infuriating. This is the police force that has all but codified radial profiling, that chronically invokes excessive force and that provokes and intimidates to conjure up infractions that aren’t otherwise happening. It’s like they are saying “how dare you stereotype us while we stereotype you!” Throughout the video, Lynch and Mullins are completely deadpan, oblivious of their contradictions.

There is a widespread lack of respect for law enforcement. Lynch blames the lack of respect on “the slanderous, insulting” portrayal of police officers, with no awareness of where the disrespect comes from. If a man rapes a woman, and then you call him a rapist, he may be insulted, but that doesn’t make you wrong. The police have a right to their feelings but a man is dead, and we need to prevent further unnecessary loss of life whether doing so insults a few cops or not. Respect is not unconditional, there are standards. The police are insulted, he’s dead.

Garner had 30 previous arrests before his death. Mullins mentions this statistic as evidence of Garner’s insidious criminality. But how many of those arrests were actually merited? If a police officer was ticketed or arrested every time he ran a red light or exceeded the speed limit unnecessarily or illegally parked while on a coffee run, or, god forbid, used excessive force, it’s not hard to imagine that they would have 30 infractions too. In this system, arrests do not necessarily correlate with criminality.

If the so-called “broken window” policing strategy worked, Garner’s numerous prior arrests should have affected some positive change. He should have somehow ceased to be a “menace” to society. Were the streets safer because of his 30 arrests? Are residents safer now that he is dead? I don’t see how.

Regardless of his record, Garner was arrested that day for the crime of illegally selling untaxed (aka “loose”) cigarettes, a minor non-violent crime. Inconveniently for the police, Garner had no cigarettes on him at the time. Inconveniently for the police, the entire interaction was recorded, so they were unable to claim that Garner reached for an officer’s gun, or otherwise provoked lethal action. Conveniently for the police, they are shielded by a powerful system that will doggedly protect them whether on not they’re right.

Throughout the video, Lynch adamantly argues against the use of the word “chokehold” in describing the physical force that the arresting officer used on Garner. Call it what you like, the fact that Garner died as a result of the physical force is the main point, not the semantics of how it is described: “chokehold” or “neck crushing?”; “enhanced interrogation” or “torture?”; “making love” or “sex?”; tom-AY-to tom-AH-to, it tastes the same either way.

Law enforcement does not see death via excessive force as murder, they are utterly dissociated from the reality of the situation. A major clue is in the impersonal passive language from the press conference as Lynch and Mullins navigate the uncomfortable topic at hand: “unfortunately...Mr. Garner died that day...” and “....the loss of life.” Later, Mullins quibbles over the disproportionate public outcry between Garner’s death and a situation of a doctor “failing to save someone.” Equating those two scenarios is a particularly dexterous mental leap. Trying but failing to prevent death is utterly incomparable to taking positive action to make it happen. It is why people do not get as angry when someone is hit by lightning as when someone is gunned down in the street.

If the NYPD had it their way, they would put Officer Pantaleo on paid leave and wait out the negative media attention (they wouldn’t have to wait long for the next horror, as Ferguson shows). Mullins complains about calls for “federal investigations [and] outside people to come in....” But what’s so bad about that? If the police’s claims are true and there was no wrongdoing, then an unbiased external investigation should exonerate Pantaleo. Law enforcement’s unwillingness to accept 3rd party review is a reminder that they value muscle over truth.

If you’re feeling cynical, you might get a couple of good laughs out of this video. You might even replay the part where Lynch’s heavy accent becomes so strong that he seems to say “New York shitty police.” But overall the press conference is one long assault on logic and humanity, and it’s even more depressing when it is taken in the context of a much bigger, deeply flawed system.

Above the Law

Much of the tension between civilians and the NYPD comes from aggressive policing practices that encourage police officers to issue consistently high volumes of citations regardless of need. New York state law prohibits the use of quotas for the issuing of tickets but, with the help of further semantic wordsmithing, it has become a regular practice under the term “goals.” The quotas have yet another nickname- “250s” -as in, 250 citations per officer per month, for every officer, in every month. The arrests are not merit-based, but market based and the demand for write-ups is insatiably high.

The NYPD is happy to take credit for the significant improvement in safety and quality of life in the past few decades. If indeed New York City is safer, then there should be fewer arrests, not more. According to a CBS News report,”The NYPD has made almost 400,000 arrests in the past year, which is up from 268,000 arrests in 1995, when there were three times as many murders in the city.” A combination of greater safety and greater demand for the issuing of tickets has a natural progression. First, police target violent criminals, then they crack down on trivial offenders, then whoever happens to be walking by at the right moment. That is how we arrive at a situation where a man like Garner has 30 arrests and is placed under arrest for potentially selling illegal cigarettes.

There are plenty of conscientious police officers who know that racial profiling, quotas and aggravated arrest are wrong. But they are powerless to act against it for fear that they will lose their job and compromise their future. The NYPD is one big fraternity where the hazing never ends. Each time an officer rises in the ranks, they face an ever-more elusive position that they must work for. There is no rear-view to the system that they left behind. There is never change, there is only up and the only way to go up is to toe the line.

It doesn’t have to be so hard for police to do what is right. According to a video published by The Nation in 2012, “the NYPD is one of New York City’s only agencies to operate without independent oversight.” There is proposed legislation to create an independent Inspector General’s office but it has not passed. When an institution is unchecked, and especially when its underlying purpose is a positive service to others, there is a risk of corruption. Those in control fear that exposing even minor ills will detract from the larger good. And so the cancer grows, unchecked.

This phenomenon is not at all limited to the NYPD. New York’s Riker’s Island has been overrun with an epidemic of severe prisoner abuse and psychological mistreatment. Penn State’s reputable football program was put at risk by a rogue coach who sexually abused children. The entire institution of Catholicism was also undermined by child sexual abuse. These institutions could act quickly to resolve their problem, but they often chose to ignore, or even perpetuate it by actively covering it up. In this way, the “bad eggs” are scrambled in with the good until the unpleasant exception becomes the rule.

Football coaches, clergymen and yes, policemen, often deserve our respect. But we reserve the right to revoke it if the person or the institution’s actions are less than unrespectable. Imagine the absurdity of seeing a politician saying “I’ve gotten to this position for a reason, so just trust me and don’t criticize me.” Being exposed to public scrutiny is part of the job of being a public servant, and the more power a person gets, the more we deserve to qualify our respect with actual standards.

There is little incentive for those in power to change a system because, even if it is flawed, they have already figure out how to make it work for them. In the same way that successful politicians lack motivation to enact campaign finance reform, NYPD leadership has no strong reason to change the status quo.

If the NYPD wants the respect of the citizens it is charged with protecting, it must earn it. They can start by acknowledging the possibility of wrongdoing and providing good-faith support to investigations. They can eliminate the illegal practice of quotas. They can work to stamp out racial profiling. They can accept or even demand a system of checks and balances that will bring oversight to the police force. Efforts like these will help restore the respect for the uniform and will help us build a system where law enforcement protects, rather than victimizes its people.

At one point in his diatribe, Union President Mullins attempts to justify arrest for the selling of loose cigarettes. He says “...this is not a victimless crime. There is a victim.” I couldn’t agree more. New examples of police brutality, excessive force and racial profiling crop up before we can respond to the last one. The victims are the people across the New York City and the country who, like Garner, can’t breathe.

Are you thinking “that’s horrible but what can I do about it?”

Luke O’Donovan, 21, will reportedly spend the next two years in a Georgia prison, followed by eight years of probation, after agreeing to a plea deal on Aug. 11, Vice is reporting.

O’Donovan, who is identified in media reports as a “{queer anarchist}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/article/prison-and-exile-for-luke-odonovan-a-price-of-fighting-back-against-gay-bashers”>,” was charged with attempted murder and five counts of felony aggravated assault in a 2012 incident. O’Donovan had reportedly been attacked by at least five men, who shouted anti-gay epithets at him after seeing him dance with several men at a New Year’s Eve party.

As The Sparrow Project noted, {O’Donovan defended himself with a pocket knife}<hyperlink=“http://www.sparrowmedia.net/2014/08/luke-odonovan-sentenced-to-10-years/”> and fled the scene, and was arrested by Atlanta police hours later.

Eyewitnesses cited by media at the time of the attack offered few details.

“Things were kind of starting winding down,” witness Lily Chambers told Georgia Newsday. “{I mean, it was a late New Year’s party}<hyperlink=“http://www.georgianewsday.com/news/147528-suspect-luke-o-donovan-accused-of-multiple-stabbings-to-be-in-court.html”>.

Added witness Cheryl Watt: “Someone got stabbed. It was just a blur.”

A group of O’Donovan’s family members, friends and supporters have called his case “{the epitome of a hate crime}<hyperlink=“http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/08/14/us-atlanta-man-receives-10-years-in-prison-for-defending-himself-in-anti-gay-attack/”>.”

{The Luke O’Donovan Support Committee}<hyperlink=“http://letlukego.wordpress.com/”> added that “the demonization” of O’Donovan’s actions represented “a growing trend: criminalizing those who successfully defend themselves from hate crimes.”

Meanwhile, {O’Donovan himself has released a statement}<hyperlink=“http://letlukego.wordpress.com/”> through the committee, noting:

It is regrettable that anyone had to come to harm, but given the choice of whether to lose my life to a hateful attack or fight for the chance to live, I will always choose the ferocious refusal to go quietly into the night.

It is this passion for life that came in conflict with my attackers, and this same passion that was arrested by the cops and is being punished by the courts. It is this passion that they are trying to chain, to cage, to rehabilitate me away from, but it is this passion that will pull my gaze — always forward — through the dark.

{Cross-posted with TomDispatch.com}<hyperlink=“http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175881/”>

Jason Westcott was afraid.

One night last fall, he discovered via Facebook that a friend of a friend was planning with some co-conspirators to break in to his home. They were intent on stealing Wescott’s handgun and a couple of TV sets. According to the Facebook message, the suspect was planning on “burning” Westcott, who promptly called the Tampa Bay police and reported the plot.

According to the {Tampa Bay Times}<hyperlink=“http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/informer-not-neighbor-complaints-led-up-to-fatal-tampa-pot-raid/2187316”>, the investigating officers responding to Westcott’s call had a simple message for him: “If anyone breaks into this house, grab your gun and shoot to kill.”

Around 7:30 p.m. on May 27, the intruders arrived. Westcott followed the officers’ advice, grabbed his gun to defend his home, and died pointing it at the intruders.  They used a semiautomatic shotgun and handgun to shoot down the 29-year-old motorcycle mechanic.  He was hit three times, once in the arm and twice in his side, and pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital.

The intruders, however, weren’t small-time crooks looking to make a small score. Rather they were members of the Tampa Bay Police Department’s SWAT team, which was executing a search warrant on suspicion that Westcott and his partner were marijuana dealers. They had been tipped off by a confidential informant, whom they drove to Westcott’s home four times between February and May to purchase small amounts of marijuana, at $20-$60 a pop. The informer notified police that he saw two handguns in the home, which was why the Tampa Bay police deployed a SWAT team to execute the search warrant.

In the end, the same police department that told Westcott to protect his home with defensive force killed him when he did. After searching his small rental, the cops indeed found weed, two dollars’ worth, and one legal handgun — the one he was clutching when the bullets ripped into him.

Welcome to a new era of American policing, where cops increasingly see themselves as soldiers occupying enemy territory, often with the help of Uncle Sam’s armory, and where even nonviolent crimes are met with overwhelming force and brutality.

The War on Your Doorstep

The cancer of militarized policing has long been metastasizing in the body politic.  It has been growing ever stronger since the first Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams were born in the 1960s in response to that decade’s turbulent mix of riots, disturbances, and senseless violence like Charles Whitman’s infamous clock-tower {rampage}<hyperlink=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman”> in Austin, Texas.

While SWAT isn’t the only indicator that the militarization of American policing is increasing, it is the most recognizable. The proliferation of SWAT teams across the country and their paramilitary tactics have spread a violent form of policing designed for the extraordinary but in these years made ordinary. When the concept of SWAT arose out of the {Philadelphia}<hyperlink=“http://blog.phillypolice.com/2012/05/phillypolice-unit-profile-special-weapons-and-tactics-swat/”> and {Los Angeles Police Departments}<hyperlink=“http://books.google.com/books?id=vTkTTIF1IpUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rise+of+the+Warrior+Cop&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_KbGU6OKC-rnsAT60ID4CQ&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=D-Platoon&f=false”>, it was quickly picked up by big city police officials nationwide.  Initially, however, it was an elite force reserved for uniquely dangerous incidents, such as active shooters, hostage situations, or large-scale disturbances.

Nearly a half-century later, that’s no longer true.

In 1984, according to Radley Balko’s {Rise of the Warrior Cop}<hyperlink=“http://www.amazon.com/dp/1610394577/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20”>, about 26% of towns with populations between 25,000 and 50,000 had SWAT teams. By 2005, that number had soared to 80% and it’s still rising, though SWAT statistics are notoriously hard to come by.

As the number of SWAT teams has grown nationwide, so have the raids. Every year now, there are approximately {50,000 SWAT raids}<hyperlink=“http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21599349-americas-police-have-become-too-militarised-cops-or-soldiers”> in the United States, according to Professor Pete Kraska of Eastern Kentucky University’s School of Justice Studies. In other words, roughly 137 times a day a SWAT team assaults a home and plunges its inhabitants and the surrounding community into terror.

Upping the Racial Profiling Ante

In a recently released report, “{War Comes Home}<hyperlink=“https://www.aclu.org/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing”>,” the American Civil Liberties Union (my employer) discovered that nearly 80% of all SWAT raids it reviewed between 2011 and 2012 were deployed to execute a search warrant.

Pause here a moment and consider that these violent home invasions are routinely used against people who are only suspected of a crime. Up-armored paramilitary teams now regularly bash down doors in search of evidence of a possible crime. In other words, police departments increasingly choose a tactic that often results in injury and property damage as its first option, not the one of last resort. In more than 60% of the raids the ACLU investigated, SWAT members rammed down doors in search of possible drugs, not to save a hostage, respond to a barricade situation, or neutralize an active shooter.

On the other side of that broken-down door, more often than not, are blacks and Latinos. When the ACLU could identify the race of the person or people whose home was being broken into, 68% of the SWAT raids against minorities were for the purpose of executing a warrant in search of drugs. When it came to whites, that figure dropped to 38%, despite the well-known fact that blacks, whites, and Latinos all use drugs at {roughly the same rates}<hyperlink=“http://www.samhsa.gov/data/nsduh/2012summnatfinddettables/nationalfindings/nsduhresults2012.htm#ch2.7”>. SWAT teams, it seems, have a disturbing record of disproportionately applying their specialized skill set within communities of color.

Think of this as racial profiling on steroids in which the humiliation of stop and frisk is raised to a terrifying new level.

Everyday Militarization

Don’t think, however, that the military mentality and equipment associated with SWAT operations are confined to those elite units. Increasingly, they’re permeating all forms of policing.

As Karl Bickel, a senior policy analyst with the Justice Department’s Community Policing Services office, {observes}<hyperlink=“http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/06-2013/preparing_officers_for_a_community_oriented_department.asp”>, police across America are being trained in a way that emphasizes force and aggression. He {notes}<hyperlink=“http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/06-2013/preparing_officers_for_a_community_oriented_department.asp”> that recruit training favors a stress-based regimen that’s modeled on military boot camp rather than on the more relaxed academic setting a minority of police departments still employ. The result, he suggests, is young officers who believe policing is about kicking ass rather than working with the community to make neighborhoods safer. Or as comedian Bill Maher {reminded}<hyperlink=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVywCqvmC0E”> officers recently: “The words on your car, ‘protect and serve,’ refer to us, not you.”

This authoritarian streak runs counter to the core philosophy that supposedly dominates twenty-first-century American thinking: {community policing}<hyperlink=“http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/12-2013/will_the_growing_militarization_of_our_police_doom_community_policing.asp”>.  Its emphasis is on a mission of “keeping the peace” by creating and maintaining partnerships of trust with and in the communities served. Under the {community model}<hyperlink=“https://ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/114213.pdf”>, which happens to be the {official policing philosophy}<hyperlink=“http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/may_2008/policing_Ds.htm”> of the U.S. government, officers are protectors but also problem solvers who are supposed to care, first and foremost, about how their communities see them. They don’t command respect, the theory goes: they earn it. Fear isn’t supposed to be their currency. Trust is.

Nevertheless, police recruiting videos, as in those from California’s {Newport Beach Police Department}<hyperlink=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_rKA6ROAVk”> and New Mexico’s {Hobbs Police Department}<hyperlink=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im66lCgZrbc”>, actively play up not the community angle but militarization as a way of attracting young men with the promise of Army-style adventure and high-tech toys. Policing, according to recruiting videos like these, isn’t about calmly solving problems; it’s about you and your boys breaking down doors in the middle of the night.

SWAT’s influence reaches well beyond that.  Take the {increasing adoption}<hyperlink=“http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/11-2012/bdus-community-policing.asp”> of battle-dress uniforms (BDUs) for patrol officers. These militaristic, often black, jumpsuits, Bickel fears, make them less approachable and possibly also more aggressive in their interactions with the citizens they’re supposed to protect.

A small project at Johns Hopkins University seemed to bear this out. People were shown pictures of police officers in their traditional uniforms and in BDUs. Respondents, the survey indicated, would much rather have a police officer show up in traditional dress blues. Summarizing its findings, Bickel {writes}<hyperlink=“http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/11-2012/bdus-community-policing.asp”>, “The more militaristic look of the BDUs, much like what is seen in news stories of our military in war zones, gives rise to the notion of our police being an occupying force in some inner city neighborhoods, instead of trusted community protectors.”

Where Do They Get Those Wonderful Toys?

“I wonder if I can get in trouble for doing this,” the young man says to his buddy in the passenger seat as they film the Saginaw County Sheriff Office’s new toy: a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle. As they film the MRAP from behind, their {amateur video}<hyperlink=“http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=8d5_1394417559”> has a {Red Dawn}<hyperlink=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_I4WgBfETc”>-esque feel, as if an occupying military were now patrolling this Michigan county’s streets. “This is getting ready for f**king crazy times, dude,” one young man comments. “Why,” his friend replies, “has our city gotten that f**king bad?”

In fact, nothing happening in Saginaw County warranted the deployment of an armored vehicle capable of withstanding bullets and the sort of improvised explosive devices that insurgent forces have regularly planted along roads in America’s recent war zones.  Sheriff William Federspiel, however, fears the worst. “As sheriff of the county, I have to put ourselves in the best position to protect our citizens and protect our property,” he {told}<hyperlink=“http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2014/04/prepared_for_disaster_mine-res.html”> a reporter. “I have to prepare for something disastrous.”

Lucky for Federspiel, his exercise in paranoid disaster preparedness didn’t cost his office a penny. That {$425,000 MRAP}<hyperlink=“http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2014/04/prepared_for_disaster_mine-res.html”> came as a gift, courtesy of Uncle Sam, from one of our far-flung counterinsurgency wars. The nasty little secret of policing’s militarization is that taxpayers are subsidizing it through programs overseen by the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Justice Department. 

Take the 1033 program. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) may be an obscure agency within the Department of Defense, but through the 1033 program, which it oversees, it’s one of the core enablers of American policing’s excessive militarization. Beginning in 1990, Congress {authorized}<hyperlink=“http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/1033ProgramFAQs.aspx”> the Pentagon to transfer its surplus property free of charge to federal, state, and local police departments to wage the war on drugs. In 1997, Congress {expanded the purpose}<hyperlink=“http://www.nps.gov/legal/laws/104th/104-201.pdf”> of the program to include counterterrorism in section 1033 of the defense authorization bill. In one single page of a 450-page law, Congress helped sow the seeds of today’s warrior cops.

The amount of military hardware transferred through the program has grown astronomically over the years. In 1990, the Pentagon gave $1 million worth of equipment to U.S. law enforcement. That number had jumped to nearly $450 million in 2013. Overall, the program has shipped off more than $4.3 billion worth of materiel to state and local cops, {according to the DLA}<hyperlink=“http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/default.aspx”>.

In its recent report, the ACLU found a disturbing range of military gear being transferred to civilian police departments nationwide. Police in North Little Rock, Arkansas, for instance, received 34 automatic and semi-automatic rifles, two robots that can be armed, military helmets, and a Mamba tactical vehicle. Police in Gwinnet County, Georgia, received 57 semi-automatic rifles, mostly M-16s and M-14s. The Utah Highway Patrol, according to a Salt Lake City Tribune {investigation}<hyperlink=“http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/57358599-78/police-program-utah-1033.html.csp”>, got an MRAP from the 1033 program, and Utah police received 1,230 rifles and four grenade launchers. After South Carolina’s Columbia Police Department received its very own MRAP worth $658,000, its SWAT Commander Captain E.M. Marsh {noted}<hyperlink=“http://www.wltx.com/news/article/255485/2/Columbia-Police-Debut-New-Armored-Vehicle”> that 500 similar vehicles had been distributed to law enforcement organizations across the country.

Astoundingly, one-third of all war materiel parceled out to state, local, and tribal police agencies is brand new. This raises further disconcerting questions: Is the Pentagon simply wasteful when it purchases military weapons and equipment with taxpayer dollars? Or could this be another downstream, subsidized market for defense contractors? Whatever the answer, the Pentagon is actively distributing weaponry and equipment made for U.S. counterinsurgency campaigns abroad to police who patrol American streets and this is considered sound policy in Washington. The message seems striking enough: what might be necessary for Kabul might also be necessary for DeKalb County.

In other words, the twenty-first-century war on terror has melded thoroughly with the twentieth-century war on drugs, and the result couldn’t be anymore disturbing: police forces that increasingly look and act like occupying armies.

How the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice Are Up-Armoring the Police

When police departments look to muscle up their arms and tactics, the Pentagon isn’t the only game in town. Civilian agencies are in on it, too.

During a {2011 investigation}<hyperlink=“http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/12/20/local-cops-ready-for-war-with-homeland-security-funded-military-weapons.html”>, reporters Andrew Becker and G.W. Schulz discovered that, since 9/11, police departments watching over some of the safest places in America have used $34 billion in grant funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to militarize in the name of counterterrorism.

In Fargo, North Dakota, for example, the city and its surrounding county went on an $8 million spending spree with federal money, according to Becker and Schulz. Although the area averaged less than two murders a year since 2005, every squad car is now armed with an assault rifle. Police also have access to Kevlar helmets that can stop heavy firepower as well as an armored truck worth approximately $250,000. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1,500 beat cops have been trained to use AR-15 assault rifles with homeland security grant funding.

As with the 1033 program, neither DHS nor state and local governments account for how the equipment, including body armor and drones, is used. While the rationale behind stocking up on these military-grade supplies is invariably the possibility of a terrorist attack, school shooting, or some other horrific event, the gear is normally used to conduct paramilitary drug raids, as Balko notes.

Still, the most startling source of police militarization is the Department of Justice, the very agency officially dedicated to spreading the community policing model through its Community Oriented Policing Services office.

In 1988, Congress {authorized}<hyperlink=“http://www.ncpc.org/cms-upload/ncpc/File/Byrne%20JAG%20history.pdf”> the Byrne grant programs in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which gave state and local police federal funds to enlist in the government’s drug war. That grant program, according to Balko, led to the creation of regional and multi-jurisdictional narcotics task forces, which gorged themselves on federal money and, with little federal, state, or local oversight, spent it beefing up their weapons and tactics. In 2011, 585 of these task forces {operated}<hyperlink=“http://www.ncja.org/sites/default/files/documents/Taskforce-Performance-Measures.pdf”> off of Byrne grant funding.

The grants, Balko reports, also incentivized the type of policing that has made the war on drugs such a destructive force in American society. The Justice Department doled out Byrne grants based on how many arrests officers made, how much property they seized, and how many warrants they served. The very things these narcotics task forces did very well. “As a result,” Balko writes, “we have roving squads of drug cops, loaded with SWAT gear, who get money if they conduct more raids, make more arrests, and seize more property, and they are virtually immune to accountability if they get out of line.”

Regardless of whether this militarization has occurred due to federal incentives or executive decision-making in police departments or both, police across the nation are up-armoring with little or no public debate. In fact, when the ACLU requested SWAT records from 255 law enforcement agencies as part of its investigation, 114 denied them. The justifications for such denials varied, but included arguments that the documents contained “trade secrets” or that the cost of complying with the request would be prohibitive. Communities have a right to know how the police do their jobs, but more often than not, police departments think otherwise.

Being the Police Means Never Having to Say You’re Sorry

Report by report, evidence is mounting that America’s militarized police are a threat to public safety. But in a country where the cops increasingly look upon themselves as soldiers doing battle day in, day out, there’s no need for public accountability or even an apology when things go grievously wrong.

If community policing rests on mutual trust between the police and the people, militarized policing operates on the assumption of “officer safety” at all costs and contempt for anyone who sees things differently. The result is an “us versus them” mentality.

Just ask the parents of Bou Bou Phonesavanh. Around 3 a.m. on May 28, the Habersham County Special Response Team conducted a no-knock raid at a relative’s home near Cornelia, Georgia, where the family was staying. The officers were looking for the homeowner’s son, whom they suspected of selling $50 worth of drugs to a confidential informant.  As it happened, he no longer lived there.

Despite evidence that children were present — a minivan in the driveway, children’s toys littering the yard, and a Pack ‘n Play next to the door — a SWAT officer tossed {a “flashbang” grenade}<hyperlink=“http://www.salon.com/2014/06/24/a_swat_team_blew_a_hole_in_my_2_year_old_son/”> into the home. It landed in 19-month-old Bou Bou’s crib and exploded, critically wounding the toddler. When his distraught mother tried to reach him, officers screamed at her to sit down and shut up, telling her that her child was fine and had just lost a tooth. In fact, his nose was hanging off his face, his body had been severely burned, and he had a hole in his chest. Rushed to the hospital, Bou Bou had to be put into a medically induced coma.

The police claimed that it was all a mistake and that there had been no evidence children were present. “There was no malicious act performed,” Habersham County Sheriff Joey Terrell {told}<hyperlink=“http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/toddler-critically-injured-by-flash-bang-during-po/nf9XM/”> the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “It was a terrible accident that was never supposed to happen.” The Phonesavanhs have yet to receive an apology from the sheriff’s office. “Nothing.

Similarly, Tampa Bay Police Chief Jane Castor continues to insist that Jay Westcott’s death in the militarized raid on his house was his own fault.  “Mr. Westcott lost his life because he aimed a loaded firearm at police officers. You can take the entire marijuana issue out of the picture,” Castor {said}<hyperlink=“http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/informer-not-neighbor-complaints-led-up-to-fatal-tampa-pot-raid/2187316”>. “If there’s an indication that there is armed trafficking going on — someone selling narcotics while they are armed or have the ability to use a firearm — then the tactical response team will do the initial entry.”

In her defense of the SWAT raid, Castor simply dismissed any responsibility for Westcott’s death. “They did everything they could to serve this warrant in a safe manner,” she {wrote}<hyperlink=“http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/tampa-police-chief-times-article-left-out-key-facts/2189054”> the Tampa Bay Times — “everything,” that is, but find an alternative to storming the home of a man they knew feared for his life. 

Almost half of all American households report having a gun, as the ACLU {notes}<hyperlink=“https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf”> in its report. That means the police always have a ready-made excuse for using SWAT teams to execute warrants when less confrontational and less violent alternatives exist.

In other words, if police believe you’re selling drugs, beware. Suspicion is all they need to turn your world upside down. And if they’re wrong, don’t worry; the intent couldn’t have been better.

Voices in the Wilderness

The militarization of the police shouldn’t be surprising. As Hubert Williams, a former police director of Newark, New Jersey, and Patrick V. Murphy, former commissioner of the New York City Police Department, {put it}<hyperlink=“https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/121019.pdf”> nearly 25 years ago, police are “barometers of the society in which they operate.” In post-9/11 America, that means police forces imbued with the “hooah” mentality of soldiers and acting as if they are fighting an insurgency in their own backyard.

While the pace of police militarization has quickened, there has at least been some pushback from current and former police officials who see the trend for what it is: the destruction of community policing. In Spokane, Washington, Councilman Mike Fagan, a former police detective, is {pushing back}<hyperlink=“http://www.kxly.com/news/Spokane-Councilman-thinks-new-uniforms-may-help-Police-PR-crisis/9224338”> against police officers wearing BDUs, calling the get-up “intimidating” to citizens. In Utah, the legislature {passed}<hyperlink=“http://le.utah.gov/~2014/bills/static/hb0070.html”> a bill requiring probable cause before police could execute a no-knock raid. Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank has been a vocal critic of militarization, {telling}<hyperlink=“http://perspectivesonthenews.blogs.deseretnews.com/2013/07/10/militarization-of-local-police-nationwide-worries-salt-lake-city-chief-chris-burbank/”> the local paper, “We’re not the military. Nor should we look like an invading force coming in.” Just recently, Chief Charlie Beck of the Los Angeles Police Department {agreed}<hyperlink=“http://www.latimes.com/opinion/readersreact/la-le-the-police-chiefs-thoughts-on-swat-20140715-story.html”> with the ACLU and the Los Angeles Times editorial board that “the lines between municipal law enforcement and the U.S. military cannot be blurred.”

Retired Seattle police chief Norm Stamper has also become an outspoken critic of militarizing police forces, noting “most of what police are called upon to do, day in and day out, requires patience, diplomacy, and interpersonal skills.” In other words, community policing. Stamper is the chief who green-lighted a militarized response to World Trade Organization protests in his city in 1999 (“{The Battle in Seattle}<hyperlink=“http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175168/tomgram:__rebecca_solnit,_writing_history_in_the_streets/”>“). It’s a decision he would like to take back. “My support for a militaristic solution caused all hell to break loose,” he {wrote}<hyperlink=“http://www.thenation.com/article/164501/paramilitary-policing-seattle-occupy-wall-street”> in the Nation. “Rocks, bottles and newspaper racks went flying. Windows were smashed, stores were looted, fires lighted; and more gas filled the streets, with some cops clearly overreacting, escalating and prolonging the conflict.”

These former policemen and law enforcement officials understand that police officers shouldn’t be breaking down any citizen’s door at 3 a.m. armed with AR-15s and flashbang grenades in search of a small amount of drugs, while an MRAP idles in the driveway. The anti-militarists, however, are in the minority right now. And until that changes, violent paramilitary police raids will continue to break down the doors of nearly 1,000 American households a week.

The Palestinians tweeting advice referred to the response of Israeli military and police forces to protests in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, not airstrikes in Gaza. Others noted that issues of police force, accountability and race in Ferguson are part of America’s own troubled history.

The team was reportedly setting up their equipment for a report on the rising tensions when police threw tear gas and fired rubber bullets towards them. Surrounded by a cloud of tear gas, the crew abandoned their cameras and ran to safety.

All three crew members managed to get out unharmed, a spokesperson from Al Jazeera America said.

However, according to a {database}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/4/president-obama-is-promoting-his-gun-control-agend/”> by a criminal law professor and former FBI agent, police shot 1,100 people, killing 607, in 2011 alone.

Mitchell said she was driving when she saw Brown trying to pull away from an officer as the two were “tussling through a window.” She said she had hoped to get a video because the incident “just didn’t look right,” but failed to get her camera out in time.

“I didn’t know exactly what was going on, but I knew it didn’t look right for someone to be wrestling with the police through the police window, but I didn’t get a video because a shot was fired through the window, so I tried to get out of the way,” Mitchell said.

Mitchell then described what she saw happen between Brown and the police officer.

“As I pull onto the side, the kid, he finally gets away, he starts running. As he runs the police get out of his vehicle and he follows behind him, shooting,” Mitchell said. “And the kid’s body jerked as if he was hit from behind, and he turns around and puts his hands up like this, and the cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks the concrete.”

Mitchell clarified she heard a shot after she saw Brown trying to pull away from the cop, and said even after Brown turned to face the cop and put his hands in the air, “the cop continued to come up on him and shoot him until he fell down to the ground.” She said she counted “more than about five or six shots.”

Mitchell also said she only saw one officer involved in the incident, and described him as a “white male, kind of tall, not too big.”

Mitchell said she received no pressure to change her story from detectives who on the case, but said the cops that arrived at the scene “were very rude” to bystanders and “didn’t want to tell” the public what had happened.

“They showed no kind of remorse for what happened to the kid at all,” she said.

Blum,08/14/14,10/28/16,"It seemed like every few months an African American man had been murdered. It was one hundred years ago and Judge Lynch had taken the reigns from Lady Justice. He and the mobs working for him were not blind. They saw black men, women, children, and communities to terrorize. Judge Lynch didn’t carry a scale to be balanced. He gave his followers a noose to choke their victims. One hundred years ago in 1914, a reported 51 African Americans were lynched. The year after, 56.

One response then was to ask “where is Jesus Christ.” W. E. B. Du Bois, who had recently helped found the NAACP and served as the editor of its monthly magazine, The Crisis, tried to move the United States public to action. The Crisis tried to expose what was really happening throughout the United States — that African American communities were being systematically terrorized by everyday white Americans, by courts of law, by politicians, and by the police. They tried statistics. They tried muckraking. They tried every form of journalism they could.

W. E. B. Du Bois also tried faith. In response to lynchings, he wrote a series of short stories and poems that wrestled with the problem of racial violence in their midst. “Jesus Christ in Texas” was a short story set in Waco, Texas — where a lynching had recently taken place. It imagined a scenario where “a stranger” arrived in town. He looked neither white, nor black (he looked Jewish, in fact, but no one seemed to recognize those elements of his appearance). He spoke from the New Testament gospels to love one another, do unto others, and those old panaceas. Jesus met with convicts, one of whom was on the run from the police and Jesus exchanged clothing with him. A white pastor tried to determine who he was, muttering that he felt like he somehow knew this man, long ago. Ultimately, Jesus in Texas was lynched.

In poetry, Du Bois wondered where God was. In “A Litany for Atlanta,” he asked if God were asleep. Du Bois trembled: “God Surely Thou, too, are not white, O Lord, a pale, bloodless, heartless thing! / Ah! Christ of all the Pities!” Which would be worse, a dead God or a white one? Du Bois refused to believe either. He called with so many others, “Hear us, good Lord! / In night, O God of a godless land.”

Now, one hundred years later, was continue to ask, where is Jesus Christ in Ferguson, Missouri? Is God out there? As our young women and men are murdered, as our politicians seem idle, as those with guns wield bigger ones, where is the spirit of the man who tried to teach us to use right for might?

These are not new questions for American communities. African Americans have been calling for justice in this land of injustice for more than 400 years. At times, as during the Civil War and the Civil Rights movement, it seemed that God was with them. But for the vast majority of the rest of the centuries, the weight of history seems to indicate a silent and distant God. The shame of it all, perhaps, is not that God seems absent, but that those with the power and authority to do justice and to act humbly seem intent on the opposite.",NA,410,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff177,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/malek-mouzon/the-silence-of-the-black-_b_5685968.html,The Silence of the ‘Black’ White Musicians,Malek Mouzon,08/19/14,10/28/16,"I hope that by the time this article posts it no longer applies. But as of its writing, the following is a small list of musicians who have yet to make a public statement or acknowledgement of Michael Brown’s murder and the racial epicenter that is Ferguson, Missouri. In no particular order, they are: Justin Bieber, Macklemore, Iggy Azaela, Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus.

I could name plenty of other entertainers and celebrities who have remained silent. However, I chose the above five for a very specific reason; they are what I like to call “Black” White Musicians. They are entertainers who have been inspired by some facet of Black culture and whether through authentic means or appropriation have gone on to repackage it for the masses under their own guise.

What I’m speaking to both includes and goes beyond mere speech and dress. They don’t just have Black friends or participate in the Black rhetoric. But they seek to replicate it, embody it, and occasionally even elevate it. Many times this occurs without the subtlety, nuance or even confidence that’s needed.

There are a multitude of examples but here are a few of the following:

Justin Bieber: Pretty much everything post Usher, most specifically in his dress and mannerisms.
Mackemore: His Rap Grammy win, deserving in my opinion but tarnished thanks to his publishing of an apology text sent to Kendrick Lamar after he received backlash from his win.
Iggy Azaela: The “Rap” Voice. We’ve all heard her speak when she’s not rapping, I don’t need to elaborate.
Katy Perry: A fan of all types of cultural appropriation (See her 2013 AMA performance of “Unconditionally”) but most recently with her video for “This Is How We Do,” which includes twerking ice cream cones, watermelon and the above hood look.
Miley Cyrus: So many examples but I’ll just say one word... “Anaconda.”

The above musicians enjoy and in many ways reap the rewards of the best parts of Black culture and yet... are surprisingly absent when it comes to the worst. As a long time fan of many of the above musicians, Macklemore and Miley Cyrus to be specific, it’s been a difficult thing to grapple with, let alone understand.

It’s frustrating to watch white musicians be so ready to have legions of Black dancers/singers behind them, work with Black producers, sing about how “we” do and then be nowhere to be found when a Black tragedy takes the national stage. It in many ways cements the same things their art and music attempt to embody. A type of post racial illusion where minstrel images or just part of exploring your creativity and having fun. But we don’t exist in any sort of post-racial world. Racism is still very real. An unfair double standard faced by Black men and women face a very real double standard when it comes to dealing with law. And there is a complete lack of value in the Black body...except of course as a sexual tool or as a means of entertainment.

Now, I know what you’re going to say. This isn’t a just a white celebrity problem. What about the Black celebrities? Looking over to the other side of the spectrum, you would find many of them are silent as well: Rihanna, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, Kim and Kanye, Will and Jada, Oprah. There are many who are speaking (Jesse Williams, David Banner, and Tichinia Arnold to name a few) but like in real life it’s the one who are quiet who we notice the most.

And if they won’t speak, what reason do celebrities of other stripes have to state their opinions. I don’t know the real reasons why they don’t but it’s hard to argue that it’s not in some ways related to fear. Fear of backlash. Fear of having your voice dominate more thoughtful ones thanks to the story hungry media. Fear of alienating any subset of your fans who may disagree. Fear of someone dismissing the validity of your opinion, as happened last week with John Legend and some type of “news” site linking itself to the Black community.

Both the silence and vocality of some Black Celebrities over others is a different bone to pick. It’s a continual conversation but I would say is that there’s no doubt Black celebrities walk a balancing act between their massive platforms and their own identities. A balancing act even our President doesn’t always achieve. However, White Musicians like the ones I’ve discussed have the luxury of picking and choosing the ways in which they engage in Black life. “We” don’t have that luxury.

I feel like I would be lying if I didn’t admit I didn’t want to write this article. I honestly love several of these musicians. In fact, just this year I attended my first Beyoncé and Miley Cyrus concert. I’m the rare creature who had a fantastic time at both. It’s interesting that what I remember most about the concerts, was the make up of the audience. There were fans who were Black and White, Asian and Latino, Gay and Straight. Fans who experience America very differently but can still come together for someone they care about.

And that’s what made me write this in the end. I realized it’s the job of the fans, not just the critics to make these artists accountable. It’s easy to forget, their status as role models matters only so far as we hold them to that example. Only so far as we challenge them to be better. To do better. To call on them to show that their love of Black culture and Black people extends beyond the superficial into the reality of that experience.

So much good and awareness can come from standing up for something as we see most recently in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. A worthy cause that many of the above mentioned musicians have participated in. But as it stands, regarding the challenge of supporting the Black community, these artists are failing. And their silence in light of recent events resonates louder than any song they could ever make.

HuffPost,huff178,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/lapd-suggests-mentally-il_0_n_5675782.html,"LAPD Shouted ‘Shoot Him’ Before Killing Unarmed, Mentally Ill Black Man: Witness",Matt Ferner,08/13/14,10/31/16,"LOS ANGELES — An eyewitness to the killing of Ezell Ford told The Huffington Post on Wednesday that he heard an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department shout “shoot him” before three bullets were unloaded into the unarmed, 25-year-old black man, who was on the ground.

“It is unknown if the suspect has any gang affiliations,” the LAPD said in a statement after the killing.

But people in Ford’s neighborhood said the young man was not remotely involved in gang activity. Leroy Hill said he was an eyewitness to the shooting Monday night, and confirmed that he heard three shots.

“He wasn’t a gang banger at all,” Hill said. “I was sitting across the street when it happened. So as he was walking down the street, the police approached him, whatever was said I couldn’t hear it, but the cops jumped out of the car and rushed him over here into this corner. They had him in the corner and were beating him, busted him up, for what reason I don’t know he didn’t do nothing. The next thing I know I hear a ‘pow!’ while he’s on the ground. They got the knee on him. And then I hear another ‘pow!’ No hesitation. And then I hear another ‘pow!’ Three times.”

At one point while the police had Ford on the ground, but before the shooting took place, Hill said, he heard an officer yell, “Shoot him.”

Monday around 8:20 p.m., police conducted an “investigative stop” in the 200 block of West 65th Street in the Newton area of South LA, according to {an LAPD news release}<hyperlink=“http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/56791”>. “During the stop a struggle ensued, which resulted in an officer-involved-shooting,” the release says. “The suspect was transported to a local hospital and after lifesaving efforts he succumbed to his injuries.”

A woman who identified herself as the deceased man’s mother {called KTLA and identified the man as Ezell Ford}<hyperlink=“http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/”>. However, as of Wednesday afternoon, the LAPD had not confirmed the identity of the “suspect.” Tritobia Ford said her son was lying on the ground and complying with officers when he was shot three times.

The shooting comes just days after the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. {Brown was fatally shot by a police officer}<hyperlink=“http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html”> in the St. Louis suburb on Saturday. He was unarmed. Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Brown before the shooting occurred, said Brown was retreating from the officer with his hands up when he was shot, CNN reported. Ferguson police, however, say a “physical confrontation” occurred before that.

Unrest has rocked the suburb in the {days following Brown’s death}<hyperlink=“http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Reports-Ferguson-protests-turn-violent-270697451.html”>. At least four people, including two police officers, have been hurt and 47 arrested in the aftermath of the shooting, according to St. Louis’ KMOV.

On Wednesday morning in South LA, a group of about 10 young and middle-aged men gathered at a makeshift sidewalk memorial lined with candles and signs that read “Police brutality must stop.”

The men at the memorial near the sight of the shooting were visibly shaken by the events that had unfolded there Monday night. They expressed anger toward the LAPD. They said that Ford wasn’t a gang member at all — that he was a “good guy,” a local man who was born and raised in the neighborhood, one whom everyone knew and liked, who routinely played basketball and who also suffered from some form of mental illness.

While all of the men said Ford suffered from some mental illness, they couldn’t confirm what it was. One young neighbor, who requested to not be identified, said that while “he wasn’t all there, he was there enough to follow orders and know to stop when the police tell him to stop. He did nothing wrong.”

Another eyewitness {told KTLA}<hyperlink=“http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/”> that Ford’s mental state was well-known in the neighborhood and to the police.

“They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division, knows that — that this child has mental problems,” the man said in an interview with the local network. “The excessive force ... there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in the back while he’s laying down? No. Then when the mom comes, they don’t try to console her ... they pull the billy clubs out.”

The young neighbor described the incident as “racial bullshit.” All of the men at the memorial told HuffPost that police routinely patrol their neighborhood, a gesture that, they said, feels aggressive as opposed to an act of peace-keeping. During the brief 10 minutes HuffPost was at the scene, two squad cars were observed driving by the main intersection of South Broadway and West 65th Street.

A middle-aged neighbor took the allegations of aggressive police officers a step further, saying that the same officers who were involved in the incident on Monday night had come through the neighborhood the day before and harassed Ford. He also alleged that wasn’t the first time the police had “targeted” Ford and harassed him while he walked down the street.

“The day before they were messing with him and they came back the next day and made good on it,” the neighbor said.

No officers were injured during the incident, according to the LAPD. The Force Investigation Division is set to investigate.

When reached by HuffPost, the LAPD declined to comment on the allegations because there is an ongoing and active investigation. “When new information becomes available, it will be released,” Officer Bruce Borihanh told HuffPost.

UPDATE: 8 p.m. — LAPD issued a statement that describes what happened:

“When the officers got closer and attempted to stop the individual, the individual turned, grabbed one of the officers, and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, they fell to the ground and the individual attempted to remove the officer’s handgun from its holster. The partner officer then fired his handgun and the officer on the ground fired his backup weapon at the individual.
“After the officers fired their handguns at the individual, they were able to handcuff him and call for a rescue ambulance. Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics arrived and transported the individual to the hospital where he was later pronounced dead.”",500,7700,NA,NA
HuffPost,huff179,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/ferguson-protests_n_5686601.html,Ferguson Police Fire Tear Gas At Protesters Hours Before Curfew (UPDATE),"Amanda Terkel, Ryan J. Reilly",08/17/14,11/03/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Police cleared Ferguson of protesters Sunday hours before a state-imposed curfew was set to take effect, throwing tear gas at individuals who were out in the streets over the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9.

What had started out as a loud, party-like gathering — with protesters honking horns, dancing and yelling — quickly dissolved into chaos as the midnight curfew approached. Police, equipped with armored vehicles, shields and gas masks, fired tear gas down Ferguson’s West Florissant Avenue.

In a press conference early Monday morning, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is now in charge of security in Ferguson, said officers were commanded to throw tear gas after members of the crowd began throwing Molotov cocktails at the police. There were also reports of gunfire and businesses being broken into, with workers at a McDonald’s reportedly locking themselves in a back room when the vandalism started.

According to Johnson, there were seven or eight people arrested in the protests, and at least two people were injured. He deliberately distinguished between peaceful individuals who came out to rally and people committed to “premeditated criminal acts.”

Gov. Jay Nixon (D) announced early Monday morning that he had {signed an executive order}<hyperlink=“http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/18/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html”> to send National Guard troops to Ferguson.

“Given these deliberate, coordinated and intensifying violent attacks on lives and property in Ferguson, I am directing the highly capable men and women of the Missouri National Guard ... in restoring peace and order to this community,” he said in a statement.

Among those hit with tear gas Sunday was an 8-year-old boy. His mother declined to give an interview, but the crowd rallied immediately around him, attempting to get him water.

[tweetbegin 501191846920740864 tweetend]

Cassandra Roberts from Richmond Heights, Missouri, came out Sunday night because she thought it was going to be peaceful and she would be able to march in solidarity without any problem.

She said she knew there was a problem when she started seeing everyone running. She went down on her knees and raised her hands in a “don’t shoot” motion, but she quickly realized there was a bigger issue and she was being tear-gassed.

“I literally see these little things like, bop bop bop, and smoke is coming up. I got so choked up,” said Roberts. “I couldn’t even gather myself. I was so mixed up in the smoke. ... It took one of the McDonald’s employees to pull me up out of the smoke. My eyes were wide open and I couldn’t see a thing. They had to throw milk and water in my eyes. I didn’t come down here for this.”

Candice Dotson and her 11-year-old son were going back to their car when they were caught up in the beginning confrontations. She wanted to go home, she said, because the crowd was starting to get rowdy, but she never expected to be tear-gassed.

“It was horrible. There were little bitty kids in strollers. He’s okay, but he’s scared out of his mind,” she told The Huffington Post.

Thursday was supposed to be the first day of school for the Ferguson-Florissant School District, but it announced that it was canceling classes for the week due to the continuing unrest.

Although the streets were largely cleared well before it was time for curfew, residents were supposed to be off the streets of Ferguson from midnight until 5 a.m. for the second night in a row. The Huffington Post saw at least four people walking the street get handcuffed by police for being out during that time.

The first curfew, imposed by Gov. Nixon on Saturday, was broken by several protesters. One person was shot and seven were arrested during demonstrations early Sunday.

Ferguson’s police chief and mayor are white. Of the six City Council members, one is black. The local school board has six white members and one Latino. Of the 53 commissioned officers on the police force, three are black, said Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson.

He grabbed Brown and shot him. Brown and a friend ran and the officer then shot Brown in the back. Brown stopped, turned around and put his hands up, before the officer shot him an additional several times at close range, killing him.

The police account differs dramatically, though the department has provided few details other than saying that someone tried to take the officer’s gun.

HuffPost,huff181,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/huffington-post-reporter-arrested-ferguson_n_5676829.html,Huffington Post Reporter Arrested In Ferguson,NA,08/13/14,11/04/16,"The Huffington Post’s Ryan J. Reilly and the Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery were arrested Wednesday evening while covering the protests in Ferguson, Missouri after the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, who was shot by a police officer last week. The journalists were released unharmed, but their detentions highlighted the town’s ramped up police presence, which has left numerous residents injured by rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas during protests held every night after Brown’s death.

SWAT officers roughed up the reporters inside a McDonald’s, where both journalists were working. Reilly snapped a photo, prompting cops to request his identification.

“The officer in question, who I repeatedly later asked for his name, grabbed my things and shoved them into my bag,” said Reilly, who appeared on MSNBC’s “All In with Chris Hayes” shortly after his release to recount the arrest. “He used his finger to put a pressure point on my neck.”

“They essentially acted as a military force. It was incredible,” Reilly said. “The worst part was he slammed my head against the glass purposefully on the way out of McDonald’s and then sarcastically apologized for it.”

[tweetbegin 499728023500107776 tweetend]

Reilly said it will be difficult to hold the officer “accountable for his actions,” as the officer did not respond to Reilly’s repeated requests for his name or other identification. He said he can’t be “100 percent sure” whether the officer was aware that he’s a reporter, “but that really shouldn’t matter in this equation.”

Reilly believes he was arrested because he declined to present the officer his identification when asked for it, he said.

[tweetbegin 499717371540799488 tweetend]

The Huffington Post called the Ferguson Police Department to inquire about the status of Reilly shortly after tweets indicated that he had been arrested. The person who picked up the phone — who identified himself as “George” — said he couldn’t give any information at this time and that there was no one who could do so. Asked for his last name, he mumbled something quickly. When pressed for the spelling of his name, he hung up.

The Huffington Post called back and again asked for information on Reilly. We were simply put through to the “Ferguson jail” voicemail. On the third try, George again insisted he didn’t have any information at this time and referred us to the city’s website for email information. When again asked for his last name, George simply hung up.

The Los Angeles Times’ Matt Pearce spoke with the Ferguson police chief:

Amid the chaos, however, there have also been inspiring scenes of kindness and generosity. Here are some of the ways people are helping each other in Ferguson:

Roberts said she was marching in Ferguson for the first time on Sunday, to show solidarity with the protesters. After she was hit with tear gas, a member of the crowd grabbed her and helped her to the McDonald’s.

“We thought it could be a peaceful night,” Roberts told the paper. “I just came down here to support my people. What the hell is going on in this world?”

Police fired several rounds of tear gas into the crowd after a small number of protesters reportedly threw bottles at the officers. Shots were fired, and the cops ordered everyone without media credentials to disperse, then evacuated the media center as well.

“Air smells like gun powder,” {the Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery tweeted}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/WesleyLowery/status/501598539932516352”>. “Not like tear gas. Gun powder.”

Jay Nixon (D) Monday morning, was posted at the police command center so that local police could concentrate on monitoring the protest, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson told reporters.

The evening seemed to begin peacefully, with increased restrictions on where and how people could assemble. The QuikTrip, a meeting place for protesters on past nights, was closed off. Police told people that they had to keep moving or else they would be arrested, and the streets were closed off to cars early in the evening. The festive atmosphere of previous nights was replaced with solemn protests.

But tensions quickly rose after {some in the crowd reportedly threw objects at police}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/aterkel/statuses/501566384858755072”>, who formed lines and told everyone to move back. {An armored vehicle}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/iamsakuma/statuses/501566249168809984”> moved through the crowd, and several people took off running. {CNN reported}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/jasoncherkis/statuses/501573215911968768”> that white anarchists from outside of Ferguson were the ones throwing things at police.

Some protesters, led by Malik Shabazz, who is affiliated with the New Black Panther Party, tried to calm the situation and encourage people to keep walking and disperse. “We didn’t want the news tonight to be tear gas and everybody running,” he added. “The news tonight is that we’re here for justice, for the arrest of officer Darren Wilson, we’re here for Mike Brown and his family and we want an end to police brutality.”

The police moved back the line and the tension in the crowd briefly eased before tempers flared again.

As a handful of people reportedly continued to throw bottles at police and protesters defied police orders to immediately disperse, the situation again intensified. Police fired tear gas at the crowd, and one person was reported to be shot. “That was the most intense tear gas yet,” ANIMAL New York reporter {Amy K.

During a press conference early Tuesday morning, Johnson said two men were shot on Monday night. No update was available on their condition, but neither were shot by police.

Two fires were set on Monday, one at a business and one at an unoccupied residence, Johnson said. A molotov cocktail and two guns were also confiscated from a vehicle located near the police command center.

Although 31 people were arrested, many were not locals; authorities said that some of the people detained by officers came from as far away as New York and California. Johnson said good people were protesting during daylight hours, and are encouraged to do so again in the morning; however, “violent agitators” were taking advantage of a volatile situation.

“Protesters don’t clash with police,” Johnson said. “They don’t throw molotov cocktails. It is criminals that throw molotov cocktails and fire shots.”

Johnson backed the officers’ actions, saying the protesters and members of the media were repeatedly asked to return to the sidewalks during clashes. We need to have the roads cleared, he said, for the everyone’s safety.

When reporters asked why heavy vehicles and officers in full SWAT gear were facing off with protesters, Johnson said officers had come under fire during the unrest and four had sustained injuries from people throwing rocks and bottles. These units were only deployed into dangerous areas to help the wounded, he said.

Johnson also called for more peaceful protests, particularly during daylight hours. “Let’s give attention to the peaceful... Let’s not glamorize the acts of criminals,” he said.

Monday night’s clashes soured the optimism that officers and protesters alike seemed to share earlier in the evening.

Ruth Gordon, 73, was hopeful as she worked to keep up with police orders to move. “I know I’m a slow walker, but eventually I get where I want to go,” she said. “God has enabled me to do that, and that’s what I’m doing. And we gonna get justice. We gonna get justice. I don’t know how long it’s gonna take, but until they bring the policeman in that did this shooting, there ain’t gonna be no peace.”

“It’s coming,” Gordon added. “Peace is coming. I can’t tell you when, but peace is coming,” Gordon said.

HuffPost,huff184,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/john-lewis-ferguson_n_5679033.html,Rep. John Lewis On Ferguson: ‘Declare Martial Law’,Alex Lazar,08/14/14,11/02/16,"Civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) called on President Barack Obama to declare martial law in Ferguson, Missouri, where police and protesters have {clashed}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-protests-police-response_n_5677741.html”> after a police officer shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown on Saturday.

“It is very sad and unbelievable. It’s unreal to see what the police is doing there,” Lewis said in a Thursday interview with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. “First of all, Ferguson, Missouri, is part of the United States of America. People have a right to protest. They have a right to dissent. They have a right to march in an orderly, peaceful, nonviolent fashion. And the press has a right to cover it.”

Lewis, whose skull was fractured by police during the 1965 march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, told Mitchell that the situation in Ferguson reminds him of “the ‘40s, the ‘50s, the ‘60s,” pointing to the {dearth}<hyperlink=“http://abcnews.go.com/US/ferguson-police-departments-race-relations-spotlight/story?id=24962153”> of black officers on the St. Louis suburb’s police force.

“So my own feeling, right now, is that President Obama should use the authority of his office to declare martial law. Federalize the Missouri National Guard to protect people as they protest,” Lewis said. “And people should come together. Reasonable elected officials, community leaders and address what is happening there.”

He continued: “If we fail to act, the fires of frustration and discontent will continue to burn, not only in Ferguson, Missouri, but all across America.”

HuffPost,huff188,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/obama-ferguson_n_5678593.html,Obama On Ferguson: ‘No Excuse For Police To Use Excessive Force’,Jennifer Bendery,08/14/14,11/14/16,"WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama on Thursday urged calm amid violence in Ferguson, Missouri, where a militarized police force has been firing rubber bullets and spraying tear gas at residents peacefully protesting the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager shot to death Aug. 9 by a police officer.

“There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism and looting,” Obama said in brief remarks from Martha’s Vineyard, where he’s been on vacation this week. “There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.”

The president acknowledged that people around the country have been “deeply disturbed” by the images coming out of Ferguson this week as police have clashed with protesters. He urged everyone to take a step back and let local and federal authorities carry out their investigations of Brown’s death. The Justice Department and the FBI are both conducting independent investigations.

“Now is the time for healing, now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,” he said.

Obama said he spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) earlier Thursday and expressed his concerns about the violence taking place. He noted that Nixon is on his way to Ferguson.

“I’m confident that, working together, he’s going be able to communicate his desire to make sure that justice is done and his desire to make sure that public safety is maintained in an appropriate way,” he said.

Obama also commented on the Wednesday arrests of two reporters, one from The Huffington Post and one from The Washington Post.

“Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground,” he said. “We all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particular those of us in positions of authority.”

These are Obama’s first public remarks on the matter since Brown was killed on Saturday. He issued a statement earlier this week, calling Brown’s death {“heartbreaking.”}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/obama-michael-brown_n_5672956.html”>

Jay Nixon (D) has signed an order declaring a state of emergency and ordering a curfew in Ferguson, he announced in a press conference on Saturday.

The curfew will last from midnight to 5 a.m., according to Capt. Ronald Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, who also spoke at the press conference.

“What we’re doing now is not who we are,” Johnson said amid shouts from community members during the press conference.

Johnson noted there would be no trucks or tear gas used to enforce the curfew. He acknowledged that tear gas had been used against protesters early Saturday morning, but said he did not order officers to take that action.

Below, more from the AP:

FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon says he’s declared a state of emergency and is implementing a curfew in the St. Louis suburb where a black teenager was shot to death by a white police officer a week ago.

Nixon said Saturday that the state will not allow a handful of looters to endanger the community and that there must be calm if justice is to be served. The curfew will run from midnight to 5 a.m.

Tensions in Ferguson flared late Friday after police released the name of the officer who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown and documents alleging Brown robbed a store before he died.

Nixon also says the U.S. Department of Justice is beefing up its investigation of the shooting and there are dozens of FBI agents on the ground working on the investigation.

Phones constantly ring with reporters asking for interviews or family members offering support. Last week, as demands reached a tipping point, both parents moved into hotels to shield themselves.

In the days leading up to the funeral, Brown’s mother continued to cry and spoke in whispers as she tried to explain her feelings.

“They say tomorrow is going to be the hardest day, but I think today was — just seeing my baby laying there, cold,” Lesley McSpadden, 34, told USA TODAY. “It did something to my heart. It’s too much. It’s too much.”

HuffPost,huff190,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/antonio-french_n_5677157.html,St. Louis Politician Arrested Amid Ferguson Protests,Amanda Terkel,08/14/14,11/14/16,"WASHINGTON — A St. Louis official who has been a prominent presence at the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, was arrested Wednesday night, according to his wife.

Antonio French, an alderman in St. Louis, has been {tweeting nonstop}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/antoniofrench”> about {events unfolding in Ferguson}<hyperlink=“http://www.stlamerican.com/news/local_news/article_138e9e7a-233c-11e4-8151-001a4bcf887a.html”> after a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, last Saturday. Members of the city’s African-American community have protested the shooting.

French has been critical of the police response to the protests — which has included officers firing tear gas and wooden bullets at crowds — telling MSNBC host Chris Hayes recently, “There is {no trust}<hyperlink=“http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/08/13/there-is-no-trust-local-official-rips-ferguson-cops-heavy-handed-response-to-protests/”> between the Ferguson police department and the community at this point.”

Late Wednesday night, French’s wife tweeted that her husband had been arrested by the Ferguson Police Department:

[tweetbegin 499763069195931649 tweetend]

She then continued to {tweet that he was being detained}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/senka/with_replies”>.

The Huffington Post called the Ferguson County Police Department and spoke with an official named “Julie.” She would not give her last name, and said she could neither confirm nor deny that French was arrested.

When asked where confirmation could be obtained, Julie replied, “You’ll get it on the web, I guess. We’re very busy.”

About an hour later, French’s wife tweeted again that he was now being booked:

[tweetbegin 499781713263087616 tweetend]

KMOX in St. Louis noted that there was {a crowd at the police station}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/kmoxnews/status/499783093931081729”> awaiting his release as well.

News of French’s arrest came shortly after two reporters, Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post and Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post, were assaulted and arrested after SWAT officers clearing a McDonald’s ordered them to leave the restaurant and then said they did not do so quickly enough.

“They {essentially acted as a military force}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/huffington-post-reporter-arrested-ferguson_n_5676829.html”>. It was incredible,” Reilly said in an MSNBC interview after his release. “The worst part was he slammed my head against the glass purposefully on the way out of McDonald’s and then sarcastically apologized for it.”

French’s activity at the protests has {contrasted greatly}<hyperlink=“http://huff.to/1vKCCZA”> with the lack of involvement by Missouri’s state and federal leaders. As the police response to protesters intensified Wednesday, Gov. Jay Nixon (D) did not initially release a comment. After significant public outcry, he said late Wednesday he would cancel his appearance at the state fair Thursday.

“Gov. Nixon first commented publicly on the situation on Ferguson on Monday morning when he {requested the DOJ investigation}<hyperlink=“http://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/gov-nixon-asks-us-department-justice-independent-investigation-fatal-shooting-ferguson”>, has been in frequent communication since that time with local and community leaders, and {spoke to a standing room-only crowd}<hyperlink=“http://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/remarks-gov-nixon-community-meeting-civic-and-faith-leaders-north-st-louis-county”> on Tuesday night at a church in North St. Louis County,” Nixon spokesman Scott Holste told HuffPost Thursday.

The police have refused to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, saying they fear for his safety.

Clarification: This article was updated to reflect that while Nixon did not immediately respond to Wednesday’s protests, he first commented on the situation in Ferguson more broadly on Monday. It was also updated to include comment from Nixon’s spokesman.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announced Friday that six-year veteran {Darren Wilson was the officer who shot Brown}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/darren-wilson-michael-brown_n_5681340.html”> on Aug. 9 in the St. Louis suburb. He also announced the department would release reports and video footage relating to a “strong-armed robbery” that took place in the area before the shooting occurred.

{Brown, 18, was named as a suspect}<hyperlink=“http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ferguson-police-name-michael-brown”> in these reports. He allegedly took a {box of Swisher Sweet cigars worth $48.99}<hyperlink=“http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/darren-wilson-identified-killed-18-year-old-michael-brown-article-1.1904539”>.

[tweetbegin 500279689693655042 tweetend]

Later in the day, {Ferguson police released surveillance footage}<hyperlink=“http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-fergsuon-shooting-police-name-20140815-story.html#page=1”> from a convenience store where the incident took place. In the three-minute video, three men can be seen entering a store. Two of the men go to exit together when another man, supposedly an employee at the store, tries to stop them. The larger of the two men pushes the apparent employee before walking out.

{Brown’s family spoke out}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/michael-brown-family-statement_n_5682546.html”> after information relating to the robbery was released, saying they were “beyond outraged.”

Michael Brown’s family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piece mil information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.
There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.
The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.
It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.
The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.

On Friday afternoon, Jackson held a press conference stating Wilson {did not know Brown was a robbery suspect}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/tom-jackson-michael-brown_n_5682762.html?1408130704”> when he stopped him. Brown was apparently stopped because he was “walking in the street, blocking traffic.”

Ferguson police have alleged an altercation occurred between the two prior to the death. The individual with Brown said the teen was unarmed and had his hands up when he was shot. During an interview with CBS affiliate KMOV, Jackson said the {officer was “was hit”}<hyperlink=“http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Chief-Officer-in-fatal-shooting-suffered-facial-injuries-271079471.html”> and the “side of his face was swollen” after the incident.

Reilly Calls Ferguson Arrest A ‘Dehumanizing Process’,Natasha Bach,08/14/14,11/14/16,"The Huffington Post’s Ryan J. Reilly was {arrested Wednesday evening}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/huffington-post-reporter-arrested-ferguson_n_5676829.html”> in Ferguson, Missouri, while covering protests surrounding the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown. Reilly joined HuffPost Live Thursday to describe the conditions of his arrest.

Reilly explained that he was working in a nearby McDonald’s along with another reporter, the Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery, when SWAT entered the premises. Reilly was then ordered to exit.

“They were giving us a countdown like we were 5-year-olds,” he explained.

When he didn’t leave quickly enough, Reilly said, he was roughed up by an officer and subsequently arrested.

“You know you always see cops yelling, ‘stop resisting, stop resisting,’ and that’s something that happened here — but I wasn’t resisting,” Reilly said. “This is just something that these cops yelled no matter what you were doing. I let my arms go limp ... wasn’t trying to resist anything.”

“In a certain way I think I’m in a privileged position both as a reporter and, frankly, as a white male, that this is something that you don’t really expect to happen to you,” Reilly said.

“It’s just such a dehumanizing process to be eliminated from all forms of communication, and thankfully I remembered some numbers in my head, so I was able to make some phone calls,” Reilly continued.

Activists set up voter registration tables near a makeshift memorial for Brown and the QuikTrip convenience store that has become a gathering base for protesters. The efforts {were organized by local clergy}<hyperlink=“http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/jesse-jackson-talks-voter-registration-at-ferguson-mcdonald-s/article_d789a49e-4957-5ba2-ae16-e03af805f00f.html”> with the help of the Revs. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.

Missouri Republican Party executive director Matt Wills called the actions “disgusting” and {told Breitbart News}<hyperlink=“http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/08/18/Missouri-GOP-Michael-Brown-Voting-Registration-Booths-Disgusting”> the activists are “fanning the political flames.”

“Injecting race into this conversation and into this tragedy, not only is not helpful, but it doesn’t help a continued conversation of justice and peace,” Willis told Breitbart News.

Political representation in Ferguson has long been divided along racial lines, and the city has a {troubled racial history}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/us/ferguson-mo-complex-racial-history-runs-deep-most-tensions-have-to-do-police-force.html”>. Two-thirds of the residents are black, but its mayor and five of its six city council members are white. In addition, only three of Ferguson’s 53 police officers are black.

One reason the city’s government poorly reflects the demographic makeup could be low voter turnout. {Only 12.3 percent of people}<hyperlink=“http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ferguson-lack-diversity-goes-way-beyond-its-cops”> voted in this year’s municipal elections. Turnout was even lower in 2013 and 2012, with 11.7 percent and 8.9 percent voting, respectively. {On Sunday}<hyperlink=“http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/twelve-percent-turnout-insult-your-children”>, Sharpton decried the dismal turnout in an address at a local church.

“You all have got to start voting and showing up. Twelve percent turnout is an insult to your children,” he said.

Local resident Debra Reed, who set up a voter registration tent near the memorial, {told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=“http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/nixon-declares-state-of-emergency-in-ferguson-orders-curfew/article_fd8c251f-ff3e-51ed-bfcb-2be8fbe252b4.html”> they are “trying to make young people understand that this is how to change things.”

Not all Republicans are joining the state GOP director in his opposition to the voter registration efforts — some are actually denouncing Wills’ views. GOP State Sen. Ryan Silvey {tweeted}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/RyanSilvey/status/501757887166038018”> that “the ‘outrage’ over voter registration in Ferguson is dumb. I’d rather they vote than riot.”

Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by Wilson on Saturday, August 9.

In a press conference earlier on Friday, Ferguson police {released a report naming Brown}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-releasing-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown/”> as the main suspect in a convenience store robbery where a box of {Swisher Sweets cigars}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/michael-brown-stole-cigars_n_5682089.html”> valued at $48.99 was stolen and a clerk was allegedly shoved.

Video of the incident allegedly showing Brown, which was released to the public, “had nothing to do with the stop” and was “unrelated” to Wilson’s contact with Brown, Jackson said. He said video of the convenience store incident was released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests.

“The initial contact between Darren Wilson and Mike Brown was not related to the alleged theft of cigars,” Jackson said, indicating Wilson did not know Brown was a suspect in the robbery.

Jackson said Wilson was in the area “coming off a sick case,” and initiated contact with Brown because the teenager was “blocking traffic, that’s it.”

When asked about Wilson, Jackson said he is “a gentleman, a quiet officer” who found the incident “devastating.”

“He never intended for any of this to happen,” Jackson said.

After Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly and Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery were {arrested}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/huffington-post-reporter-arrested-ferguson_n_5676829.html”> at the McDonald’s where they were working Wednesday evening, Christine Conetta, a HuffPost Live producer working with Reilly, was trapped on the wrong side of a police wall, unable to get to him or the police station. Reilly had all the group’s equipment as well as the rental-car keys.

Then police began a tear gas attack and Conetta was chased deep into the surrounding neighborhood. One local resident gave Conetta a T-shirt to hold over her mouth to fend off the gas. Others tried to help her navigate her way through side streets to get across town to the police station to find Reilly. The thick cloud of tear gas made it impossible, though residents finally guided her to the memorial site where Michael Brown was slain.

Eventually, a group of people there decided to go to the police station and offered her a ride. “The community was just very welcoming in general. Nobody was asking why I was there. Everybody said they appreciated the media being there and covering the ordeal and never had any qualms about answering questions. It was a 180 from D.C.,” said Conetta.

Phones constantly ring with reporters asking for interviews or family members offering support. Last week, as demands reached a tipping point, both parents moved into hotels to shield themselves.

In the days leading up to the funeral, Brown’s mother continued to cry and spoke in whispers as she tried to explain her feelings.

“They say tomorrow is going to be the hardest day, but I think today was — just seeing my baby laying there, cold,” Lesley McSpadden, 34, told USA TODAY. “It did something to my heart. It’s too much. It’s too much.”

HuffPost,huff200,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/ferguson-arrests_n_5682679.html,Police In Ferguson Let High-Profile Journalists Go While Charging Regular Folks With Crimes,Amanda Terkel,08/15/14,11/14/16,"WASHINGTON — On Wednesday night, reporters from The Huffington Post and The Washington Post made national news when police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, {assaulted and arrested them}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/reporters-arrested-ferguson-ryan-reilly-wesley-lowery_n_5676841.html”> for not obeying orders quickly enough. Outrage, a demand for answers and calls for press freedom grew as word of what happened spread on social media. Shortly thereafter, the two men were released, in part, it seemed, due to their high-profile status.

“The chief thought he was {doing you two a favor}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html”>,” one officer told them, making clear that their privileged position played a role in why they were let go.

That same night, St. Louis Alderman {Antonio French was also arrested}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/antonio-french_n_5677157.html”>. French has been a non-stop presence at the protests, using Twitter to document the community’s response to the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed African American teenager. French’s arrest, like those of the two journalists, received a significant amount of attention. Although he had to spend the night in jail, he was eventually released {without facing any charges}<hyperlink=“http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/St-Louis-Alderman-arrested-amid-protests-in-Ferguson-271183831.html”>.

But French and the two reporters weren’t the only ones arrested Wednesday night — {at least 13 other people}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-arrests_n_5678595.html”> were picked up as well.

Unfortunately for them, they didn’t have the benefit of the media spotlight. They had to spend the night in jail, pay bail and were charged with crimes. Their problems will linger for a few weeks, while they await their court dates.

Liz Peinado works for French, and she and her coworker Meghan Flannery were waiting at the police station for their boss to be released. Both are alumni of Teach for America and had taught in the school district where Brown had just graduated high school. As on other nights, there were a few dozen people there protesting. The crowd was growing, Peinado said, and people were calling for French’s release.

Shortly after midnight, a heavily armored Humvee and dozens of officers in full gear showed up and told everyone to leave or be arrested. While most of the crowd dispersed, Peinado told The Huffington Post that she and Flannery decided to stay, sitting on the sidewalk and tweeting what was happening.

“I sat down,” she said, “legs crossed, one hand in the air holding a peace sign, one hand holding my phone on Twitter.”

They decided to leave when the police said it was their “final warning.” Peinado said they were afraid that the officers were going to spray tear gas, so they went to Flannery’s car, accompanied by two other people.

Peinado said she was already in the car and Flannery was about to get in when “at least seven armed” police officers surrounded them and told them to get out of the vehicle because they were under arrest.

“I stand at 4’11”. I’m a tiny woman,” Peinado said. “And they’re like, ‘Get out of the car.’ So I’m like, I have a choice: I can probably get manhandled and hope someone is watching this, or get manhandled and no one is ever going to know about it. So I just got out of the car.”

They got into a police van and were driven across the street to headquarters, where they spent the night in a jail cell. There were three women in the cell and only one bed. There was also no toilet paper; Peinado had to ask five times before someone provided it.

“I wish I could describe how cold it was,” said Peinado. “They refused to give us blankets because they said they didn’t have any. But it was really cold. Everyone in all of the cells was complaining about it.”

Peinado and Flannery were released the next morning on $300 bail each. They were charged with failure to comply with police orders and a noise violation.

Umar Lee, a columnist for the St. Louis Evening-Whirl, was also at the protest Wednesday night and was also arrested. He told The Huffington Post that he was charged with the same crimes as Peinado and Flannery.

Ryan Frank, a filmmaker, was there as well and {faced identical charges}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-arrests_n_5678595.html?1408133859”>. And like Peinado and Flannery, he said he was actually {getting up to leave}<hyperlink=“http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/14/ryan-frank-filmmaker-arrested-rights-violated/14046441/”> when he was arrested.

The St. Louis County Police Department, which was in charge of security in Ferguson at the time, did not return a request for comment. Gov. Jay Nixon (D) {relieved them of those duties}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/missouri-highway-patrol-to-take-over-security-in-ferguson/”> after intense criticism of their heavy-handed, militaristic response to the protests.

Frank posted a video of the arrests on YouTube. Peinado is the woman in denim shirt who gets out of the car, and Lee is shown being handcuffed at the end:

HuffPost,huff203,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-protest-police_n_5678441.html,Report: St. Louis County Police To Be Withdrawn From Duty After Ferguson Protests,Igor Bobic,08/14/14,12/14/16,"The St. Louis County Police Department will no longer be involved in policing Ferguson, Missouri, the suburban community rocked by protests after the death of an unarmed black teenager who was shot by a police officer last week.

Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), who represents Ferguson, told {Bloomberg}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jonallendc/status/499925308574023680""> on Thursday that Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) is expected to announce the decision later today.

“The gov. just called me and he’s on his way to St. Louis now to announce he’s taking St. Louis County police out of the situation,” he {said}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/dwallbank/status/499926179701608450"">.

The situation, already tenuous after extensive police presence that included rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas since Michael Brown’s death last week, exploded Wednesday evening after SWAT officers {roughed up and arrested two reporters}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/huffington-post-reporter-arrested-ferguson_n_5676829.html""> inside a local McDonald’s. The journalists were unharmed, but the incident highlighted the town’s ramped up police presence, which has been criticized as {overly militarized}<hyperlink=""http://mashable.com/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-protests-vs-iraq/"">.

It was unclear which authorities, either state police or the FBI, would be taking over in place of the St. Louis County Police Department.

According to the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=:""https://twitter.com/joelcurrier/status/499934734831849472"">, the county police department was “not aware of reports that they are being relieved of duty.”

The Ferguson Police Department has continued to withhold the identity of the officer who shot Brown, out of concern for his personal safety.

The governor released a statement on the situation on Wednesday evening, urging law enforcement to “keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press during this difficult time.”

“I have been closely monitoring the situation and will continue to be in communication with local leaders, and I will be in north St. Louis County tomorrow,” Nixon said. “As Governor, I am committed to ensuring the pain of last weekend’s tragedy does not continue to be compounded by this ongoing crisis.”

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) {said Wednesday evening}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/clairecmc/status/499727811742277632""> that she was in contact with local officials and the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division in order to “de escalate the tense and unacceptable situation” in Ferguson. She is also expected to meet with Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday.

UPDATE 12:32 p.m. ET — In a statement released by her office Thursday afternoon, McCaskill said Thursday called on authorities to “de-militarize” the situation. “I obviously respect law enforcement’s work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right. Today is going to be a new start, we can and need to do better,” she said. The senator also {confirmed}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/499954828614041600""> that St. Louis County police were being relieved of their duty.

UPDATE 1:18pm ET — Gov. Jay Nixon did not confirm the change in authority in remarks to residents in Florissant, Missouri on Thursday, but he did hint at “some of the operational shifts that I think are going to be necessary.”

“There is a certain level of emotion that must be expressed in order for us to reach a higher plane and my sense is that over the last few days there has been a fear to hear,” he added, according to {National Journal}<hyperlink=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/domesticpolicy/missouri-may-pull-st-louis-county-police-out-of-ferguson-20140814"">. “A fear to hear, not just about this action, but about how it fits in a much longer and broader context of a deeper march to justice.”

He continued: “So we are over the next few hours making some shifts so that folks will feel safe as long as they honor what I said before...the property and the person of their neighbors. And quite frankly the vast, vast majority of people I’ve spoken to have done just that.”

HuffPost,huff204,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/quiktrip-ferguson_n_5688947.html,"Police Block Off QuikTrip, A Central Gathering Location In Ferguson Protests",Amanda Terkel; Ryan J. Reiley,08/18/14,12/14/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Police blocked off the central gathering place for protesters in this St. Louis suburb Monday in an attempt to prevent large crowds from forming there and getting out of control.

Protesters have convened at the QuikTrip, or QT, gas station and convenience store since the Aug. 9 death of Michael Brown at the hands of a Ferguson police officer. The day after the shooting, on Sunday night, the store was looted and set on fire.

Since the building was destroyed, the QT’s parking lot has been a popular spot where protesters have mingled at night. Nearly every surface has been covered in graffiti either remembering Brown or criticizing police actions. Late at night, the QT has turned into somewhat of a party zone, with people drinking and the smell of marijuana wafting through the air. On many nights, a parade of cars — some with as many as 14 people piled on top — have passed along the street in front of the lot, honking their horns and blasting music.

On Sunday night, a line of heavily armed police officers spraying tear gas progressed just past the QT and found a dumpster that had been set on fire. A handful of people showed up early Monday morning to clean up the debris from the previous night. CNN and MSNBC both had tents at the QT on Monday and were doing live interviews, and protesters occasionally stopped by to catch up on what happened the night before and to plan for the day ahead. The Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke with people who had gathered there that day, as did St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been a constant presence at the protests.

But around 10 a.m., police officers began telling people they could no longer loiter at the QT. They were allowed to congregate, police said, as long as they continued to move around. One officer, who did not give his name, said it was on the orders of Gov. Jay Nixon (D). Nixon’s office did not return a request for additional comment. Police also told three young kids who were biking around the lot of the QT that they would have to move along.

A couple hours later, the police further restricted access to the lot, kicking everyone, including the media, off the property. They said it would remain off-limits Monday night as well.

Police also were enforcing the no-standing rule elsewhere on West Florissant Avenue, where the bulk of the protesting has been.

[tweetbegin 501381003659993089 tweetend]

Community members anticipated there could be a tense situation Monday night, after Nixon on Monday morning announced he was calling in the National Guard. There will be no curfew, unlike the previous two nights, when people could have been arrested for being out between midnight and 5 a.m.

“I think the presence of the National Guard has the potential to escalate the situation even more, and I hope that doesn’t happen,” French told The Huffington Post Monday morning at the QT, while it was still accessible.

{At least seven were arrested}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/ferguson-protests_n_5686601.html""> and two wounded Sunday night and into Monday morning during the clashes between protesters and police. According to the Missouri Highway Patrol, there had been molotov cocktails thrown at police long before the curfew, resulting in authorities tear-gassing the crowds and clearing West Florissant Avenue.

“It’s just a terrible thing what happened,” said Eyer, who has worked for the company for 34 years. “It’s a bad thing. It’s just not good.”

Eyer was there when armed officers strode into the fast food joint and ordered out patrons, including Huffington Post reporter Ryan J. Reilly and The Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery. The pair was in the area to report on the shooting death of 18-year-old {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/michael-brown-friend-shooting_n_5675097.html""> and the protests that followed, where ramped up tensions have escalated into brick throwing, tear gas, molotov cocktails and rubber bullets.

Meanwhile, reporters have been using {the McDonald’s}<hyperlink=""http://www.mcmissouri.com/811#""> as a hub because it has WiFi and electric outlets for charging phones and laptops. But McDonald’s customers were hustled out Wednesday evening in a noisy show of force — and in the confusion, Reilly and Lowery were aggressively cuffed and taken to a Ferguson Police Department holding cell.

The scuffle was unlike anything McDonald’s employees like Eyer had seen before.

“It’s a rough time,” he told Huffington Post, his voice shaky. “But I really think the city will get through it and make it stronger.”

HuffPost,huff207,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/lacy-clay-ferguson_n_5685812.html,Missouri Rep. Lacy Clay Calls For Police Diversity Amid Ferguson Unrest,Sabrina Siddiqui ,08/17/14,12/14/16,"WASHINGTON — After another night of clashes between protesters and police in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting death of Michael Brown, Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) is calling for greater diversity in the police force.

“A bigger problem here in Ferguson, and across this region and across America, are police forces who, in African-American communities, are not diverse enough,” Clay said Sunday during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “They do not have enough diversity within their force, [and] they do not have a healthy relationship with the African-American community that they are supposed to police.”

Unrest and riots have erupted in Ferguson in the last week after Brown, an unarmed teenager, was shot by a police officer in broad daylight. The local police force was heavily criticized for militarizing its response to protesters, attempting to quash largely peaceful assemblies and arresting reporters who were covering the situation on the ground.

Clay said the violent clashes between protesters and police were “totally unacceptable” and criticized police for a “heavy-handed” approach toward peaceful demonstrations.

“We have to have a national conversation about how police forces should interact with the African-American community,” Clay said.

Clay also appeared on radio amid the protests Saturday, where he asked the federal government to take over the entire investigation in Ferguson.

“I have absolutely no confidence in the Ferguson police, the county prosecutor. I know we won’t get a fair shake there,” Clay told {We Act Radio & Credo Mobile}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLyDZYVLTUQ&feature=youtu.be"">.

The situation appeared to take a more peaceful turn Thursday when local authorities were replaced by state highway patrol. But tensions flared again over the weekend after Ferguson police released a video allegedly showing {Brown robbing a convenience store}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/michael-brown-stole-cigars_n_5682089.html"">, a move widely seen as an attempt to attack his character as both local police and the Justice Department investigate his death.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew Saturday, a move that {appeared to backfire}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/jay-nixon-curfew_n_5685632.html?1408285508""> and renew mistrust between police and the Ferguson community.

Statistics in Ferguson point to serious evidence of {racial bias in law enforcement practices}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/michael-brown-killing_n_5675001.html?1407948267"">. An annual report on racial profiling by the Missouri attorney general found that blacks in Ferguson are twice as likely to be stopped by police as whites. Ninety-three percent of arrests last year following car stops in Ferguson were of blacks, while 92 percent of searches and 80 percent of car stops involved blacks, according to the report.

The Ferguson police department has 47 white officers and just three black officers, {according to ABC News}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/ferguson-police-departments-race-relations-spotlight/story?id=24962153"">.

Maria Chappelle-Nadal: Ferguson Police Manhandled Pregnant Woman,Alex Lazar,08/19/14,12/14/16,"Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal (D) told a disturbing story of what she alleges Ferguson police did to a pregnant woman during an interview with MSNBC’s Joy Reid on Tuesday.

“There are a lot of people in this community who have been abused, who have been intimidated, who have been forced to do things that they don’t want to do,” Chappelle-Nadal told Reid.

“A great example is this six-month-pregnant woman who was gassed the same day as I was. And she was forced face-down to the ground, and the police officer said, ‘Get down, face down on the ground.’ She’s six months pregnant, and that’s the way basically my community has been treated, not just in the last 11 days, but for quite a long time,” she added.

The Ferguson police have been criticized for the way they have been treating protesters, including using {tear gas}<hyperlink=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28848692""> on them.

The unrest in Ferguson, stemming from the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson, became so chaotic that the {National Guard}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/ferguson-protests_n_5689963.html""> was deployed to the area in an attempt to quell the situation.

HuffPost,huff210,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/16/ferguson-looting_n_5684465.html,Ferguson Shop Owner ‘Overwhelmed’ By Community Support After Looting,Ryan J. Reilly ,08/16/14,12/14/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Sonny Dayan owns a cell phone store that was looted early Saturday morning amid protests related to the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown. Police released a video Friday allegedly showing Brown robbing a convenience store, sparking fresh outrage in the already tense town. The Ferguson police chief said on Friday afternoon that Brown was not stopped in connection with the alleged robbery, but rather because he was walking in the middle of the street.

Here’s Dayan’s story:

We left at 7:30 p.m. Nothing was happening. It was quite quiet. There were a bunch of police across the street at the liquor store. At that point I assumed I’m probably the safest store around — I had 60 police officers across the street from my shop.

We got some advisements from people from the neighborhood that said that they heard something, that you know maybe I should board it tonight. But I just didn’t believe it. I’m here 17 years. ... So I had faith in the community, and indeed it wasn’t the community — it was just a couple of, you know, bad guys, I don’t know what to call them. But they were drinking all over the store. They stir drinks, they come here, vodka was everywhere, soda was spilled everywhere. I mean you should have seen the store this morning. Man, a mess!

So in that sense I was a little surprised. I’m not used to somebody robbing me, coming into my establishment and staying there as long as they need to and deciding when they want to leave, not when it’s time to leave. ... There’s been four break-ins in here, so it’s not my first time, and it’s not a big deal. But most of the time it’s minor, a door here, a door there, they call Ferguson, they come here, they save the day. This time around, the alarm company called Ferguson and said there’s movement inside the store, the officers said we can’t do anything. There’s riots going on and there’s troopers out there.

I had to immediately come over here, and I tried to get into the area. I couldn’t get into the area because the whole area was blocked. And I was like, ‘People are robbing my store, can I just go and put some boards on it?’ They did try, but then in the middle they changed their mind and said no, it’s too risky or something, please wait. They took my information and told me they’re going to call me as soon as the area is clean. That was about 1:45, 3:45 a.m., I’m just waiting.

Nobody calls me, so I just decide to come over. So I get here around 5, 5:30 a.m. There are a few people outside, some reporters were outside too, but the whole store was open, people could come in and out and take what they want at their leisure.

So that’s on the sad part. The good part is the people who were out here were waiting outside, they wanted to help me. So as soon as I got here, they said ‘Can I help you? Can I do this, can I do that?’ I wanted to take my time and clean as part of my therapy, as part of dealing with the situation. But some of them would not leave unless they did something to help, unless they got a hug or something. So that was very overwhelming, I didn’t think I’d come in there to be so overwhelmed by the community. So that’s very sweet.

I want to go back to normal. I’ve got to pay bills. I don’t have the luxury to be closed for weeks.

I don’t have a big insurance on this place. The whole concept of the store is modesty. So our prices are modest, we are alternative, so we’ll sell you a cheaper phone or a phone you would buy somewhere else, we’ll sell it to you a lot cheaper.

So we don’t have fancy-shamancy insurance because we don’t need to spend thousands of dollars on insurance. ... I’ll be covered for my expenses, the damages aren’t that extensive, thousands, maybe $5,000, $6,000. Manageable. We’ll live. It’s not the end of the world.

I just want things to go back to normal somehow. Wait for that positive to float and stay afloat, you know. Right now you see it, you know they’re there, a lot of good folks in the neighborhood, you see there here and there, but you will hope that they will come out and stay out.

HuffPost,huff211,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-tear-gas_n_5679931.html,This Company Is Profiting From Police Aggression In Ferguson,Zach Carter,08/14/14,12/23/16,"WASHINGTON — If there’s a winner from the militarized police aggression in Ferguson, Missouri, it would have to be the tear gas industry.

Officers bombarded city streets with tear gas for hours on Wednesday night, bathing Ferguson in a noxious cloud. At times, the police assault appeared to target {journalists}<hyperlink=""http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/live-news/2014/8/al-jazeera-americareportergetshitwithteargasinferguson.html"">. Citizens have protested for days over Saturday’s fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer, who authorities have refused to name.

It’s boom time for the tear gas industry, as law enforcement agencies turn to chemical weapon to combat political unrest abroad and protest movements at home. {As Sarah Kliff detailed for Vox}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6001995/ferguson-missouri-tear-gas-painful"">, the use of tear gas in international warfare is banned by the Geneva Convention — but it is increasingly a weapon of choice for governments to deploy against their own people.

A June {report from Visiongain}<hyperlink=""https://www.visiongain.com/blog/index.php/non-lethal-weapons-market-2014/"">, a business intelligence consultant, valued the global market for “non-lethal” weapons at $1.6 billion, which it predicted would increase over the next decade. “Our research indicates that non-lethal anti-personnel weapons are becoming increasingly high in demand particularly from law enforcement agencies,” Visiongain said in a press release.

The domestic tear gas industry is dominated by three companies — Jamestown, Pennsylvania-based Combined Systems Inc., Homer City, Pennsylvania-based NonLethal Technologies Inc., and {Defense Technology}<hyperlink=""http://www.defense-technology.com/"">, a Casper, Wyoming-based brand owned by the {Safariland}<hyperlink=""http://www.safariland.com/Safariland-Story.aspx""> law enforcement supply company.

Safariland’s Defense Technology appears to be the brand in Ferguson, {based on photographs}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/gallery/news/multimedia/protests-arrests-continue-monday-in-ferguson/collection_3cb71990-8eb8-5328-aeda-bd0d4bed7198.html#13""> of {canisters found}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jonswaine/status/499207314918764545/photo/1""> on the scene taken by journalists from The Guardian and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Guardian photographer {Jon Swaine has also documented explosives}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jonswaine/status/499759502325850113/photo/1""> in Ferguson that were manufactured by Combined Systems. Ferguson police were not available to comment.

“In the U.S., most police departments maintain stockpiles of tear gas munitions and launchers for riot control,” said Sven-Erik Jordt, a professor in the Duke University School of Medicine anesthesiology department. “Defense Technology cartridges were used by police to clear the Occupy protesters in Oakland, for example.”

Safariland tear gas has also been deployed in Bahrain, Egypt, Turkey, Tunisia and other countries, according to the {War Resisters League}<hyperlink=""http://facingteargas.org/tc/19/defense-technology-safariland-federal-laboratories"">, a nonprofit group that promotes nonviolence. {HuffPost’s Joshua Hersh reported from Cairo in 2011}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/23/egypt-tahrir-square-tear-gas_n_1110292.html""> that the use of U.S.-manufactured tear gas weapons against protesters in Egypt had fueled anti-American sentiment.

Neither Safariland nor the other tear gas manufacturers would comment for this article. They tout their products as humane alternatives to more violent force, though some {experts have attributed deaths}<hyperlink=""http://www.veritagiustizia.it/docs/gas_cs/CS_Effects_Waco.pdf""> to tear gas. Safariland has {trademarked}<hyperlink=""http://www.safariland.com/Safariland-Story.aspx""> the Orwellian phrase “Together, we save lives.”

The companies aggressively promote their wares to U.S. police departments. The War Resisters League has levied particular criticism at {Urban Shield}<hyperlink=""http://urbanshield.org/"">, an annual weapons expo in California that caters to law enforcement agencies.

“The targets are always communities of color and poor people, especially when they are actively struggling for justice. We feel that community’s very ability to build movements is on the line,” said Ali Issa, a national field organizer with the War Resisters League. “Tear gas and the police militarization that always comes with it do not appear in Ferguson and nationwide in a vacuum.” Issa noted that the Department of Defense has been supplying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of “excess” military equipment to law enforcement agencies in recent years.

There are three general types of tear gas. The most common is 2-{chlorobenzalmalononitrile}<hyperlink=""http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+4346"">, or CS. Other varieties include {phenacyl chloride}<hyperlink=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenacyl_chloride"">, or CN gas, which Jordt described as more toxic than CS, and {oleoresin capsicum}<hyperlink=""https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/181655.pdf"">, or OC, derived from hot peppers. All make people feel awful.

HuffPost,huff212,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/darren-wilson-protest_n_5686491.html,"Group Rallies In Support Of Darren Wilson, Police Officer Who Shot Michael Brown",Amanda Terkel; Ryan J. Reiley,08/17/14,12/23/16,"ST. LOUIS, Mo. — Frustrated with the national coverage of protests surrounding the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teen who was fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, a few dozen people showed up in downtown St. Louis on Sunday afternoon to show solidarity with the officer who killed the 18-year-old.

Since officer Darren Wilson {shot Brown on Aug. 9}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/darren-wilson-michael-brown_n_5681340.html"">, there have been nightly protests in Ferguson. But the counterprotesters said they wanted the country to know that not everyone supported the Ferguson demonstrations, and wanted Wilson and his family to know that there were people who backed them.

The protesters gathered outside KSDK-TV, a local station that they said has been biased in its coverage of the controversy.

Word of the Wilson rally spread via Facebook, according to the attendees, who were overwhelmingly white. For a $7 donation, there were pro-Wilson T-shirts, and all 55 of them sold out quickly.

Still, the rally was significantly smaller than the protests around Brown’s death. The Wilson supporters said they were worried about the officer’s family and for the most part had little sympathy for individuals claiming that there are problems with police behavior in Ferguson.

“If you do what the police tell you do — if you’re not doing anything wrong, and the cops ask you to do something, then you’re not going to have nothing to worry about,” said Michael Bates, 33.

When asked why the pro-Wilson rally didn’t have many African-American attendees, John Newshaw, a retired St. Louis County police officer, said, “This sounds wrong, but I don’t think the black community understands the system. Again, there’s a process. They’re screaming about, why isn’t he [Wilson] arrested, why isn’t he in jail? Well, without the investigation being done, you can’t go and apply for a warrant.”

[tweetbegin 501161951037509633 tweetend]

Newshaw criticized the Missouri Highway Patrol for “doing exactly what the violent protesters want” and trying to use more communication and less force.

“They’re going to keep pushing the envelope,” he said of demonstrators who’ve gotten violent during protests in Ferguson. “There’s no reason to stop. ... It’s as simple as training your dog. If you don’t tell them stop biting, guess what, he’s going to continue to bite.”

[tweetbegin 501158945625767937 tweetend]

The Brown killing has touched a chord with many in the African-American community and beyond that goes further than the shooting. Although a majority of Ferguson residents are black, the power structure there is still white. Ferguson’s mayor and police chief are both white, as are six of the city’s seven council members. (The seventh is Latino.) And just three members of Ferguson’s 53-person police force are black. A {2013 report}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf> found a major racial disparity in stops and searches in Ferguson, with black individuals twice as likely to get arrested.

But Bates said he was frustrated that the issue was becoming a “race thing,” saying that was besides the point.

[tweetbegin 501155789047095296 tweetend]

“If everyone just stopped with the racism thing, it’d all just go away and everything would go to court and come out with the way the law is supposed to do it. Rioting and everything in the streets doesn’t get anything done,” he said.

The Missouri Highway Patrol, which is now in charge of security in Ferguson, declared a second curfew for Sunday night, in effect from midnight until 5:00 am CDT Monday morning. One person was shot and seven people were arrested in the early hours of Sunday morning, while the first curfew was in effect.

HuffPost,huff213,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/michael-brown-shooting_n_5675660.html,ACLU Files Sunshine Law Requests To ID Officer Who Shot Michael Brown,Jennifer Bendery,08/13/14,12/23/16,"WASHINGTON — The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri filed formal requests on Tuesday to obtain a copy of the police incident report naming the officer who shot Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager killed Saturday while walking down the street in a St. Louis suburb.

The ACLU submitted its requests to {the Ferguson Police Department}<hyperlink=""http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/Ferguson.pdf""> and {the St. Louis County Police Department}<hyperlink=""http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/StLouis.pdf"">. Both were filed under the state’s Sunshine Law, which stipulates that records of public governmental bodies be made open to the public.

Diane Balogh, communications director for the ACLU of Missouri, said the group filed the requests specifically to find out the identity of the police officer. The Ferguson Police Department originally planned to release the officer’s name on Tuesday, but then decided not to, citing threats against the officer. In the meantime, the Justice Department is overseeing an investigation into the shooting and Ferguson has become a scene of {daily protests}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/michael-brown-protests_n_5672163.html""> and {vandalism}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnewsnow.com/story/26242441/vandalism-reported-after-vigil-for-missouri-man"">, with police even using tear gas on people {standing in their own backyards}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-tear-gas_n_5671811.html"">.

“If they don’t follow through, we will file a lawsuit and hold a press conference,” Balogh told The Huffington Post. “There have been other situations where we’ve actually had to sue the police department because they haven’t fulfilled the Sunshine Law requirements.”

She added, “The police like their secrets.”

Missouri’s Sunshine Law specifies that requests for information be acted on as soon as possible, but “no later than the end of the third business day following the date the request is received.”

Requests for comment from the Ferguson Police Department and the St. Louis County Police Department were not immediately returned.

The ACLU isn’t the only group intent on identifying Brown’s shooter. The group of activist hackers known as Anonymous has vowed to out the officer’s name through its own efforts, which so far have included {hacking into city computers}<hyperlink=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/anonymous-ferguson-police-killing-unarmed-michael-brown""> and temporarily shutting them down.

HuffPost,huff214,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/obama-ferguson_n_5688455.html,Obama Dispatches Eric Holder To Ferguson As Federal Probes Continue,Jennifer Bendery,08/18/14,12/23/16,"WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama spoke out on Monday about the ongoing situation in Ferguson, Missouri, where protesters have been demonstrating since the Aug. 9 death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager shot and killed by a police officer.

He reiterated that the Justice Department has opened an independent investigation into Brown’s killing, and announced that Attorney General Eric Holder will head to Ferguson Wednesday to meet with federal investigators.

“We have all seen images of protesters and law enforcement in the streets. It’s clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting. What’s also clear is that a small minority of individuals are not,” Obama said.

“While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or by carrying guns or by attacking the police only serves to stir tension … it undermines rather than advances justice.”

Obama acknowledged that the Ferguson community is “hurting” and said residents are rightly looking for answers in the wake of Brown’s shooting. But he said he had to be “careful about not prejudging” before investigations are completed. He also touched on the issue simmering beneath Brown’s shooting: the racial divide.

“In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and left as objects to fear,” he said, adding, “Part of the ongoing challenge of perfecting our union has involved dealing with communities that feel left behind.”

Given the stunning images that have been coming out of Ferguson, showing police riding tanks and armed in riot gear, he said it may be time to re-examine a Pentagon program that provides surplus military weapons to police departments.

“There is no excuse for excessive force by police,” Obama said.

“I think it’s probably useful for us to review how the funding has gone, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars, to make sure that what they’re purchasing is stuff that they actually need,” He added. “There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred.”

The president made his remarks following a briefing on the situation by Holder. He made similar comments {last Thursday}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/obama-ferguson_n_5678593.html"">, urging calm amid the unrest in the St. Louis suburb.

Holder said later that the Justice Department is committing its “full resources” to the probe into Brown’s death. On Monday alone, he said, more than than 40 FBI agents conducted interviews with Ferguson residents. The department plans to carry out its own independent autopsy of Brown.

“I realize there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to Michael Brown’s death, but I ask for the public’s patience as we conduct this investigation,” Holder said in a statement. “The selective release of sensitive information that we have seen in this case so far is troubling to me. No matter how others pursue their own separate inquiries, the Justice Department is resolved to preserve the integrity of its investigation.”

“What happened is, some people are taking their names and going on the Internet and getting their identities and social security numbers, and so that’s been occurring,” Johnson said.

“I can’t set rules for another police department,” Johnson added, telling Reilly the Ferguson police chief would have to address the identification issues.

In an op-ed on {Time.com}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police"">, the libertarian-minded senator attributed the “militarization of law enforcement” to an “expansion of government power,” making the tie-in to his advocacy for smaller government.

Paul also wrote that it is “impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them,” turning to how “racial disparities” distort the criminal justice system:

Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth. The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.
The senator, who is considered a likely contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, hasn’t been coy about his attempts to appeal to a broader cross-section of voters by {backing a voting rights bill}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/22/rand-paul-voting-rights_n_5519374.html""> and by {criticizing federal drug policies}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/17/rand-paul-racist-drug-laws_n_5504062.html""> that disproportionately affect minorities.

Some were killed by police. Some were killed by private citizens. All were unarmed.

Then it hit me. Suddenly I realized it didn’t matter if he had a gun. In the eyes of America, he had something more dangerous than a gun: his black skin. Yes, Ezell Ford was suspicious, in part, because he was black. That’s why unarmed black people continue to be killed.

Look online and you’ll find pictures of white people proudly carrying guns into {churches}<hyperlink=""http://www.chocolatecity.cc//wp-content/uploads/gun%20to%20church.jpg"">, {bars}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_404h/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/10/27/Local-Politics/Images/03GunsInBars_10_0_42774901-378.JPG>, and {grocery stores}<hyperlink=""http://www.activeresponsetraining.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/open_carry_gun_law_03.jpg""> thanks to the “open carry” laws passed in nearly every state recently. Black people don’t have that right.

When a white teenager named {Steve Lohner}<hyperlink=""http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/08/03/teen-totes-shotgun-through-town-still-shaken-by-mass-murder-because-2nd-amendment/""> was stopped by the police last month and {refused to show his ID}<hyperlink=""http://youtu.be/x7Gx73R3p1U""> after carrying a loaded shotgun on the streets of Aurora, Colorado (the same city where a mass murderer killed 12 people and injured 70 others in a packed movie theater in July 2012), the teen walked away with nothing but a citation.

But when a 22-year-old black kid named {John Crawford}<hyperlink=""http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/man-police-shot-in-walmart-killed-over-fake-gun-fa/ngw77/""> picked up a mere BB gun in a Walmart store in Dayton, Ohio last week, customers called the police, who then shot and killed him.

Here lies a racial disparity that’s difficult for honest people to ignore. How can black people openly carry a real gun when we can’t even pick up a BB gun in a store without arousing suspicion? The answer in America is that the Second Amendment doesn’t really apply to black people.

Consider this. In the hours since the protests began in Ferguson, Missouri, {gun sales spiked}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/gun-stores-in-st-louis-area-see-a-spike-in/article_f3e99891-8111-5f3e-a159-c94ad7834a72.html""> in the St. Louis area. It seems some whites are scared to death of violent black people, even though the only person who’s been killed in the past week of turmoil in St. Louis was 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Imagine what might happen if black people started buying up scores of weapons at gun stores and posting pictures of ourselves carrying them on the streets to protect ourselves? We don’t have to wonder. When the {Black Panthers did this in the 1960s}<hyperlink=""http://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_capitolmarch.html'>, California’s Republican Governor Ronald Reagan, the patron saint of white conservatives, signed a law called the {Mulford Act}<hyperlink=""http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/readersrespond/bs-ed-reagan-letter-20120210,0,1471722.story""> which prohibited the carrying of firearms on your person, in a vehicle, or in any public place or street.

So does it really matter if Ezell Ford had a gun on him when he was killed? Perhaps it allows his defenders to maintain some sense of moral high ground, but it does not change the problem with race in our country. In America, a black kid with a bag of Skittles is far more “suspicious” than a white man carrying an assault rifle. That’s why studies have shown that police are {more likely to shoot unarmed black suspects}<hyperlink=""http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/ps/racialbias.pdf""> than unarmed white ones. A white man with a gun is assumed to be a law-abiding patriot, while a black man with a gun is assumed to be a lawless thug..

When a black man’s exercise of his constitutional right stamps him with an instant presumption of guilt, he understands the Second Amendment isn’t designed to protect him. But if white Americans want blacks to respect the law, then they must understand how pervasive racial disparities undermine confidence in our laws and our criminal justice system.

If the public conversation about Michael Brown, Ezell Ford, Eric Garner, Renisha McBride, Trayvon Martin, and other victims does nothing else, I hope it strikes another nail in the coffin of the delusion of colorblindness in America. Until white people finally acknowledge the persistence and the depth of their own conscious and subconscious racial biases and assumptions, unarmed black people will continue to die from their mistakes.

According to a White House spokesman, “a good time was had by all.”

Read the full White House press release from a pool report below:

From Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz:
Tonight, the President and First Lady attended the birthday celebration for Mrs. Ann Jordan at an event at the Farm Neck Golf Club. There were approximately 150 guests in attendance.
Among the attendees seated with the Jordans and the President and First Lady were former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Valerie Jarrett and her mother Mrs. Barbara Bowman, Ursula Burns, Kenneth Chenault and his wife Kathy, along with other friends and family of Mrs. Jordan. President Obama honored Mrs. Jordan with a toast before dinner, as did Mr. Jordan and Secretary Clinton and others. The President and First Lady have known the Jordans for over twenty years, and were grateful to have been able to share this special evening with them.
The President and First Lady also were happy to have the chance to spend time with Secretary Clinton and former President Clinton.
A little color: in his toast for Mrs. Jordan, President quipped that he met Vernon and first, but liked Ann more. The menu consisted of surf and turf and pasta. The Obamas danced nearly every song. A good time was had by all.

HuffPost,huff220,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/michael-brown-rally_n_5686149.html,Ferguson Church Hosts Rally In Remembrance Of Michael Brown,AP/The Huffington Post,08/17/14,12/23/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on a black Missouri teenager whose fatal shooting by a white police officer has spurred a week of rancorous and sometimes-violent protests in suburban St. Louis.

The “extraordinary circumstances” surrounding the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown and a request by Brown’s family members prompted the order, Department of Justice spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.

“This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,” Fallon said. “Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.”

The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation into the shooting. Officials said a day earlier that 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson, Missouri, neighborhood where Brown, who was unarmed, was shot to death Aug. 9 in the street.

David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami’s U.S. Attorney’s office, said a federally conducted autopsy “more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises” might help that investigation, and that the move is “not that unusual.”

He also said federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case.

President Barack Obama, who has been getting regular updates on the situation in Ferguson while on vacation, was to be briefed by Holder upon returning Monday to the White House.

The Justice Department’s announcement followed the first night of a state-imposed curfew in Ferguson, which ended with tear gas and seven arrests after police dressed in riot gear used armored vehicles to disperse defiant protesters.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said protesters were not the reason for the escalated police reaction early Sunday after the midnight curfew took effect. He cited a report of people who had broken into a barbecue restaurant and taken to the roof, and a man who flashed a handgun in the street as armored vehicles approached the crowd of protesters.

At a Sunday afternoon rally, Johnson said he had met members of Brown’s family and the experience “brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart.”

“When this is over,” he told the crowd, “I’m going to go in my son’s room. My black son, who wears his pants sagging, who wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, but that’s my baby.”

Johnson added: “We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael’s going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.”

The Rev. Al Sharpton told the rally Brown’s death was a “defining moment for this country.”

Sharpton said he wants Congress to stop programs that provide military-style weaponry to police departments. He said he expects police to “smear” the slain teenager, his family and his attorneys.

He also condemned the recent spate of violence and looting in Ferguson.

As the sun began to set Sunday, the protests had a party-like atmosphere, with crowds lining the street in front of buildings that had been looted. Some people were barbequing outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that was destroyed earlier in the week.

The protests have been going on since Brown’s death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Missouri’s governor to put the state highway patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson Police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store before he was killed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Gov. Jay Nixon, who imposed the curfew after declaring a state of emergency, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that he was not aware the police were going to release surveillance video from the store where Brown is alleged to have stolen a $49 box of cigars.

“It’s appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,” Nixon said.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

“When you’re exhausted, when you’re out of resources, when you’re out of ammunition, you surrender,” Brown’s uncle, pastor Charles Ewing, told worshippers during a Sunday sermon at Jennings Mason Temple in Ferguson. “He surrendered, and yet he died.”

The officer who shot Brown was identified as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting and the department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

After all, he told his radio listeners on Wednesday, all of his run-ins with the law have been very pleasant, even when he’s been carrying a weapon, so he didn’t see why people were feeling negative about cops, even in the wake of the killing of Michael Brown.

As he put it:

“When a cop pulls me over, I put my hands outside of the car. If I’m carrying a weapon, which I’m licensed to carry in New York, the first thing I tell the police officer is, ‘Officer, I want you to know I have a legal firearm in the car.’ First thing I say to the officer! He’ll ask, ‘where is it?’ And I’ll say, ‘It’s in my holster.’ And he says, ‘Alright, just keep your hands outside.’ That’s usually the protocol. And then, ‘Can I have your license and registration, please, move slowly.’ And I often would even step out of the car, lift my shirt up so he can see where the gun is. And you handle it. ‘Yes, sir,’ ‘no, sir,’ writes me a ticket, ‘thank you, sir,’ and that’s it. You battle the issue in court!”
So there you have it, folks. If rich, white, gun-toting radio host Sean Hannity is doing fine, what’s everyone else’s issue?

Reilly ,08/14/14,12/23/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday spoke with the parents of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager killed Saturday by a police officer in this St. Louis suburb, The Huffington Post has learned.

Holder, who {also issued a statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-854.html""> on the shooting and ensuing protests in Ferguson, promised the family a full and independent investigation, according to a person briefed on the matter.

A lawyer representing Brown’s family told CNN Thursday afternoon that he and the family had met with officers from the Justice Department’s Community Relations Service, a secretive peacekeeping arm of DOJ that helps soothe tensions in communities across the country. Attorney Anthony Gray said the family felt “way more comfortable” after the meeting, which took place at the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The phone call with Holder took place there as well.

In his Thursday statement, Holder said he was “deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message” to the community.

“At my direction, Department officials have conveyed these concerns to local authorities. Also at my direction, the Department is offering – through our COPS office and Office of Justice Programs – technical assistance to local authorities in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force. The local authorities in Missouri have accepted this offer of assistance as of this afternoon,” Holder said.

Frank, a local filmmaker, was documenting about 100 people peacefully protesting outside the Ferguson Police Department on Wednesday night when a SWAT team came up, {“pointed guns”}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/14/ryan-frank-filmmaker-arrested-rights-violated/14046441/""> at everyone and told protesters to leave. Frank told KSDK that he sat down on the sidewalk to watch what was going on.

“I was charged with failure to obey a lawful order and noise violation,” Frank said in his interview with KSDK, adding, “I felt that it was our right to stay and observe what was happening, and we weren’t breaking any laws. So we sat down on the sidewalk, and they came and arrested us.”

Wesley Lowery, Washington Post Reporter

A McDonald’s a few blocks from where Brown’s shooting took place has been a frequent resting place for journalists who are covering what’s going on in Ferguson and need a place with outlets and Internet access to file their stories. On Wednesday evening, police officers came into the McDonald’s and told everyone to leave. Lowery, who was {filming}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2""> what the officers were doing, was ({illegally}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/filming-police-officers_n_5676940.html?1407983205"">) instructed to stop doing so.

According to Lowery, when he didn’t leave quickly enough, multiple officers grabbed him.

“As they took me into custody, {the officers slammed me into a soda machine}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2"">, at one point setting off the Coke dispenser. They put plastic cuffs on me, then they led me out the door,” he wrote.

Lowery was released Wednesday night and not charged with a crime.

Ryan Reilly, Huffington Post Reporter

Like Lowery, Reilly was working at the McDonald’s when officers came in and tried to kick everyone out. Reilly took issue when the police officers {demanded to see his ID}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2""> and told him to pack up.

“Evidently, I was not moving quickly enough,” Reilly said in a Wednesday night interview with MSNBC. “At that point, I was given a countdown. I was told I had 45 seconds, 30 seconds to pack up all my stuff and leave, at which point the officer in question who I have not — I repeatedly later would ask for his name and was never [told], or his batch number. He has never given it. [He] decided that he was going to help me pack, and he grabbed my things and shoved them into my bag. And, I was then, when I — basically, he arrested me. He handcuffed me. He used his finger to put a pressure point on my neck, and it was just a very difficult experience.”

Reilly said one of the police officers also slammed his head against the glass, on purpose, and then “sarcastically apologized for it.” He was released with Lowery without any charges.

HuffPost,huff224,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/michael-brown-marijuana-toxicology_n_5688788.html,So What If Michael Brown Had Marijuana In His System When He Was Killed?,Nick Wing; Matt Ferner,08/18/14,12/23/16,"The St. Louis County medical examiner’s report on the body of Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old killed by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 9, found that Brown had “marijuana in his system” when he died, according to a {Washington Post article}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/county-investigation-michael-brown-was-shot-from-the-front-had-marijuana-in-his-system/""> Monday.

This development should not have come as a surprise to anyone who has ever been or known a teenager, but some still expected the {toxicology report to be a “bombshell.}hyperlink=""http://twitchy.com/2014/08/18/next-potential-bombshell-michael-brown-toxicology-report/”> It isn’t.

For one, the presence of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in Brown’s body says nothing about whether he was intoxicated at the time of his confrontation with Wilson. Depending on how frequently a person consumes cannabis and how fast that individual metabolizes the many compounds contained in the plant, it’s not entirely clear for just how long a marijuana user will continue to test positive for the substance.

THC can stay in a person’s body for upward of 40 days, {according to the National Drug Court Institute}<hyperlink=""http://www.ndci.org/sites/default/files/ndci/THC_Detection_Window_0.pdf"">.

Infrequent or first-time users of marijuana might still test positive for about four days after the initial use, but frequent users of cannabis may test positive for THC for weeks after the person last consumed the drug.

In an extreme case, a single person who reportedly regularly used marijuana for about 10 years still tested positive almost 70 days after last using it, according to the NDCI.

In other words, just because marijuana was found in Brown’s system does not mean he was high at the time he was shot to death by a police officer. It doesn’t even necessarily mean he recently consumed cannabis. Such false assumptions often lead to claims that marijuana use is directly linked to criminal behavior. While some studies have found higher marijuana use among criminal offenders, the presence of THC in their systems is often circumstantial, rather than a contributor to the behavior itself.

Even if Brown was high or had recently used marijuana, there is little evidence to suggest Brown would have been more aggressive or confrontational when approached by a police officer because of it. In fact, if Brown were high, a number of recent studies suggest that marijuana would have made him {much less aggressive}<hyperlink=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390813003304"">.

Even {a study}<hyperlink=""http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/nc/ncc3_4.htm""> commissioned by President Richard Nixon from 1972 reported this same effect: “Rather than inducing violent — or aggressive behavior ... marihuana was usually found to inhibit the expression of aggressive impulses by pacifying the user ... generally producing states of drowsiness lethargy, timidity and passivity.”

But most importantly, when the discussion surrounding this controversy shifts to Brown’s apparent use of drugs — and marijuana, no less, a substance that has been fully legalized in two states — it distracts from the real questions at hand: How did an unarmed black teenager approached by a police officer for walking in the street end up being shot six times? Was Wilson justified in shooting Brown? Did Brown attack the officer and reach for his gun, as police claim? Did Wilson’s fatal shot to Brown’s head come while the teen’s hands were up, as witnesses contend? Meaningless and misleading indictments of Brown’s character {do nothing}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/michael-brown-stole-cigars_n_5682089.html?1408122745""> to provide answers to these questions.

But another prominent member of the KKK is skeptical of the effort, {according}<hyperlink=""http://www.thewire.com/national/2014/08/kkk-disowns-kkk-fundraiser-for-darren-wilson/378689/""> to The Wire.

Frank Ancona, Imperial Wizard of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan {based in Potosi, Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan/active_hate_groups"">, expressed doubts over the branch of the KKK working to support Wilson. Ancona said Chuck Murray, who heads the group raising funds for Wilson, may be leading an unofficial group he started on his own that’s not recognized by the KKK, noting that “they don’t even have their own legitimate website.”

“It’s a scam, he is just trying to capitalize on the situation,” Ancona said.

{The Wire reports:}<hyperlink=""http://www.thewire.com/national/2014/08/kkk-disowns-kkk-fundraiser-for-darren-wilson/378689/"">

“He basically made up his own name,” Ancona said, explaining that Murray may not even be on his birth certificate. “We are a registered organization. We have a charter with the state... Half of them don’t have the rituals for our ceremonies.”
Ancona worked with senior members of his organization to attempt to find Murray and confirm his connection to the larger group, but they could not. “No one has ever heard of the guy, I talked to the older members of our group,” he said. “There are other legitimate Klan organizations, but this group here sprang out in the last year or so I don’t believe he has any members. I think it’s just him.”
Additionally, Ancona believes Murray’s fundraising effort is a scam, because technically, members of the Klan cannot speak with the media, let alone solicit their help with raising donations. All members sign an agreement that forbids conversations with the press. Only highly vetted officials interact with reporters, and even then, interviews are rare.
Ancona has tried to dispel what he calls falsehoods about the KKK in the past, saying “rogue” members give the group a bad name.

“We don’t hate people because of their race, I mean, we’re a Christian organization,” Ancona {said in March}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/21/virginia-kkk-fliers_n_5008647.html"">. “Because of the acts of a few rogue Klansmen, all Klansmen are supposed to be murderers, and wanting to lynch black people, and we’re supposed to be terrorists. That’s a complete falsehood.”

Murray and his group aren’t the only ones to show support for Wilson, who {was named}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/darren-wilson-michael-brown_n_5681340.html""> as the officer who fatally shot Brown at an Aug. 15 press conference.

HuffPost,huff227,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/obama-police-militarization-_n_5689242.html,Obama On Police Militarization: We Need To Make Sure They’re Buying Stuff They Actually Need,Sam Stein,08/18/14,12/23/16,"WASHINGTON — Appearing at the White House during a respite from his vacation, President Barack Obama on Monday offered support for a review of the militarization of local law enforcement.

Addressing the ongoing strife in Ferguson, Missouri, Obama sought a balanced resolution. He urged looters to stop commandeering a legitimate civil rights protest, and called on the police to further respect the rights of protesters. His most noteworthy remarks came when asked about the machinery being deployed by those police in recent days to quell unrest, which has been criticized for instead inciting tensions and further alienating the local community.

“I think one of the great things about the United States has been our ability to maintain a distinction between our military and domestic law enforcement,” said the president. “That helps preserve our civil liberties. That helps ensure that the military is accountable to civilian direction. And that has to be preserved. After 9/11, I think, understandably, a lot of folks saw local communities that were ill equipped for a potential catastrophic terrorist attack. And I think people in Congress, people of goodwill, decided we’ve got to make sure they get proper equipment to deal with threats that historically wouldn’t arise in local communities.”

“Some of that has been useful,” Obama conceded, citing law enforcement officials who didn’t have basic radios that could operate in the midst of a disaster.

However, he added, “I think it’s probably useful for us to review how the funding has gone, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars, to make sure that what they are purchasing is stuff they actually need. Because there’s a big difference between our military and local law enforcement and we don’t want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions.”

The militarization of law enforcement may have become a hot-button national issue in the wake of the Ferguson protests, but it’s been a simmering controversy for years. Nevertheless, Congress has largely turned a blind eye to the matter, choosing to send unused Pentagon funds to police under the guise of enhancing neighborhood safety. As The Huffington Post reported on Monday:

House lawmakers overwhelmingly voted in June to block legislation by Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) that would have stopped the program, which funnels surplus military weapons to police departments at no charge. The so-called ‘1033 program,’ launched in 1997, has provided billions of dollars in military equipment to local law enforcement agencies around the country. Grayson’s amendment failed 62 to 355, with Democrats opposing the legislation by a 3-to-1 margin.
The effects of the program have been on full display in Ferguson, where police have responded to mostly peaceful protests over the Aug. 9 murder of Michael Brown with a stunning display of force involving armored vehicles, tear gas, assault rifles and smoke bombs. The result is a nightly scene that looks more like an international war zone than a St. Louis suburb.

HuffPost,huff228,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/obama-michael-brown_n_5672956.html,Obama Calls Michael Brown Tragedy ‘Heartbreaking’,Amanda Terkel,08/12/14,12/23/16,"WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama weighed in Tuesday with his first public comments on the shooting of an unarmed African American teenager by a police officer, a controversy that has gained nationwide attention and sparked days of protests in the St. Louis suburb where the altercation took place.

On Aug. 9, Michael Brown, 18, was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The Ferguson Police Department has said that Brown assaulted the officer, whose name has not been released. Eyewitnesses, however, have disputed that claim and said {Brown was killed while attempting to surrender or flee}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5988925/mike-brown-killing-shooting-case-ferguson-police-riots-st-louis"">.

In a statement, Obama urged people to “talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds”:

The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time. As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed.
I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.
Since the shooting, the black community in Ferguson has held {protests and vigils}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/08/12/in_defense_of_black_rage_michael_brown_police_and_the_american_dream/""> that have {attracted hundreds}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5988925/mike-brown-killing-shooting-case-ferguson-police-riots-st-louis"">. At least four people have been injured and {47 people have been arrested}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Reports-Ferguson-protests-turn-violent-270697451.html""> so far, according to KMOV in St. Louis, and {looting and vandalism}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnewsnow.com/story/26242441/vandalism-reported-after-vigil-for-missouri-man""> have been reported in the area.

The police response to the protests has caused controversy, with one officer caught on video calling the protesters {“fucking animals“}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/michael-brown-protests_n_5672163.html""> and another seen {throwing tear gas}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-tear-gas_n_5671811.html""> at residents in their own backyards.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said the shooting deserves a full review, and the Justice Department has already dispatched its Community Relations Service to the scene to try to {calm the racial tension}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/eric-holder-michael-brown_n_5669766.html"">, according to the Associated Press.

The Ferguson Police Department had {initially promised to release the name of the officer who shot Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-department_n_5671590.html""> by midday Tuesday, but the department backtracked, {saying it was concerned}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-department_n_5671590.html""> about threats to its officers.

Most of Ferguson’s residents are African American but very few of its public officials are. {According to the Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html#page=1"">, “Ferguson’s police chief and mayor are white. Of the six City Council members, one is black. The local school board has six white members and one Latino. Of the 53 commissioned officers on the police force, three are black, said Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson.”

Black residents are disproportionately pulled over by police in Ferguson. Whites make up about one-third of the city’s population but accounted for {just 12.7 percent of traffic stops}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/blacks-overwhelmingly-get-stopped-by-the-police-in-ferguson""> by Ferguson police last year. African-Americans made up 93 percent of the arrests following those stops, yet whites were more likely to be caught with contraband.

The Brown tragedy has brought back memories of the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012. Martin was an unarmed black teenager who was killed by a white neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Florida.

“If I had a son, {he’d look like Trayvon}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/23/obama-trayvon-martin_n_1375083.html"">,” Obama said after his death. “I think [Trayvon’s parents] are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and we are going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.”

HuffPost,huff229,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/michael-brown-family-statement_n_5682546.html,‘Beyond Outraged’ Family Of Michael Brown & Their Attorneys Release Statement,Paige Lavender ,08/15/14,12/23/16,"The family of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teen who was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri last week, released a statement Friday.

The statement, from both the family and their lawyers, was {tweeted}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/attorneycrump/status/500334365919170560""> out by attorney Ben Crump after police announced {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/darren-wilson-michael-brown_n_5681340.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics""> as the officer who shot Brown, and named the teen as a {suspect}<hyperlink=""http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-say-michael-brown-fit-description-strong-arm-robbery-suspect/""> in a robbery that occurred before the shooting.

Read the {full statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s44se5""> below:

Michael Brown’s family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piece mil information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.
There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.
The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.
It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.
The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.
Benjamin L Crump, Esq.
Anthony D. Gray, Esq.
Daryl D. Parks, Esq.
UPDATE: Aug. 15, 4:51 p.m. — At a press conference Friday afternoon, Brown’s family’s attorneys addressed {video}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/15/raw-video-surveillance-video-believed-to-show-michael-brown-robbing-convenience-store/""> and images released by the police that allegedly show Brown leaving the convenience store where the robbery took place and shoving a clerk.

Attorney Daryl Parks said “it appears to look like” Brown in the video, but wouldn’t say Brown committed the robbery. He noted Brown’s family believes the police chief decided to release still shots from the video before releasing the video itself because “those pictures look a lot worse than the video.”

“We believe that he strategically did that to assassinate the character of Michael Brown,” Parks said.

The attorneys, along with Brown’s cousin Eric Davis, made a plea for protesters to continue to peacefully protest and not “get distracted,” riot or cause harm to others.

HuffPost,huff230,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/michael-brown-family-autopsy_n_5687898.html,Michael Brown’s Family: What Else Do They Need To Arrest Killer Of Our Son?,Sabrina Siddiqui ,08/18/14,12/23/16,"WASHINGTON — After a preliminary autopsy this weekend revealed that Michael Brown was shot at least six times, the teenager’s mother had just one question on Monday for police: “What else do we need to give them to arrest the killer of my child?”

The independent autopsy found that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. Members of Brown’s family surrounded their attorney, Benjamin Crump, at a press conference Monday as he described their emotional turmoil and called for a fair investigation into the teen’s death. Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, wants justice for her son and is desperate for answers, Crump said.

Dr. Michael Baden, the former New York City chief medical examiner who conducted the autopsy, also addressed the media, saying there was “no evidence of a struggle” — a key detail at odds with the police’s {reported accounts}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/10/ferguson-police-news-conference-michael-brown/13860601/""> of what transpired moments before an officer shot and killed Brown on Aug. 9.

“The family has a right to know how their loved one died,” Baden said.

Baden and Professor Shawn Parcells, a pathologist assistant based in Kansas who helped with the autopsy, said they could not establish the order of bullets fired at Brown. But they believe Brown died from a final bullet fired through the top of his skull because all of the other gunshot wounds were survivable, Baden said.

The information is largely consistent with eyewitness accounts of Brown’s fatal encounter with police earlier this month. A friend who was with Brown at the time said the teen, who was unarmed, had his hands in the air and was trying to surrender. At a height of 6-foot-4, Brown’s head would have been facing downward when the final bullet entered his head, Baden said.

“We believe that given those types of facts, it shows this officer should have been arrested,” Darryl Parks, another family attorney, said.

The questions surrounding Brown’s death “could have been answered on Day One if you were really trying to have transparency be the objective,” Crump said of local police. “The Brown family wanted to have this autopsy performed on their behalf because ... they did not want to be left having to rely on the autopsy done by the St. Louis law enforcement agencies, the same individuals they feel are responsible for executing their son in broad daylight.”

The family “begged and pleaded” to have an independent autopsy performed, Crump added.

Baden appeared to criticize the Ferguson police for the way the case was handled, noting that putting information out sooner on Brown’s death and talking to his family could have calmed tensions within the community.

In the week since Brown was killed, Ferguson has been rocked by unrest and riots. Local police were heavily criticized for withholding details about the fatal shooting and attempting to quash largely peaceful protests, prompting state highway patrol officers to take over the law enforcement efforts in the community.

Tensions flared again over the weekend after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) imposed a curfew, leading to a new round of clashes between protesters and police. Nixon announced an executive order on Monday to send {National Guard troops to Ferguson.}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/ferguson-protests_n_5686601.html"">

HuffPost,huff231,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/sunil-dutta-police-washington-post_n_5692266.html,"Veteran Cop: ‘If You Don’t Want To Get Shot,’ Shut Up — Even If We’re Violating Your Rights",Nick Wing,08/19/14,12/23/16,"Sunil Dutta, a 17-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and adjunct instructor of homeland security at Colorado Technical University, has a suggestion for victims of police violence searching for someone to blame: Look in the mirror.

In a {column published Tuesday in The Washington Post}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/08/19/im-a-cop-if-you-dont-want-to-get-hurt-dont-challenge-me/""> titled, “I’m a cop. If you don’t want to get hurt, don’t challenge me,” Dutta responds to mounting criticism of the policing tactics on display in Ferguson, Missouri, amid the {hyper-militarization of law enforcement}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/obama-police-militarization-_n_5689242.html""> and {accusations that officers have violated the First Amendment rights}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/police-force-and-first-amendment-trespasses-ferguson-protests""> of both demonstrators and {journalists covering the events}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/ferguson-police-arresting-journalists_n_5691645.html"">. In a particularly telling passage, Dutta argues that citizens could deter police brutality if they were simply more cooperative, even when they’re unjustly targeted.

“Even though it might sound harsh and impolitic, here is the bottom line: if you don’t want to get shot, tased, pepper-sprayed, struck with a baton or thrown to the ground, just do what I tell you,” he writes. “Don’t argue with me, don’t call me names, don’t tell me that I can’t stop you, don’t say I’m a racist pig, don’t threaten that you’ll sue me and take away my badge. Don’t scream at me that you pay my salary, and don’t even think of aggressively walking towards me. Most field stops are complete in minutes. How difficult is it to cooperate for that long?”

It’s worth noting that arguing with a cop and even verbally abusing one, as well as asking for a badge number, are not illegal actions, though they {have been known to lead to punishment or arrest}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/unlawful-arrests-police_n_5678829.html"">. Dutta goes on to admit that police officers aren’t perfect and some have been known to be corrupt bullies, but he says your best bet is to swallow your pride, stay quiet and submit to any unlawful actions by police.

“But if you believe (or know) that the cop stopping you is violating your rights or is acting like a bully, I guarantee that the situation will not become easier if you show your anger and resentment,” he writes. Dutta goes on to encourage people to seek legal recourse after the fact, rather than protest at the time of the encounter. Of course, {an April 2014 poll}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/blog/2014/04/04/reason-rupe-poll-half-of-americans-think""> found that half of Americans don’t believe cops are held accountable for misconduct, so that likely won’t be much solace to most people.

Dutta also claims that you can simply exercise a number of rights, and decline to submit to an illegal stop or search or question a cop’s legal basis to search you — as if those behaviors will automatically ward off an officer.

The column’s general premise was never in doubt. Of course it’s true that one way to avoid escalating a confrontation with a hot-headed or misbehaving cop is to follow orders or shut up, even if your rights are being trampled.

But it’s concerning that Dutta, an officer who both admits structural problems with police behavior and has called for reforms — including an {overhaul of internal investigations}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/after-christopher-dorners-rampage-how-to-build-community-trust-in-police/2013/02/15/7a6f8482-76c8-11e2-8f84-3e4b513b1a13_story.html""> and the use of officer-mounted cameras to record interactions with citizens — appears so unsympathetic to citizens who are growing increasingly intolerant of police abuse.

As {J.D. Tucille, managing editor of Reason.com, writes}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/blog/2014/08/19/police-officer-if-you-dont-want-to-get-s?"">, the tone of Dutta’s column reveals that he is ignorant of the broader concerns expressed by police critics:

If you have the attitude that you are owed deference and instant obedience by the people around you, and that you are justified in using violence against them if they don’t comply, we already have a problem. That’s especially true if official institutions back you up, which they do.
If you really think that everybody else should “just do what I tell you,” you’re wearing the wrong uniform in the wrong country. And if you really can’t function with some give and take—a few nasty names, a little argument—of the sort that people in all sorts of jobs put up with every damned day, do us all a favor: quit.
Dutta is no doubt correct in claiming that being a cop is a difficult and dangerous job, and that the overwhelming majority of officers are not eager to use their service weapons on anyone, unarmed or not. But in the face of countless instances of officers harassing, abusing and brutalizing suspects far beyond the limits of department policy, it is unfair — and even un-American — to suggest that “not the cops, but the people they stop” are primarily responsible for avoiding this harsh and often illegal treatment.

State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, a Democrat who represents parts of Ferguson, Missouri, was {tear-gassed by police}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/state-senator-ferguson_n_5676766.html""> last week while peacefully protesting the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed African-American teenager shot and killed by a Ferguson police officer.

In a Monday interview with Fox News, Chappelle-Nadal said the persistent use of tear gas prompted her to send multiple tweets the governor’s way.

“The reason why I used profane language is because he has allowed us to get tear-gassed for three days,” she said. “I am one of his senators in his party, and he was at the state fair enjoying a country concert while we were getting teargassed and shot at. And yes, anyone who’s going to get tear-gassed deserves to say a few f-bombs here and there.”

Nixon, amid criticism over his lack of response to the growing protests, {canceled}<hyperlink=""http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article1219594.html""> a scheduled appearance at the Missouri State Fair last week.

Although the {tweets}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/maria-chappelle-nadal-jay-nixon_n_5681744.html""> came before Nixon’s visit to Ferguson last Thursday, Chappelle-Nadal said Monday that he had still not done enough to reach out to Ferguson’s black community.

“He has still yet to come to ground zero,” she told Fox. “He has not spoken to the people who are the victims of this crisis that we’re dealing with now, and that is why I have called him a coward.”

Early Tuesday morning, Amnesty, which {sent a delegation}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/amnesty-international-ferguson-police_n_5685952.html""> to observe the conflicts between protesters and police in Ferguson, Missouri, tweeted that the United States could not tell other nations to improve policing until it improved its own policing record. The Center for Strategic and International Studies responded by saying “your work has saved far fewer lives than American interventions. So. suck it.”

[tweetbegin 501727574138294272 tweetend]

CSIS apologized for the tweet, which has since been deleted.

[tweetbegin 501625488423796736 tweetend]

CSIS spokesman Andrew Schwartz said an intern was to blame for the tweet, while adding that he was “embarrassed about this unfortunate situation and the tweet doesn’t reflect anyone’s views at CSIS or the institution as a whole.”

“It was sent by a CSIS intern who had access to our account for monitoring purposes,” Schwartz said in an email to The Huffington Post. “Apparently he meant to send something reflecting his personal views from his personal Twitter account. I find his views and the way he expressed them to be abhorrent and am taking appropriate action at CSIS to address the matter internally.”

Schwartz also said that he had reached out to Amnesty to personally apologize but had been unsuccessful so far.

Dawn Rennie, an Amnesty spokeswoman, told The Huffington Post that CSIS had apologized and “no offence has been taken on our part.”

Jay Nixon (D) for help.

“I don’t know the name of who the officer is. I’m not conducting either of the investigations,” Nixon said during a press conference Thursday.

He added, however, that he would ultimately like to see the name released.

“I would hope that the appropriate release of that name — with the security around it, if necessary, to make sure that there’s not additional acts of violence — be done as expeditiously as possible,” he stated. “There’s certainly, in my view, methods and abilities to do that. I’m not sure litigation is the best method...but I think it would be an important milestone here to get that out as expeditiously as possible.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri {filed requests}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/michael-brown-shooting_n_5675660.html""> Tuesday to obtain a copy of the police report naming the officer who shot Brown, the unarmed black teenager killed Saturday in Ferguson, Missouri.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson had originally said he would release the officer’s name, but later {decided against it}<hyperlink=""http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2014/08/12/police-say-they-wont-release-name-of-officer-who-shot-killed-michael-brown/"">, citing death threats that he said were coming into the police department.

Nixon declined to comment Thursday when asked whether the incident report should be released.

Anger in this St. Louis suburb has continued to grow over the police department’s handling of the situation, including that it has not yet released additional details about the shooting. Officers have been out in Ferguson in recent nights {dressed in full riot gear}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z2""> and {using tear gas and rubber bullets}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/fourth-night-of-protests-in-ferguson-ends-in-chaos-tear-gas-arrests/"">.

Nixon’s press conference came after he was {heavily criticized on social media}<hyperlink=""http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/08/where-governor-jay-nixon""> Wednesday night for being silent during the protests. He eventually announced he would be canceling his appearance at the Missouri State Fair on Thursday to deal with the situation in Ferguson.

The governor also announced Thursday that he was putting the {Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of security}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/jay-nixon-ferguson-security_n_5679774.html""> in Ferguson, taking the responsibility away from the St. Louis County Police Department.

HuffPost,huff235,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/congress-police-militarization_n_5682286.html,Here’s How Lawmakers Use The War On Terror To Defend Police Militarization,Jennifer Bendery; Ryan Grim,08/15/14,12/23/16,"WASHINGTON — Local police forces need military equipment to fight terrorism, members of Congress argued in June when they successfully beat back legislation that would have restricted the Defense Department’s ability to transfer such weaponry to police departments.

During a late-night debate on an annual defense appropriations bill, Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) tried to attach an amendment to demilitarize the police. Specifically, his measure would have blocked a Defense Department program that provides surplus military equipment — Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles and M16 assault rifles, among other things — to local law enforcement, free of charge.

The House {crushed Grayson’s effort}<hyperlink=""http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll329.xml"">, with 355 votes against it and 62 for it. Ahead of the vote, lawmakers argued that it’s good for local law enforcement to have access to weapons used in war zones. One member warned it would “devastate” police departments if they didn’t have access to such equipment.

“As a past sheriff, we utilized that equipment in a responsible way,” said Rep. Richard Nugent (R-Fla.). “End of the day, you can always find misuses of any equipment that’s given or utilized by law enforcement. It’s the responsibility of those communities to keep that law enforcement agency in check. But to just outright ban the usage of that equipment would devastate local law enforcement agencies across the nation.”

He added, “This is absolutely ludicrous to think the equipment that’s utilized by law enforcement is utilized for any reason other than public safety.”

Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) said he welcomed the use of military equipment in his state, where many people died in the Sept. 11, 2011, terrorist attacks.

“It’s not misused,” he said. “And the law enforcement agencies in the Northeast that benefit from this equipment have used it to make sure that all of our citizens are protected. And not only in the Northeast.”

Grayson pointed out that police aren’t using military weapons for terrorists.

“Where is the terrorism on our streets? Instead, these weapons are being used to arrest barbers and to terrorize the general population,” he said. “In fact, one might venture to say that the weapons are often used by a majority to terrorize a minority.”

Concerns about police militarization were thrust into the forefront this week as local law enforcement in Ferguson, Missouri, rolled out armored vehicles and sprayed rubber bullets and tear gas onto mostly peaceful protesters. People in the St. Louis suburb have gathered in the streets for days to protest {the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/09/ferguson-teen-police-shooting_n_5665305.html"">, by a police officer on Saturday.

One Missouri Democrat who voted against Grayson’s amendment, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, said Friday that he was concerned the measure was overly broad.

“We need to re-evaluate distributing this kind of war equipment to municipalities,” Cleaver said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “And if we are going to do it, we must at least have other requirements, including something as simple as adequate training.”

Legally, the Defense Department program has the ability to pass along all types of military-grade weapons to police departments. Grayson listed them during June’s House debate: grenade launchers, silencers, toxicological agents, chemical agents, biological agents, launch vehicles, guided missiles, ballistic missiles, rockets, torpedoes, bombs, mines and nuclear weapons.

Nugent scoffed at the idea that any of those things would end up in the hands of local police.

“All the helicopters we had in our fleet are all surplus helicopters that flew as far back as Vietnam. Some of the weapons that we have come from the military. We didn’t receive any bombs.”

Hundreds of wide-eyed students stand with their arms raised and palms extended, staring solemnly at the camera. {A hashtag in the Twitter caption reads}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/The_Blackness48/statuses/499714499688300545"">, “Don’t shoot.”

Their pose is a nod to reports of Brown’s posture before he was shot to death. According to eyewitness Dorian Johnson, {Brown had turned to face the officer with his hands in the air}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/michael-brown-friend-shooting_n_5675097.html"">, but was gunned down before he could finish telling the officer he was unarmed.

“I hope people look at the picture and see that the {issue is bigger than Mike Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/krystieyandoli/why-howard-university-students-took-this-photo-in-solidarity"">, bigger than Eric Garner, bigger than so many other young blacks killed by the police,” {Megan Sims, a junior at Howard}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/krystieyandoli/why-howard-university-students-took-this-photo-in-solidarity>, told BuzzFeed. “This issue is about the fact that this country is not post-racial, this country is not just, this country is not free.”

“We had the option to opt out of the picture, but I chose to get involved because this is a very close issue to my heart,” Sims added.

Sims told Mother Jones the group in the photo had originally assembled for a meeting on the freshmen move-in process; they took the photo after realizing “{we needed to respond to the Mike Brown issue}<hyperlink=""http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/08/incredibly-powerful-photo-taken-today-howard-university"">.”

HuffPost,huff238,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/police-militarization-congress_n_5688357.html,Why Congress Is Reluctant To Stop The Military Toys Flowing To Local Cops,Jennifer Bendery; Ryan Grim; Zach Carter,08/18/14,12/23/16,"WASHINGTON — The militarized police response to protests in Ferguson, Missouri, is forcing members of Congress to explain their ongoing support for a Pentagon program that provides local law enforcement with weapons used in war zones — and how, if at all, they plan to change it.

House lawmakers {overwhelmingly voted in June}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/congress-police-militarization_n_5682286.html""> to block legislation by Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) that would have stopped the program, which funnels surplus military weapons to police departments at no charge. The so-called ‘1033 program,’ launched in 1997, has provided billions of dollars in military equipment to local law enforcement agencies around the country. Grayson’s amendment {failed}<hyperlink=""http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll329.xml""> 62 to 355, with Democrats opposing the legislation by a 3-to-1 margin.

The effects of the program have been on full display in Ferguson, where police have responded to mostly peaceful protests over the Aug. 9 murder of Michael Brown with a stunning display of force involving armored vehicles, tear gas, assault rifles and smoke bombs. The result is a nightly scene that looks more like an international war zone than a St. Louis suburb.

The consequences of a militarized police force are varied, as Radley Balko writes in his book, {Rise of the Warrior Cop}<hyperlink=""http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=38395X1020929&site=huffingtonpost.com/politics&xs=1&isjs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRise-Warrior-Cop-Militarization-Americas%2Fdp%2F1610392116%3Ftag%3Dthehuffingtop-20&xguid=ee13eb4ba2fbf3abefb866d0eb874fd7&xuuid=59474f508fb562dfbdf7dbfb4cf58156&xsessid=4b580af5cd001791a3bd3e67235c5061&xcreo=0&xed=0&sref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2014%2F08%2F18%2Fpolice-militarization-congress_n_5688357.html&xtz=300"">. A person’s home is no longer a place of sanctuary, the Fourth Amendment is compromised, and local police are conditioned to see the citizens in their own communities as the enemy. Notably, in Ferguson, {the protests were far less contentious}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/with-highway-patrol-hugs-and-kisses-replace-tear-gas-in-ferguson/""> on Thursday night, when the police weren’t out in riot gear.

Yet while lawmakers have decried the excessive police response in Ferguson, a number of members told The Huffington Post they don’t expect Congress to do much to rein in the Pentagon program. That’s not so much because of intense lobbying from the defense industry, they said, but more because local police forces say they benefit from the free gear.

“I can’t speak for others, but my guess is that most people think police don’t get enough funding/support at the local level,” said one House Democrat who voted against Grayson’s amendment. “So if the Feds want to give cops stuff for free, go for it.”

“The argument made is that everyone wants their community to ‘be prepared’ with the best equipment, in the event they need it,” said another House Democrat, who also voted against the amendment. “Hard to say ‘no’ to your local police chief when they are explaining to you how this equipment could help and in what type of situation.”

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), who spoke at a community gathering in Ferguson last week and urged faith leaders to help end the violence, said he still supports military weapons being transferred to police departments, though there may need to be more oversight of the program.

“We need to re-evaluate distributing this kind of war equipment to municipalities,” Cleaver said. “And if we are going to do it, we must at least have other requirements, including something as simple as adequate training.”

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a leading voice for progressives, says it’s time to reassess the way the program is carried out, not end it altogether.

“The Leader supports examining the overall federal effort of giving military-type equipment to local police departments,” said a Pelosi spokeswoman. “Cutting off all funding — like the Grayson amendment — is a blunt instrument, but oversight and appropriate scale of funding for such programs need to be examined.”

But Grayson’s legislation wouldn’t have cut off all funding for the Pentagon program — {instead, it would have banned funding for a specific set of heavy-duty gear}<hyperlink=""https://beta.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/918/text?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5b%22H.R.+4870%22%5d%7d"">, including grenade launchers, toxicological agents and drones, all of which may legally be transferred to police departments under current law.

Thirty-five members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus voted against Grayson’s amendment, though some, like Rep. Andre Carson (D-Ind.), have criticized police militarization in the wake of the events in Ferguson.

“Our nation has a rich history of peaceful protests to advance civil and human rights,” said Carson, who is a former law enforcement officer. “These voices are too valuable to be silenced by violence and the use of unnecessary and excessive force.”

Carson spokeswoman Jessica Gail said the congressman doesn’t oppose the Pentagon program outright, since “some of the equipment transferred from the DOD has a legitimate law enforcement purpose.” But she said Carson thinks the program deserves “additional scrutiny” to make sure that police officers are using military equipment appropriately.

The sizable opposition from progressives to what appears to be a progressive amendment had a number of root causes, one plugged-in aide to a caucus member told HuffPost. Much of it can be overcome with organizing. According to the aide, the debate and vote came late at night and the caucus never sent out a note to members advising them how to vote. And no outside groups working on the issue lobbied members of Congress.

“We do hundreds of these things on appropriations bills and, sadly, staff and Members often times aren’t on top of things,” the aide said. “As a staffer you have to make vote recommendations on the fly, often with very little information. When there aren’t outside groups lobbying, it’s even harder.”

Once those organizing hurdles are overcome, the aide predicted, support will increase among natural allies. But the politics will still be difficult, as the defense industry and local police can serve as extremely effective lobbyists. “Outside of the good work [Georgia Rep.] Hank Johnson and FCNL have been doing, this issue hasn’t gotten a lot of play up on the Hill,” the aide added. {The Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) is a Quaker group}<hyperlink=""http://fcnl.org/""> that lobbies against militarization and has worked with Johnson, who {plans to introduce a bill in the House}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/police-militarization-bill_n_5679707.html""> to address the issue.

In the Senate, meanwhile, Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) {issued a statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.levin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/levin-statement-on-transfer-of-military-equipment-to-police-agencies/?section=alltypes""> on Friday vowing to review the program, but stopped short of calling for any actual reforms.

“Congress established this program out of real concern that local law enforcement agencies were literally outgunned by drug criminals,” Levin said. “We intended this equipment to keep police officers and their communities safe from heavily armed drug gangs and terrorist incidents. Before the defense authorization bill comes to the Senate floor, we will review this program to determine if equipment provided by the Defense Department is being used as intended.”

Although the effects of the 1033 program have been {documented}<hyperlink=""http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=38395X1020929&site=huffingtonpost.com/politics&xs=1&isjs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRise-Warrior-Cop-Militarization-Americas%2Fdp%2F1610392116%3Ftag%3Dthehuffingtop-20&xguid=ee13eb4ba2fbf3abefb866d0eb874fd7&xuuid=59474f508fb562dfbdf7dbfb4cf58156&xsessid=4b580af5cd001791a3bd3e67235c5061&xcreo=0&xed=0&sref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2014%2F08%2F18%2Fpolice-militarization-congress_n_5688357.html&xtz=300""> for {years}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=0"">, many lawmakers don’t know much about it. Former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), a longtime critic of bloated defense budgets, told HuffPost he was “not familiar” with it, and a progressive House aide said the lack of lobbying around the program made it easier for lawmakers to defer to their local police.

Members of Congress have justified the program by saying police departments need to be prepared to fight terrorism. “There could be a terrorist threat with people with high-cartridge ammunition and weaponry, where [police] might need to respond with some type of, something like that, although the national guard would be called out,” Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) said Friday on MSNBC.

But Cohen was one of three lawmakers who wrote to House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) last week urging him to hold a hearing to examine how much local law enforcement really needs access to military gear.

Wartime weapons should not be used “against our own citizens when there is civil unrest and civil protest,” Cohen said. “Even if it got to the point where it did where they are breaking some glass, that’s no reason to come with the amount of force and appearance that was brought by the police in Ferguson.”

A Goodlatte spokeswoman said the congressman supports the investigation into Michael Brown’s death, but wouldn’t comment on the Pentagon program.

A {petition on the White House website}<hyperlink=""https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/remove-program-1033-which-gives-unused-military-equipment-police-departments-across-united-states/FKffCPs3""> calling for an end to the program had nearly 500 signatures as of Monday afternoon. If the petition collects 100,000 signatures by Sept. 13, the White House will issue a response.

Police conducted an “investigative stop” in the Newton area around 8:20 p.m., according to a news release from the LAPD. “During the stop a struggle ensued, which {resulted in an officer-involved-shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/56791"">. It is unknown if the suspect has any gang affiliations,” the release continues. “The suspect was transported to a local hospital and after lifesaving efforts he succumbed to his injuries.”

A woman claiming to be the deceased man’s mother called KTLA and identified the man as Ezell Ford. Tritobia Ford said her son was lying on the ground and complying with the officers when {he was shot three times}<hyperlink=""http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/"">.

An unnamed man who claimed to be Ezell Ford’s cousin also spoke with KTLA.

“They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division, knows that — that this child has mental problems,” he said. “The excessive force … there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in the back while he’s laying down? No. Then when the mom comes, they don’t try to console her … they pull the billy clubs out.”

Officer Jane Kim, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department, said {a vigil had been scheduled}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/12/lapd-shooting-ezell-ford/13985607/""> for Tuesday night in response to the incident, according to USA Today.

No officers were injured during the incident, according to the LAPD. The Force Investigation Division is set to investigate.

The shooting comes just days after the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. {Brown was fatally shot by a police officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html""> in the St. Louis suburb on Saturday, Aug. 9. He was unarmed. Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Brown before the shooting occurred, claimed Brown was retreating from the officer with his hands up when he was shot, CNN reported. Ferguson police, however, say a “physical confrontation” occurred prior to this.

Looting and unrest has rocked the neighborhood in the {days following Brown’s death}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Reports-Ferguson-protests-turn-violent-270697451.html"">. At least four people, including two police officers, have been hurt and 47 arrested in the aftermath of the shooting, according to St. Louis’ KMOV.

HuffPost,huff240,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/trayvon-martin-michael-brown_n_5689870.html,Trayvon Martin’s Mother Pens Heartbreaking Letter To Michael Brown’s Family,Christina Wilkie,08/18/14,12/23/16,"WASHINGTON - Sybrina Fulton, the mother of teenaged shooting victim Trayvon Martin, has written a heartbreaking {letter}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3136685/travyon-sybrina-fulton-ferguson/""> to the family of Michael Brown, the unarmed teenager who was shot and killed by a Ferguson, Missouri police officer earlier this month.

Published Monday by Time magazine, Fulton’s letter draws on her experience following the 2012 shooting of her son, 17 at the time, by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman. Tried for manslaughter, Zimmerman was acquitted by a jury, under Florida’s controversial “Stand Your Ground” law.

In her letter to the Brown family, Fulton offers wise counsel, both about how to deal with being in the spotlight, and how to honor your child’s memory.

“You will ... hear character assassinations about Michael which I am certain you already have. This will incense and insult you. All of this will happen before and continue long after you have had the chance to lay your son to rest,” Fulton writes. “I know this because I lived and continue to live this.”

The parallels that Fulton sees between the two families serve to make her letter even more meaningful. “No one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed,” she writes.

In the wake of Brown’s shooting, Ferguson police released photos they claim showed the teenager threatening a store owner, but they later admitted the store incident had no connection to Brown’s fatal shooting. On Monday, a county coroner’s report alleged that Brown had marijuana in his system when he died. Still, the police have yet to fully explain the circumstances leading up to Brown’s death.

In her letter, Fulton advises the Browns, “Honor your son and his life, not the circumstances of his alleged transgressions.”

“But know this: neither of their lives shall be in vain. The galvanizations of our communities must be continued beyond the tragedies. ... We will bond, continue our fights for justice, and make them remember our children in an appropriate light.”
