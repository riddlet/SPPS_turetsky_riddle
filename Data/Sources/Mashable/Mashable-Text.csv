At night, the media sometimes appear to outnumber protestors near police lines.
As reporters from around the world descend on the small town, the inevitable question has emerged — is the media becoming too big a part of the very story it is covering?
It is a particularly salient inquiry as stunning photos and videos emerging from Ferguson have helped to ignite debates about police brutality, the militarization of local authorities and a range of issues concerning race, class and the U.S. justice system.
The media has loomed large in the story in Ferguson from the early days of the protests. As {David Carr of The New York Times}<hyperlink=” http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/business/media/view-of-ferguson-thrust-michael-brown-shooting-to-national-attention.html?_r=1”> pointed out in his column on Ferguson, much of the coverage seemed to ramp up after the arrests of Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly. The use of tear gas on an Al Jazeera America news crew also drew attention that the police had begun to indiscriminately target bystanders.
Since then, journalists have piled into Ferguson. Some have already noticed just how many cameras had lined up alongside protestors and police.

Mashable made the decision to send down two reporters to cover the unrest. One of them, Director of News video Ashley Codianni, has felt first-hand the pull of wanting to cover the story with the push of realizing how much media is already there.
""The press is a third player in this situation that is not helping,"" she said.
""At one point, the ratio of reporters to protestors was so minimal that you almost wondered if we were creating more hysteria,"" she said. ""Three protestors would do something, they would raise their hands or throw a water bottle and the entire press scrum would run into the street to try to capture that moment.""
Codianni also noted that on Monday night, a protestor pleaded with the media not to do anything to escalate the situation.
[tweetbegin 501568884722634752 tweetend]
Blowback from the media's coverage began to build on Tuesday morning after {media analyst Noah Rothman}<hyperlink=” http://hotair.com/archives/2014/08/19/is-the-press-in-ferguson-behaving-irresponsibly/”> published a post detailing that ""the press is no longer serving as objective chroniclers of the proceedings.""
""In many ways, the media appears to believe that it is an active participant in the events in Missouri. What’s more, the press appears to be relishing this role,"" he wrote.
The Washington Post's {Dylan Byers}<hyperlink=” http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/has-the-media-gone-too-far-in-ferguson-194166”> aggregated the post, and the debate began.
Byers took some flak for his post, particularly from The Intercept's editor in chief John Cook.
[tweetbegin 501752803787014144 tweetend]
A tweet from New York Magazine columnist Annie Lowrey took the other side of the debate, arguing that more coverage is better than less.
[tweetbegin 501743883530010624 tweetend]
The town's residents may also be getting tired of the media's involvement. Codianni said that multiple people had come by the media staging area, telling journalists to go home. Protesters also hurled rocks at MSNBC's Chris Hayes.’
Fox News reporter Steve Harrigan was confronted by a protestor after calling the evening's unrest ""child's play.""
Other journalists have also noted that local residents understand the positive impact that the media have had.
[tweetbegin 501755111220457472 tweetend]
At this point, there is no risk of under-covering the situation. Photos out of Ferguson have been the lead of websites, newspapers and television coverage for days. For better or worse, Ferguson coverage is unlikely to wane in the coming days.
Asking questions about media coverage is not about blame. There is no one journalist to point to as an example of what not to do. Most if not all journalists seem to be abiding by police requests and attempting to do their job. The risk is when the good intentions of individual journalists end up collectively amping up the situation.
Tuesday night, with a noticeable media presence, {authorities arrested 78 people}<hyperlink=” http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/78-arrested-overnight-most-missouri-arrest-records-show-n184036”>, the most in one night since the unrest began.

Police and about 200 protesters clashed in Ferguson, Missouri, late Friday after another tense day in the St. Louis suburb, a day that included authorities identifying the officer who fatally shot Brown on Aug. 9. At the same news conference in which officer Darren Wilson was named, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released documents alleging that Brown stole a $48.99 box of cigars from a convenience store called {}<hyperlink=”http://www.krdo.com/news/ferguson-market-asks-not-to-become-a-target/27525080”>, then strong-armed a man on his way out.
Just before midnight, some in what had been a large and rowdy but mostly well-behaved crowd broke into that same small store, and began looting it, according to Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson. Some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Johnson said. One officer was hurt, but details on the injury were not immediately available. Johnson added that police backed off to try and ease the tension. He believes looting may have spread to a couple of nearby stores. No arrests were made.

""We had to evaluate the security of the officers there and also the rioters,"" Johnson said. ""We just felt it was better to move back.""
Meanwhile, peaceful protesters yelled at the aggressors to stop what they were doing. About a dozen people eventually blocked off the front of the convenience store to help protect it. Andy Banker, a local news reporter, reported that the St. Louis police department only documented the looting five hours after the break-in, and that the store owners are ""furious"" as a result.

Watch live footage of the aftermath of the looting via local television station KMOV's live stream, here:
Brown's death had previously ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Gov. Jay Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But Friday night marked a resurgence of the unrest that had momentarily abated.
Nixon on Thursday appointed Johnson to take over security after concerns were raised about how local police had used tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters earlier in the week. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly.
Jackson's decision to spell out the allegations that Brown committed the robbery, and his releasing of surveillance video, angered attorneys for Brown's family and many in the community, including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay. Earlier Friday night, the Democratic congressman from Missouri took a bullhorn and told protesters, ""They have attempted to taint the investigation. They are trying to influence a jury pool by the stunt they pulled today.""
Family attorney Daryl Parks acknowledged that the man shown in the surveillance footage ""appears to be"" Brown. But he and others said Brown's family was blindsided by the allegations and release of the footage. They said that even if it was Brown, the crime didn't justify the shooting of a teen after he put up his hands in surrender to the officer, as witnesses allege.
Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said police ""are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style"" killing. Crump also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.
The surveillance video appears to show a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white t-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store's door. A police report alleges that Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter, and ""forcefully pushed him back"" into a display rack.
Police said they found evidence of the stolen merchandise on Brown's body.
Brown's family and supporters had been pushing for release of the officer's name. Wilson is a six-year police veteran — two in neighboring Jennings and four in Ferguson — and had no previous complaints filed against him, Jackson said.
The police chief described Wilson as ""a gentle, quiet man"" who had been ""an excellent officer."" Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation of the shooting wraps up.
St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley on Friday asked Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster to take over the case, saying he did not believe McCulloch could be objective. Koster said Missouri law does not allow it unless McCulloch opts out. McCulloch spokesperson Ed Magee said McCulloch has no plans to surrender the case.
Also on Friday, the U.S. Justice Department confirmed in a statement that FBI agents had conducted several interviews with witnesses as part of a civil-rights investigation into Brown's death. In the days ahead, the agents planned to canvass the neighborhood where the shooting happened, seeking more information, the statement said.",4,1800,NA,“Ferguson Market and Liquor” hyperlink no longer active.

This isn't a war zone in eastern Ukraine. This was last night on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri.
Civilians in Ferguson have been clashing with police off and on since Sunday, shortly after the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed by a police officer. They've chanted ""hands up, don't shoot"" as police, who are outfitted in riot gear and armed to the teeth, have trained their weapons on them.
But things {took a dramatic turn on Wednesday evening}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/13/reporters-ferguson-swat-protests/#Ze7Usa3UDmqw”> as the unrest turned increasingly chaotic.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that about 10 people had been arrested, including St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been chronicling the protests on social media.
Local authorities also arrested two journalists: Washington Post's Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly, both of whom have been steadfast in tweeting and have become two incredibly reliable sources for this story. Once released, Reilly detailed the arrest:

For days, journalists have been on the ground in Ferguson, documenting the terror that has taken over this St. Louis neighborhood. But they've had trouble getting the story even before last night. Police have repeatedly told reporters to get out of the way, and the FAA on Wednesday granted a request to ban flights over the area, including news helicopters.
Residents of Ferguson have complained about the excessive force of police there. However, County Police Chief Jon Belmar said his officers have responded with ""an incredible amount of restraint,"" as they've been the targets of rocks, bottles and gunshots, with two dozen patrol vehicles being destroyed.
At the center of the unrest is racial tension — Ferguson is a predominately black neighborhood, and a police officer killed Brown. Although Ferguson's police chief has said improving race relations is ""the top priority,"" reporters on the ground say peaceful, solution-oriented dialogue is nowhere to be found on the streets.
If Ferguson wasn't ""mainstream"" already, it hit that point last night, {topping Twitter's national trends}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-social-media/#jBwozrfoD8qA”> for the first time. Police attempted to censor the information coming out of Ferguson, but instead, they only inflamed the story and created one of the most shareable, debatable moments this year.
UPDATE: Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon issued a statement on the events of last night in Ferguson:
“The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans. While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.
“I have been closely monitoring the situation and will continue to be in communication with local leaders, and I will be in north St. Louis County Thursday. As Governor, I am committed to ensuring the pain of last weekend’s tragedy does not continue to be compounded by this ongoing crisis. Once again, I ask that members of the community demonstrate patience and calm while the investigation continues, and I urge law enforcement agencies to keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press during this difficult time.”",6,3200,NA,NA

The discontent had been simmering for days on social media — partly because those pictures cropping up on Twitter and (to a lesser extent) Facebook of police in Iraq-style fatigues and Army-style entourages were getting harder and harder to ignore. Difficult questions floated to the surface of the American conscience. Was this police response happening in America, or a Middle East war zone, or 1968, or all of the above?

The reason? Just watch for yourself, moments before Lowery is arrested in a McDonalds where he was recharging his phone and using the Wifi. Police ordered him and other patrons out, for no apparent reason; then when they asked the all important question ""why,"" this interaction happened.
Lowery was arrested at that point — as was Reilly, whom you can see in the background, also trying to charge his phone. What were they arrested for? We don't know. There is, the reporters discovered when they were released from the holding cell a few hours later, no arrest sheet for their incarceration. Curious, that.

French's level-headed, just-the-facts Vines and tweets from the ground have helped make him a social media superstar. At time of writing he's being held in jail for 24 hours on a vague and unexplained ""unlawful assembly"" charge.

But don't expect U.S. military veterans to condone what has been going on in Ferguson— in fact, some of the most vocal critics of the police tactics have been former soldiers.
In general, criticisms by veterans fell into two categories: problems with how individual officers in Ferguson carried themselves, and problems with the scale of the crowd control operation.
Individual officers, they said, appeared far too aggressive.
""You just see guys running around pointing their weapons at people who are obviously not a threat,"" Josh Weinberg, a U.S. army veteran who spent time in Afghanistan, told Mashable.
He focused on a few images that have showed an officer sitting on top of an armored vehicle, peering through the scope of a long-range weapon.
[tweetbegin 499963182954610688 tweetend]
“If that guy really thought he was in danger…then he wouldn’t be sitting up there totally uncovered,"" Weinberg, who now works at the Truman Project, a national security think tank, said. ""Again, where is the threat?""
Not only did veterans think officers were being overly aggressive, but they said the police didn't seem to understand how their show of force could exacerbate tensions.
[tweetbegin 499703348153810946 tweetend]
“We look at it from the perspective of how effective you’re going to be versus how much force protection you’re going to have,"" Joshua Prentice, a U.S. veteran of the war in Afghanistan, told Mashable.
The more weaponry and armor a soldier has, the more protected they seemingly are. But the more weaponry and armor they strap on, the more likely citizens are to feel threatened.
[tweetbegin 499728733830676480 tweetend]
“When you show up with sniper rifles, M-4 rifles with scopes on them and armored vehicles, all you’re trying to do is assert your control,"" Prentice said.
The second problem that veterans pointed to was the size of the police operation in Ferguson.
The St. Louis County Police Department has been in charge in Ferguson since the shooting, helping local officers quell crowds of protesters. But Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ordered them out of the city on Thursday, handing authority to the state's highway patrol after days of criticism of what seemed like the use of excessive force.
Prentice said that overreaction by police—in terms of both weaponry and the sheer number of officers—make it hard for residents to see them as anything but an ""occupying force,"" even if he thinks that term has been somewhat overplayed.
Police forces across the U.S. have been outfitted with leftover military hardware and weaponry as America's operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have wound down over the past several years.
Weinberg doesn't object to police getting military equipment but he said that a certain level of training needs to come with the weaponry.
“What you really need to talk about is, 'are those guys ready to use it?'"" Weinberg said. “They could've kept all that shit in the garage for this one.”",1,1300,NA,NA

[tweetbegin 500046501477769216 tweetend]
It was a lesson in how a department sets the tone as it polices — either as an occupying force fighting an enemy, as was seen Wednesday night through a haze of tear gas, or as members of a community in crisis.
Though ""no justice, no peace"" remained the protesters' mantra, tensions ran much cooler than they had the night before. Interactions between police and protesters appeared respectful.
While protests had started peacefully in daylight Wednesday, a heavily-armed SWAT presence quickly descended, training military rifles on demonstrators from the tops of armored vehicles in a scene that looked like a city under military occupation.
[tweetbegin 500060209931628545 tweetend]
As night fell, the situation deteriorated swiftly as officers tried to disperse the crowd. Projectiles were thrown, and police came down hard on the protestors of Ferguson, firing tear gas, rubber bullets and flash grenades well into the night and targeting the media, all as the world watched on social media.
By contrast, on Thursday, an Instagram video showed Capt. Johnson approaching a demonstrator with a bullhorn — only to make sure he knew which way the march was going. This was followed by a civil exchange in which the man said he and his group were going to the QuickTrip before ending the march.
Lowery also tweeted that Capt. Johnson said ""media staging areas"" would be provided for reporters covering the events, a night-and-day difference from the media-under-siege pictures that emerged from the town the previous night.

Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol said at a press conference early Tuesday morning.Johnson criticized ""violent agitators"" and ""criminals"" for creating a disturbance among peaceful protesters by firing shots, and throwing bottles and molotov cocktails. He added that there were ""numerous reports"" of shots fired -- including ""heavy gunfire"" in Canfield -- and that two fires occurred, with one at an unoccupied residence and one at a business.""These are not acts of protests, but acts of violent criminals,"" Johnson said at the police command center at W. Florissant Avenue and Lucas-Hunt Road. He also emphasized that ""not a single bullet [was] fired by officers despite coming under heavy attack.""As of 2 a.m., local time, 31 people were arrested, some of whom were from as far away as New York City and California, Johnson said. He encouraged peaceful protesters to demonstrate during the daytime for their safety, and so police can identify and arrest ""violent agitators"" who come out at night. Johnson said the peaceful protesters should not be ""cover"" for those who commit dangerous acts. ""There is a dangerous dynamic in the night,"" he said. Johnson also asked journalists at the scene not to ""glamorize the acts of criminals,"" and criticized media for failing to cooperate with local law enforcement. Members of the media had to be repeatedly asked to return to sidewalks and clear the roads, he said, adding that police ""need to have that area cleared"" for everyone's safety. - AL

Tear gas and flash bangs in Ferguson
12:15 a.m. ET: Police finally cracked down on the protests just after 11 p.m. local time, launching a barrage of smoke bombs, tear gas and flash bangs at a crowd.
The action came after police on a megaphone repeatedly warned protesters to get out of the QuikTrip area -- a spot that's been deemed off limits. Vice News's Tim Pool said on his livestream that the protesters had thrown items into the street.

Brown family attorneys address autopsy report
11 a.m. ET: Michael Brown did not suffer when he was fatally wounded in his encounter with Ferguson police, an attorney for the 18-year-old's family said Monday morning.
The attorneys held a press conference to address the findings of a preliminary autopsy report.
That autopsy revealed, attorneys said, that Michael Brown was shot at least six times, with the ""kill shot"" entering Brown's head at its apex. That caused an immediate loss of consciousness, said Dr. Michael Baden, a pathologist who performed a private autopsy for Brown's family.
""We believe that given those kinds of facts, this officer should have been arrested,"" said attorney Daryl Parks.
[tweetbegin 501382089498185728 tweetend]
Shawn Parcells, a forensic pathologist who worked with Baden on the autopsy, explained how two of the bullets may have exited and re-entered Brown's body. One bullet, he said, may have entered, exited, entered and exited again.
They are consistent with Brown moving either toward or away from the officer at the time he was shot. Pathologists couldn't say whether Brown was attacking the officer, surrendering with his hands up or defending himself.
[tweetbegin 501384392556949505 tweetend]
Baden added that there were no signs of a struggle. Brown's face had some abrasions on it, he said, but they were likely caused by its impact with the ground after he was shot.
He took one question from a member of the public, who asked if the wounds were survivable. ""All of these gunshots wounds were survivable -- except for the one on top of the head,"" Dr. Baden said.
""Then why hasn't this officer been arrested?"" the woman asked.
That, for better or for worse, is not a question of forensic science, Baden answered.
That's a question that residents of Ferguson, the St. Louis suburb that's been at the center of protests this week, want to know. Some of them were ""glued"" to the news conference, watching on a TV at the local McDonald's, as captured by Los Angeles Times reporter Matt Pearce. - BR

“You don’t want to be here after sundown,” she added.
Like many people in Ferguson, Gordon has been on this stretch of road near the intersection of Ferguson Avenue and West Florissant Avenue every day of these protests. However, unlike most people in this crowd of hundreds, Gordon is nearing 73 years of age.
With a handicap hangtag tied around her neck in a makeshift necklace, Gordon can barely walk without the help of Ferguson resident Denise Little. As the two made their way down the main drag, hand in hand, they could have easily passed for close family or dearest of friends. But when I asked if Gordon was Little’s mother, they both smiled warmly.
“We just met,” Little said. “She looked like she needed help.”
[tweetbegin 501542961990336512 tweetend]
In the hours dwindling down to sunset, Florissant Avenue is filled with people like this. They come from all corners of St. Louis — from around the corner in Ferguson, to the south end of the city — to peacefully protest the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.
Children carry hand-drawn pictures; others chant while holding their hands in the air. A few volunteers from local churches hand out much-needed bottles of water. The demonstrators stay on sidewalks. They say prayers with one another. Some even tell police officers here to have a nice evening, to which the officers nod their heads and genuinely smile in return.
However, as Gordon and Little note, things look “very different” on Florissant Avenue when the sun goes down.
Within the span of an hour or so, the older demonstrators return home as a helicopter circles low overhead, shining a bright spotlight across the asphalt. Many of the people left are younger — some in their 20s, carrying children of their own. The protesters start to grow more wary of their surroundings.
Even the slightest of movements by a police officer jars them. They look over their shoulders while giving interviews in front of the dozens of television cameras pushed in their faces. They put paper masks over their children’s faces to protect them from what’s to come.
But most of all, they are angry. They are defensive. Many of them say they feel marginalized.
One 21-year-old man, who refused to give his name, said he asked an officer earlier in the evening what he tells his kids about Ferguson when he gets home at night. He said the officer laughed at him.
“This man laughed in my face like this is a joke,” he said.
“A young man lost his life. Is that a joke?”
Another girl, 15, stood at the corner of the intersection with two friends. Even though they had school the next morning, they were out here tonight just like every other. “Are you scared?” I asked, to which the girl nodded before saying, “Yes. It’s crazy out here.” The three teenagers also said Brown and the protests were all they could talk about in the school hallways. It consumes the community. (Schools in the Ferguson-Florissant School District itself will stay closed this week.)
'Be careful out here'
After a violent Sunday night in Ferguson, tensions ran deep on a humid Monday evening.
“Just give it about 15 minutes or so,” one woman said as she made her way home. “Be careful out here,” she warned.
Crowds moved past the torched QuikTrip station and headed to the top of the hill near a McDonald’s, where they have been gathering for days. However, the restaurant closed on Monday morning after “someone from corporate came in,” a police officer told Mashable. Now, the protesters shuffled into a large crowd in the middle of the south side of the intersection.
Outspoken leaders carrying megaphones became the unofficial spokesmen for the crowd. One was wearing prisoner garb, while another man was dressed in a fake cop uniform with a hat that read “murder police.” They shouted on behalf of the protesters and also shouted instructions at them, telling them to remain calm while demanding they keep moving, per police orders.
Then, right on schedule, the entire crowd gasped and many screamed — this time it wasn’t a chant, but rather out of true terror — “Don’t shoot!”
Just over the hill at Ferguson Avenue rolled in armored police tanks, and officers with shields formed a column in front in a standoff. As a few angry protesters threw a couple of water bottles in the direction of the police, the officers slid on their gas masks, and an ear-splitting alarm sounded through the streets. A voice came over a loudspeaker, demanding the protesters disperse.
It was chaos for a half hour as people who were wearing T-shirts that said ""peacekeepers"" struggled to keep protesters — and members of the press — on the sidewalk. Then, a loud pop rang out from the other end of the street near QuikTrip. As tear gas rose through the air, a crowd that had been milling around at the other end of Florissant Avenue started running toward the intersection where the bigger group was still standing.
Some fell in front of the media tents, scratching at their burning eyes. Members of Amnesty International, most of whom arrived in Ferguson on Monday to assist demonstrators, helped wash out their eyes and get them back on their feet. Other protesters carried spray bottles of milk and Mylanta, offering it to those who were caught in the gas.

'What's the point?'
By this time, most members of the press had moved behind police barricades and into a parking lot that was unofficially deemed a safe zone. Some were packing it up because it seemed as though the the tear gas had thinned out the crowd. The street was completely empty.
It was relatively peaceful here until an armored car sped into the street and slammed its brakes in front of the media. The doors flew open, and at least a half dozen armed guards jumped out of the truck and stood, looking at everyone in a silent warning.
“Is this necessary?” One of the peacekeepers, who was now behind the press barricade with some other demonstrators who were seeking refuge there as well, shouted through this megaphone. “What’s the point?”
And perhaps those words perfectly sum up Monday evening in Ferguson. The sudden and drastic change in attitude of the police seemed unprovoked. It felt as though they were almost toying with the protesters, sending in tanks and speeding up and down the main street in SUVs. It was all pointless.
Although the curfew had been lifted, police still seemed eager to clear out the entire area by midnight, repeatedly threatening to arrest people who weren’t on sidewalks or were carrying signs and not moving enough around the area. When the sting of tear gas rolled in through the entire area, including the media center, it choked those caught off-guard, sending hundreds running in panic.
By 2 a.m., {at least 31 people had been arrested}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/18/ferguson-live-updates/#N3ozbhLfPaqc”>, said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol. He blamed ""violent agitators"" and ""criminals"" for shooting at least two people in the area and throwing Molotov cocktails. The police did not fire bullets, he said.
Johnson urged protesters to demonstrate during the day and stay clear of the area at night.
Most of the protesters had left Florissant Avenue before midnight on Monday. Peacekeepers ushered people out of the middle of the street.
“Go home,” one woman peacekeeper said. “We can fight tomorrow.”",1,1400,NA,NA

Police hold press conference in Ferguson: 47 people arrested
3:15 a.m. ET: As a night of peaceful protests once again ended in disarray, 47 people were arrested overnight between 8 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. in Ferguson, Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol said in a press conference early Wednesday morning. It was in comparison to 31 arrests in the same time period yesterday.
Ferguson was calm overnight until just before midnight when protesters began throwing glass and plastic bottles at police officers, Johnson said.
[tweetbegin 501991558141726720 tweetend]
The police did not use smoke bombs or tear gas this time, though some officers did use pepper spray, Johnson said. Again, no bullets were fired by the police.
Johnson gave credit to a group of volunteers, clergy and activists who came out to urge peace and influence younger protesters. ""I believe there was a turning point tonight,"" Johnson said.
Two loaded guns were seized from a vehicle that was identified as a threat to police at 8:30 p.m. Another loaded gun was retrieved from a different incident. - JR

At least 10 people reportedly detained outside of McDonald's restaurant
1:45 a.m. ET: Tensions were running high in the parking lot of a 24-hour McDonald's restaurant on W. Florissant Avenue, with 10 people reportedly detained.
Vice News confirmed a legal observer from the National Lawyer's Guild was arrested during the scuffle. The observer was wearing an official's bright green cap.
{Local news station KMOV}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/KMOV”> reported the chaos was caused by protesters throwing objects at police. The confrontation came after an injured protester had been loaded into an ambulance, as the crowd screamed ""she's pregnant.""
Media were asked to leave to area by authorities and move on to a briefing area outside Target. They were then asked to move down another street. A press conference is expected this morning, but a time has not been confirmed. - JR

Peaceful protests derailed after water bottles thrown; at least 1 arrest reportedly made
1 a.m. ET: Tensions in Ferguson escalated just before 1 a.m. ET, derailing the evening's mostly peaceful protests, after water bottles were thrown. At least one arrest was reportedly made.Police formed a line, and began chasing a group running north on W. Florissant, after water bottles were thrown. An officer spoke through a bullhorn, telling protesters to stop throwing objects and ""disperse immediately.""

Police, some protesters wary of heavy media presence in Ferguson
FERGUSON, Mo., 11:30 p.m. ET -- ""We ready, we ready, we ready for y'all,"" the crowd sang in perfect unison as they walked down Florissant Ave. on Tuesday night.There are more people in Ferguson Tuesday night, and cops relocated the press area from the top of the hill at W. Florissant Avenue and Ferguson Avenue, to a darker corner in front of the now-dilapidated QT. While some protesters are still willing to speak to media, many of them are weary of the presence of journalists. And for good reason. Police have repeatedly threatened to arrest protesters if they don't keep moving, or step off the sidewalk and into the streets. The problem is the sheer amount of media, here -- I even spotted a team of young students wearing yellow shirts that said Missouri School of Journalism -- pushing protesters into the streets. Police shout, and protesters blame reporters clamoring for the perfect photo or headline quote.
[tweetbegin 501900620602023936 tweetend]
Police tonight are also focused on media. They have posted themselves near the press corral, partly for safety, but mostly for show of force (something we also saw first-hand on Monday night).
It's not to say that protesters are anti-media. In fact, some said they genuinely believe things would be worse in Ferguson if the world's attention wasn't on the city. ""We need you here,"" said Chrystal Williams, 41. ""Everyone needs to see this."" – AW[tweetbegin 501939039810113536 tweetend]

Sundown: Armored trucks roll in
9 p.m. ET -- The sun is setting on Ferguson and, reportedly earlier than in nights past, armored police trucks are rolling in.
[tweetbegin 501892747918581761 tweetend]
Though images from the scene still depict a calm event with pretty of kids present, the trucks are setting up in parking lots around the area, to the dismay of protesters gathered there.
[tweetbegin 501893132045516800 tweetend]
The sight of heavily armored officers, trucks, and the barking of police dogs has typically had the effect of escalating violence at the protests, rather than disarming it. It has been the point at which peaceful protests transform into a clash between police, media, those there to cause trouble, and the citizen peacekeepers who remain in the fray to try and keep it calm.
It's beginning to appear as if tonight may be no different. – KSD
Demonstrations resume in Ferguson
8 p.m. ET -- Community members have resumed marching on Florissant Ave. in Ferguson, as they have nightly since Michael Brown was shot.
Some, including Twitter co-founder and St. Louis native Jack Dorsey, are once again handing out roses in memory of the teen. There have been reports of security checkpoints at either end of the street, which police apparently closed to traffic for about two miles.

Crowds continued to gather at Riverview Blvd. and McLaran Ave. in north St. Louis, where a 23-year-old man was shot by police earlier today. That's about 2.5 miles from the protests in Ferguson.
The familiar ""don't shoot"" refrain had been adjusted by some to an angrier ""Hands up, shoot back,"" in light of the latest officer-involved shooting in the area.
That and the dual demonstrations left many wondering what would happen as violence bubbles up after dark. – KSD
Protesters demand murder charge for Officer Darren Wilson
CLAYTON, Missouri, 6:30 p.m. ET -- The Ferguson protests stretched beyond Florissant Ave. today when a group of around 100 demonstrators gathered in front of the office Bob McCulloch, St. Louis county prosecuting attorney.
Protesters are pushing for McCulloch to charge Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Michael Brown, with murder. Wilson is currently on paid leave.
Holding signs with slogans like ""Justice for Mike Brown"" while chanting in unison, the group, which was made up of both white and black protesters, stood face to face with one lightly armed guard in a white shirt. Behind him, a row of nearly 20 police officers wearing bulletproof vests gathered. One cop even filmed the protest with a handheld camera.
Asked what would happen if protesters tried to enter the building, a police officer with the last name Barton told Mashable all of them would be arrested. Another cop who was standing by noted, ""Looks pretty peaceful to me.""
Clayton is an upper-class, predominately white neighborhood of St. Louis. McCulloch, whose father was a police offer shot by a black man while on duty in 1964, has been accused of racism. There have also since been concerns about the way his office has released information about the case and the way it has handled prior officer-involved shootings.
""The county police and Bob McCulloch have exacerbated the situation,"" said protester Elizabeth Vega. ""And if you are not angry and enraged, then you are not paying attention.""
This group of protesters was highly organized and well spoken. They also knew their boundaries. When two people were arrested, it was by choice -- essentially asking to be taken away in order to make a statement.
As the cops handcuffed the two protesters -- one man and one woman -- the crowd chanted: ""This is what democracy looks like.""
Minutes later, the protesters calmly put down their signs and made their way to their cars in the adjacent lot, many of them saying goodbye for just a few hours.
They'll see each other tonight on Florissant Ave. - AW
Eric Holder's message to Ferguson
6 p.m. ET -- U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who will be in Ferguson starting Tuesday to aid the federal investigation into Michael Brown's death, has written a letter to the beleaguered community in the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/a-message-to-the-people-of-ferguson/article_ea8b7358-67a3-5187-af8c-169567f27a0d.html”>.
In it, he shares details of the federal civil rights investigation currently underway by some 40 FBI agents and experienced prosecutors. ""Hundreds of people have already been interviewed in connection with this matter,"" he writes, appearing to reassure protesters that justice is in the process of being sought. He also notes that a federal medical examiner conducted an autopsy of Brown's body. That was independent of two other autopsies: one by the county examiner and one requested by Brown's family.
Holder goes on to recognize the legitimacy of those who have been ""peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights"" but notes that acts of violence, even by a minority, ""undermine, rather than advance, the cause of justice.""
Above all, he says, the Justice Department's ""investigation into this matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will be independent.""
As for the local investigation into the shooting, the Post-Dispatch reports that the county's standing grand jury will begin hearing evidence in the investigation beginning Wednesday, ""depending upon the ability to get the witnesses in and the witnesses showing up,"" according to a spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has, in turn, handed over law enforcement to state highway patrol.
Missouri State Highway Patrol takes over security
4:15 p.m. ET: Missouri State Highway Patrol will take over security in Ferguson, Gov. Jay Nixon announced Thursday afternoon.
""Law enforcement in Ferguson will be turned over to state highway patrol,"" Gov. Nixon announced to a room full of reporters. Nixon said Ferguson ""looked a little bit more like a war zone, and it's not acceptable.""
[tweetbegin 500012937965502464 tweetend] 
[tweetbegin 500013452795314176 tweetend]
When asked who was calling the shots Wednesday night, Gov. Nixon wouldn't answer. ""That was yesterday,"" he said. ""I'm not looking backward. I'm looking forward.""
The plan, starting Thursday night, was developed to allow ""more movement, trying to bring in a different tone of the amplitude of protective force,"" he said, referring to the ""operational shift"" he expects to provide both parties — protesters and police — to step back and take a breather.
All in all, the unrest in Ferguson feels like an ""old wound,"" the governor saids.
The challenges Ferguson faces ""go much more deep,"" he said. The key, he added, is to get control, let voices be heard, protect property, open up and ""be a little bit more free."" However, Nixon said there are other problems that will need to be addressed.
""These are deep and existing problems not only in Missouri, but in America, but this has clearly touched a nerve,"" he said.
""While we're focused today on the shorter operational things, I think ultimately we will be gauged as to whether or not this was an opportunity used to begin to make some longer term healing, and understanding,"" the governor said.
""We'll do our best to reestablish the rule of law and subsequently expand the trust.""
Eric Holder concerned about deployment of military equipment's message
3 p.m. ET: Attorney General Eric Holder {issued a statement}<hyperlink=”http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-eric-holder-latest-developments-ferguson-missouri”> Thursday afternoon saying he was ""deeply concerned"" about the conflicting message that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends.
“At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" Holder said. ""At my direction, Department officials have conveyed these concerns to local authorities. Also at my direction, the Department is offering – through our COPS office and Office of Justice Programs – technical assistance to local authorities in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force. The local authorities in Missouri have accepted this offer of assistance as of this afternoon.""
In the same statement, Holder also toed a similar line as President Obama did earlier, condemning violence by members of the public while calling on law enforcement to ""seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them.""
“For one thing, while the vast majority of protests have been peaceful, acts of violence by members of the public cannot be condoned. Looting and willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers who are genuinely trying to protect the public do nothing to remember the young man who has died. Such conduct is unacceptable and must be unequivocally condemned.“By the same token, the law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them. Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.

Ferguson police chief: We are changing our tactics
1:51 p.m. ET: Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson struck a new tone Thursday morning, saying he'd allow people to ""freely protest"" — as long as they stayed on sidewalks.
""[We will be] changing our tactics,"" Chief Jackson told members of the media after what he said was a productive meeting with the NAACP and the Department of Justice.
However, Jackson defended his department's militarized response, saying tactical commanders on the ground were responding to ""deadly force"" used by protesters who threw Molotov cocktails, rocks, bricks and bottles.
""I understand it doesn't look good, but there is gunfire. There are firebombs being thrown at police,"" the chief said. ""We want this to be peaceful.""
The chief said protesters will be encouraged to stay on the sidewalks — not by barricades, but by ""cones"" instead — and may use porta-potties the department will set up on their behalf.

""We're going to give sidewalks to the protesters and allow them to freely protest for as long as they want,"" he said.

After he spoke, Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill, a former prosecutor, took the microphone and said Wednesday night's police presence escalated the situation in Ferguson as ""this kind of response by police has become more of the problem instead of the solution.""
""My goal has been demilitarize the situation,"" McCaskill said, adding she's spoken with Attorney General Eric Holder about the police's enhanced weaponry.

""I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images that we’ve seen in the heartland of our country,"" the president said.
Obama said he'd spoken to Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a ""good man and a fine governor,"" and expressed his concern over the ""violent turn that events have taken on the ground.""
[tweetbegin 499964581297815552 tweetend]
Obama then called the death of Michael Brown ""heartbreaking and tragic,"" and said the local authorities needed to be open and transparent about their investigation.
The president then spoke about the friction that's arose between police and protesters over the past four days, saying ""there is never an excuse for violence against police."" However, Obama said, ""there's no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests.""
President Obama said he's tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI with investigating the death of Michael Brown. He also reiterated several times that demonstrators there have a right to peaceful protests.
""There is no excuse for police to use force against peaceful protesters,"" Obama said. He added that police in Ferguson should not bully or arrest journalists there who are ""just doing their jobs.""
Governor is making operational shifts in Ferguson
12:51 p.m. ET: Missouri Governor Jay Nixon told a group of clergy members that his team was ""working through a number of operational things to make some shifts,"" and hinted to the Ferguson community they would ""see a different tone"" as a result.
The governor, who drew applause from the Clergy Coalition crowd in St. Louis, apologized for being late — he was talking on the phone with President Obama.
Gov. Nixon also called for press freedoms following a night that saw at least two reporters arrested in Ferguson and a TV crew with Al-Jazeera America hit with tear gas.
""If the media wants to take pictures of things and cover stuff they ought to do it, we live in a free country,"" he said.

Nixon is expected to announce those changes later this afternoon.
Senator calls for demilitarization of police
12:35 p.m. ET: Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill spoke on Thursday at a meeting for clergy members and called for a demilitarization of the situation no the ground.
""We need to de-militarize this situation — this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution. I obviously respect law enforcement's work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right.

Missouri governor: Ferguson does not represent who we are as Americans
11:30 a.m. ET: Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who is now headed to the St. Louis suburb, issued a statement Thursday morning acknowledging that local authorities in Ferguson have violated the rights of both protesters and the press.
""The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans,"" Nixon, a Democrat, said.
""While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.""
For days, journalists have been on the ground in Ferguson, documenting police tactics. But they had trouble getting the story even before Wednesday night. Police have repeatedly told reporters to get out of the way, and the FAA on Wednesday {granted a request to ban flights}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/12/faa-flights-media-ferguson-missouri/#k43QSE7QDkq3”> over the area, including news helicopters.
Ferguson authorities said the restriction was for safety. Journalists said it was an attempt to black out media coverage.
Civilians in Ferguson have been clashing with police off and on since Sunday, shortly after the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed by a police officer. They've chanted ""hands up, don't shoot"" as police, who are outfitted in riot gear and armed to the teeth, have trained their weapons on them.
But things took a dramatic turn on Wednesday evening as the unrest turned increasingly chaotic.
Around 10 p.m. local time, police fired smoke grenades and rubber bullets into a crowd of hundreds after a protester threw a Molotov cocktail. St. Louis County police then ordered protesters and journalists — who have been flooding the Internet with photos and first-person accounts of the excessive militarization of the police — to turn off their cameras.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that about 10 people had been arrested, including St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been chronicling the protests on social media.

Local authorities also arrested two journalists: Washington Post's Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly, both of whom have been steadfast in tweeting and have become two highly sourced reporters covering this story.
The unrest began on Sunday in Ferguson, a predominately black neighborhood, after a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old who was unarmed at the time.

By the time night fell, like a scene out of a war-torn country, the streets of Ferguson were filled with the sights and sounds of flash grenades, tear gas, car alarms and rubber bullets.
Ryan J. Reilly, The Huffington Post's justice reporter, and Wesley Lowery, a Washington Post reporter, were covering and live-tweeting the scene in Ferguson on Wednesday, following the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown on Saturday, before they were arrested and detained.

Nixon released a statement on the unrest that said, in part: ""The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans. While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.""
Nixon called on law enforcement to seek peace and allow journalists to continue to report.
""Once again, I ask that members of the community demonstrate patience and calm while the investigation continues, and I urge law enforcement agencies to keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press during this difficult time,"" the statement continued.
The Ferguson Police Department has been criticized for what has been seen as militant behavior, as it tries to keep the peace. Police had already used tear gas and rubber bullets before Wednesday on the outraged, grieving community in the days since Brown was killed. The department has also refused to release the name of the officer involved, citing security concerns, and full details of the event, due to the ongoing investigation, angering those affected.
There has been crime and acts of violence in the days following the shooting, which caused the police department to release an official statement urging residents to assemble ""only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner.""
The days following Brown's shooting have raised questions around the militarization of police in the U.S., thanks to a {Pentagon program}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=1”> that has transferred military equipment — including machine guns and armored vehicles — to local police departments. That was on full display in Ferguson on Wednesday night.

Heavily-armed SWAT officers fired on protesters after arresting and reportedly assaulting two national reporters in Ferguson, Missouri, Wednesday night.
Based on tweeted images and {live-streamed video}<hyperlink=” http://fox2now.com/on-air/live-streaming-wc/”> from the scene, combat-style SWAT teams arrived in full riot gear, training sniper rifles on the crowd, and attempted to disperse what started as a peaceful protest in a community where tensions are already running high. By the time night fell, like a scene out of a war-torn country, the streets of Ferguson were filled with the sights and sounds of flash grenades, tear gas, car alarms and rubber bullets.
Ryan J. Reilly, The Huffington Post's justice reporter, and Wesley Lowery, a Washington Post reporter, were covering and live-tweeting the scene in Ferguson on Wednesday, following the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown on Saturday, before they were arrested and detained. That quickly brought national attention to local police officers' actions, as the situation in Ferguson deteriorated.

Reilly and Lowery said they were working in a McDonald's when officers entered and ordered everyone to leave. Reilly told MSNBC that the officers said they were ""shutting down"" the restaurant, and when Reilly didn't pack fast enough, he was arrested and detained for what seemed to be about an hour.

“I knew I was going to be fine,” he said. “But the thing is, so many people here in Ferguson don’t have as many Twitter followers as I have and don’t have Jeff Bezos or whoever to call and bail them out of jail.”
Wednesday's protests began in daylight hours, in accordance with police directives. Based on {live streams}<hyperlink=”http://www.ustream.tv/RealAlexJones”> that showed them in real-time, the protests were largely calm, though they quickly escalated as night fell.
Demonstrators' chants of ""No peace, no justice"" and ""Police: We are all Michael Brown"" turned into ""F*ck the police,"" as authorities began firing tear gas, rubber bullets and flash grenades into the crowd. That was apparently in response to a thrown bottle or other projectiles. A police spokesperson {told}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/juliebosman/statuses/499762600302100480”> The New York Times' Julie Bosman that molotov cocktails were also thrown.

The tape appears to be from St. Louis County dispatch — but the officer who fired the shots works for Ferguson's police department. Discussion of the shooting begins at {11:26}<hyperlink” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zta9FyoA7TU&feature=youtu.be&t=11m26s”>, when a dispatcher mentions hearing about the incident ""on the news,"" and at minute 44, which contains audio from 1:35 p.m. - 2:05 p.m., the dispatcher says ""we are switching over to the riot channel.""
It's likely any chatter regarding the actual shooting will be found in the Ferguson Police Department's audio dispatches. Those have yet to be released — Ferguson's Police Chief Thomas Jackson says the 911 tapes were still being processed during a press conference on Wednesday, and apologized that it was taking so long.
Reached over email, St. Louis Police spokesperson Brian Schellman tells Mashable, ""We are aware of this and are currently investigating it.""
Asked if he has any indication if they were real, or any clue how they were obtained, Schellman responded, ""That's what our investigators are looking into now. The answer to both of those questions.""
The St. Louis County Police Department is currently in charge of the shooting's investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting.

""We have released these tapes to the public so as they are able to get a sense of the atmosphere the moments before and the hours after Mike Brown was shot,"" an Anonymous spokesperson associated with the leaks told Mashable.
""The public needs to understand that there were faults in the response to Mike Brown's shooting. For example, crowd control was requested but there was no mention of a shooting. The dispatcher was notified from a caller and Ferguson PD said they had no idea what was going on. This is all in the tapes,"" the spokesperson said.
The group explains the scanner audio, which is almost two hours long, was lightly edited to remove quiet periods in its {description on YouTube}<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zta9FyoA7TU”>:

These raw audio files have been compiled and long quiet moments have been cut down. Time stamps are available within the video.
The group had promised to release the tapes on Wednesday, but ran into technical problems uploading the tape.
""We apologize for the delay, file size is rather large. Continue to stay tuned in, we will notify you immediately,"" the Twitter account @TheAnonMessage message tweeted just after 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. ""It's not my fault YouTube servers take forever to process.""
The website of the St. Louis suburb has also been experiencing cyberattacks since the shooting, but Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said on Wednesday that those won't sway him into releasing the officer's name who shot Brown.
The officer has not been identified, though Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer had been with the Ferguson police force for six years.
Jackson said someone burrowed into the website and shut it down for much of Monday, two days after the 18-year-old Brown was killed. Brown's death has stoked racial tensions, violent protests, and looting, along with calls for police to release the offending officer's name so his background could be reviewed.
Anonymous has pledged to tamper with the city's computers if the name wasn't released. But Jackson said releasing the information could endanger the officer, who has received numerous death threats.
Jackson said he was unaware of whether the hackers obtained any personal information about police officers from its website. Ferguson, a predominantly black city of roughly 20,000 residents, is about 8 miles northwest of St. Louis.
Investigators have released very few details about the shooting; the events that unfolded on Saturday are still in dispute. Officials only said that a scuffle began after an officer asked Brown and another man to get out of the street, and that the officer's weapon fired at some point inside a patrol car. Witnesses say Brown had his hands raised when the officer repeatedly shot him.",1,2400,NA,NA

But the police also suggested on Friday that Brown was a suspect in an unrelated convenience store robbery that took place shortly before he was shot. Jackson released a report that named Brown as ""the primary suspect"" in the incident, identified after he was fatally shot.
The police chief, who made the announcements in front of the QuikTrip convenience store that was torched in the first night of protests, said Officer Wilson has no history of disciplinary action. The chief didn't say if Wilson would face any punishment over Brown's shooting. The officer is a six-year veteran of the police force and was described by the chief in a second press conference on Friday as a ""gentle, quiet man.""
Brown was shot after the officer encountered him and another man on the street at 12:01 p.m. local time, Chief Jackson said on Friday. The initial confrontation occurred because Brown and a friend were ""walking down the street blocking traffic.""
What happened next is still unclear.
Police say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over his weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Witnesses have said the officer fired on Brown as he tried to run away.
One witness, who tweeted the immediate aftermath of the shooting, said he was shot at least seven times — two of them in the back.
{witness to Brown killing}<hyperlink=” https://twitter.com/7im/timelines/499639344613695488”>
Reporters on Friday afternoon were unclear why the police chief released a report and video from the convenience store robbery, which the police chief clarified was unrelated and yet in which they finger Brown as a suspect. Chief Jackson said, ""Because you asked for it"" when he was questioned of this logic. Governor Jay Nixon, earlier, responded ""I don't know"" when asked why Jackson made the decision to release the alleged robbery video.
And the report, part of a packet given to reporters at the scene of Friday morning's announcement, included stills from the footage.
The images show a large black man — who police labeled as ""Brown"" — physically intimidating a smaller man at the convenience store.

Some, however, {questioned}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/CMReischman/status/500292358022627328”> the discrepancies in Brown's clothing, noting he was wearing sandals in the video and yet wore sneakers when he was shot.
Benjamin Crump, Anthony Gray and Daryl Parks, attorneys for the Brown family, released a statement}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/500334598111236096”> slamming the police chief's decision to name their son as an alleged suspect in the robbery:
Michael Brown's family is beyond outrages at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piece mil [sic] information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.
There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.
The prolonged release of the officer's name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.
It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.
The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, form being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael's death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.
The night before Friday's events, county police in riot gear and armored tanks gave way to state troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of peaceful protesters after nearly a week of unrest and mounting public tension in the St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teen was shot by a city police officer.
The dramatic shift Thursday came after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol, stripping local police from the St. Louis County Police Department of their authority after four days of clashes with furious crowds protesting the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.
Capt. Ronald Johnson, the Missouri State Highway Patrol captain put in charge of security in Ferguson, immediately criticized the decision to release information about the robbery, saying it was separate from the shooting.

The more tolerant response came as President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting — and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.
Obama said there was ""no excuse"" for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.
Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening in the neighborhood where looters had smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and where police had repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.
But the latest protests had a light, almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd, more akin to a parade or block party.
The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell — the point at which previous protests have grown tense — no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.
""You can feel it. You can see it,"" protester Cleo Willis said of the change. ""Now it's up to us to ride that feeling.""

The two reporters had stopped in the restaurant to recharge devices while covering the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, on Wednesday night.
The next morning, after Reilly and Lowery were detained by police, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough had some choice words for the journalists.
Scarborough said reporters who had been confronted by police ""just wanted to get on TV.""
""When a police officer asks you to pick up... I don't sit there and have a debate and film the police officer, unless I want to get on TV and have people talk about me the next day,"" he said.
Lowery, however, had little patience for Scarborough's comments.
""I would invite Joe Scarborough to come down to Ferguson and get out of 30 Rock where he's sitting and sipping his Starbucks smugly,"" Lowery said during an interview with CNN's Kate Bolduan.
""I invite him to come and talk to the residents of Ferguson, where I've been since Monday afternoon having tear gas shot at me, having rubber bullets shot at me,"" Lowery said.
Lowery emphasized the importance on focusing on the events on the ground and not what pundits had to say.
""Let me be clear about this — I have little patience for talking heads. This is too important. This is a community, a community in the United States of America, where are things on fire. This community is on edge,"" Lowery added. ""There’s so much happening here, and instead of putting more reporters on the ground we have people like Joe Scarborough running their mouth and have no idea what they’re talking about.""
The sparring between Lowery and Scarborough followed a night in which the media received both criticism and praise for its coverage — and became a big part of the story itself.
In addition to Lowery's and Reilly's arrests, images and video of an Al Jazeera America news crew fleeing from tear gas were widely disseminated, seen by many as evidence that police hostilities toward the press had reached a new level.
Al Jazeera America said its crew had been targeted by police.
""Last night at 930 CDT in Ferguson, Missouri, an Al Jazeera America news crew was reporting behind police barricades,"" the network said in a statement. ""They were easily identifiable as a working television crew. As they were setting up their camera for a live report, tear gas canisters landed in their proximity and police fired rubber bullets in their direction.""
The statement continued: ""Police continued to shoot after crew members clearly and repeatedly shouted ‘Press’. Al Jazeera America is stunned by this egregious assault on freedom of the press that was clearly intended to have a chilling effect on our ability to cover this important story. Thankfully all three crew members are physically fine. We believe that this situation must be investigated along with those involving our colleagues at other media outlets.""
There was no shortage of pictures or video flowing out of Ferguson, whether from recognized news outlets or citizens posting content online. Local elected official {Antonio French}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench”> has become one of the most consistent documenters of the situation, having posted a variety of Vines of police action against protesters.

The cable news channels did eventually pivot coverage, although Fox received some heat for focusing on the police response instead of the events on the ground.

His remarks came amid rising anger over the shooting of an unarmed black teenager and the police response to the ensuing demonstrations.
""I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images that we’ve seen in the heartland of our country,"" Obama said, speaking from his vacation on Martha's Vineyard. ""I'd like us to take a step back.""
Obama called the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown ""heartbreaking and tragic.""
The president then spoke about the friction that has arisen between police and protesters over the past four days as a result of Brown's death.
""There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" {he said}<hyperlink=”http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/08/14/transcript-obamas-remarks-on-iraq-efforts-ferguson-situation/”>.

[tweetbegin 499961692345090048 tweetend]
The president's statement came as a growing number of politicians and civil rights activists added their voices to condemn {the police force’s tactics}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/14/who-in-charge-of-ferguson-police/#O6VPCuFzNSq0”> in Ferguson.
""Now is the time for healing, now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,"" the president said, appealing for a break in the action that's gripped the city.
Police have used tear gas and smoke bombs to repel protesters on Ferguson's streets in the wake of the shooting of Brown, who was unarmed. Ferguson's police chief said on Wednesday that race relations were the top priority in the town. Authorities have vowed to reach across the racial, economic and generational divide in a community in search of answers.
The president said he spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, calling him a ""good man and a fine governor."" Obama has tasked Attorney General Eric Holder's department with coordinating with local authorities in Ferguson.
St. Louis Mayor Francis G. Slay {questioned the police tactics}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/MayorSlay/status/499917468492521472”>, ""especially the arrest of journalists,"" in a series of tweets Thursday morning.
""I think it is imperative to distinguish between protest and violence. Only the latter warrants arrest.” The mayor added that he had spoken to federal, state and county officials to express these views.
Sen. Claire McCaskill spoke on Thursday at a meeting for clergy members and called for a demilitarization of the situation on the ground.
""We need to demilitarize this situation — this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution. I obviously respect law enforcement's work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right. Today is going to be a new start, we can and need to do better,"" she said.
Civil rights activist Al Sharpton also called on the Department of Justice to monitor how police are responding to protesters in Ferguson. Sharpton said on Thursday he spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief John Belmar by phone to express his outrage at how the police responded to the protests.
Earlier, Gov. Nixon {released a statement}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-obama-police/%E2%80%9Dhttp:/governor.mo.gov/news/archive/statement-gov-nixon-events-ferguson%E2%80%9D/”> on the ""worsening situation in Ferguson” calling it ""deeply troubling.” It ""does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans,” the governor said.
At least three members of Congress, Rep. Wm. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), and Congresswoman Marsha Fudge (D-Ohio), called on Attorney General Holder to investigate civil rights violations at the hands of the St. Louis County Police Department in a letter {released}<hyperlink=”https://lacyclay.house.gov/press-releases/clay-conyers-fudge-request-expanded-fbi-probe-in-police-shooting-of-unarmed-black-teen-in-ferguson-missouri”> earlier this week.
They wrote:
“In light of the foregoing developments, we ask the Department of Justice to investigate the shooting of Michael Brown, looking at both the facts of the specific incident as well as the potential for any pattern or practice of police misconduct by the Ferguson Police Department.
We understand that the St. Louis County Police Department is investigating the matter in order to have some level of independent investigation take place, but this arrangement is insufficient for at least two reasons.
First, the St. Louis County Police Department may not be the most objective or credible body to investigate civil rights matters involving law enforcement given evidence of racial profiling by that department in the recent past, which Congressman Clay had asked the Department of Justice to investigate.""
At least one local politician was arrested in the protests.
St. Louis alderman {Antonio French}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench”> was arrested Thursday night, along with at least two national reporters. Missouri Sen.

Governor Sets Curfew After New Looting on Friday
Following numerous nights of unrest in Ferguson that have included everything from peaceful protests, clashes with police, as well as looting and citizen groups protecting local businesses, a state of emergency has been declared in Ferguson and a curfew set for Saturday evening.
Governor Nixon announced the curfew at a press conference on Saturday afternoon.
""If we're going to have justice we must first have and maintain peace,"" Governor Nixon said at the press conference. ""We cannot allow the ill will of the few to overwhelm the good will of the many.""
Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, who became something of a heroic figure following the removal of local police in favor of the state's highway patrol, said the curfew would be in effect from midnight until 5 a.m. local time, but did not say if it would span multiple nights.
[tweetbegin 500764187489206273 tweetend]
“We won’t enforce it with trucks, we won’t enforce it with tear gas, we will enforce it with communication,” Johnson said, {according to}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html?_r=0”> The New York Times.
Nixon also acknowledged the {efforts of citizens}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/16/police-protesters-ferguson/#ezQts4d6kaqi”> to prevent some of the looting that had occurred, adding that the curfew would be an effort to separate them from those who might break the law.

The timing of the release of the allegations caused widespread backlash against the Ferguson police department and ruined much of the goodwill that had been built on Thursday night.
Similarly, the announcement of a curfew wasn't met with a positive response from people on the ground in Ferguson. On Twitter, those concerns were expressed by locals as well as those who have watched events unfold on television over the past few days.

The announcement (which you can watch above) was released early Tuesday morning following {}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/19/ferguson-missouri-protesters/#LibNcyEfIuqm”> of smoke bombs, tear gas and at least 31 arrests in Ferguson.

Anonymous released a corresponding {list of times and locations}<hyperlink=”http://pastebin.com/HQCaxcdu”> for the day of action, mentioning 37 gathering points across the United States ranging from Times Square in New York City to the Gateway Arch in downtown St. Louis.
For cities that weren't listed, the group invited people to create their own Facebook events.
The group also listed demands, which included Congress passing ""Mike Brown's Law,"" a {proposal}<hyperlink=” https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/mike-brown-law-requires-all-state-county-and-local-police-wear-camera”> on the White House's ""We the People"" site that would require local and state authorities to wear body cameras.

Citizens of the United States. We are Anonymous. With each passing day more people around the world are discovering the atrocities that are occurring in Ferguson. With the cold-blooded death of Mike Brown and the subsequent violence towards demonstrators, we — not only members as members of Anonymous but members of humanity — have grown restless for change and justice.
It is unacceptable for an officer to be named and then let go. St. Louis County identified Darren Wilson as Mike Brown’s murderer, yet he has not been charged or prosecuted. In addition, reports say that if he is charged it won’t happen for another few months. This is not justice.
The truth is we cannot sit still and watch as protesters and journalists are arrested and shot at simply for raising their voices in unison and demanding that justice be served.
Again, we call upon the citizens of the United States to collectively gather in support for those who are suffering in Ferguson.
We must indeed all hang together as one nation or most assuredly we shall all hang separately. The world is witnessing our response. If we stay silent as we watch our brothers and sister suffer the oppression that authorities have brought on them who’s to say that the next attack won’t be in your city.
We therefore once again call upon the citizens of the United States to take to the streets in a day of collective rage against the actions of police and their commanders.
It is our time to get up from our couches, to turn off the TV, and to gather and raise our voices. Anonymous continues plans to assist with protests by leaving our keyboards and going on the ground with our brethren. Our collective will join with those who demonstrate on the streets.
Times, dates and locations for protests will be listed locally and will be available in the description of this video. We continue to demand that Congress take immediately action and pass a bill that will enforce bodily cameras on local and state authorities titled Mike Brown’s Law. The petition is located in the description.
We also demand the immediate arrest and prosecution of the identified shooter immediately.

Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.Sunday's clashes in Ferguson erupted three hours before the curfew imposed by Nixon.

The streets remained quiet as the curfew began. It was to remain in effect until 5 a.m.Earlier in the day, Johnson said he had met members of Brown's family and the experience ""brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart.""""When this is over,"" he told the crowd, ""I'm going to go in my son's room.

Because Michael's going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.""The protests have been going on since Brown's death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Nixon to put the state highway patrol in charge of security.[tweetbegin 501325304661835777 tweetend]Ferguson police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before he was killed.

The police said the two were vying for the officer's gun — Brown was unarmed — though Ferguson residents have balked at that claim. Brown's friend has said that the officer {tried to force}<hyperlink=”http://fox2now.com/2014/08/10/ferguson-police-officer-shoots-kills-teen-community-outraged/”> Brown into the car after approaching the teens, who were walking in the street instead of on the sidewalk.
At least one shot was fired in the car, but the officer {shot Brown multiple times}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/us/looting-and-unrest-follows-vigil-for-st-louis-teenager.html?ref=us&_r=0”>, killing him. The St. Louis County Police Department is still investigating the number of shots the officer fired. Brown wound up about 35 feet from the car when he was killed.
Brown's body remained on the street, guarded by police, for hours after the shooting.
The parties involved
Brown had just graduated high school and was set to start college at nearby Vatterott College on Monday.

""You took my son away from me,"" Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told local TV news station KMOV. ""Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many. Because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they don't got nothing to live for anyway.
'They're going to try to take me out anyway.'""
Brown was a member of the U.S. Army's Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps and a player on his high school football team. But he also {had an eye for business}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/michael-brown-remembered-as-a-gentle-giant/article_cbafa12e-7305-5fd7-8e0e-3139f472d130.html”>; the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Brown ran a fledgling operation in middle school, selling candy to classmates.
The officer has not been identified, though he has been an officer in Ferguson for six years. Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, said Brown was running away from the officer when he was shot dead. Johnson allegedly hid behind a car.
A vigil leads to violence
Outraged by what they felt was an unjust death, Ferguson residents arrived at the scene of the shooting after a vigil for Brown on Sunday night. Many began to {shout}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&smid=tw-nytimes”> things like, ""No justice, no peace.""
Some people looted and vandalized local shops and smashed police car windows.
The violence {calmed down}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/violence-breaks-out-near-site-of-vigil-for-teen-killed/article_f9d627dc-e3c8-5bde-b2ab-7f0a3d36a083.html”> around 3:30 a.m. local time on Monday morning. Some 200 officers worked to quell the demonstration, and 32 people were arrested for burglary, theft or assault.
Two officers were injured during the night. A gun was reportedly fired at a patrolling police helicopter, though the bullets didn't do any damage. Officers used tear gas on protesters in an effort to quiet the scene.
Local residents gathered for a more peaceful demonstration on Monday.
The outrage off the streets
The hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown began cropping up on Twitter after the shooting, focusing on how the media portrayed Brown. Each tweet contained two images of a young black man or woman — one, depicting the person in an act of valor (in a suit or graduation gown); the other of that same person hanging out in street clothes and posing for the camera.

In Ferguson, police still {stop}<hyperlink=”http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf”> blacks on the street disproportionately more often than they stop whites. In 2013, Ferguson police stopped black drivers 4,632 times and white drivers 686 times, equating to a difference of more than 600%. If they were stopping drivers in proportion to the population, the difference would be 200%.
No one has filed a lawsuit yet, as the investigation is ongoing. Brown's family has retained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer who {represented the relatives}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/us/looting-and-unrest-follows-vigil-for-st-louis-teenager.html”> of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager killed in an altercation with a Sanford, Florida, neighborhood watchman in 2012.
The police department has not yet revealed details about what led to the shooting, though officials alleged that Brown shoved the officer back into the police car and was trying to grab the officer's gun during the altercation.
Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has asked the Department of Justice to open an investigation into the incident, and the DOJ has said it will conduct an investigation {alongside the FBI}<hyperlink=”https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-holder-recent-shooting-incident-ferguson-missouri”>.

Missouri governor criticizes response by Ferguson police
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon made several television appearances on Sunday to discuss the ongoing situation in Ferguson.
Nixon said he was upset with local law enforcement's decision to release video tape, allegedly of Brown, posthumously.
When {naming Wilson}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-name-michael-brown-officer/#soyVuEcHEZqH”> as the officer who shot and killed Brown, Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson also released surveillance tape and a police report naming Brown as the chief suspect in an unrelated convenience store robbery. The tape shows a man police identified as Brown physically intimidating a smaller man at a convenience store. The incident report released by the Ferguson Police Department indicates that Wilson was unaware of the alleged robbery when he shot Brown.
""You are clearly trying to besmirch the young man by releasing that video,"" Nixon said Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation.
Nixon added that St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch had the opportunity to bring charges against Wilson, and that ""he should step up and do his job.""
Throughout his Sunday-morning TV tour, Nixon stressed the need to balance citizens' right to assemble with making the city safe and allowing justice to occur. Nixon said he appreciated the federal aid that the U.S. Justice Department sent, which included 40 additional FBI agents to conduct interviews in the area.
""I think it's right for people to grieve. I think it's right for people to speak. We need to keep the rule of law and peace,"" he said on CBS.
Local leader shares how unrest began

French said that the unrest started after a fire ignited near the site of Brown's killing. The community created a makeshift memorial, which included rose petals and candles, where Brown's body lay for nearly five hours. Barbecue charcoals in an apartment dumpster nearby caught on fire, which is what prompted a response from the local fire department. The fire truck was accompanied by police officers.
After some people started shouting at officers, French said police called for backup. That backup included dogs, which just ""agitated the crowd more.""",0,1100,NA,NA

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said protesters weren't the reason for the escalated police reaction early Sunday morning after the midnight curfew took effect, but a report of people who had broken into a barbecue restaurant and a man who flashed a handgun in the street as armored vehicles approached the crowd of protesters.
Also overnight, a man was shot and critically wounded in the same area, but not by police; authorities were searching for the shooter. Someone also shot at a police car, officials said.
The protests have been going on since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed Aug. 9 by a white Ferguson officer, Darren Wilson. The death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several confrontations between protesters and heavily armed police.
In an effort to reduce tensions, Missouri's governor on Thursday put the Highway Patrol in charge of security.
The arrests early Sunday occurred after police received a report that people broke into Red's Barbecue and some were on the roof — creating a potential danger for officers trying to disperse the protesters. Police were responding to that report — not the fact that protesters were still on the street after curfew, Johnson said at a pre-dawn briefing.
Things got worse when a man with a handgun went into the street as police were nearing the restaurant. He ran away, but there was plenty of violence.
""I was disappointed in the actions of tonight,"" Johnson said. He said it was unclear whether the wounded person was a protester, {according to}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/one-person-critically-wounded-in-shooting-arrested-after-ferguson-curfew/article_03b8ca92-776d-525d-b95e-4387ef63a3e2.html”> the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Those arrested, he said, would be charged with failure to disperse.
Below is a video recorded after the curfew of police firing tear gas in an effort to disperse the protesters.
Police used smoke and tear gas on protesters who refused to move back, essentially ending the confrontation nearly an hour after the midnight curfew. Seven people were arrested for failure to disperse.
Saturday marked a week since a white Ferguson officer, Darren Wilson, shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9. The shooting ignited racial tension in the mostly-black suburb and has led to looting and several run-ins between police and protesters.
As the curfew deadline arrived Sunday, remaining protesters — chanting ""No justice! No curfew!"" — refused to leave the area. And as five armored tactical vehicles approached the crowd, officers spoke through a loudspeaker: ""You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately. Failure to comply, may result in arrest.""
[tweetbegin 500894789517451266 tweetend]
As officers put on gas masks, a chant from the distant crowd emerged: ""We have the right to assemble peacefully.""
A moment later, police began firing canisters into the crowd of protesters.
Highway Patrol Spokesman Lt. John Hotz initially said police only used smoke, but later told The Associated Press that they also fired tear gas canisters. He said of police efforts: ""Obviously, we're trying to give them every opportunity to comply with the curfew.""
Jayson Ross, who was leading the protesters toward police before the canisters were fired, said: ""They got guns. We got guns. We are ready.""
[tweetbegin 500876764667973635 tweetend]
The unrest between police and protesters came after Gov. Jay Nixon on Saturday declared a state of emergency in Ferguson.
Nixon's curfew announcement came after tensions again flared in Ferguson late Friday night. Earlier that day, local police identified the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson and released documents and video footage alleging that Brown had robbed a convenience store just before he was shot. Police said Wilson was unaware Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.
In announcing the curfew, Nixon said that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow looters to endanger the community.
""I am committed to making sure the forces of peace and justice prevail,"" Nixon said during a press conference at a church that was interrupted repeatedly by people objecting to the curfew and demanding that the officer who shot Brown be charged with murder.
""We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching,"" Nixon said. ""We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.""
State statute gives the governor broad powers when he declares a state of emergency, but he hasn't indicated that he plans to do anything other than imposing the curfew and empowering the state highway patrol to enforce it.
Meanwhile, Nixon said the U.S. Department of Justice is beefing up its civil rights investigation of the shooting.
Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door in the neighborhood starting Saturday, talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting.
Johnson on Saturday said police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas but would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave. Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly and several officers got trapped and injured.
Brown's death had already ignited several days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But Friday night marked a resurgence of unrest.
On Saturday, some residents said it appeared the violent acts were being committed by people who came from other suburbs or states.
Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, is a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, the local police chief has said.
The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson's whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.
Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up.",3,1100,NA,NA

Imposed curfews in times of civil unrest are nothing new in the U.S. Here are five other instances throughout history:
1. Japanese-Americans on the West Coast - 1942
The Japanese army's attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, is date that will live in infamy. Not only did it cause the U.S. to enter World War II, it also sparked a major struggle for Japanese people living in America at the time.
Two months after the Pearl Harbor attack, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt enforced harsh rules on Japanese-Americans living on the West Coast. He imposed a curfew that forbade anyone of Japanese descent to leave their home after 8 p.m., according to the {The New York Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/04/us/gordon-hirabayashi-wwii-internment-opponent-dies-at-93.html?_r=0”>.

Only three people, including Seattle resident and University of Washington student Gordon Hirabayashi, {openly defied}<hyperlink=”http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/community/chapel-hill-news/”> the curfew and internment.
2. Los Angeles Riots - 1992

Around 63 people died, and more than 2,000 injured by the time the curfew was lifted on May 4.
3. WTO Protest - 1999
Seattle was the center of major protests in late 1999, when a global meeting of the World Trade Organization was scheduled to take place in the city. Protestors {flocked in}<hyperlink=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-12/01/089r-120199-idx.html> from all over the U.S., demonstrating peacefully against corporations. However, there was a small group of protestors who smashed windows, prompting the police to respond by firing tear gas at them, according to the Washington Post. Police made 20 arrests, and the conference's opening ceremony was canceled.
Seattle Mayor Paul Schell immediately imposed a 7 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. curfew, and declared a civil emergency.
4. Hurricane Katrina - 2005
New Orleans residents endured one of the worst natural disasters in recent American history when Hurricane Katrina swept through the city in late August 2005. Around 1,833 people {were killed}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/23/us/hurricane-katrina-statistics-fast-facts/”>, mostly in Louisiana, but also across Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Mississippi, according to CNN.

Michael Naidus to help with the transition from the network space — dominated by David Letterman, the Two Jimmys and the incoming {Stephen Colbert}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/04/04/stephen-colbert-replace-david-letterman-late-night/#DNfEzVgUUkqw”> — to the syndication world of Ellen, Oprah and Judge Judy.
Ferguson at 7 p.m. has a strange ring to it, but he does have the advantage of no talk-show competition whatsoever at that time. His devoted following will easily find him, and he'll encounter new eyeballs. Of course, that was the same thinking that went into Jay Leno's blindingly brilliant brief moment at 10 p.m. — but the vibe at the dishes-clanking 7 p.m. hour is also quite different from changing-into-pajamas time.

Mashable,mash34,http://mashable.com/2014/08/14/5-things-police-militarization-america-ferguson-mike-brown/#3YubyFChvEq0,5 Things You Need to Know About Police Militarization in America,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai; Dustin Drankoski ,08/14/2014,03/23/2016,"After a police officer {shot and killed}<hyperlink-“http://mashable.com/2014/08/11/brown-shooting-ferguson-protests/#v5RMwnBmcPqU”> 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday, demonstrators took to the streets to protest.
Police officers, dressed in camouflage uniforms, responded to the scene, riding armored vehicles, clutching semi-automatic rifles and covering the streets with teargas.
The display of force quickly prompted a political debate about the militarization of police departments in America.
On Thursday, Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill said that ""we need to de-militarize this situation — this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution.""
And Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) wrote in {TIME}<hyperlink=” http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter”> that ""there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.""
[tweetbegin 499904279961149440 tweetend]
But how did this happen? How did American police departments get all these military gear?
Here are answers to five key questions.
1. How did police departments like the one in Ferguson get so much military gear?
In two words? The ""1033 Program.""
This federal program was born as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1991. Initially, it allowed police departments to get unused surplus military gear — leftovers from the Cold War and the first Iraq war — to be repurposed for war on drugs in the United States. The program was expanded in 1997 to include anti-terrorism missions.
The idea behind the program is simple: cash-strapped local police departments can get advanced military equipment — for free — as long as they pay the shipping and maintenance costs. This way, the police saves money, and the military doesn't have to worry about stuff that's old or no longer useful.
2. Who's in charge of the program?
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), through its Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) is in charge of managing the program. That means determining what material is available, putting out a catalog and processing requests from law enforcement agencies.
On its {website}<hyperlink=”http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/pages/default.aspx”>, the agency explains the reasoning behind the program: ""Every dollar's worth of property reutilized is a tax dollar saved.""
3. What have police departments acquired through this program?
All kinds of stuff. From barber chairs and underwear to assault rifles and armored vehicles.
The DLA says that only 5% of the material transferred to police departments from 2006 until May 2014 are weapons, and just 0.35% are tactical vehicles. That, according to data provided to {The New York Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html”> in early June, translates to:
432 mine-resistant ambush protected armored vehicles, also known as MRAPs
435 other armored vehicles such as cars and trucks
44,900 night vision equipment such as sights, binoculars, goggles, lights and accessories
533 aircraft, planes and helicopters
93,763 machine guns (5.56 mm) and rifles (7.62 mm)
180,718 magazines (excluding ammunition).
Since 1990, the program has transferred $5.1 billion worth of equipment to police departments across the U.S.
4. Who got all this stuff?
More than 8,000 law enforcement agencies are part of the program, according to LESO.
According to data obtained by {Wired}<hyperlink=”http://www.wired.com/2012/06/cops-military-gear/all/”> in 2012, the top 10 beneficiaries of the program included small agencies such as the Fairmount Police Department, in northern Georgia, which serves a population of 7,000 people, and the police department in Issaquah, Washington, a town of 30,000 people, but also the Los Angeles Sheriff Department and the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department.
Thanks to this program, the 50-officer police department in Oxford, Alabama, a town of 20,000 people, has an arsenal of M-16 machine guns and a Puma armored vehicle; the Nebraska State Patrol has acquired three amphibious eight-wheeled armored vehicles; and the Lebanon Police Department, which serves 30,000 people, has $4 million worth of stuff including armored vehicles, weapons and heavy equipment like bulldozers and truck loaders.
The Ferguson police department, for its part, has recently acquired two Humvees, a 10-kilowatt generator and an empty flatbed trailer. The St. Louis County Police, which has been deployed in Ferguson, have acquired twelve 5.56 millimeter rifles, six .45 caliber pistols, and Humvees, according to {USA Today}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-michael-brown-militarization-column/14006383/”>.
5. Do police departments get training to use this equipment?
No.
“It's up to law enforcement agencies to handle all their training requirements,” Michelle McCaskill, a spokesperson for the LESO, told Mashable.
Every agency, however, needs to meet certain criteria to be accepted in the program. And all requests are screened by the law enforcement agency itself, a state program coordinator, and LESO.
Moreover, every state needs to sign an agreement with LESO that sets some requirements like drafting a State Plan of Operation which should include ""training and education"" procedures for local law-enforcement agencies.",8,1300,NA,NA

Easy and cheap to make, the Molotov cocktail is {thought}<hyperlink=”https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA214&lpg=PA214&dq=weapons+encyclopedia+molotov+cocktail&source=bl&ots=K6SExiSFeL&sig=ybI8zWfFA0G7mfDkIkdA4V3AWvc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Cx_yU_r2OJCayAT-4YHQAw#v=onepage&q=weapons%20encyclopedia%20molotov%20cocktail&f=false”>  to have been invented during the Spanish Civil War, where it was used by the Republicans against Nationalist tanks. The original design was a mixture of tar, ethanol, and gasoline in a beer bottle, creating a substance that's both sticky and flammable; either an oil-soaked rag or a long, wind-proof match is inserted into the bottle’s mouth to act as a wick. When the ""bottle bomb"" hits its target, the sticky mixture of fuel and flame ignite, causing a large fireball and coating whatever it hits with fire.
But why is the weapon named after Vyacheslav Molotov, the Soviet foreign minister who signed the {secret 1939 Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact}<hyperlink=”http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1939pact.html”>  that heralded World War Two?
The answer comes from Finland.
The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact divvied Europe up into “spheres of influence,” carving Poland into Nazi and Soviet territory, while ceding Finland to the Soviets, who had previously controlled it under the Russian Empire.
In the winter of 1939, after seizing eastern Poland and leaving the country’s west to the Third Reich, the Soviets invaded Finland. Molotov (“Hammer” in Russian) then said in a speech, “Tomorrow we will dine in Helsinki!” After Soviet bombs began to fall on Finnish troops, Molotov {insisted that the Soviets}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/20/opinion/l-how-the-molotov-cocktail-got-its-name-085186.html”>  were dropping food and drink instead. Exhibiting a keen wit, the Finns thus dubbed Soviet cluster bombs “Molotov bread baskets” (the food) and named the improvised weapons that they were using against Soviet armor “Molotov cocktails"" (the drink).
The Finnish {Alko corporation}<hyperlink=”http://www.alko.fi/”> , a liquor conglomerate, mass-produced {450,000 Molotov cocktails}<hyperlink=”http://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/the-molotov-cocktail-one-cocktail-you-dont-want-to-drink.html”>  during the war. The weapon proved instrumental in halting the Soviet advance toward the Finnish capital. The use of Molotov cocktails spread during the war, among Allied and Axis forces alike. In 1940, as Nazis threatened to invade the United Kingdom, the British {armed home guard units}<hyperlink=”http://www.britishpathe.com/video/cocktails-a-la-molotov”>  with the weapon as a form of civil defense.
So Molotov, the war-mongering Bolshevik, ended up lending his name to a bomb known for its popularity in {anti-Communist protests}<hyperlink=”http://time.com/3878232/the-hungarian-revolution-of-1956-photos-from-the-streets-of-budapest/#1”>  behind the Iron Curtain.
Fast forward to today in the United States. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms considers Molotov cocktails a “destructive device” under the {National Firearms Act}<hyperlink=”https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/atf-national-firearms-act-handbook-atf-p-53208/download”> .

Mashable,mash36,http://mashable.com/2014/08/11/vandalism-looting-vigil-st-louis/#2CcZFi5cpEqD,Riots Erupt in St. Louis After Vigil for Man Killed by Police,The Associated Press,08/11/2014,04/01/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — A day of anger over a fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man in suburban St. Louis turned to mayhem as people looted businesses, vandalized vehicles and confronted police who sought to block off access to several areas of the city.
[tweetbegin 498797175535845376 tweetend]
The tensions erupted after a candlelight vigil Sunday night for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times the previous afternoon after a scuffle involving the officer, Brown and another person in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb of the city.
Afterward, a convenience store was looted. Several other stores along a main road near the shooting scene were broken into, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store.
People also took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer, and carted rims away from a tire store.
TV footage showed streams of people walking out of a liquor store carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters were standing atop police cars or taunting officers who stood stoic, often in riot gear. Video posted online by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch showed a convenience store on fire.
Other witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows. Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van.
[instabegin https://www.instagram.com/p/rjULwYyq9P/ instaend]
Police were having a hard time catching looters because crimes were happening at several locations in Ferguson and spilling into neighboring communities, Mayor James Knowles told KTVI-TV. It wasn't immediately clear how many arrests were made. Authorities set up some blockades to try to keep people from the most looted areas.
While St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said that there were no reports of injuries as of about 11 p.m., there also were scattered reports of assaults into the early morning. Pat Washington, a spokeswoman for Dooley, there was one instance she knew of in which tear gas was used. There were scattered media reports of gunfire but authorities did not immediately confirm any.
[tweetbegin 498685923211493377 tweetend]
""Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess,"" Knowles told KTVI-TV. ""Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors. There's nothing productive from this.""
As the investigation of Brown's death progresses, ""we understand people want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out,"" Knowles added. ""We're going to obviously try to urge calm.""
Earlier in the day, a few hundred protesters had gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police building, some chanting ""Don't shoot me"" while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn't use force; the crowd eventually left.
County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after an officer encountered two people — one of whom was Brown — on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson.
Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer.
The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known, but ""it was more than just a couple.""
[tweetbegin 498486270633738241 tweetend]
He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.
Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged. Authorities aren't sure if that person was unarmed, Jackson said.
Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV there's no apparent video footage of the shooting from a nearby apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn't yet put in use.
Jackson said blood samples have been taken from Brown and the officer who shot him, with those toxicology tests generally expected to take weeks to complete.
Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said he had graduated from high school and was about to enter a local college. She said she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue her son with a club or Taser, and she said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.
""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,"" she said, fighting back tears.
The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.
""We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,"" said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.
St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, and Dooley said he will request an FBI investigation. The U.S. Justice Department said Attorney General Eric Holder had instructed staff to monitor developments.
The race of the officer involved in the shooting has not been disclosed. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.

The FBI opened an investigation Monday into the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after being confronted by an officer in Ferguson, a suburb of 21,000 that's nearly 70 percent black.
Authorities in Ferguson used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse a large crowd Monday night that had gathered at the site of a burned-out convenience store damaged a night earlier, when many businesses in the area were looted. 
Police Chief Tom Jackson said members of the crowd threw rocks at police and gunfire came from the crowd, so officers used tear gas and shot ""beanbag rounds"" meant to stun them.
An Associated Press photographer said police were telling people to go home, but authorities had blocked exit streets off. Jackson said police blocked off the area where most of the looting and vandalism occurred the previous night out of concern that cars passing by might hit demonstrators in the street.
Authorities were vague about exactly what led the officer to open fire on Brown, except to say that the shooting was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man. It was unclear whether Brown or the man he was with was involved in the altercation.
Investigators have refused to publicly disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave. But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.
Brown ""was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,"" Walker told The Associated Press on Monday. The officer ""had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times."" The officer then ""stood over him and shot him"" after the victim fell wounded.
[tweetbegin 499018559075651584 tweetend]
Dorian Johnson offered a similar account when he told WALB-TV that he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of the vehicle.
Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away.
""He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,"" Johnson said. ""But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""
""We wasn't causing harm to nobody,"" Johnson said. ""We had no weapons on us at all.""
Walker said that he did not see a scuffle or the circumstances that preceded the first gunshot.
The St. Louis County Police Department refused to discuss Johnson's remarks, citing the ongoing investigation. But county Police Chief Jon Belmar previously said that an officer encountered Brown and another man outside an apartment complex, and that one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled over the officer's weapon.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said there's no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex or from any police dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but has not yet put to use.
Brown's parents and their attorneys asked the public to share any information and videos they might have related to the shooting.
The family had planned to drop their son off at a technical college Monday to begin his studies.
""Instead of celebrating his future, they are having to plan his funeral,"" said Benjamin Crump, a family attorney who also represented Trayvon Martin's relatives after he was slain in 2012 in Florida.
""I don't want to sugarcoat it,"" Crump added. Brown ""was executed in broad daylight.""
Crump and some civil rights leaders drew comparisons between Brown's death and that of Martin and other young black men killed in racially charged incidents.
Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she did not understand why police did not subdue her son with a club or stun gun. She said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted, adding that ""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty.""
The FBI is looking into possible civil rights violations, said Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the agency's St. Louis field office.
Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement that the case deserves a full review.
Nearly three dozen people were arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night after crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted and threatened reporters and taunted officers.
Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they used Brown's death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.
""I can understand the anger and unrest, but I can't understand the violence and looting,"" Trout said.
Some people climbed atop police cars as officers with riot shields and batons stood stoically nearby, trying to restrict access to the most endangered areas.
Thirty-two people were arrested, police said. Two officers suffered minor injuries. There were no reports of civilians hurt.
On Monday, the scene of the shooting was marked with a makeshift memorial of candles and signs in the middle of the narrow street where Brown fell dead.
Brown's father, also named Michael Brown, visited the memorial Monday, at one point straightening a wooden cross. He abruptly left after gunshots rang out a block away. There were no reports of injuries from that gunfire.
The person who was with Brown has not been arrested or charged, and it was not clear if he was armed, Jackson said. Blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer for toxicology tests, which can take weeks to complete.",1,1200,NA,NA
Mashable,mash40,http://mashable.com/2014/08/18/missouri-national-guard-racial-tension/#kZ.Cpnv.Ziq7,Missouri National Guard Has Its Own History of Racial Tension,Colin Daileda,08/18/2014,04/01/2016,"Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced on Monday that he would deploy the Missouri National Guard to Ferguson in an attempt to quell protests there that have raged since the police killing of an unarmed black teenager on Aug. 9.
The killing led to an eruption of long-simmering racial tension in Ferguson between residents of the predominantly black St. Louis suburb and the city's predominantly white police. And the Missouri National Guard, meant to enforce order, has its own questionable track record when it comes to racial bias.
Complaints of racial discrimination within the guard date back to at least 2000, when Capt. James Tate, who is black, filed a complaint against a guard member under his command for {calling him a racial slur}<hyperlink=”http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2000/may/20000507feat10.htm”>. The investigation took nearly a year and cost four senior officers their jobs for mishandling the case, according to the Columbia Daily Tribune. Sgt. Toni Settle, who allegedly used the slur, was eventually told she would be demoted, but her demotion was delayed by six months, and she retired before her pension was reduced.
Tension flared again in 2008 when more than a dozen Missouri National Guard members including Tate, who had since risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, {filed a federal discrimination complaint}<hyperlink=”http://content-static.armytimes.com/article/20081222/NEWS/812220305/Mo-Guardsmen-complain-about-discrimination”> against Adjutant Gen. King Sidwell and chief of staff Col. Glenn Hagler for allegedly discriminating against women and blacks by passing them over for promotions.
In 2010, the Missouri National Guard fired Tate after a controversial investigation into Tate's alleged abuse of travel privileges. But Tate was not informed that he was being investigated, and was fired {before the audit of his travel log began}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/guard-officer-fired-after-bias-complaints-he-claims-retaliation-over/article_b4034df0-0c85-58be-a639-4260dd6fdb06.html”>. A second audit by the national guard later cleared him of any wrongdoing, though after his employment was already terminated. Tate said he was fired in retaliation for his whistleblowing, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
A year before Tate filed his second complaint, Sidwell had called him a ""{must promote}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/guard-officer-fired-after-bias-complaints-he-claims-retaliation-over/article_b4034df0-0c85-58be-a639-4260dd6fdb06.html”>"" candidate for colonel.
Sgt. Nathan Wooten, a white guard member, was also under investigation around the time Tate was fired. Fellow guard members had complained that Wooten was a {member of a neo-Nazi organization}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/the-platform/editorial-missouri-guard-needs-outside-help-to-fix-discrimination-problem/article_8ed34093-1418-5a62-8276-b287c1dc46fd.html”> and used national guard offices to recruit new members. Wooten wasn't fired until the St. Louis Post-Dispatch began asking questions about his activities.
Sidwell and Hagler are no longer with the Missouri National Guard, and the organization has had a better record of promoting minority officers under current Adjutant Gen. Stephen Danner.
However, Danner was the commanding officer who oversaw Tate's removal, and he has been {accused of harassing and intimidating troops}<hyperlink=”http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/local/tarnished-reputations-a-national-guard-officer-in-columbia-alleges-retaliation/article_5c15b492-7e0c-11e3-a774-001a4bcf6878.html”> who have spoken out against alleged racial, gender and sexual orientation discrimination in the Missouri National Guard, according to the Columbia Daily Tribune. He also reportedly denied Sunshine Law requests to investigate claims that his national guard troops had looted parts of Joplin, Missouri, after a 2011 tornado ravaged the city.
The Army's Office of the Inspector General and the Department of Defense are reportedly investigating allegations of intimidation and retaliation by Danner and other top Missouri National Guard officials that stem from a complaint made by Lt. Col. Michael Fayette, who was the state guard's director of policy and strategic communications. The details of the complaint, which involve Fayette being discriminated against for speaking out on behalf of veterans who were also discriminated against, can be found in the embedded documents below.
Neither the Missouri National Guard nor the state governor's office, to which the guard reports, responded to a request for comment.
The Missouri governor has said the national guard will serve in a limited capacity in Ferguson. Their main duty will be to {protect the police's headquarters}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSum&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news”> from attacks by citizens who reportedly fired guns at law enforcement officials on Sunday night.

Al Sharpton pressed police Tuesday to release the name of the officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager in suburban St. Louis, and he pleaded for calm after two nights of violent protests over the young man's death.
Police said death threats prompted them to withhold the name of the officer, who was placed on administrative leave after fatally shooting 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, where the incident has stoked racial tension, rallies and a night of looting.
Investigators have released few details, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Brown and another teen to get out of the street. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, police said.
""The local authorities have put themselves in a position — hiding names and not being transparent — where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,"" Sharpton said during a news conference in St. Louis where he was joined by Brown's parents.
He also echoed pleas for peaceful protests by the NAACP and Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., who told the crowd: ""I need all of us to come together and do this right. ... No violence.""
President Barack Obama also urged calm, saying people must comfort each other ""in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.""
Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told a standing-room only crowd at a community forum Tuesday night that the shooting feels ""like an old wound torn fresh"" in a nation still struggling with race relations.
The forum, held at a church, was organized as an alternative response to two nights of unrest in which more crowds have burned stores, vandalized vehicles assaulted reporters and taunted officers. Ferguson's mayor and police chief also attended the meeting and were welcomed with applause.
Earlier in the day, Police Chief Tom Jackson said he had decided against releasing the officer's name Tuesday after death threats were called into police and City Hall and posted on social media. Jackson said it could be weeks before he releases the name.
""If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,"" Jackson said. ""We're taking the threats seriously.""
The officer has been with the force for about six years and was on a routine patrol when he encountered the two young men, Jackson said.
Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. Brown was black.
[tweetbegin 499360639173677057 tweetend]
The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. Jackson said the city has had trouble recruiting and retaining black officers.
The fullest account of Brown's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home from a convenience store with Brown when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who, using expletives, ordered them to move to the sidewalk.
In the hours after the shooting, Johnson told news crews that he and Brown had kept walking and explained to the officer they were near their destination. The officer then reversed his car ""to where it almost hit us.""
The officer, Johnson said, tried to open his door, but he was so close to the men that it ""ricocheted"" back. Johnson said the officer then reached through the window, ""grabbed my friend around the neck"" and tried to pull him into the car. The officer then reportedly pulled out his weapon and said, ""'I'll shoot you,' or 'I'm going to shoot,'"" Johnson said.
When the officer opened fire, Brown was hit and started to bleed, Johnson said. Johnson ran to hide behind a car.
Brown ""kept running, and he told me to keep running because he feared for me, too,"" Johnson said.
Johnson said the officer pursued Brown with his weapon drawn and fired again.
When Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. But the officer kept firing, Johnson said.
""And my friend died. He didn't say anything to him. He just stood over and he's shooting.""
Authorities have not commented directly on Johnson's account.
Another witness, Phillip Walker, told the AP he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he saw a white officer with Brown, who was ""giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued."" Walker said the officer then ""stood over him and shot him.""
Police have said there is no security or police video of the confrontation.
St. Louis County police are leading the investigation into Brown's death, and the Federal Aviation Administration agreed to order flight restrictions over Ferguson until Monday to give police helicopters unfettered access to that airspace.",2,566,NA,NA

Jay Nixon said ""vigorous prosecution must now be pursued"" in Michael Brown's death, prompting some to criticize him for what they perceived to be biased language.

In the video, which lasted nearly five-and-a-half minutes, Nixon said St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder have an ""obligation to achieve justice"" in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, and that it ""must be carried out thoroughly, promptly and correctly.""
Previously, Nixon said McCulloch had the opportunity to bring charges against Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed Brown, and that ""{he should step up and do his job}<hyperlink=”http://evap.mashable.com/2014/08/17/michael-brown-second-autopsy-ferguson/#dawyr9uv0OqM”>.""
Some Ferguson residents have questioned McCulloch's ability to conduct an impartial investigation. State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed launched an {online petition}<hyperlink=”http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/appoint-a-special-prosecutor?source=c.em.cp&r_by=11088158”>, calling for McCulloch to remove himself from the case, and to appoint a special prosecutor.
However, Nixon said in another statement released Tuesday that McCulloch will not be removed from the case. ""There is a well-established process by which a prosecutor can recuse themselves from a pending invesigation, and a special prosecutor be appointed. Departing from this established process could unnecessarily inject legal uncertainty into this matter and potentially jeopardize the prosecution,"" the Missouri governor said.

In his video statement, Nixon reiterated the {remarks made by Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol early Tuesday morning}<hyperlink=”http://evap.mashable.com/2014/08/18/ferguson-live-updates/#WZv3jRswuaqw”>, saying that a few ""violent instigators take to the streets intent on creating chaos and lawlessness"" among peaceful protesters. Nixon also defended local law enforcement, saying that they are ""working valiantly to protect the public, while at the same time preserving citizens' rights to express their anger peacefully.""
""It is not an easy balance to strike,"" he added. ""But we will not be defeated by bricks and guns and molotov cocktails.""
Nixon also emphasized that it was important to achieve ""justice for the family of Michael Brown,"" and said he hoped that Brown's death would not be remembered ""as a tragedy that sparked a cycle of violence and distrust, but rather marks the beginning of a process of healing and reconciliation.""",4,1300,NA,NA
