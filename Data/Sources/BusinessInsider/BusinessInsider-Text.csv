Police said Michael Brown, 18, physically assaulted the officer from the Ferguson police, who then fired multiple shots at Brown after he left the car on Saturday. The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told a news conference.

""It is our understanding at this point in the investigation, that within the police car, there was a struggle over the officer's weapon,"" Belmar told reporters as voices from demonstrators shouting outside the building could be heard.

Belmar said it appeared one shot was fired during the struggle in the police car.

A crowd of some 200 people gathered at the site of the shooting on Saturday, some of them shouting ""kill the police"" and yelling profanities, a county police spokesman said.

""Emotions were running very high,"" Belmar said.

St. Louis County police said Brown was unarmed and they would turn over investigation findings of what happened in Ferguson, northwest of St. Louis, to local prosecutors.

Brown's mother told local TV broadcaster KSDK that her son was a good child getting ready to go to college and was visiting his grandmother when the incident took place.

""He didn't bother nobody,"" she said. ""They told me how many times my son was shot - eight,"" she added, and then directed her comments at police.

""You not God. You not decide you are going to take somebody from her,"" she said in an interview with KSDK.

The St Louis County branch of the civil rights group NAACP has said it wants the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into the case, with many in the community telling media that race played a factor in the shooting.

""Witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows,"" the Associated Press said. ""Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van.""

FOX 2 News in St. Louis has live footage from the ground. 

Antonio French, an alderman of the 21st Ward in St. Louis, has been tweeting video and photos from the demonstrations. 

The protests come after thousands of people gathered Sunday night at a candlelight vigil for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police say assaulted an officer before he was shot to death, according to CNN. 

Witnesses dispute that account — they say Brown was unarmed and had his hands up when a police officer fired. 

""I saw him turn around with his arms up in the air and they shot him in his face and chest and he went down unarmed,"" bystander Piaget Crenshaw told ABC News. 

Meanwhile, images and video streaming in from social media paint a picture of complete chaos on the streets of Ferguson. 

Robert Cohen, a photojournalist from the St. Louis Dispatch, captured this image of a QuickTrip gas station burning. 

Brown, who was set to begin college on Monday, was walking to his grandmother's house when the shooting happened. Brown's family and other residents are now calling for a full investigation into the incident. ",65,NA,NA,NA

BusinessInsider,bus6,http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-missouri-riots-continue-2014-8,Tensions Still High In Missouri 'War Zone' After Monday's Riots,Carey Gillam,8/12/2014,10/28/2015,"FERGUSON Mo. (Reuters) - An uneasy calm settled over Ferguson, Missouri, early Tuesday after a second night of violent clashes between law enforcement and residents protesting the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, with another demonstration planned for mid-morning.

So far, more than 50 people have been arrested in protests following the death of Michael Brown, 18, in a largely black St. Louis suburb on Saturday after what police officials said was a struggle with a gun in a squad car.

The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the racially charged case, and St. Louis County is also investigating the shooting.

Police have not said why Brown was in the police car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.

Chanting ""hands up, don’t shoot,"" protesters overnight challenged police trying to seal off the neighborhood where Brown was shot, a low-income, high-crime area east of downtown Ferguson. Some protesters said they were outraged that Brown appeared to have been shot while holding his hands up in surrender, calling the shooting the latest in a long history of police harassment of area minorities.

""They brought this on themselves,"" said 25-year-old Adam Burcher of Ferguson, who stood outside the Ferguson Police Department on Monday night with a sign reading ""Stop Killing.""

Later on Tuesday, a protest is expected outside the St. Louis County prosecutor's office in Clayton, Missouri, and officials are also expected to identify the police officer involved in the shooting.

Brown's family has hired Benjamin Crump, an attorney who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager whose fatal shooting in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012 triggered nationwide protests.

""To bring further calm, and for people to have confidence, we need the Justice Department to take over this investigation completely and not rely on the St. Louis police,"" Crump told CNN in an interview on Tuesday.

Brown’s parents have called for calm, but demonstrations have turned violent. More violence ensued on Monday night as officers in riot gear, armed with rifles and accompanied by dogs tried to secure the area.

Some protesters said they were trying to honor Brown’s memory. A memorial of flowers, notes and candles grew near the apartment building where Brown reportedly was walking to see his grandmother before he became involved with police.

""We aren't going to let this one go,"" said 18-year-old Dreya Harris of St. Louis. ""People feel like in the Trayvon Martin case that there was no justice.""

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson has said officers are determined to keep a lid on the simmering tensions.

The expected announcement identifying the officer involved in the shooting also could escalate tensions in an area that has seen a stark demographic shift in recent decades.

Officials, who so far have not disclosed the officer's race, have said the six-year police veteran is on administrative leave pending the investigation. About two-thirds of Ferguson's 21,000-strong population are black, while 50 of the 53 members of its police department members are white.

Most of the communities around Ferguson have gone from white to mostly black in the last 40 years, said Terry Jones, political science professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis.

""There's a long history of racial injustice,"" said Jones. ""Slowly and not so surely, the St. Louis metropolitan area has been trying to figure out a way forward. As the Michael Brown shooting indicates, there are often setbacks.""",19,NA,NA,Reuters

MSNBC's Trymaine Lee {spoke with}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”> Johnson, who described the episode in which Brown was reportedly accosted, assaulted, and shot by a police officer just days before he was set to begin college.

Freeman Bosley, Johnson’s attorney, told msnbc that the police have yet to interview Johnson. Bosley said that he offered the police an opportunity to speak with Johnson, but they declined.

“They didn’t even want to talk to him,” said Bosley, a former mayor of St. Louis. “They don’t want the facts. What they want is to justify what happened … what they are trying to do now is justify what happened instead of trying to point out the wrong. Something is wrong here and that’s what it is.”

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar says the incident began when Brown {attacked}<hyperlink=”http://www.wtsp.com/story/news/2014/08/11/trayvon-martin-family-attorney-to-represent-slain-missouri-teen/13882389/”> the unnamed police officer and was shot in an ensuing scuffle.

We looked intimidating, but all of our vehicles and equipment had a clear purpose for combat against enemy forces. So why is this same gear being used on our city streets?

On Saturday, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, an unarmed black man. In the days that have followed, the town with a population of about 21,000 has seen massive protests in response to the shooting, as some witnesses said Brown had his hands up when he was killed.

Putting aside what started the protests for a moment, it's worth discussing the police response to the outrage. In photos taken Monday, we are shown a heavily armed SWAT team.

BusinessInsider,bus11,http://www.businessinsider.com/shooting-of-unarmed-black-teen-exposes-racial-divide-in-town-near-st-louis-2014-8,Fatal Shooting Of Unarmed Black Teen Exposes Racial Divide In Town Near St. Louis,Nick Carey; James B. Kelleher,8/13/2014,10/28/2015,"FERGUSON Mo (Reuters) - The fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday, and subsequent violent protests, highlight a stubborn racial divide in a St Louis suburb that has struggled to build healthy relations between blacks and whites.

From the 1970s, Ferguson, pop. 21,000, changed from being overwhelmingly white to predominantly black as whites left the town and its surrounding areas, seeking to avoid racial integration of public schools.

African Americans, allegedly excluded from buying homes in many St. Louis neighborhoods in an illegal practice called redlining, found Ferguson a hospitable place to set down roots.

""Most of the communities around Ferguson have gone from all Caucasian to all African-American over a 40-year period,” said Terry Jones, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Ferguson, on St. Louis' northern border, is relatively mixed, with 63 percent of the residents African American and 34 percent white, according to 2010 U.S. Census data.

To some Ferguson residents, the shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, symbolizes how African Americans are treated unfairly in a town still run by a Caucasian minority.

Mayor James Knowles is white, as are all but one of six city council members. The police chief is white, and only three members of the 53-person police force are African Americans. A 2013 state attorney general's report found more than 85 percent of motorists pulled over in the city are African American, and the arrest rate among blacks is twice the rate among white residents.

TROUBLED HISTORY
For the broader St. Louis area, the Ferguson disturbances represent another troubled chapter for a metropolitan area with a painful track record on race.

Before the Civil War, a federal judge in downtown St. Louis sent former slave Dred Scott back into slavery, a decision later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1917, racial riots across the Mississippi River in East St. Louis were among the most deadly in U.S. history. And in the 1970s, St. Louis experienced tense court battles over school desegregation.

Today, St. Louis remains one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States, according to a study of Census Data by researchers at Brown University and Florida State University.

Jones, of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, says Ferguson until now had the reputation of a suburb that made integration work.

A revitalization of Ferguson's downtown, directed by a newly hired city planning director, has brought new restaurants and shops into the once-drowsy neighborhood. The city has worked with local employers, including Emerson Electric and the University of Missouri, to encourage employees of all races to live and work in Ferguson.

“It's a bit of an irony that the one municipality that made that effort has suffered the biggest conflict,” Jones said.

POLICING IN THE SPOTLIGHT
John Gaskin III, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP board of directors, said the group was outraged by Brown's killing, but said the issues were hardly unique to Ferguson or St. Louis. He cited the case of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old unarmed black man who died after New York police put him in a banned chokehold.

“Police brutality takes place in every state, all over the country, every day,"" Gaskin said. ""A big part of the problem is that our police departments don't look like our communities.""

Protestors who stormed the streets of Ferguson in the aftermath of the Brown shooting said race was at the root of Ferguson's troubles.

Mary Hall, 57, said police stop her car frequently as she drives through Ferguson. ""You can't drive anywhere without being stopped,"" Hall said.

At a protest outside a burned-out gas station in Ferguson, 92-year-old L.T. Taylor put the events into perspective. ""I been here a long time and I had hoped we could move past this in America,"" he said. ""But some things don't change.""

Some protestors put their emotions into writing. ""Beware, Killer Cop on the Loose. Watch Out, Children,"" read a hand-painted placard leaning against a stately tree.

Others wrote messages trying to urge calm. Jerome Williams, 32, carried a sign reading, ""Guns down for Mike Brown.""

Police said Brown was shot in a struggle with a gun in the Ferguson Police Department squad car, but they have not said why Brown was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.

As of Tuesday evening, more than 50 people had been arrested in two nights of disturbances following Brown's death. The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the racially charged case, and St. Louis County also is investigating the shooting.",17,NA,NA,Reuters
BusinessInsider,bus12,http://www.businessinsider.com/police-in-ferguson-missouri-shoot-another-man-2014-8,"Police Have Shot And Critically Wounded Another Person In Ferguson, Missouri",Nick Carey,8/13/2014,10/28/2015,"Violence again erupted in the St. Louis area near the site of the police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, according to local police, despite calls by U.S. President Barack Obama and activists for a measured response.

Early on Wednesday, a police officer shot and critically wounded a man who drew a handgun near the site of protests over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, a St. Louis County Police Department officer said.

Police responded about an hour after midnight to reports of four or five men with shotguns and wearing ski masks. They encountered multiple suspects running, one of whom pulled a gun on an officer, who fired at him, the county officer said. The man was taken to an area hospital.

Shortly after midnight, police fired tear gas into protesters who had confronted a line of officers after a far larger crowd dispersed, St. Louis County Police Department spokesman Brian Schellman said.

A photograph in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch showed a protester wearing a shirt with an American flag printed on it throwing a tear gas container back at the police. There were other media reports of bottles thrown at police.

The incidents followed two nights of violent protests, looting and arrests in Ferguson, the largely black St. Louis suburb where the shooting of Brown took place.

Obama promised a full investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into the teenager's death.

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but ... I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" Obama said in a statement.

Friends and family of Brown held a peaceful church vigil on Tuesday night, after his father pleaded for an end to the violence. Standing with supporters, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, Michael Brown Sr. said he wanted justice for his son but wanted it ""the right way.""

""I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,"" said Brown Sr., who wore a T-shirt showing his son's baby picture. ""No violence.""

Several hundred protesters appeared to heed the calls for non-violence late on Tuesday evening, chanting ""hands up, don't shoot"" and ""no justice, no peace"" during a tense but ultimately peaceful stand-off with police clad in riot gear and flanked by armored vehicles near the site of Brown's death.

The protesters, some of whom waved signs as the group was led in chants by megaphone, had dwindled to a handful before midnight.

Also on Wednesday, a woman was shot in the head in a drive-by shooting blocks from the area where Brown was killed. Her condition and whether the shooting was related to the protests were unknown, Schellman said.

In a separate incident simmering in California, a vigil was planned after Monday's shooting death of an unarmed 24-year-old black man in Los Angeles, USA Today cited a Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman as saying.

CONTROVERSIAL SHOOTING
Sharpton, a New York-based civil rights leader, called for peaceful protest in the wake of looting and more than 50 arrests since the shooting.

""To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant that he was,"" Sharpton said of the 6-foot, 4-inch (198-cm) Brown, who had planned to start college this week.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon told a packed church in North St. Louis County on Tuesday evening the community was ""reeling from what feels like an old wound that has been torn open afresh.""

The activists also were demanding authorities make public the name of the officer involved. The police had said they would do so on Tuesday, but changed the plan, citing fears of retaliation, according to media reports.

Police said Brown was shot in a struggle with a gun in a police car but have not said why he was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.

A witness to the shooting interviewed on local media has said that Brown had been putting his hands up to surrender when he was killed.

The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the racially charged case and St. Louis County also is investigating.

Demonstrations on Sunday night turned violent, with looting and property damage. Violence broke out again on Monday night as police officers in riot gear, armed with rifles and accompanied by dogs tried to secure the area.

Residents in the low-income, mostly black neighborhood where Brown was killed say they are often harassed by police. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said the neighborhood had a lot of crime but there were no race problems.

Ferguson has seen a stark demographic shift in recent decades, going from all white to mostly black. About two-thirds of the town's 21,000-strong population are black. On a police force of 53, three officers are black.",NA,NA,NA,Reuters
BusinessInsider,bus13,http://www.businessinsider.com/profile-of-ferguson-missouri-shooting-victim-michael-brown-2014-8,"Family Of Ferguson, Missouri Shooting Victim: He Was A 'Gentle Spirit'",David A. Lieb,8/13/2014,10/28/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Michael Brown Sr. stood alone in the center of the narrow street where the blood of his namesake son still stained the gray pavement, two days after the 18-year-old was shot dead by a police officer. He straightened a waist-high wooden cross and re-lit the candles erected as part of a makeshift memorial.

""Big Mike,"" as some of his friends called Michael Brown Jr., wasn't the type to fight, family and neighbors said, though he lived in a restless neighborhood where police were on frequent patrol. His parents and neighbors described him as a good-hearted kid with an easy smile who certainly wouldn't have condoned the violence and looting that spread though his north St. Louis suburb following his death.

""He was funny, silly, he would make you laugh,"" his father said, and when there was ""any problem going on, any situation, there wasn't nothing that he couldn't solve. He could bring people back together.""

Brown, who was unarmed, was shot Saturday by a Ferguson police officer while walking with a friend down the center of the street. Police have said a scuffle broke out after the officer asked the boys to move to the side. Witnesses say Brown's arms were in the air — in a sign of surrender — as a white policeman repeatedly shot the black youth.

After a vigil Sunday night, an angry crowd looted stores, and a night later police in Ferguson fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse protesters. The U.S. Justice Department has announced that its civil rights division is investigating, and Brown's family retained the same lawyer who represented relatives of Trayvon Martin — the Florida teen killed in a racially charged 2012 shooting. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton joined the family Tuesday to urge protesters to refrain from violence.

Brown was among a small group of students who had graduated Aug. 1 from Normandy High School, needing the summer to finish their required credits. He was to have started college his week for a career in heating and air conditioning engineering.

""We can't even celebrate; we've got to plan a funeral,"" said his tearful mother, Lesley McSpadden.

Brown had been staying at his grandmother's apartment when the shooting occurred, and family and neighbors said he had long shied away from confrontation.

Because he was big, he gave football a try his sophomore year of high school. But he quit before the first game, said cousin Eric Davis.

""Him being a gentle spirit, he was like,'I don't like to hit people,'"" Davis said Tuesday. ""'He would be like, I might hurt him. I don't want to hurt him.'""A couple of weeks before his death, Brown had confessed Jesus as his savior, said a great-uncle, pastor Charles Ewing. Shortly thereafter, Brown had a dream in which he saw a body laying covered by a sheet, Ewing said.

""He didn't know whose body it was,"" Ewing said, his voice cracking. ""He said, 'One day, the whole world is going to know my name' ... not knowing this is what was going to happen.""

Neighbor Sharon Johnson, 58, said Brown frequently stopped to chat with her, including about his faith.

""He had a more mature mind than a little boy's mind,"" she said.

On Monday, Johnson was standing at the side of the street where Brown was shot as a woman who had driven in from a nearby community preached loudly to anyone willing to listen about the importance of peaceful protests and parental discipline for teenagers.

A passing car stopped, letting out a man wearing a newly made black T-shirt bearing Brown's baby picture and the words ""NO JUSTICE NO PEACE.""

""I'm his father,"" he said somberly, eliciting hugs.

The older Brown picked up a piece of cardboard that had been lying on the ground. ""End police brutality,"" it read. He placed it on a pile of toy animals stacked by a streetlight pole, then set about straightening up his son's mid-street memorial.

He had just returned to the grass when a gunshot rang out. Then another. And another. It was time to go.",4,NA,NA,Associated Press
BusinessInsider,bus14,http://www.businessinsider.com/eye-witness-account-of-michael-browns-shooting-2014-8,"This Is The Version Of The Ferguson, Missouri Shooting That Police Don't Want You To Hear",Harrison Jacobs,8/13/2014,10/28/2015,"A police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, {shot and killed}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-mo-michael-brown-shooting-2014-8”> an unarmed, black 18-year-old named Michael Brown on Saturday, sparking riots and protests in the St. Louis suburb. At least 50 people were arrested in three days.

Details have been hazy about the shooting, but two competing stories have emerged. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar says {Brown assaulted the officer first}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/10/justice/missouri-police-involved-shooting/index.html”>, and then the two began to struggle with the officer’s gun. 

The police version is at odds with another story, corroborated by multiple witnesses, including 22-year-old Dorian Johnson, Brown’s friend who was “within arm’s reach” of Brown when the first shot was fired. Johnson spoke to {MSNBC last night and gave his account}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”>. Here’s a summary of his version of the events. (Police have reportedly {refused to interview Johnson}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/police-havent-spoken-witness-saw-ferguson-shooting-2014-8”>.)

On Saturday afternoon, somewhere between 1:40 p.m. and 2:00 p.m., Johnson says he saw Brown walking on the street and went to talk to him. As the two caught up, they headed back to Johnson’s house. When they were a 1-minute walk away, they went to cross the street. As they walked in the middle of the road — jaywalking — a police car drove up. The officer told the two to go on the sidewalk, according to Johnson.

""His exact words were get the f—k on the sidewalk,” Johnson told MSNBC.

Johnson told the officer they were almost at their destination. Thinking the officer was giving them leave, they began walking again. Instead of driving away, the officer switched his police truck in reverse, tires screeching, and nearly hit the two, according to Johnson.

At that point, Johnson said, he and Brown were in line with the officer’s side door. The officer asked them what the two had said and then tried to push his door open, according to Johnson. Because the two were so close to the door, Johnson says the door hit Brown and closed. The officer then allegedly grabbed Brown by the neck.

Brown then tried to pull away to avoid being choked, Johnson says.

“They’re not wrestling so much as his arm went from his throat to now clenched on his shirt … It’s like tug of war. He’s trying to pull him in. He’s pulling away, that’s when I heard, ‘I’m gonna shoot you,’” Johnson said. 

The two realized the officer had pulled out a hand gun and pointed it at Brown. The officer repeated, “I’ll shoot.” Seconds later, the first shot went off. Johnson says the officer let go after he shot Brown. 

Brown and Johnson then ran towards a line of three cars on the side of the street. Johnson went behind the first, but Brown ran past. Brown yelled “Keep running, bro!” But by the time he got to the third car, the officer shot Brown in the back, according to Johnson.

Johnson says Brown stopped, put his hands up, turned around, and yelled he didn't have a gun.

The officer allegedly shot several more times, Brown fell to the ground, and Johnson ran to his apartment. 

""It was just horrible to watch … {It was definitely like being shot like an animal}<hyperlink=”http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/13/dorian-johnson-michael-brown-eyewitness/13986845/”>,” Johnson told local news station KSDK.

To become a PoliceOne member, you have to verify you're a law enforcement officer, although it is possible that some troll accounts have bypassed this system.

VON1:

All a cop needs to believe that his life or another is in danger and he can use the force necessary to stop that threat. Something made this officer shoot.

Hawasafuzz:

No one likes to see loss of life especially a young person but it always appears that anytime officers or civilians are automatically guilty of a wrong when when there is a minority in the mix. Very sad.

Shawnpp:

Has anyone read/heard of any actual details about why the officer actually shot the unarmed boy? In a use of force situation, shooting an unarmed person is acceptable if the officer has tried everything else and it's not working and the suspect is causing great bodily injury or death, i.e.: the officers is getting his a-- kicked seriously and needs immediate relief. I have yet to read any details supporting or non supporting the decision to shoot. 

Runcop:

I feel for the poor young copper who will be screwed over because the 'community activists' are now involved. The worthless DOJ will be monitoring and the entire department will be under the microscope. Frickin lying 'witnesses'. Hopefully the copper's administration will not throw him under the bus!

RNS1:

Let's just hope for the officer's sake, assuming he was justified, that there is not the least bit of ambiguity in the incident or he is likely to be railroaded. On a side note, every time I get mad at my department I go steal a TV. Trash.

OldCowboy:

They think that as long as they are unarmed, the officer won't shoot. So they don't really have a healthy fear of the police, they expect us to play by the rules and take our lumps. Sometimes they don't get shot and sometimes they do. Why chance it?

icrazylegs:

Any decent police officer knows any situation can turn from sugar to shit in an instant. You sound like any know it all citizen I run across, ""I wasn't there but...."" I pray for the police officers in this situation and the hardworking memebers of that community that have to put up with this.

rodan:

What a mess! I hope the officer involved is cleared.

GRPrecon:

So a cop, doesn't matter if white or black, with a six year service record that was clean according to the chief just decided one day to gun down a black man for walking in the street? Yeah ok. These people are incredibly ignorant. They are going to hang this cop some way some how. The altar of political correctness and racial grievances knows no bounds.

 This post tries to strike more of a middle ground:

Commando5368:

Yeah, I'm an old guy too, lot's of things have changed since the 70's, some good and some not so good. No matter what, we always seem to hear the same old cries of ""us against them"" whenever these incidents occur. 

I'm a long way from being a bleeding heart, but we owe it to the next generation of coppers coming after us to do our best today. Not live in the past or recite the wrongs of our nation, but to really try and make this country a better place.

As long as we treat these people like animals, then animal type behavior is what we should expect from them. Most of them are just trying to feed their family and get through the day.

In the days that followed, the community has seen massive protests, and the police have responded with an overwhelming ""show of force"": {Heavily-armed SWAT officers wearing military-style uniforms and riding in large armored trucks have tried to keep protesters at bay}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8”>.

Many have been disturbed by the images coming out of Ferguson, which show some officers pointing rifles at unarmed civilians.

The book {""Rise of the Warrior Cop,""}<hyperlink=”http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Warrior-Cop-Militarization-Americas/dp/1610392116”> by journalist Radley Balko, helps explain how these types of police forces have been used more frequently, and departments across America have become more militarized in the post-9/11 era.

This is an excerpt from the book:

On November 2, 2002, a large group of police officers in tactical gear descended on a rave party in Racine, Wisconsin. The cops kicked in doors, dragged young people from bathroom stalls, threw others to the floor, and held dozens more at gunpoint.

The police issued more than 450 citations of $968 each to partygoers merely for attending an event where some attendees were breaking the state’s drug laws. Only three people were arrested on actual drug charges. With help from the ACLU, the city of Racine eventually dismissed the charges against all attendees who hadn’t yet pleaded guilty.

The trendy new drug throwing the media and politicians into hysterics was Ecstasy. Raves were the new, weird, and different dance parties where teenagers were allegedly taking this crazy sex drug. Cue the moral panic, political grandstanding, and ensuing aggressive crackdown. Prior to the raid in Racine, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware seemed particularly obsessed with rave parties. Politicians seemed to think that any party with techno music, pulsing lights, and neon inevitably degenerated into underage kids getting high on Ecstasy and engaging in mass orgies.

In the summer of 2002, Biden was pushing his RAVE Act, an absurdly broad law that would have made venue and club owners liable for running a drug operation if they merely sold the “paraphernalia” common to parties where people took Ecstasy — accessories like bottled water and glow sticks. After attempting to sneak the bill through Congress with various parliamentary maneuvers, Biden was finally able to get a slightly modified version folded into the bill that created the Amber Alert for missing children.

Once again a politician had demagogued worries over a mostly harmless drug into a climate of fear. And once again that fear led to aggressive, wholly disproportionate crackdowns across the country.

A few years later, a rave raid was captured on video. In August 2005, more than 90 police officers from several state and local SWAT teams raided 1,500 people at a peaceful, outdoor dance party in Spanish Fork Canyon, Utah. The police were armed with assault weapons, full SWAT attire, police dogs, and tear gas. Many in attendance say that police beat, abused, and swore at partygoers.

Police denied the allegations, though amateur video/audio clearly showed the police barking out orders punctuated with profanity. In truth, the party appeared to have been pretty well run. Private security guards had been stationed outside the event, and confiscated any illegal drugs they found on attendees. The raiding SWAT cops then arrested the private security guards for the drugs they had confiscated, and charged them with possession.

The other new concept at work in Racine and Spanish Fork was the willingness to subject large groups of people to commando tactics in hopes of catching even a few offenders. By the late 2000s, SWAT teams were increasingly called out to raid entire bars and nightclubs for drug activity. A search warrant for a bar’s owner or a description of the place as a drug market could allow police to go in and give the SWAT treatment to everyone inside.

And it wasn’t just bars and nightclubs that were treated this way. In November 2003, police in Goose Creek, South Carolina, raided an entire high school, conducting a blanket commando-style raid on Stratford High School. Students were ordered at gunpoint to lie face-down on the floor while police searched their lockers and persons for drugs. Some were handcuffed, while K-9 units deployed dogs to search their lockers, backpacks, and bodies. Oddly, media reports indicated that the school had a stellar academic reputation.

Le’Quan Simpson, a fourteen-year-old, was forced to kneel at gunpoint. His father had once served on a SWAT team. “They hit that school like it was a crack house,” he said. “Like they knew that there were crack dealers in there armed with guns.” The raid was based on a tip from the school’s principal that a single student might have been selling pot. The raid turned up no illicit drugs, and the police made no arrests.

Still, though these raids of schools and parties were somewhat new, drug cops had been conducting massive drug sweeps of entire neighborhoods for years, subjecting innocent people to violent tactics simply because of where they happened to live. There were more of those police actions too.

In February 2002, for example, one hundred Durham police officers, two National Guard helicopters, and ten North Carolina Bureau of Investigation agents seized an entire neighborhood on Cheek Road, then engaged in a series of forced-entry drug raids. They called the whole episode Operation TAPS, short for The Aggressive Police Strategy. The police arrested thirty-five people and confiscated an “undisclosed” amount of drugs, plus two pistols. Superior Court judge Orlando Hudson later threw out all the arrests and evidence, ruling that the entire operation was unconstitutional and “partially illegal” and that some of the officers’ behavior amounted to “criminal conduct.""

One particularly aggressive action peppered with war rhetoric occurred in April 2006, when police in Buffalo, New York, staged a series of drug raids throughout the city under the moniker Operation Shock and Awe. They borrowed the phrase from the US military, which had used it to describe its strategy in the early days of the Iraq War. Shock and Awe in Buffalo meant thirty-eight SWAT raids over three days. The cops even invited along a couple of reporters from the Buffalo News to cover the invasion.

A month later, the Buffalo News ran a follow-up report. The original six pounds of marijuana police claimed to have found was actually four pounds, thirteen ounces. Three and a half pounds of that came by way of an unrelated traffic stop on the same day that had nothing to do with the raids. They found all of five guns. Not surprisingly, the revised haul wasn’t enough contraband to keep the seventy-eight people in jail. Sixteen were immediately released with no criminal charges. Another thirty-two were out of jail within twenty-four hours due to insufficient evidence.

City leaders were furious, not because city police had just terrorized innocent people with fruitless SWAT raids, but because so many petty offenders were let off. City officials demanded tougher drug laws, and discussed the possibility of sending drug cops and SWAT teams out with housing code inspectors to clean up suspected crack houses without those pesky Fourth Amendment warrant requirements.

Buffalo’s chief of detectives, Dennis Richards, told the newspaper that Operation Shock and Awe was “just the beginning.” “There will certainly be more raids in the future,” he said. “You can count on that. . . . We’re looking at small-scale, large-scale, street-level. . . . We’re looking at top to bottom.""",5,NA,NA,Rise of The Warrior Cop

Ferguson has seen a wave of protests following the Saturday death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, an unarmed black man who was shot and killed by a still-unnamed Ferguson police officer.

... I had spoken to police officers who knew we were there. We had had discussions with them. We understood this was as far as we could get in terms of where the protest was going on, about a mile up the road. So, we didn’t think there would be any problems here so we were very surprised ...

We were very close to where those [tear gas] canisters were shot from. We yelled, as you heard there [on the video]. We were yelling that we were press. But they continued to fire. We retreated about half a block into the neighborhood, until we could get out of that situation.”

Marla Cichowski, a field producer at Al Jazeera America, gave her side of the situation in the same statement: 

We were clearly set up as press with a full live shot set up. As soon as first bullet hit the car we screamed out loud, ""We are press,’ ‘This is media.""

Police that were there at the intersection directing traffic earlier knew we were there. We never drove around the police barricade.

There was another station local NBC parked across the street from us the whole time.

The two were covering {ongoing protests}<hyperlinks=”http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/protests-turn-violent-ferguson-day-five”> against police over Saturday's fatal shooting of an unarmed young black man, Michael Brown.

""There is a lot of unanswered questions here, but I do know this,"" Scarborough said. ""When a police officer asks you to pick up -- I've been in places where police officers said, 'All right, you know what? This is cordoned off, you guys need to move along.' You know what I do? I go, 'Yes, sir,' or 'Yes, ma'am.' I don't sit there and have a debate and film the police officer, unless I want to get on TV and have people talk about me the next day.""

Scarborough acknowledged that he'd probably get a lot of flak for saying that, but repeated that ""next time a police officer tells you that you've got to move along because you've got riots outside, well, you probably should move along.""

""I didn't see any evidence that there were riots outside that McDonald's,"" the New York Times' Nick Confessore chimed in.

""I wasn't there either,"" Scarborough said. ""I don't know why the police officers were there. I know it's bad out there.""

He went on to insist that the officers were likely just following orders in telling the reporters to clear the area and faulted the journalists for {recording the encounter}<hyperlink=”http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/video-washington-post-reporter-detained-ferguson”> instead of packing up in a timely fashion.

""Am I a sucker for when the police officer comes in and says 'Hey, we need you to move along?' Am I a sucker for actually listening and moving along, or should I sit there and question him?"" Scarborough later asked. ""By the way, what was he packing up? If he was packing up our entire control room, that's fine. He had a freakin' laptop. Come on! 'Oh, wait, I'm packing up, officer, let me ask you a question.' I'm sorry.""

Lowery didn't take kindly to the MSNBC host's criticism.

""Well I would invite Joe Scarborough to come down to Ferguson and get out of 30 Rock where he's sitting and sipping his Starbucks smugly,"" he told CNN's Kate Bolduan Thursday morning. ""I invite him to come and talk to the residents of Ferguson, where I've been since Monday afternoon having tear gas shot at me, having rubber bullets shot at me ... I would invite Joe Scarborough down here to do some reporting on the ground, then maybe we can have an educated conversation about what's happening here.""

""Things are on fire, this community is on edge,"" he added. ""There's so much happening here and instead of putting more reporters on the ground we have people like Joe Scarborough who are running their mouth and who have no idea what they're talking about.""",NA,NA,NA,TPM

""There is never excuse for violence against the police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" Obama said, taking a break from his vacation in Martha's Vineyard. ""There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.""

The protests started after the death of an African-American teen, Michael Brown, during an encounter with police officers last Saturday.

Obama said he tasked Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate Brown's ""heartbreaking and tragic"" death and expressed confidence in Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) to handle the situation. The president also said the American public should look forward.

""I know many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we’ve seen in the heartland of our country,"" Obama said. ""Today, I’d like us all to take a step back and think about how we’re going to be moving forward ... Let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law, a basic respect for public order, and the right to peaceful public protest.""

Obama concluded by calling for ""calm"" in the chaotic streets of Ferguson.

""It doesn't look good. It's a PR nightmare if nothing else, and it just stirs people up.""

Tensions between Ferguson cops and Ferguson residents actually started long before the shooting {death last weekend of Michael Brown}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-mo-michael-brown-shooting-2014-8”> days before he was supposed to start college. The city is {67% black}<hyperlink=”http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/29/2923986.html”>, but only three out of 53 police officers in the city are African-American, {The New York Times notes}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/opinion/racial-history-behind-the-ferguson-protests.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22%7D&_r=0”>. There is evidence of racial profiling in the city, as The Times notes that blacks account for 87% of traffic stops in Ferguson.

""It started years before this ... The shooting is just the spark that ignites it,"" said Drago, who after his retirement from the police force served as a senior law enforcement adviser to former Florida governor Charlie Crist.

Since the shooting, there have been missteps, Drago says, by Ferguson police and the St. Louis County Police Department, which helped handle the protests and is {overseeing an investigation into Brown's death}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting.html”>.

The public has questioned the police's version of the shooting. While the police say Brown assaulted the officer who shot him, a witness {said Brown was shot in the back}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/police-fire-tear-gas-on-al-jazeera-america-tv-crew-and-then-take-their-equipment-2014-8”> and repeatedly said he did not have a gun.

The lack of transparency in the investigation has also added to the mistrust residents feel toward their police officers, as police have refused to name the officer who shot Brown, citing concern for the officer's safety.

When ""the police department tightens and batters down the hatches, [it] makes things so much worse,"" Drago said, adding that it should not be a surprise when such a tense community ""rises up.""

“It’s a textbook example of how not to handle the situation,” St. Louis City Councilman Antonio French {told The New York Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html”>, referring to the general police response in the aftermath of the shooting. “Ferguson has a white government and a white mayor but a large black population. This situation has brought out whatever rifts were between that minority community and the Ferguson government.”

""It sends a message that you're trying to cover things up,"" Drago said. Instead, he said, police officers should work with the media to help disseminate as much information as possible to help quell rumors and rebuild trust.

Arrests, especially of protesters, should generally be a last resort, as should the use of tear gas, Drago says.

""The whole idea is to protect property and life but allow people to protest peacefully as much as you can. Sometimes you need to give them the street,"" he said.

Unfortunately, the police — who have worn riot gear for protection — are not going to do much to build a relationship with the community while the protests are actually going on.

""It's kind of like Israel and Gaza, trying to get them to stop while they're fighting,"" Drago said. ""The police are not going to resolve it in the streets with tear gas for sure.""",51,NA,NA,NA

Paul, a libertarian-minded politician eyeing a potential presidential campaign in 2016, said police forces are in something of an arms race and competing with one another to have the best weapons.

""There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement. Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem.

""Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday called for peace on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer and urged authorities to be transparent in their investigation.

""Now is the time for healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,"" Obama told reporters on Martha's Vineyard, where he is vacationing with his family. ""Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done.""

Protesters have gathered every night in Ferguson, the mostly black suburb of St. Louis, since Michael Brown was fatally shot on Saturday during what authorities said was a struggle over a gun in a police car. Some witnesses say he was outside the car with his hands up.

Obama said he had asked the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate the killing independently.

He said he expressed concern to Missouri Governor Jay Nixon about violence in the wake of the shooting and noted he had asked Attorney General Eric Holder and the U.S. attorney on the scene to report back to him in the coming days about the investigation.

""We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heart-breaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again,"" Obama said.

""When something like this happens, the local authorities, including the police, have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death and how they are protecting the people in their communities.""

Obama said there was never an excuse for looting or violence against police. But he also made a point of saying there was no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protesters or to throw people, including journalists, in jail for exercising their rights under the U.S. Constitution.

""We all need to hold ourselves to a high standard,"" Obama said.

The Missouri incident recalls Obama's emotional reaction to the shooting of Trayvon Martin, the black teenager who was shot to death by a white Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012.

Obama, the first black U.S. president, compared Martin to a son he did not have and urged ""soul searching"" over how the incident occurred.

The president has faced criticism since arriving on Martha's Vineyard for spending time golfing or partying with friends while U.S. forces were active in Iraq and mayhem erupted in Ferguson.

The White House rejects that criticism and has said Obama continues to do his job while having some down time to relax. Shortly after completing his statement on the situations in Ferguson and Iraq, Obama went golfing with friends.",NA,NA,NA,Reuters

Jackson also said that military-style vehicles will remain if protestors start throwing fire bombs, destroying property, or shooting guns.

View Holder's full statement below:

""This morning, I met with President Obama to discuss the events in Ferguson, Missouri. Like the President, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of Michael Brown.  While his death has understandably caused heartache within the community, it is clear that the scenes playing out in the streets of Ferguson over the last several nights cannot continue.
 
""For one thing, while the vast majority of protests have been peaceful, acts of violence by members of the public cannot be condoned. Looting and willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers who are genuinely trying to protect the public do nothing to remember the young man who has died. Such conduct is unacceptable and must be unequivocally condemned.
 
""By the same token, the law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them. Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.
 
""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message. At my direction, Department officials have conveyed these concerns to local authorities. Also at my direction, the Department is offering – through our COPS office and Office of Justice Programs – technical assistance to local authorities in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force. The local authorities in Missouri have accepted this offer of assistance as of this afternoon.
 
""Department officials from the Community Relations Service are also on the ground in Missouri to help convene law enforcement officials and civic and faith leaders to plot out steps to reduce tensions in the community. The latest such meeting was convened in Ferguson as recently as this morning. Over time, these conversations should consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities.

In their letter, Rep. John Conyers (D-Michigan), Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Virginia), and Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tennessee) said the situation in Ferguson raised the question of whether ""local law enforcement is out of control.""

""For five days the citizens of Ferguson have protested the killing of an unarmed teenager by local police. Last night, law enforcement broke up the protest with brutal force: confronting demonstrators in riot gear and armored vehicles, arresting journalists, and firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowds,"" the congressmen wrote. ""These incidents raise concerns that local law enforcement is out of control and, instead of protecting the safety and civil liberties of the residents of Ferguson, is employing tactics that violate the rights of citizens and hinder the ability of the press to report on their actions.""

Conyers, Scott, and Cohen cited three isusues they said were highlighted by the situation in Ferguson.

Firstly, they said the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown on Saturday, which started the protests, was part of ""a continuing pattern of the use of deadly force by police against unarmed African Americans."" Secondly, they pointed to what they described as a ""series of troubling arrests in Ferguson."" Specifically, the congressmen pointed to the arrests of two reporters and an alderman from St. Louis, Missouri on Wednesday evening. However, in addition to these three specific incidents, they cited reports they described as having raised ""questions about the legitimacy of all arrests made during the course of these protests. Lastly, the congressman said Ferguson has highlighted the need to ""address the extensive militarization of state and local police.""

""The use of overwhelming force by police against unarmed citizens requires our urgent attention,"" the congressmen wrote. ""It is imperative the Committee convene to examine these issues as soon as possible.""

American law enforcement decked out in military fatigues, patrolling the streets in armored vehicles that look like they were plucked out of Afghanistan or Iraq.

And the thing is, they very well might have been. The Ferguson and St. Louis County police departments have both received equipment from the U.S. military through what's known as the 1033 program, a federal program that the American Civil Liberties Union says has been a key catalyst to the broader escalation of law enforcement force in the United States.

The 1033 program, which was approved by Congress in 1992 to help law enforcement fight the war on drugs and was expanded in 1997, allows police departments to request and receive refurbished military equipment from the U.S. Defense Department free of charge. That equipment can range from night vision goggles to military-grade firearms and armored vehicles. The ACLU {estimated}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf”> in June 2014 that 500 MRAP vehicles, built to withstand roadside bombs, are now in the hands of American law enforcement.

Ferguson and St. Louis County, which has taken the lead in addressing the protests since the Saturday police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, have obtained equipment through the 1033 program. David Mastio {reported}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-michael-brown-militarization-column/14006383/”> for USA Today that Ferguson police had received two vehicles, a trailer and a generator through the program in November 2013. Newsweek {reported}<hyperlink=”http://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537”> Thursday that the St. Louis County police had been given nine utility trucks and two cargo trailers since 2012.

TPM has requested further information from the Defense Logistics Agency, which administers the 1033 program. The agency {stated}<hyperlink=”http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/default.aspx”> on its website that nearly $450 million worth of equipment were distributed nationwide in 2013.

""It's a culture of militarism. We determined that the police in America have become excessively militarized,"" Kara Dansky, senior counsel for the ACLU, told TPM. The organization released a {report}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf”> on police militarization in June 2012. ""It's dangerous because it undermines public trust in law enforcement. It makes it difficult for them to effectively police their communities.""

""It certainly plays a significant role,"" Danksy added of the 1033 program. And another ACLU finding seems particularly resonant in the wake of Ferguson, sparked by the shooting of an African-American teen and confrontations between a largely white police force and a black community.

According to the group's analysis of 800 SWAT deployments, minority groups are disproportionately the target of these military-style units. The report concluded that more than 50 percent of the people impacted in the deployments it analyzed were black or Latino.

Police in Ferguson have defended the tactics and equipment used in confrontations with protesters. The {Associated Press}<hyperlink=”http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/breaking-news/index.ssf/2014/08/battle_of_ferguson_mo_continue.html”>, among others, have reported of gunfire directed at officers, stones being thrown and protesters attempting to light Molotov cocktails to throw at police, which police cited as part of the need for the equipment.

""People have bombs now,"" Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson told reporters Wednesday when asked about the military-style equipment.

The images from Ferguson have already brought increased scrutiny and questions about the 1033 program specifically and the general militarization of American law enforcement. More than 17,000 agencies participate in the program, the ACLU reported. ""This is America, not a war zone,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) {tweeted}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/499904279961149440”> Thursday.

But part of the problem with the program, according to the ACLU, is a lack of transparency and oversight. Few restrictions are placed on what equipment law enforcement can request or how they use it. The organization concluded that the only significant restriction placed on departments is that they not sell whatever equipment they receive. In fact, departments are required to use the equipment that they receive within one year, which Dansky said could actually incentive the use of the equipment even when it's unnecessary.

""The program contains a built-in incentive,"" she said. ""As these local police departments receive this equipment, there are no meaningful constraints on their ability to use it.""

""If all you have is a hammer,"" she added, ""everything looks like a nail.""

And the 1033 program isn't the only program that's contributed to police militarization, Dansky added. The Byrne Justice Assistance Grants program annually {provides}<hyperlink=”http://www.ncjp.org/byrne_jag”> up to $500 million toward local law enforcement, some of which is spent on the same kind of equipment funneled to police departments by the 1033 program. The nearly $1 billion Homeland Security grant program also helps pay for military-style gear, though Danksky cautioned that it is difficult to determine how much of the total funding goes toward this kind of equipment.

One other element seems particularly relevant to the events in Ferguson. The 1033 program and other federal funding streams for military gear has been particularly instrumental in militarizing smaller law enforcement agencies like Ferguson and St. Louis County. Urban departments are more likely to have already obtained this kind of equipment. But 1033 and these other programs have made them available to almost any department that wants them.

""I have heard police officers say that there is no way small police departments would have access to this kind of weaponry were it not for the 1033 program and other federal funding streams,"" Dansky said.

But with the events in Ferguson, more scrutiny could be coming to the 1033 program and its counterparts. Public officials ranging from the liberal Warren to tea party favorite Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) have {condemned}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/499740253633388546”> the tactics being deployed in the last few days. Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA) has now {introduced}<hyperlink=”http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/hank-johnson-stop-militarizing-law-enforcement-act”> legislation that would ban some high-grade equipment like the bomb-resistant MRAP vehicles and require more rigorous oversight by the Defense Department.

The images coming out of Ferguson could be critical in instigating the debate. Dansky and others have noted that police militarization dates back to the 1980s. But the prevalence of social media and its ability to share the kind of images that {caused}<hyperlink=”http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/the-derp-and-the-horror”> TPM's Josh Marshall to ask ""Ferguson or Fallujah"" have made the issue more difficult to ignore.

""It has become increasingly difficult — if not impossible — to distinguish between law enforcement officers on the ground,"" Dansky said, ""and soldiers fighting overseas.""",NA,NA,NA,TPM

No potential White House contender has commented more forcefully than Sen.

The other leading candidates, including Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), have been more reserved in their rhetoric. Rubio told Business Insider in a statement that he was ""very concerned"" about the violence and the arrests of two reporters Wednesday night in particular.

""Michael Brown's family is in my prayers during this terrible time in their lives. I'm very concerned by recent events in Ferguson, including the violence that has gripped that community and the inexplicable jailing of two reporters. As the FBI looks into allegations regarding the police department there, I hope Americans all over the country will voice their opinions through peaceful means and not resort to violence,"" Rubio said.

Cruz's statement, {published in a Facebook post}<hyperlink=”https://www.facebook.com/SenatorTedCruz/posts/593610474084590”> earlier in the day, also focused on the {jailed journalists}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-police-chief-freaked-after-cops-arrested-reporters-2014-8”>.

""All of our prayers are with the citizens of Ferguson, that the violence will subside and peace will restored. Reporters should never be detained — a free press is too important — simply for doing their jobs. Civil liberties must be protected, but violence is not the answer. Once the unrest is brought to an end, we should examine carefully what happened to ensure that justice is served,"" Cruz said.

Business Insider's requests for comment to other top Republicans — including 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), and Congressman Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) — received no response.

On the Democratic side of the aisle, front-runner Hillary Clinton's office acknowledged the inquiry but did not offer further comment. Two potential Clinton challengers — Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) and former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D) — did not return requests for comment. However, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), who has repeatedly said she is not running for president yet is still mentioned as a potential contender, strongly condemned the police militarization over Twitter.

The protests were often tense, as heavily armed police with rifles, body armor, and gas masks squared off against a large crowd of demonstrators chanting and marching. Some, as St. Louis Post-Dispatch's {David Carson observed}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/pictures-ferguson-protests-2014-8”>, threw rocks, bottles, and Molotov cocktails.

“When I see a young lady cry because of fear of this uniform, that’s a problem.” Capt. Johnson told Lowery as he marched with the protesters. “We’ve got to solve that.”

Perhaps no other photo captures the incredible change in mood than one tweeted by USA Today's Yamiche Alcindor, which shows an ideal interaction between community residents and the police:

Twitter compiled every geotagged tweet that mentioned Ferguson and plugged them all into one map. What begins as an area tragedy in the Midwest on Aug. 9 evolves into a national news story by Aug. 11. If the blips are any indication, Ferguson was a trending topic in North America and Europe for most of the week, and a topic of conversation across every continent on the planet.

I could be reading too much into the map function, but it appears that the arrests of the Huffington Post's Ryan J.

(Reuters) - Protests over the shooting of an unarmed black teen in Missouri were boisterous but peaceable on Thursday night as a small number of state police, led by a newly appointed black captain, replaced riot gear-clad local forces and mingled with the crowd.

Missouri's governor Jay Nixon hours earlier put Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson in charge of security in the town of Ferguson after almost a week of clashes between protesters and police firing tear gas and stun grenades. Dozens of people have been arrested amid looting, shooting and vandalism.

In a tactical U-turn, Johnson and a handful of black officers without body armor walked among thousands of protesters filling the streets of the mostly black St. Louis suburb, demanding justice for the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

""We just want to be able to come and demonstrate together without the fear of being shot. It's that simple,"" said 53-year-old protester Cat Daniels, an Iraq veteran. ""What you see tonight is people coming together. When that kid was killed the hurt and the pain was real.""

Mark Hall, a 21-year-old student, said: ""I'm so happy they left us alone so we could prove that all we wanted was the opportunity to exercise our rights peacefully ... a chance to be heard.""

In the forecourt of a gas station burned out during this week's rioting, a cowboy rode a horse and a group of children danced on pavement covered in chalk drawings with the words: ""Now the world knows your name, RIP Mike.""

Elsewhere drivers honked horns and waved signs in solidarity and one group of demonstrators even took to the streets on a car-sized replica of fictional steam train Thomas The Tank Engine.

""It's because of this young man right here,"" Johnson told a CNN reporter, as the captain held up a picture of Brown to shouts of approval from protesters around him. ""It's about the justice for everyone.""

The protests have cast a spotlight on racial tensions in greater St. Louis, where civil rights groups have complained in the past that police racially profiled blacks, arrested a disproportionate number of them and had racist hiring practices.

Two thirds of the town's population of 21,000 are black while 50 of its 53-strong police force are white.

Brown's shooting galvanized a national moment of silence and rallies in other U.S. cities.

In New York, a large crowd briefly overwhelmed a small police presence in Union Square park, forcing officers to scramble to close one of Manhattan's major thoroughfares. Local media showed a handful of protesters being arrested.

In St. Louis, CNN footage showed hundreds of people peacefully assembled in the shadow of the renowned Gateway Arch, Brown's mother and other family members among them.

Seeking to defuse the situation, U.S. President Barack Obama had called on police to respect peaceful demonstrations.

Nixon said Ferguson lately ""has looked a little bit more like a war zone, and that is unacceptable"".

Police have pledged to do better but have also justified the tough tactics, saying they have responded to the threat of violence during protests.

""WHAT'S HIS NAME?""

Protesters have decried what they say is a lack of transparency from police investigating Saturday's shooting, including the refusal to name of the officer responsible.

On Thursday night in Ferguson, about 200 demonstrators chanted, ""What's his name? What's his name?'"" at Johnson and the St. Louis County police chief, Jon Belmar.

Police said they plan to release the officer's name on Friday, according to CNN and Los Angeles Times reports.

Some critics have also called for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCullough to be removed from the case.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement that police had accepted an offer of technical assistance from the Justice Department on crowd control and public safety ""without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force"".

A law enforcement official told Reuters that Holder expressed his personal condolences for their son's death in a phone call with Brown's parents and promised the department would conduct a full, independent civil rights investigation.

Early on Thursday, a member of the Anonymous hacker activist collective tweeted the name of a person alleged to be the police officer who shot Brown. But police and other Anonymous tweeters said the activist had named the wrong person.

Protests in Ferguson have calmed down since Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon brought in the State Highway Patrol to take over security operations in the St. Louis suburb. Capt. Ron Johnson, who grew up near Ferguson, is now overseeing policing of the protests.

The protests broke out after Brown, who was unarmed, was shot and killed on Saturday. His friend, who was a witness to the shooting, said he had his hands up when he was shot, but the police say Brown lunged for the officer's gun.

Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white man and six-year veteran of the police force, was identified as the officer.

The police report from a convenience-store robbery that happened on Saturday names Brown as a suspect. He and friend Dorian Johnson, {who witnessed Brown's shooting}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/eye-witness-account-of-michael-browns-shooting-2014-8”>, were allegedly trying to steal cigars.

There was allegedly an altercation between Brown and a person who appears to be a store clerk as Brown was attempting to steal from the store, according to the report.

Wilson encountered Brown at about 12:01 p.m., Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said on Friday. Brown had been shot by the time a second officer arrived on scene at 12:04 p.m.

A description of the alleged convenience-store robber was dispatched on police radio as Wilson was in the area, Jackson said. Shortly after, Wilson stopped Brown nearby.

Here's the police report:

Police also provided stills from the convenience-store surveillance camera:

Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said the department released surveillance video and a police report from the robbery earlier today because media had requested the footage and documents.

""The initial contact between the officer and Mr. Brown was not related to the robbery,"" Jackson said at the news conference this afternoon.

Jackson also said that he wasn't sure whether officer Darren Wilson was aware of the robbery at all when he stopped Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown when the alleged robbery took place.

In an earlier news conference Friday morning, however, Jackson did not make clear that the incidents were unrelated. He said radio dispatchers had reported the robbery and a suspect description shortly before Wilson encountered Brown.

Wilson reportedly stopped Brown and Johnson because they were walking in the middle of the street and blocking traffic, Jackson said.

It's unclear exactly what happened after that, but Wilson shot and killed 18-year-old Brown, who was unarmed. Police say Brown lunged for Wilson's gun, but Johnson says Brown had his hands up when he was shot.

Police have not released any report related to the actual shooting.

Three teenagers from Georgia have decided to take the issue into their own hands.

Caleb Christian, 14, and his two sisters — Ima, 16, and Asha, 15 — are about to roll out an app called ""Five-O,"" which will let users document police abuse and join together as a community to problem-solve.

""We’ve been hearing about the negative instances in the news, for instance most recently the Michael Brown case, and we always talk about these issues with our parents,"" Ima Christian told Business Insider. ""They always try to reinforce that we should focus on solutions. It's important to talk about the issues, but they try to make us focus on finding solutions. That made us think why don't we create an app to help us solve this problem.""

Five-O lets users submit the details of any incident of police abuse and rate the specific officer. The app also has community boards for different counties so that users can communicate and plan responses to any difficulties with local police.

The idea is to collect data that users can then bring to community activists, the media, and other forms of law enforcement. That way, it's not just ""he said, she said,"" Caleb said.

And they're hoping to illuminate both the negative and the positive interactions users have with police officers. They want the good examples to serve as motivation for officers to do better.

But don't be fooled by these teenagers' young age. They are determined to make a difference.

""You’re never too young to learn, and you're never too young to make a difference,"" Caleb said.

The Christian siblings all have a strong background in coding, which made it possible for them to create Five-O along with two other apps (Coily and Froshly), all under their app development company called {Pinetart Inc}<hyperlink=”http://pinetartinc.com/”>. Caleb, Ima, and Asha all participated in MIT's k12 Scratch and App Inventor program, and with their parents' encouragement (both have backgrounds in technology), continued to learn JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java.

Five-O will be available on August 18 for both iOS and Android devices.

The unarmed black teenager was shot Saturday in Ferguson, Missouri as he was walking with his friend Dorian Johnson. Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white man and six-year veteran of the police force, has been identified as the officer who shot Brown.

Authorities have not yet released a report about the shooting itself, but we've assembled a timeline of what we know so far. It will be updated as we learn more.

11:48 a.m.: Wilson responds to a call about a sick child.

11:51 a.m. (approximate): Police {received a call reporting a robbery}<hyperlink=”http://www.scribd.com/doc/236913666/Michael-Brown-Police-Report”> at a convenience store in Ferguson.

The suspect, who has been identified as Brown, allegedly grabbed a box of Swisher Sweets cigars and turned to leave without paying for them. Someone in the store tried to stop Brown, but then Brown grabbed him and pushed him away. Brown and Johnson left the store.

11:54 a.m.: An officer arrived at the convenience store and got a description of the suspect from an employee and a customer. The witnesses said the suspect (Brown) was wearing a white T-shirt, khaki shorts, yellow socks, and a red Cardinals baseball hat. The employee said Brown and Johnson walked off in the direction of a nearby QuikTrip store.

Police dispatched this information over the radio. The officer who responded to the call could not find Brown or Johnson when he went out looking for them near the store.

12:00 p.m.: Wilson leaves the scene of the sick-child call.

12:01 p.m.: Wilson encounters Brown and Johnson walking down the middle of a street near the convenience store. He stops them for blocking traffic.

12:04 p.m.: Another officer arrives on scene. By this time, Brown has been shot.

Johnson has admitted to his lawyer that Brown took the cigars at the convenience store.

He has also spoken about the shooting, saying Wilson told him and Brown to get on the ground, then grabbed Brown's neck and tried to pull him into the squad car, {according to}<hyperlink=”http://bigstory.ap.org/article/turmoil-tear-gas-give-way-hope-ferguson”> the Associated Press. Wilson then reportedly took out his weapon and shot Brown. 

Johnson also claims that Brown had his hands up and started to run away as the officer continued shooting at him.

The local police tell a different story. They claim that either Brown or Johnson pushed Wilson into the cop car and assaulted him while inside, according to the AP. Police say Brown reached for Wilson's gun during the altercation. At least one shot was reportedly fired before the trio got out of the car and the altercation continued on the street, according to this account.",7,NA,NA,NA
BusinessInsider,bus52,http://www.businessinsider.com/police-officer-body-cameras-2014-8,Every Police Officer Should Wear A Camera At All Times,Reihan Salam,8/15/2014,11/11/2015,"If you’ve ever had the distinct displeasure of calling a customer service hotline, you’ve probably heard a soothing voice tell you that “this call may be monitored for quality assurance purposes.” It can be comforting to know that there is, in theory, at least, someone out there monitoring customer service representatives who make life more difficult rather than less. Customer service representatives dealing with abusive customers can take comfort in this kind of monitoring too, as it can shield them from false accusations of bad behavior. By reviewing recordings of calls gone wrong and calls gone right, meanwhile, trainees can learn from the sometimes trying experiences of others. What’s not to like?

Thankfully, the stakes of customer service interactions tend to be pretty low. You might think that getting a small instead of an extra-small in the mail is a bona fide calamity, but no one else does. The same can’t be said about interactions between armed police officers and civilians, which can be a matter of life and death. The turmoil in Ferguson, Missouri, vividly reminds us that while most of these interactions go smoothly, far too many of them spiral out of control. We know little about the exact circumstances surrounding the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. But had the police officer who shot and killed Brown been obligated to wear a video recording device, there is at least some reason to believe that Brown would still be alive.

Over the past few years, the idea of requiring that police officers make use of so-called “body cams” has gained currency. Note that this is quite different from simply {allowing civilians}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/02/18/good-news-and-bad-news-on-recording-the-police/”> to record on-duty police officers, a right that shouldn’t even be {in dispute}<hyperlink=”https://reason.com/archives/2010/09/20/how-to-record-the-cops”>. Instead of waiting for a world in which every civilian records every encounter with the police, at least some students of law enforcement have argued that police forces themselves should move in this direction. Last fall,Guardian correspondent Rory Carroll {reported}<hyperlink=”http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/california-police-body-cameras-cuts-violence-complaints-rialto”> on the small southern California city of Rialto, where the local police department has affixed small body cams to all of its officers. The results were dramatic. Carroll cites a {jaw-dropping study}<hyperlink=”http://www.policefoundation.org/sites/g/files/g798246/f/201303/The%20Effect%20of%20Body-Worn%20Cameras%20on%20Police%20Use-of-Force.pdf”>, which found that in the year following the introduction of the body cams in February 2012, public complaints fell by 88 percent while officers’ use of force fell by 60 percent.

The success of the Rialto experiment makes intuitive sense. When we know that we are being observed, it affects our behavior in all kinds of ways. We become more aware of how others might judge our behavior, so we feel a not-so-subtle pressure to act in socially acceptable, rule-following ways. Moreover, the existence of a video recording allows police officers to revisit exactly how they performed in high-pressure situations. Our capacity to remember past events is notoriously faulty. There is a universal human tendency to fixate on some things while neglecting others. Video recordings can help correct for these deficiencies. In instances where something does go wrong—due to malice on the part of the police, a civilian, or something else entirely—the video provides a record that can help investigators sort out how things really came unstuck. In politically sensitive cases, in which all sides fear getting railroaded, a black box of this kind would be a godsend.

Granted, Rialto is not a major metropolis, and some will no doubt dismiss the success of its body cam initiative as a fluke, or one not easily repeatable in a big, bustling city. Even Bill de Blasio, the New York City mayor who came to office on the strength of his opposition to heavy-handed stop-and-frisk policing, has {hesitated}<hyperlink=”http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/08/8550154/city-maintains-not-quite-yet-position-nypd-cameras”> to require that NYPD officers wear body cams, insisting that “it’s not something that has been perfected yet.” The American Civil Liberties Union, however, has {endorsed the idea}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all?redirect=technology-and-liberty/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all#control”>, giving it much-needed liberal street cred. And now the Michael Brown shooting has led {a cavalcade of commentators}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/AdamSerwer/status/499910157103812608”>, mostly but not exclusively on the left, to speak out in favor of the idea. Given time, it’s easy to imagine body cams becoming standard-issue for police officers in the near future.

But why stop at video recording the police? While I will happily concede that video recording is particularly important for the police, in light of their ability to use deadly force, there are many public servants who have considerable power over others and who are shielded from scrutiny in the absence of video recording.

Public school teachers and administrators are the most obvious example. In March, the Justice Department issued {an alarming report}<hyperlink=”http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/expansive-survey-americas-public-schools-reveals-troubling-racial-disparities”> on racial disparities in school discipline policies. For example, while black children represent only 18 percent of all children attending preschool, 42 percent of all preschool students suspended once are black, as are 48 percent of children suspended more than once. Video recordings could surface whether teachers are systematically biased against black students, if they are disciplining students in an entirely race-neutral way, or if the truth lies somewhere in between. Investigators could identify patterns that could help inform how teachers are trained to manage their classrooms.

What’s more, video recording could allow teachers to evaluate their own progress, and to share their experiences with other teachers who can help them think through {how to improve their performances}<hyperlink=”http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_teachers_need_real_feedback/transcript”>. Teachers unions and their allies, however, are {not keen on the idea}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/05/10/bill-gatess-5-billion-plan-to-videotape-americas-teachers/”> of video recording. In light of the collapsing cost of collecting this data, it’s hard to understand why they’d be opposed to it, particularly if the recordings are used primarily for professional development. If anything, video recording could help teachers beat back shrill accusations of incompetence and top-down, one-size-fits-all schemes for measuring effectiveness. Many teachers have, for good reason, resisted the concept of value-added assessments that rely heavily on standardized tests, preferring instead classroom evaluations that involve occasional visits from outside observers. Video recording every class session would give observers far more data to work with, thus giving them a fairer and more complete picture of how well a given teacher is doing day in and day out—not just a brief snapshot drawn from an hour or two.

Some readers will surely be offended by the idea of video recording cops and teachers. You might even invoke the specter of mass surveillance or the spread of CCTV cameras, or some other outrage. I see things differently. Privacy is a wonderful thing, but on-duty police officers and teachers in classrooms are not in fact private citizens living their lives as they choose. They are public servants charged with, well, serving the public. Video recording is nothing more and nothing less than a tool for accountability. Those who use their power responsibly and who make a good-faith effort to do their jobs well have much to gain from video recording. Those who abuse their power and who otherwise cut corners will either have to shape up or answer for their actions. If you come across an argument against video recording that doesn’t sound like an attempt to avoid accountability, fill me in.",3,NA,NA,Slate

When Bill Clinton ran four years later, he was so determined to avoid Dukakis’ fate that in late January 1992, with the Iowa caucuses only days away, he flew back to Arkansas to preside over the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a man so mentally impaired that during his last meal he asked guards to save his pecan pie for “later.” Upon becoming president, Clinton signed a crime bill that rescinded the right of inmates to receive Pell Grants for university education, created “boot camps” for delinquent minors, allocated large sums for new prisons, and made 60 new offenses eligible for the death penalty.

But in the two decades since, violent crime has dropped and dropped. As a result, public attitudes have softened. {The percentage of Americans}<hyperlink=”http://www.albany.edu/sourcebook/pdf/t2512013.pdf”> who favor the death penalty for murderers, which hit 80 percent in 1994, fell to 60 percent last year. Even more importantly, crime has virtually disappeared as a political issue. In 1994, {according to the University of Albany}<hyperlink=”http://www.albany.edu/sourcebook/pdf/t212012.pdf”>, 37 percent of Americans cited crime or violence as the “most important problem facing the country.” By 2012, it was 2 percent. 

It’s not that many of the white conservatives who once voted Republican because of their fear of crime no longer harbor racialized fears about illegality and public disorder. They still do. But to a large degree, those fears have shifted from black crime to Latino immigration. And this shift has given Paul and other Republicans the space to challenge harsh police tactics and sentencing policies without incurring the wrath of their party base.

In intriguing ways, Rand Paul in 2014 is the mirror image of Bill Clinton in 1992. Clinton won white votes by confronting their stereotype of Democrats as soft on black crime. Paul is trying to win black and other minority votes by confronting their stereotype of Republicans as indifferent to white racism. By 1992, the rise of crime had made liberal Democrats so desperate that they were willing to accept Clinton’s embrace of policies that made them uncomfortable. Today, demographic change is making some conservative Republicans desperate enough to accept Paul’s embrace of policies that make them uncomfortable. If Republicans are smart, they will heed the shifting politics of crime and follow Paul's lead.",15,NA,NA,The Atlantic

Police and about 200 protesters clashed in Ferguson, Missouri late Friday after another tense day in the St. Louis suburb, a day that included authorities identifying the officer who fatally shot Brown on Aug. 9. At the same news conference in which officer Darren Wilson was named, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released documents alleging that Brown stole a $48.99 box of cigars from the convenience store, then strong-armed a man on his way out.

Just before midnight, some in what had been a large and rowdy but mostly well-behaved crowd broke into that same small store and began looting it, said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson.

Some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Johnson said. One officer was hurt but details on the injury were not immediately available.

Johnson said police backed off to try and ease the tension. He believes looting may have spread to a couple of nearby stores. No arrests were made.

""We had to evaluate the security of the officers there and also the rioters,"" Johnson said. ""We just felt it was better to move back.""

Meanwhile, peaceful protesters yelled at the aggressors to stop what they were doing. About a dozen people eventually blocked off the front of the convenience store to help protect it.

Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday appointed Johnson to take over security after concerns were raised about how local police had used tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters earlier in the week. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly.

Jackson's decision to spell out the allegations that Brown committed the robbery, and his releasing of surveillance video, angered attorneys for Brown's family and others, including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay. Earlier Friday night, the Democratic congressman took a bullhorn and told protesters, ""They have attempted to taint the investigation. They are trying to influence a jury pool by the stunt they pulled today.""

Family attorney Daryl Parks acknowledged that the man shown in the surveillance footage ""appears to be"" Brown. But he and others said Brown's family was blindsided by the allegations and release of the footage. They said that even if it was Brown, the crime didn't justify the shooting of a teen after he put up his hands in surrender to the officer, as witnesses allege.

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said police ""are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style"" killing, said Crump, who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.

The surveillance video appears to show a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store's door. A police report alleges that Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and ""forcefully pushed him back"" into a display rack.

Police said they found evidence of the stolen merchandise on Brown's body.

Brown's family and supporters have been pushing for release of the officer's name. Wilson is a six-year police veteran — two in neighboring Jennings and four in Ferguson — and had no previous complaints filed against him, Jackson said.

The police chief described Wilson as ""a gentle, quiet man"" who had been ""an excellent officer."" Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation of the shooting wraps up.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley on Friday asked Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster to take over the case, saying he did not believe McCulloch could be objective. Koster said Missouri law does not allow it unless McCulloch opts out. McCulloch spokesman Ed Magee said McCulloch has no plans to surrender the case.

Also Friday, the Justice Department confirmed in a statement that FBI agents had conducted several interviews with witnesses as part of a civil-rights investigation into Brown's death. In the days ahead, the agents planned to canvass the neighborhood where the shooting happened, seeking more information, the statement said.",4,NA,NA,Associated Press

Ferguson cops had wanted to release the video on Thursday but held off when federal officials asked them not to release the tape, an unnamed law enforcement official told CNN. That tape allegedly showed Brown stealing cigars from a convenience store before a police officer shot the unarmed 18-year-old in the street last weekend.

Despite holding off Thursday, Ferguson police still decided to release the tape Friday over the Justice Department's objections, according to CNN.

The Justice Department may have been correct about the effect the tape would have.

After a {period of relative calm}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-protests-calm-after-the-governor-put-a-black-police-captain-in-charge-2014-8”> on Thursday night, protests {got ugly again on Friday}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/police-and-protesters-clash-again-in-ferguson-2014-8”> after police released the tape of Brown and revealed that he was a suspect in a robbery the day he was killed last weekend.

Brown's family released a statement Friday declaring they were ""{beyond outraged}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-browns-family-releases-statement-2014-8”>"" at the ""character assassination"" of their son.

The killing of the unarmed teen in broad daylight on Saturday, Aug. 9 sparked outrage in Ferguson, a city of 21,000 that's a suburb of St. Louis. {The city is 67% black}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-cops-made-things-worse-in-ferguson-2014-8”> but only three members of the 53-member police force there are African-American. Tensions between the local police and community members have likely been simmering for decades, and they erupted into angry protests after Brown's death.

Members of the Ferguson police and St. Louis County police responded to those protests with riot gear, tear gas, and police dogs — a display that has started a national conversation about America's {increasingly militarized police forces}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8”>. Local police were also widely criticized for a lack of transparency about the shooting and for arresting prominent journalists who were covering its aftermath.

The {situation began to improve}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-protest-selfie-2014-8”>, albeit briefly, after the state's governor, Jay Nixon, relieved local cops Thursday and brought in the state's highway patrol to police the protests.

The {video of this incident}<hyperlink=”http://time.com/3016326/eric-garner-video-police-chokehold-death/”>, shot by a friend of Garner’s from the street, shows a shockingly swift escalation from Garner’s words to the cop’s violence. As I got tweets and emails from Gabfest listeners flagging it for me, I had that sick feeling you get when something awful happens that proves your point.

It was just one anecdote, just coincidence. Except of course, it wasn’t. Last Saturday, police in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson says Brown hit an officer and tried to take his gun; on Thursday, Jackson added that the officer had gone to the hospital and that his face was swollen. The friend Brown was with, Dorian Johnson, tells a different story. Johnson says he and Brown were walking down the middle of the street when a police officer told them to get on the sidewalk, and that Brown used only words, not his fists, to object. {Another witness}<hyperlink=”http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Another-witness-to-Michael-Brown-Jr-shooting-speaks-to-News-4-271139501.html”> said she saw Brown tussling with an officer at the window of a police car, and that Brown fled as shots were fired.

Maybe we will find out who is telling the truth about Michael Brown’s death, and who is not, but it’s hard to have faith in that right now, as the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting, turns Ferguson into a military zone.

Black writers like Jamelle and {Jelani Cobb}<hyperlink=”http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/anger-ferguson”> are explaining why Brown’s death resonates, adding it to a list of other suspect police shootings and explaining how, as Cobb put it, “the race-tinged death story has become a genre itself, the details plugged into a grim template of social conflict.”

I’ve been thinking about something related but different: Why writing about legal issues for 20 years has taught me that black people are at risk from the police in a way that the rest of us are not—and how that shapes my own choices.

But I don’t just know this because of my job.

You might say, that’s a crazy extreme, and it happened a long time ago. (Or you might have, until you saw Ferguson last night.) Here’s a memory of an incident that’s far more ordinary but for me more indelible, because I didn’t see it refracted through a TV screen. It’s from 1998 or 1999, just across the border of New Haven, where I lived, in the town of Hamden, on a street called Cherry Ann. I was visiting a black family, four sisters and a mother. Bear with me while I explain what I was doing there. I met this family in 1993, when I was an intern at the New Haven Advocate.

I was supposed to write about them as an example of successful reunification after foster care. It turned out that the story was more complicated than that. The girls were the victims of prolonged and serious sexual abuse at the hands of the father of the youngest one, who had lived with them and their mother. When I met them, his trial was a month away and the two oldest sisters were to be the main witnesses. They were 11 and 13. I spent the summer reporting their story, which mostly meant hanging out with them on their front porch, going to the park, and swimming at the public pool. The prosecutor in the case was dedicated, caring, and full of concern for them. The girls gave their testimony, credible and solid, and the man who hurt them went to prison for a long, long time. That part of the story is about the criminal justice system working.

But on the late ’90s night when I stopped by to say hello, I saw a side of law enforcement I’d never seen firsthand. I was inside the house, talking with the girls and their mom when we heard sirens come screaming down the street. We looked through the window and then opened the front door. The cops pounded on the door of another home on the block. They went inside and came out with two guys who they clubbed to the ground. When the men were down, faces against the asphalt and hands cuffed, the cops yanked them into a police car and went zooming off into the night.
I don’t know who those men were or what they’d done. I asked the girls and their mother if they were drug dealers, and they shook their heads: They didn’t think so, but they didn’t know. Mostly, they weren’t surprised. Whatever led up to that arrest, to them the use of force felt routine. Like everyone else on the street, they went back inside and shut the door.

For me, the whole thing was mind bending. It all seemed entirely unaccountable. This was before cellphones and the citizen videos that have changed how we see deaths like Garner’s or {an arrest of a black passerby like this one}<hyperlink=”http://thedignityvirus.com/2014/08/09/activists-protest-bombing-of-gaza-and-innocent-passerby-harassed-by-pro-israel-opposition-and-arrested/”>. I had no idea what to make of what I’d seen. Were the police protecting people like the family I was visiting from the thugs in the neighborhood? Or were they flexing their muscle because they could? Had they crossed the line into misconduct? Were they a force for good or for ill?

I still don’t know. But I came away sure of one thing: I couldn’t imagine anything like that happening on any street I’ve lived on. And it’s black people who tend to live in the places where it does happen—and when the police clearly do use excessive force, their victims often have little recourse. And sometimes, people die. That happened again on Monday night, in Los Angeles, to 25-year-old black man Ezell Ford, whose mental illness, his family said, was well known to the police but who the police say got into a struggle during an investigative stop, went for an officer’s gun, and was shot and killed.

And it’s black people who tend to live in the places where it does happen—and when the police clearly do use excessive force, their victims often have little recourse. And sometimes, people die. That happened again on Monday night, in Los Angeles, to 25-year-old black man Ezell Ford, whose mental illness, his family said, was well known to the police but who the police say got into a struggle during an investigative stop, went for an officer’s gun, and was shot and killed. 

Between 2003 and 2009, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 4,813 people died “while law enforcement personnel were attempting to arrest or restrain them, or shortly thereafter,” {as Gene Demby writes for NPR}<hyperlink=“http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/07/29/335847224/what-we-see-in-the-eric-garner-video-and-what-we-dont”>, and about 60 percent of the deaths are classified as homicides by the police (I don’t know how many of the people killed were black). Demby points out that this is a small number in the context of the 98 million arrests made nationally during the same time period. But it’s still a scary number, especially when, as in Michael Brown’s case so far, police departments seem intent on protecting their own from the consequences.

This is the sharp edge of my explanation for why as a white person, if I have a choice about whether to involve the police in the life of a black person, I will try to choose not to. I’m not saying that I won’t call 911 and pray as hard as I can for the police to come if someone, whatever race, breaks in to my house. But much of the time, our choices are made in a far hazier gray area. To go back to the story of Debra Harrell and her daughter, who wound up respectively, getting arrested and going into foster care: If I saw a 9-year-old black girl alone in the park, and she said her mom was at work, I would not call the police. I would ask that girl if she was OK and try to talk to her mom. Because, once the wheels of the bureaucratic state start to turn, they can grind people up. Maybe the police want to help but don’t have discretion. Maybe “the law is an ass,” as my colleague David Plotz put it on the Gabfest. Whatever the cause, I would rather stay away from bringing its weight to bear on someone else, especially when I know that person is likelier to get an unfair shake.

The girls whom I visited on Cherry Ann Street have grown up, and one of them has an 18-year-old son. He graduated from high school in May, and he’s supposed to start college next week. He is a good kid who has not had an easy life and who is making his way. One day earlier this summer, he says, a friend brought a moped to his house and said he could ride it. The boy I know drove the bike and got stopped by the police because he wasn’t wearing goggles. They ran the moped through the system and discovered it was stolen, and he’s now facing larceny charges. This wouldn’t happen to one of my sons. I just don’t think it would. Just like I don’t think I would ever have my kids taken away from me for letting them go to the park alone.

So what does this have to do with Ferguson? What’s happening there—the tear gas, the tanks—is not what’s happening in black neighborhoods all across America every day. But it’s the same dynamic that black people experience too often, and more often than everyone else: The arm of the government that is meant to protect them instead poses a danger, to their lives and their futures. Keep that in mind the next time you consider calling the cops.",NA,NA,NA,Slate

The streets were fairly quiet about an hour before curfew time, but soon after midnight loud chants of ""hands up, don't shoot!"" could be heard by a number of protesters. Most police officers on the scene were standing outside numerous businesses to protect them from potential looters.

[tweetbegin 500832103127597057 tweetend]

""I don't think it's a good idea,"" Maurice Millere told Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly of the curfew. The main chant of the protesters over the past week had been ""hands up, don't shoot,"" but as the Wall Street Journal's Ben Kesling tweeted, those had been outnumbered by chants of ""F--k 12.""

[tweetbegin 500872936719659008 tweetend]

Twenty minutes after the curfew began, police were not seen advancing or taking any action to arrest or force the protesters away. The St. Louis County Police Department {said it had received}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/stlcountypd/status/500873989049171968”> ""several calls"" of men with guns on the streets.

Roughly 200 people remained in the area and chanted in protest of the police, while some activists called for them to go home in an attempt to deescalate the situation.

Officers observed at least one person standing in the road with a handgun, and a police car was also fired upon, according to Capt. Ron Johnson, who spoke at a press conference after the clashes at around 2:30 a.m.

[tweetbegin 500912376632594433 tweetend]

At 12:40 a.m., police officers formed a line of vehicles and announced over the loudspeaker: ""This is the police department. You are violating a state-imposed curfew. ... you must disperse peacefully or you will be subject to arrest or other actions.""

Police fired {tear gas}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/bkesling/status/500894789517451266”> into the crowd about five minutes later, although a police spokesman insisted it was smoke. He later backtracked and {confirmed it was indeed used}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/samgustin/status/500899123256885248”>.

Vice News' Tim Pool observed at least one protester throwing a Molotov cocktail at a business. Other protesters quickly stamped out the fire that had been lit.

[tweetbegin 500881948907012097 tweetend]

Around 12:55 a.m., at least three to four gunshots were heard. The Guardian's Jon Swaine later {reported}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/jonswaine/status/500885072501694466”> one man was shot in the leg (not by police), and was quickly put in a car to be taken away. Capt. Johnson confirmed the man was transported to the hospital and was in critical condition.

Nearly two hours post-curfew, most people had vacated the streets. Police made seven arrests, all on charges of ""failure to disperse."" They did not arrest the person they observed with a handgun, or the suspect who had wounded a protester.

{In the wake of riots that ensued}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/feds-objected-to-the-release-of-alleged-michael-brown-robbery-tape-2014-8”> after a police officer shot an unarmed black 18-year-old, Gov. Jay Nixon put the curfew in place and declared a state of emergency.

“We will not allow a handful of looters to endanger the rest of this community,” Gov. Jay Nixon said in a heated press conference broadcast live on MSNBC.

People at the governor's press conference expressed anger, questioning why the police officer who shot Brown has not been arrested and charged with murder. Nixon responded by saying, ""If we want justice, we cannot be distracted ... We cannot have looting and crimes at night. We cannot have people fearful.""

As reporter Matt Pearce showed in this Instagram video, the press conference was quite tense:

'There is not going to be an armored truck come out'

Ferguson {has been in a state of unrest}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/feds-objected-to-the-release-of-alleged-michael-brown-robbery-tape-2014-8”> since a local police officer shot unarmed Michael Brown in broad daylight on Aug. 9. The curfew will run from midnight until 5 a.m., Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson said at the press conference. Johnson — an African-American native of Ferguson who was brought in to help quell the riots on Thursday — tried to strike a positive note on Thursday.

""We will survive this, and we will make a change,"" he said. Johnson implied that the all-night protests were threatening public safety and health, saying at one point, ""People are calling 911 and not getting their calls [answered] ... People get sick at one in the morning. People get sick at two in the morning.""

One person in attendance asked Johnson how he was going to enforce the curfew, saying, ""Are you going to use tear gas again? Are you bringing back military force?""

Johnson tried to ease those fears, explaining how police would enforce the curfew: ""We won't enforce it with trucks, with tear gas. We will communicate ... Because someone is standing in the street, there is not going to be an armored truck come out.""

The curfew will apparently not apply to reporters, as the governor specified that the press were free to monitor {how police enforce it}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/alanblinder/status/500746451207852034”>. Police in Ferguson were widely criticized for their response to the protests, which included bringing out military-style weapons and barking dogs. Following this criticism, on Thursday Nixon relieved the local police of their duties and brought in Johnson and other members of the state highway patrol.

Ron Johnson Changed The Tone Of The Protests In Ferguson,Patrik Jonsson,8/16/2014,11/11/2015,"FERGUSON, MO. — As people continued to protest the police shooting death of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink”http://www.csmonitor.com/csmlists/topic/Michael+Brown”> Friday night, Capt. Ron Johnson took responsibility for the streets with a daring gambit that changed the tone of what promises to be protracted protests and struggles here in Ferguson, Mo.

At way over 6 feet tall with a bald imposing dome, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Johnson, after watching local police wage pitched battles against protesters earlier last week, took command by engaging protesters and defending their right to express anger at police for the death of Brown, an unarmed teenager, and the failure to arrest Darren Wilson, the officer who they believe killed him without justification.

The stance put the black commander at odds with the white police structure in Ferguson and St. Louis County, which had responded to the protests with riot gear, armored vehicles, high-powered rifles, tear gas, and rubber bullets.

Recommended: {IN PICTURES}<hyperlink=”http://www.csmonitor.com/Photo-Galleries/In-Pictures”> {Policing America}<hyperlink=”http://www.csmonitor.com/Photo-Galleries/In-Pictures/Policing-America”>

Bob McCulloch, the white county prosecutor who is in charge of investigating whether Brown was justifiably killed or murdered, criticized the decision to elevate Johnson over local police as disrespectful.

For the second night in a row, Johnson kept his officers back as a thousand protesters swelled along West Florissant Avenue – the thoroughfare near where Brown was shot and killed, witnesses say, with his hands up.

Throngs of mostly African American residents swore, danced, chanted, and at times surrounded honking cars with swaying dance moves. Along the street, late into the night, young children jumped up and down crying, “No justice, no peace!” and “Hands up, don’t shoot!”

Asked if he thought it was a gamble to draw back the police line in stark contrast to the much-criticized military response, Johnson said no. “I see people out here smiling and walking and speaking their piece,” he told the Monitor.

But shortly after midnight, in a drenching rain, that assessment changed as a group of protesters broke away and began looting the same liquor store pictured in a video released Friday that police say shows Brown stealing cigars and strong-arming a much smaller clerk.

After looters were finally dispersed by police, protesters took up guard outside the stores to prevent more looting. At Sam’s Meat Market, store owners brandished rifles to warn looters.

While Johnson may be criticized for allowing the looting to happen, the image of protesters helping protect their community is also notable as the nature of the protests evolve with the more respectful stance from police.

Protesters like Camese Bedford say a sense of deep injustice and distrust in the white political and police structure will continue to drive the protests. Officer Wilson “needs to be behind bars, flat out,” Mr. Bedford said.

The decision by {Gov. Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=”http://www.csmonitor.com/csmlists/topic/Jay+Nixon”> to put Johnson in charge came as national leaders, including President Obama, condemned the “bullying” police response, where journalists were attacked and detained. Nixon’s decision was certainly a coup for protesters, who saw the armed response – earlier, police pointed high-powered rifles at protesters and journalists – wither away.

“You the man who shook the world,” one protester told Johnson before shaking his hand late Friday night.

Earlier in the day, Johnson moved through the crowd as people shook his hand and took selfies with the imposing commander, who occasionally used a white kerchief to wipe sweat from his brow.

Johnson defended the right of protesters to take over the streets, especially as infractions, before the looting, were minor – some pot smoking and traffic violations as people climbed on top of vans and cars as they honked their horns wildly.

At one point, Johnson said he would have handled the release of the Brown video differently.

After releasing the video earlier Friday, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson first said Wilson was investigating what police called a strong-arm robbery – protesters called it shoplifting – and then came back to say Wilson wasn’t aware that Brown was a suspect, and later clarified that to say Wilson saw Brown with the box of cigars and so suspected him when the altercation began.

Johnson, in charge of public safety, was never told the Brown video – which turned out to be a powder keg – would be released. He was incensed enough to tell protesters surrounding him that lots of people in the crowd may have committed crimes, “but they’re still standing here” – a jab at what Brown’s family alleged is a building narrative to paint Brown as an aggressor who may have done something to justify his own death.

Such stances have made the decision to install Johnson, who grew up in the area, “very controversial,” says the Rev. Darrell Burgess, who has lived all his life in Ferguson.

Johnson’s appointment and less confrontational approach also highlighted a vexing backdrop to Brown’s death: The appearance of police agencies at odds, which is fueling skepticism about whether justice will be served for Brown and his family.

The seeming disconnect between the various agencies in handling the investigation and the protests is unnecessary and counterproductive, Daniel Isom, a retired St. Louis police chief who now teaches at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, told the Associated Press.

""There are several agencies involved in this endeavor,"" Mr. Isom told the wire service. ""It seems that everyone is on their own page. And that's not good for us moving forward.""",NA,NA,NA,Christian Science Monitor

According to the report, Brown was shot six times in the fatal incident, including twice in his head. The bullets that entered his body did not appear to have been fired from very close range, according to the report.

An autopsy conducted by local officials had still not been completed. Meanwhile, Attorney General Eric Holder said Sunday that the Justice Department would conduct its own autopsy because of what spokesman Brian Fallon said was ""due to the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family.""

""We believe given those kinds of facts, that this officer should have been arrested. Those things speak for themselves,"" family lawyer Daryl Parks said. ""Why would he have been shot in the very top of his head — 6-foot-4 man, makes no sense.""

BusinessInsider,bus64,http://www.businessinsider.com/r-unarmed-black-teen-killed-by-police-was-shot-six-times-nyt-2014-17,Unarmed Black Teen Killed By Police Was Shot Six Times: NYT,Reuters,8/18/2014,11/11/2015,"A preliminary private autopsy report found that Michael Brown, the black teen killed by a police officer in the suburban St. Louis city of Ferguson, was shot at least six times, The New York Times reported on Sunday night.

Citing Dr. Michael M. Baden, former chief medical examiner for the City of New York who was asked to perform the autopsy by Brown's family, the newspaper reported that Brown, 18, was shot twice in the head, and that the bullets that hit him did not appear to have been fired from very close range.

Four shots hit Brown in his right arm, and one entered the top of his skull, The Times said, citing findings by Baden, who it said flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family's behest and waived his usual fee in view of the extraordinary circumstances.

The bullets, some of which left as many as five wounds, did not appear to have been fired from very close range, The Times reported, because no gunpowder was detected on his body. That conclusion could change, however, if gunshot residue is found on Brown's clothing, the newspaper said.

The autopsy was in addition to one performed by Missouri officials, as well as one that Attorney General Eric Holder said the Department of Justice would perform.

A spokesman for the Ferguson police said the department had not seen a report of the autopsy and had no comment on it.

Brown was shot by white police officer Darren Wilson. The police department in the St. Louis suburb has come under strong criticism for both the death of an unarmed man and its handling of the aftermath. Unrest has gripped the area for days, including the past two nights despite a midnight curfew.

“People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day 1,” Baden told The Times in an interview after performing the autopsy.

“They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying.

Baden said his autopsy was not intended to determine whether the shooting was justified.

“In my capacity as the forensic examiner for the New York State Police, I would say, ‘You’re not supposed to shoot so many times,'” he told The Times. “Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.”

Baden also said only three bullets were recovered from Brown's body but that he had not yet seen the X-rays showing where the bullets were found, which would help clarify the autopsy results.",11,NA,NA,Reuters
BusinessInsider,bus65,http://www.businessinsider.com/mr-bad-example-2014-9,Mr. Bad Example,James Kunstler,8/18/2014,11/11/2015,"Of all the awful tensions roiling and coiling in American society, it’s only a little bit surprising that the racial module is blowing off now rather than, say, the stock market. Perhaps it’s a seasonal thing: race riots in the summer; stock market crashes in the fall, revolutions in the spring.

Michael Brown, the 18-year-old shooting victim of a cop-stop in Ferguson, Missouri, was not the best candidate for martyrdom. But it was only after the violent protests to his killing got underway that his convenience store robbery videotape went public — despite attempts by the US Department of Justice to suppress it — and by then it was too late to stop the juggernaut of grievance. Meanwhile, the white condescension machine (The New York Times, The Huffington Post, et. al.) revved into top gear to validate the fears and resentments of the rioters.

The casual observer from Mars might have trouble finding the reality in this welter of bad feeling. A toxicology report should have accompanied the second autopsy report, and shed a little light, but apparently no one has asked for it yet — notably the leading news media. 18-year-old young men are not known for having great judgment or impulse control even when not high.

White America is tortured by black America’s failure to thrive, and all that guilt and anxiety has only gotten worse as a substantial quota of white America loses its own footing in the middle class and plunges into the rough country of joblessness, hopelessness, and government dependency. The usual remedies of even more dependency aren’t working so well for anybody. It’s politically easier for the moment, though. And both the government and the news media are frantically busy manufacturing excuses for everybody’s bad conduct.

This poor nation is faced with the tasks of completely retooling its economy in a way that it can’t bear to imagine, and of also reforming its grotesque social behavior. One might follow the other in a better world, but our prospects for the moment are not so bright. My own camp is inclined to expect an anguished collapse rather than any deliberate reformation. We’ve set ourselves up for it.

The future we don’t want to think about is an economy focused on food production at the local scale, along with the activities that support it and add value to its products, and the labor required to do all that. There’s a fair chance that we will fail altogether to ever get it running. In any case, the officially-sanctioned future that so many people are expecting — the digital wonderland economy — will not survive the energy and capital scarcities ahead.

The basic questions of race relations in America remain too painful to ask and too hard to answer. For instance, are we hard-wired to self-segregate? There certainly was a great wish that this were not so. Has it been disproven or overcome in the 60 years since Brown v. Board of Education? Do we have different standards of behavior for different races? Does that work?

The case of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, can’t inspire a whole lot of confidence about working anything out. We’re finding out that a culture of opposition produces confrontation, often just for its own sake, because there seems to be nothing better to do. Is it the opening round of broader discontent and conflict? Black America surely faces an existential crisis, but not the one imagined in the condescending news media — of somehow getting non-black America to be more just and generous. The truth is, we’ve already been through that and there is nothing left to do. We’re out of “affirmative actions” of all kinds. “Diversity” chatter didn’t make anything better. Have we completely discarded the idea of a common culture along with uniform standards of behavior? If not, we’re in for more violence and anarchy.

BusinessInsider,bus66,http://www.businessinsider.com/john-oliver-talks-about-police-militarization-2014-8,This John Oliver Clip Shows The Troubling Effects Of Police Militarization,Pamela Engel,8/18/2014,11/11/2015,"Many of the images that have been coming out of Ferguson, Missouri, this past week convey a worrying truth — {America's police are becoming increasingly militarized}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8”>.

Local cops are now heavily armed with rifles, armored vehicles, and other military-grade weapons they {probably don't really need and may not be properly trained to handle}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/aclu-report-on-police-militarization-2014-8”>.

John Oliver {gave some pretty sobering examples}<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUdHIatS36A”> of this on his HBO show ""Last Week Tonight"" (start watching at about 6:49):

Oliver made this observation about one iconic image to come out of the Ferguson protests: ""The police are troublingly dressed like they're about to launch an assault on Fallujah.""

As Business Insider's Paul Szoldra {pointed out}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8”> last week, these police officers could be mistaken for soldiers, with their uniforms that are modeled after those of the U.S. Marine Corps.

Military members wear camouflage to blend in with their surroundings, but as Oliver notes, Ferguson police are ""northwest of St. Louis, not northwest of the Amazon.""

""If they want to blend in with their surroundings, they should be dressed as a Dollar Store,"" he said.

Local police departments argue they have a use for this equipment, but their reasoning can sound a bit thin.

Keene, New Hampshire, for example, cited an annual pumpkin festival as a possible terrorism target.

In Saginaw, Michigan, the county sheriff drives around a giant armored tank:

The guys who shot the YouTube video asked: ""Why? Has our city gotten that f---ing bad?""

Oliver answers: ""Here's the thing — no. It hasn't got that bad. Because unless you live in downtown Kabul, there is no practical need for anything like that in your town.""

Doraville, Georgia — with a population of about 8,500 — has a similar vehicle, and the police department's website advertised its power in a bizarre video set to the song ""Die Motherf---er, Die"":

Aside from being excessive, this equipment could end up being counterproductive.

While military members are trained not to point a weapon directly at someone unless they are ready to shoot, the police in Ferguson have been walking around pointing their guns at people who may not be direct threats.

SWAT raids in the U.S. have also gone up by 1,400% since the 1980s, according to an Al Jazeera report.

The ACLU {notes}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/feature/war-comes-home?redirect=war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing”> in a recent report that 79% of those deployments are for executing search warrants, mostly in drug raids.

""If you are getting high in your dorm room right now, you're not paranoid; there is a SWAT team outside, and they are coming to get you,"" Oliver said.

The militarization of local police is largely due to the Defense Department repurposing military equipment for cops to fight the drug war and terrorism on the home front. In 2013, the military transferred about $450 million worth of equipment to local police in the U.S.

Ferguson police have been using this equipment in a so-far failed effort to control riots that have gripped the St. Louis suburb since the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown last week. Brown, who was black, was shot by a white police officer who stopped him for jaywalking.",2,NA,NA,NA
BusinessInsider,bus67,http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-brown-ferguson-arrest-autopsy-2014-8,MICHAEL BROWN'S MOTHER: 'What Else Do We Need To Give Them To Arrest The Killer Of My Child?',Colin Campbell,8/18/2014,11/11/2015,"The family of the Missouri teen whose death has {sparked more than a week of riots and protests}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-protests-mike-brown-shooting-curfew-2014-8”> believes the autopsy they recently had performed on their son gives ""ample evidence"" for the arrest of the police officer who shot him.

Benjamin Crump, a family lawyer, said at a news conference Monday morning that the mother of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9, had a lingering question.

""What else do we need to give them to arrest the killer of my child?"" Crump said Brown's mother asked.

The autopsy, performed by Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner for New York City, {revealed}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?_r=0”> that Brown had been shot at least six times, including two times in the head, during the fatal police encounter slightly more than a week ago.

Attorneys representing the family argued that the wounds, notably one they said indicated Brown was shot while his head was bent forward, provided evidence that the officer should have indeed already been arrested.

""We believe given those kinds of facts, that this officer should have been arrested. Those things speak for themselves,"" said another family lawyer, Daryl Parks. ""Why would he have been shot in the very top of his head — 6-foot-4 man, makes no sense.""

Professor Shawn Parcells, who also conducted the autopsy, said the arm wounds could have been sustained while Brown's hands were up in a surrendering position.

""It could have occurred when he was putting his arms up,"" he said. ""We don’t know and we still have to look at other aspects of this investigation before we really start piecing things together.""

The St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office has {already performed}<hyperlink=”http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/12/michael-brown-preliminary-autopsy-results/13961385/”> the initial autopsy.

To be sure, there are several troubling results from a family-ordered autopsy of 18-year-old Michael Brown — including the findings that officer Darren Wilson shot him from behind and above, {according to CNN}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/18/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html”>. That autopsy also didn't find signs of a struggle, CNN noted, which conflicts with the police account that Brown was reaching for Wilson's gun.

But the public should not focus too heavily on the number of times Brown was shot, two experts on police force told us. It sounds excessive when you hear that a police officer shot someone multiple times, but these experts say cops often have very good reasons for doing so.

""Hollywood has us believing that if you shoot someone once or twice, they fall,"" {former police chief Chuck Drago}<hyperlink=”http://dragoconsultants.com/”> told Business Insider by phone. But, he added, ""I've seen people shot many times, and they don't even slow down.""

Police often keep firing because they don't even realize they hit the person, Drago says. Cops are also taught to fire three times before reassessing the threat — a procedure known as ""triple tap,"" according to {Dr. Daniel Kennedy, a forensic criminologist}<hyperlink=”http://www.forensiccriminology.com/pages/background.htm”>. 

""It is not at all unusual for officers to fire multiple rounds, once they begin to fire,"" Kennedy said in an email, noting, as Drago did, that bullets often don't ""take immediate effect.""

In the case of Brown, investigators should look at how far away Wilson was from Brown when he shot him, Drago said. To do that, investigators can look at how much soot is on Brown's body.

""If [the officer] says, 'He was trying to take my gun away from me,'"" Drago said, ""there is going to be some very close-range forensics to show that.""

In a statement released Monday afternoon, Nixon also outlined why he was sending members of the Missouri National Guard to the town, saying he was doing so to ""provide protection"" and ensure the safety of a police command center that was attacked Sunday night.

Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, has been the {site of racially charged protests}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/state-of-emergency-declared-in-ferguson-2014-8”> since the Aug. 9 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Clashes between protesters and police had calmed as the week progressed, but they ramped up again over the weekend.

""With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard. We will not use a curfew tonight,"" Nixon said in the statement.

Witnesses reported police firing tear gas into crowds marching toward a police command center on Sunday night. Echoing what Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson told reporters early Monday morning, Nixon said protesters threw Molotov cocktails and fired gunshots at law-enforcement officers. Nixon said a civilian had also been shot Sunday night.

""Again, I join the people of Ferguson, and all Missourians, in strongly condemning the violent acts we saw last night, including the firing upon law enforcement officers, the shooting of a civilian, the throwing of Molotov cocktails, looting and a coordinated attempt to overrun the unified Command Center,"" his statement continued.

""We are all frustrated and looking for justice to be achieved regarding the shooting death of Michael Brown.

The attorneys representing Brown's family said the autopsy provided ""ample evidence"" that Wilson should already be arrested.

""Let’s seek to heal, rather than to wound each other,"" Obama said in a statement from the White House, where he addressed the situation in Ferguson and U.S. military involvement in Iraq. 

Obama announced that Attorney General Eric Holder, with whom he met at the White House on Monday, will travel to Ferguson on Wednesday to ""assess the situation"" and hold meetings with law-enforcement officials investigating Brown's death. Holder has ordered a federal autopsy to be performed on Brown's body.

Obama took questions after his statement, and he was asked if he would visit Ferguson or if he felt he could ""do more"" to help communities like Ferguson. He said it was important to distinguish issues of local jurisdiction and warned about wading his thoughts into the discussion.

""I have to be very careful about prejudging before the investigation is completed,"" Obama said.

Obama addressed the protests, saying that while the vast majority of protests had been peaceful, a ""small majority"" had not.

Obama said he had spoken Monday with Nixon as well as Missouri Sens. Roy Blunt (R) and Claire McCaskill (D).

CNN's Brianna Keilar threw to her colleague, who flew into Ferguson over the weekend, to cover the protests and riots that broke out after the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, by a local policemen.

“Move out of the way, sir. Move,” the policeman ordered before placing his arm across Lemon to push him back.

According to Lemon, he and the protestors had been instructed to stand at that location on the sidewalk and had “been there all day.”

Despite the fact that the cameras were rolling and a crowd of people were watching, the officer continued to push Lemon.

“We're on national television,” Lemon said. “Imagine what they're doing to people you don't see on national television.”

Also on Monday, a Getty Images photographer was detained by police while covering the protests. His arrest was captured on video and posted on Instagram. 

This was all occurring as President Barack Obama held a press conference on Ferguson and told authorities in that region that freedoms of assembly and the press must be “vigilantly safeguarded” in the town. Although there had been looting and some altercations with police, the President said there was “no excuse for excessive force by police.”

SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents some of the nation's on-air talent also condemned the treatment of journalists in Ferguson. 

“SAG-AFTRA joins the rest of the journalism community in condemning the arrest and detention of reporters covering the events happening in Ferguson, Missouri.,” the group said in a statement Monday.

“As a union that represents broadcast journalists, including many local St. Louis broadcasters, we strongly support the rights of journalists not to be impeded in their efforts to report the news.

Tapper displayed a sense of disgust when describing the overall absurdity of the situation, especially the police's show of force toward protesters who didn't appear to be doing anything threatening. He twice compared the situation to times he reported from a war zone in Afghanistan.

""The protesters have moved all the way down there,"" Tapper said on air, pointing to a clear distance between police and protesters. ""Nobody is threatening anything. Nobody is doing anything. None of the stores here that I can see are being looted. There is no violence.""

Tapper then took his cameraman to examine the police's show of force.

""Now I want you to look at what is going on in Ferguson, Missouri — in downtown America, OK?"" he said. ""These are armed police, with semiautomatic rifles, with batons, with shields, many of them dressed for combat.

""Now why they’re doing this? I don’t know. Because there is no threat going on here. None that merits this. There is none, OK? Absolutely there have been looters. Absolutely, over the last nine days there's been violence. But there is nothing going on on this street right now that merits this scene out of Bagram. Nothing.

Over time, he said, such wounds, rooted in America's painful history on race, can be healed.

Six years later, the stalemate suddenly seems more entrenched than ever. As Obama pleads for calm and understanding in Ferguson, Missouri, he's struggling to determine what role — if any — the nation's first black president can play in defusing a crisis that has laid bare the profound sense of injustice felt by African-Americans across the country.

As Obama sought to strike the appropriate tone Monday, he appeared to be trapped between the need, as president and commander in chief, to stand up for the government's right to ensure law and order, and the inclination, as an African-American, to empathize with those whose say the killing of an unarmed black man just goes to show how blacks are treated differently by police.

""In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,"" Obama said at the White House, in his most expansive comments to date about the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown just outside St. Louis.

But while Obama lamented the disproportional apprehension of young black men, he pointedly argued that's not solely the fault of overzealous cops. Police officers must be honored and respected for the difficult job they perform, Obama said.

""There are young black men that commit crime,"" the president said. ""We can argue about why that happens — because of the poverty they were born into and the lack of opportunity or school systems that fail them or what have you — but if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted, because every community has an interest in public safety.""

It's a delicate balance that's likely to leave no one fully satisfied.

Aiming to reassure edgy Americans that the federal government is fully engaged, Obama announced that Attorney General Eric Holder would travel Wednesday to Ferguson to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death. Obama said he also spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who has deployed National Guard units, and urged him to ensure the use of those units is limited and constructive. ""I'll be watching over the next several days,"" the president said.

Obama also called for the U.S. to reassess the militarization of local police departments that have purchased military gear from the Pentagon. Federal grants for such equipment have come under intense scrutiny amid the alarming images of armored vehicles and tear gas canisters filling the streets of an American suburb.

""There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement,"" Obama said. ""We don't want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions.""

Yet for all the talk of procurement and sentencing disparities and police tactics, Obama has steadfastly avoided personalizing this latest bout of racial friction.

Unlike in 2013, when Obama declared that slain teen Trayvon Martin ""could have been me,"" Obama has been careful not to describe Brown's death through the lens of his own experience as an African-American.

And unlike in 2009, when Obama exacerbated tensions by saying police acted ""stupidly"" by arresting a black Harvard University professor at his own home, this time Obama is leaving the fault-finding to investigators. Obama said Monday he has to be careful about appearing to put his thumb on the scale by weighing in while a federal probe is underway.

Witnesses have said Brown's hands were above his head when an officer shot him repeatedly on Aug. 9 in Ferguson. But police have said the officer was physically assaulted during a struggle over his weapon. Meanwhile, the aggressive police response to the subsequent protests has drawn criticism from across the U.S.

Obama's impassive response to the unrest in Ferguson contrasts with a second-term approach in which he generally has been more willing to engage on issues of race. In his remarks Monday, which came during a brief break from Obama's two-week vacation on Martha's Vineyard, the president pointed to his signature initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which aims to bring government, business and nonprofit groups together to empower young minorities to pursue a better future.

""We're making some significant progress as people of good will of all races are ready to chip in,"" Obama said. ""But that requires that we build and not tear down, and that requires we listen and not just shout.""",14,NA,NA,Associated Press

The National Guard has been called in to help tame the situation in Ferguson.

Protests have taken over the St. Louis suburb of 21,000 people since a Ferguson police officer shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in broad daylight on Saturday, Aug. 9.

In an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday morning, Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson accused reporters of swarming around agitators, giving ""them a platform and glamoriz[ing] their activity.""

""We have a lot of media that have not done a great job. Last night, when crowds were walking and small groups — and they got larger, and they were just walking — and then when a certain element — that criminal element, that got out here with masks on, that wanted to agitate and build up the crowd, would stop in front of the media — the media would swarm around them, give them a platform and glamorize their activity,"" Johnson said, according to {a Mediaite video}<hyperlink=”http://www.mediaite.com/tv/cpt-johnson-some-of-the-media-glamorizing-ferguson-violence/”> of the interview.

When the media promotes the disruptive protesters, Johnson argued, the more violent demonstrators rush to the scene.

""And then before we knew it, the crowd was 100. Now it’s 200. Now it’s 300,"" Johnson said. ""And now those criminals began to start throwing things out of the crowd that was standing within the media.""

Johnson was recently named to manage the police response to the protests, which began when 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed during an Aug. 9 encounter with police. The demonstrations have also resulted in an aggressive police crack down. Officers have repeatedly arrested journalists covering the event, including {four reporters and photographers}<hyperlink=”http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/four-more-journalists-arrested-monday-ferguson”> Monday night.

Johnson also made sure to praise another segment of the media — but ""not all,"" he was sure to note — which he felt has been doing its job responsibly.

""We had a number of journalists — and not all, I want to say that now — the journalists have been on our side, they have been our partners in reporting,"" he said. ""You know I get home each morning, I look at the news and I am really grateful to the media for what they’ve done.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Amid the social media and news coverage of the community’s response to the police shooting of the unarmed teenager, a picture of Ferguson and its history has emerged.

{The New York Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/opinion/racial-history-behind-the-ferguson-protests.html?smid=fb-nytimes&WT.z_sma=OP_TDO_20140813&bicmp=AD&bicmlukp=WT.mc_id&bicmst=1388552400000&bicmet=1420088400000&_r=2”> and others have described the deep-seated racial tensions and inequalities that have long plagued the St. Louis region, as well as the dramatic demographic transformation of Ferguson from a largely white suburban enclave (it was 85 percent white as recently as 1980) to a predominantly black community (it was 67 percent black by 2008-2012).

But Ferguson has also been home to dramatic economic changes in recent years. The city’s unemployment rate rose from less than 5 percent in 2000 to over 13 percent in 2010-12.

For those residents who were employed, inflation-adjusted average earnings fell by one-third.

The number of households using federal Housing Choice Vouchers climbed from roughly 300 in 2000 to more than 800 by the end of the decade.

Amid these changes, poverty skyrocketed. Between 2000 and 2010-2012, Ferguson’s poor population doubled. By the end of that period, roughly one in four residents lived below the federal poverty line ($23,492 for a family of four in 2012), and 44 percent fell below twice that level.

These changes affected neighborhoods throughout Ferguson. At the start of the 2000s, the five census tracts that fall within Ferguson’s border registered poverty rates ranging between 4 and 16 percent. However, by 2008-2012 almost all of Ferguson’s neighborhoods had poverty rates at or above the {20 percent threshold}<hyperlink=”http://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/em/winter11/highlight2.html”> at which the negative effects of concentrated poverty begin to emerge. (One Ferguson tract had a poverty rate of 13.1 percent in 2008-2012, while the remaining tracts fell between 19.8 and 33.3 percent.)

As dramatic as the growth in economic disadvantage has been in this community, Ferguson is not alone.

Within the nation’s {100 largest metro areas}<hyperlink=”http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/concentrated-poverty#/M10420”>, the number of suburban neighborhoods where more than 20 percent of residents live below the federal poverty line more than doubled between 2000 and 2008-2012. Almost every major metro area saw suburban poverty not only grow during the 2000s but also become more concentrated in high-poverty neighborhoods. By 2008-2012, 38 percent of poor residents in the suburbs lived in neighborhoods with poverty rates of 20 percent or higher. For poor black residents in those communities, the figure was 53 percent.

Like Ferguson, many of these changing suburban communities are home to out-of-step power structures, where the leadership class, {including the police force}<hyperlink=”http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/police-staffing/”>, does not reflect the rapid demographic changes that have reshaped these places.

Suburban areas with growing poverty are also frequently characterized by many small, fragmented municipalities; Ferguson is just one of 91 jurisdictions in St. Louis County. This often translates into inadequate resources and capacity to respond to growing needs and can complicate efforts to connect residents with economic opportunities that offer a path out of poverty.

And as concentrated poverty climbs in communities like Ferguson, they find themselves especially ill-equipped to deal with impacts such as poorer education and health outcomes, and higher crime rates. In an {article for Salon}<hyperlink=”http://www.salon.com/2014/08/12/in_defense_of_black_rage_michael_brown_police_and_the_american_dream/”>, Brittney Cooper writes about the outpouring of anger from the community, “Violence is the effect, not the cause of the concentrated poverty that locks that many poor people up together with no conceivable way out and no productive way to channel their rage at having an existence that is adjacent to the American dream.” 

None of this means that there are 1,000 Fergusons-in-waiting, but it should underscore the fact that there are a growing number of communities across the country facing similar, if quieter, deep challenges every day.",23,NA,NA,The Brookings Institution
BusinessInsider,bus81,http://www.businessinsider.com/how-police-officers-use-force-in-protests-2014-8,Here's When Cops Are Justified In Using Force Against Protesters,Drake Baer,8/19/2014,11/11/2015,"Ferguson, Missouri, {is chaotic once again}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-protests-police-tear-gas-michael-brown-shooting-death-2014-8”>, more than a week after a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old who was unarmed. 

After a few nights of relative peace, tear gas and stun grenades are part of the news as protestors assemble and police disperse them. 

This onslaught of chaos raises the question of when and how police officers should use force. 

Within the police studies community, it's agreed that every encounter between police and citizen is ""defined by the potential for the officer to use force,"" Mike White, a criminologist at Arizona State University, tells Business Insider. ""For the citizen, for the officer — (force) is an underlying theme."" 

Yet while the specter of force is always present, it's rarely used in the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics {has found}<hyperlink=”http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=251”> that force is only used in 2% of all police-citizen encounters. In the case of encounters that result in arrests, that number bumps up to 20% of the time. 

So what's happening in Ferguson? 

""When things are about to boil over,"" White says, the appropriate tactic is ""a show of force rather than use of force.""

This translates as a police presence, which he says acts as ""a visual deterrent"" to violence, looting, and other criminal acts that can happen when frustrated people gather.  

Cops are taught what level of force to use by their police departments, usually decided on as a state policy. White says most of the time this policy is taught as a ""use of force continuum,"" which the National Institute of Justice {defines as}<hyperlink=”http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/Pages/continuum.aspx”> ""an escalating series of actions an officer may take to resolve a situation.""

Here's {the NIJS example of the appropriate use of force}<hyperlink=”http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/Pages/continuum.aspx”>: 

• Officer Presence: No force is used
• Verbalization: Force is non-physical.
• Empty-Hand Control: Officers use bodily force to gain control of a situation.
• Less-Lethal Methods: Officers use less-lethal technologies to gain control of a situation.
• Lethal Force: Officers use lethal weapons to gain control of a situation. 

White says the point is to use the ""least amount of force necessary to accomplish the objective, usually to resolve police-citizen encounter peacefully.""

In Ferguson, the use of force has escalated with the behavior of the crowds. University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist David Klinger says that if protesters are throwing Molotov cocktails, bricks, and rocks — as has {reportedly been the case in Ferguson}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-protests-police-tear-gas-michael-brown-shooting-death-2014-8”> — then using higher degrees of force is appropriate. 

But ""some of it doesn't make any sense to me,"" he says, ""like pointing lethal rifles at the crowd — there's things (that the police in Ferguson) are doing that have me and my colleagues scratching our heads.""

Racial tensions that have been simmering for decades in the St. Louis suburb likely contributed to the quick escalation of the protests.

As you can see, there are income, housing, and education divides between the city's white and black residents.

On the surface it would seem an easy fix for the mainly white police force simply to adopt a less aggressive policy on traffic stops, which overwhelmingly and disproportionately snare black motorists.

That may be easier said than done, though.

Traffic fines are the St. Louis suburb's second-largest source of revenue and just about the only one that is growing appreciably. Municipal court fines, most of which arise from motor vehicle violations, accounted for 21 percent of general fund revenue and at $2.63 million last year, were the equivalent of more than 81 percent of police salaries before overtime.

The heavy reliance on these funds is emerging as a thorny issue for Ferguson following the Aug. 9 shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by white policeman Darren Wilson. Brown's death has sparked days of protests and nights of riots in the majority black community, many of whose residents complain about their treatment by Ferguson police.

""In the aftermath of this month's tragic events in Ferguson, the city will be forced to shift away from its increasing reliance on traffic fines as a revenue source,"" said James Parrott, chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute in New York. ""Not only is it a self-defeating budget practice, but it has exacerbated racial tensions.""

Ferguson's finance director declined a Reuters interview request and referred inquiries to the city manager who was not immediately available for comment.

The civil unrest has all but crippled the city of about 21,000, around a dozen miles north of downtown St. Louis, and has drawn an extensive and costly police response. Brown's family also has hired a legal team, raising the prospect that the city could face pricey litigation.

""One big unknown, aside from any potential lawsuit, is the tremendous cost of police overtime, which could lead to a troubling budget shortfall and force other tax and fee increases or service reductions,"" said Parrott.

STRIVING FOR BALANCE

Searching for other areas for revenue growth could prove an uphill task. The city describes itself as being in the midst of an ""extraordinarily slow"" economic recovery.

Sales tax receipts, for instance, have been highly variable since the recession, frequently falling short of projections. While fiscal 2014 sales tax receipts were budgeted for a 4 percent increase to just over $6 million, this revenue source remains some 13 percent below its peak in fiscal 2006 of around $6.9 million.

""Local economic circumstances continue to improve slowly, but steadily,"" the city's latest budget said. ""Unfortunately, this trend has not carried over to retail sales activity and sales tax collections.""

A property tax increase two years ago helped give an initial boost to that revenue line, but real estate taxes were forecast to dip slightly in the most recent budget year.

While the city denies in its budget that it explicitly targets court fines as a revenue source, it notes city police have placed greater emphasis on traffic control in recent years.

""Due to a more concentrated focus on traffic enforcement, municipal court revenues have risen about 44 percent ... from those in full-year 2010-2011,"" its 2013-2014 budget says. This has been boosted in recent years by the use of traffic cameras.

A study released last week by a group of St. Louis-area public defenders, ArchCity Defenders, detailed the perception of local black residents that they are singled out by the police for traffic stops and treated unfairly by the local courts.

""If you’re black, they’re going to stop you,"" the study quoted one traffic defendant as saying.

In 2013, 86 percent of all Ferguson police traffic stops involved black drivers, the largest share since the Missouri Attorney General's Office began tracking the data in 2000. According to 2010 U.S. Census data, the city is 63 percent black and 34 percent white.

""If the city were to try to be seen as not targeting blacks, but maintain similar revenue levels, then it would probably have to pull over a much higher proportion of whites,"" said Jeff Smith, assistant professor at The New School and a former Missouri state senator.

Arlando Travis, a 38-year-old owner of a landscaping business in Ferguson described how a friend of his, a minister, had been pulled over for a traffic stop.

""They see a 60-year-old and driving a $70,000 car and he can't find his insurance card ... he just forgot it, but they don't listen,"" Travis said. ""Can't they use some common sense?""",NA,NA,NA,Reuters
