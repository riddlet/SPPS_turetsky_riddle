Cole and artists from his label stopped by QuikTrip, the gas station referred to as ""ground zero"" where protesters and police have squared off and not too far from the street where Brown reportedly lay dead for hours after Officer Darren Wilson, 28, shot him to death.

Brown, 18, was unarmed.

An autopsy report released by the family this weekend shows Brown was shot six times, twice in the head, apparently from a distance (there was no gun powder residue on his body; his clothes were not available for testing), causing tensions to rise again. Police say molotov cocktails and gunfire have come from the protesters and at least two people have been wounded from civilian weapons.

The National Guard was deployed to Ferguson this morning.

""He was not an animal but that's how he was killed,"" Brown's cousin Ty Pruitt said during a memorial service Sunday (Aug. 17).

The officer should be ""held accountable to the full extent of the law,"" Benjamin Crump, the family's lawyer, insisted.

Many protesters have rallied peacefully.

""It continues to be an 'us against them' mentality..."" {Cedric the Entertainer}<hyperlink="""">, a native of the area, said on CNN this morning. ""Right now it feels like the officer in question is being protected by the blue line. ... Why can't they get to the bottom line of this 9, 10 days later? This is what has the young people upset so much, this is why they feel like they're constantly under attack...""

I grew up just a few miles away from the 2900 block of Canfield Drive, where the unarmed 18-year-old was gunned down by a police officer on Saturday. I bought back-to-school clothes with my mom at the Famous Barr department store at the old Northland Shopping Center near Brown's house. I played football and ran track against Normandy High School, where Brown graduated. I never met Michael Brown, but I feel connected to his story.

In recent years, I've written about the shooting deaths of unarmed teens {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/2012/03/15/commentary-trayvon-martin-and-the-vilification-of-young-black-men.html"">, {Jordan Davis}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/2014/02/15/commentary-we-continue-to-wait-for-justice-for-jordan-davis.html""> and {Renisha McBride}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/2014/08/07/commentary-how-the-ap-slandered-renisha-mcbride-even-in-death.html"">. Now I must add Michael Brown to this sad list. Today would have been his first day in college.

But today's news coverage about Brown didn't focus on what might have been the start of his adult life and the ongoing investigation into his death. Instead, the story changed Sunday evening as a day of peaceful protests in Ferguson turned into a {night of violence}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/2014/08/11/in-st-louis-police-shooting-of-michael-brown-leads-to-rioting.html""> and looting.

Most of the demonstrators did not participate in the mayhem, but the few who did captured the headlines. Thirty-two people were {arrested}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Reports-Ferguson-protests-turn-violent-270697451.html""> and two police officers suffered minor injures in the incident. By Monday morning, two huge photos of fire and looting on the front page of the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/""> eclipsed the tiny, grainy portrait of Brown under a 1-column headline that called him a ""{gentle giant}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/michael-brown-remembered-as-a-gentle-giant/article_cbafa12e-7305-5fd7-8e0e-3139f472d130.html"">.""

As a native St. Louisan, I was surprised by the expression of outrage in Ferguson this weekend. That's because residents in my hometown have no real history of big protests, much less rioting. When major cities erupted in riots after Dr. King was assassinated in 1968, {St. Louis wasn't one of them}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/a-look-back-after-the-rev-king-s-murder-st/article_b96ca31e-5612-562f-9fe1-3e9d0c88b050.html"">. And while nearby East St. Louis, Illinois, has a {famous history}<hyperlink=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/garvey/peopleevents/e_estlouis.html""> of rioting, I don't remember hearing about or seeing similar incidents in St. Louis.

For a long time, Black St. Louisans struck me as timid. Once when I was younger, I asked an aunt if we could go to the fourth of July Veiled Prophet Fair under the Arch downtown. ""No,"" she told me. ""Them white folks ain't gonna let us go there."" From my experience, St. Louis was a segregated collection of communities where people just knew ""their place."" That is, until this weekend.

Part of what surprised me about the protest in Ferguson is that Black residents would stand up against their own, presumably, Black city government. After all, Ferguson is a mostly Black municipality. But I learned today that the city's racial composition is not necessarily reflected in its government and its institutions.

Although {67 percent of Ferguson residents are Black}<hyperlink=""http://censusviewer.com/city/MO/Ferguson"">, most of the local cops shown on television were white. Perhaps this racial imbalance explains why Black drivers in Ferguson are {twice as likely}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf""> to be searched and twice as likely to be arrested compared to white drivers. And their disparities don't end at the police department. From the looks of the city's own web site, the {city council}<hyperlink=""http://www.fergusoncity.com/171/Council-Members""> of this mostly Black city appears to be overwhelmingly white as well.

When the police and elected representatives don't reflect the population, it's not surprising that residents would lack faith in their institutions in times of turmoil. And since county police are also facing a {racial profiling lawsuit}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/naacp-files-civil-rights-complaint-against-st-louis-county-police/article_5e3ddfee-b883-55a1-bf08-948f74c96e47.html"">, they can't be trusted either to lead the investigation into Brown's death.

Still, violence is not the answer.

""I'm absolutely convinced that a riot merely intensifies the fears of the white community while {relieving the guilt}<hyperlink=""http://www.gphistorical.org/mlk/mlkspeech/index.htm"">,"" Dr. King told an audience in Michigan a few weeks before his own assassination would spark riots across the country.

But Dr. King didn't place all the burden on rioters to follow his nonviolent ways. A riot is ""the language of the unheard,"" King warned. ""As long as justice is postponed, we always stand on the verge of these darker nights of social disruption.""

Just as Dr. King had a dream for a better America, Michael Brown had a dream that he could go to college and make a better life for himself. Perhaps no one else understood his dream more than his mother, Lesley McSpadden.

""You know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate?"" {she told a reporter}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2014/08/10/dnt-misouri-teen-shooting-protests.kmov"">. ""You know how many Black men graduate? Not many!"" she said. ""Because you bring them down to this type of level where they feel they don't got nothing to live for anyway.""

Police shootings of unarmed civilians are still relatively rare in our country, but they often seem to happen to Black men. How many more {Michael Browns}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/fbi-opens-investigation-into-shooting-of-michael-brown/?utm_term=.d1511d73904f"">, {Eric Garners}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/2014/07/28/family-of-eric-garner-speaks-out-wants-justice.html"">, {Oscar Grants}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/2013/07/12/commentary-from-fruitvale-station-to-retreat-view-circle.html"">, {Sean Bells}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/nyregion/in-sean-bell-killing-4-officers-to-be-forced-out.html?_r=0"">, or {Amadou Diallos}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/05/nyregion/officers-in-bronx-fire-41-shots-and-an-unarmed-man-is-killed.html""> does it take before Black men just can't take it anymore?

Anonymous, an international collective of hacker activists, recently released a video warning the Ferguson, Missouri, police of retaliation if the officers harmed the demonstrators protesting the fatal {shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/2014/08/12/shooting-of-michael-brown-needs-fair-investigation-lawyers.html""> of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/2014/08/12/missouri-shooting-victim-called-quiet-respectful.html"">.

The notorious group also pointed to a graphic image showing the 18-year-old boy lying in the street and alleged that police officers had refused to move his body for 15 hours on Aug. 8.

“The entire global collective of Anonymous is outraged at this cold-blooded murder of a young teen. Not a week goes by that some young person, usually of minority ethnicity, is slaughtered by murderous police in the USA,” a cryptic voice {said}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/hacker-group-anonymous-threatens-mo-police-article-1.1900772""> in the video.

“For this reason, Anonymous will not be satisfied this time, as we have in the past, with simply obtaining justice for this young man and his family. Anonymous demands that the congressional representatives and senators from Missouri introduce legislation entitled ‘Mike Brown’s Law’ that will set strict national standards for police conduct in the USA. We further demand that this new law include specific language to grant the victims of police violence the same rights and prerogatives that are already enjoyed nationwide by the victims of other violent criminals.”

For the past two nights, groups of enraged residents have held rallies in the Ferguson and St. Louis streets. Anonymous vowed to take the Ferguson departments and governments offline and release the personal information of officers if protesters were abused, harassed or harmed in any way.

""That is not a threat, it is a promise,” the video’s narrator {said}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSRQ-c1XW0"">. ""The police have clearly crossed a line in the sand.”

An OpFerguson Twitter {account}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/OpFerguson""> has also been launched by the hacktivist group.

The Ferguson Police Department decided against releasing the name of the officer involved in Brown’s death on Tuesday after the department began receiving threats, such as the Anonymous video, the NY Daily News {reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/hacker-group-anonymous-threatens-mo-police-article-1.1900772"">.",42,NA,Anonymous posted the name of the Ferguson cop who they say shot and killed Mike Brown.,NA

To {Nelly}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/topics/n/nelly.html"">, the story is personal. As a proud St. Louis native, some in the community saw it as his responsibility to be one of the first people to speak up about the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown. 

Nelly Mo broke his silence about Brown's murder and the subsequent unrest that has followed during an interview with hometown radio station {Hot 104.1}<hyperlink=""http://hot1041stl.com/""> Thursday afternoon (Aug. 14). The rapper encouraged Ferguson residents not to resort to more {looting and rioting}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/2014/08/11/in-st-louis-police-shooting-of-michael-brown-leads-to-rioting.html"">. ""Sometimes when you are so angry, instead of reacting, that's the time when you really need to take a deep breath,"" advised the St. Lunatic, who noted that using anger as ""a weapon,"" won't ""accomplish anything.""

The Grammy winner was in Helsinki, Switzerland, when he found out about Brown's death. In the days since, he privately contacted the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, to put together a scholarship in Brown's name. ""So brothers can go to school in his honor because he paid for that,"" he explained. 

Nelly's goal was to figure out a way to not ""disrespect"" Brown's legacy by taking the ""focus off the issue."" He believes that the non-peaceful protests have done just that. ""You don't use your last resort first,"" explained Nelly. ""We gotta do something different. Black boys have been dying since we came to this country, ain't nothin' changed. He [Officer Darren Wilson] will not be the last cop to shoot an unarmed black man.""

Within hours of Brown's slaying last Saturday, the story spread over social media and by the following day, the city of Ferguson was making international news. Brown getting gunned down turned out to be the {last straw}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/5999929/shooting-mike-brown-final-straw-ferguson-st-louis-missouri""> for the community. More than 60 percent of Ferguson's residents are Black, while the police force is over 90 percent white. The lack of diversity and accounts of racial profiling occurred long before Brown was gunned down.

Ferguson police have no dash cam evidence of the teen's shooting. Out of 18 patrol cars in the city, just two dash cams and wearable body cameras were purchased for officers. The cameras have yet to be installed. 

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has since ordered state Highway Patrol officers to take over for Ferguson police. The decision has already calmed tensions for the first time in nearly a week. 

For now, the people of Ferguson must wait for the justice system to run it's course, Nelly said. If Wilson is not held accountable for killing Brown, only then will it be suitable to strategize the next step. ""Right now, it's a murder,"" continued Nelly. ""The injustice comes if the verdict is not sufficient or we think the penalty is not stiff enough.""",4,NA,"St. Louis native speaks on Michael Brown shooting, announces scholarship fund in teen's honor.",NA

Brown was to start college two days after he was gunned down in the St. Louis suburb. There are conflicting accounts as to what led to his death. Ferguson police say Brown tussled with and reached for the gun of the officer who shot him.

A friend walking with him at the time claims the cop was {the aggressor}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> and unloaded bullets into Brown even after he put his hands in the air. Witnesses have corroborated the friend's account.

After providing an update on the U.S.-led humanitarian effort in Iraq, Obama focused his remarks on Ferguson, Missouri, which has been in turmoil following the Aug. 9 {fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/2014/08/11/in-st-louis-police-shooting-of-michael-brown-leads-to-rioting.html""> by local police.

Acknowledging that the images of police clashing with protesters have been ""deeply disturbing,"" the president called on those on both sides of the conflict to take a step back.

""It's important to remember how this started. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again. And when something like this happens, the local authorities, including the police, have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death and how they're protecting the people in their communities,"" Obama said. ""There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment right.""

Earlier in the week, the president {delivered a brief statement on the incident}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/politics/2014/08/12/obama-weighs-in-on-death-of-michael-brown.html""> in which he urged the residents of Ferguson and communities across the nation to not let the ""strong passions"" the tragedy has prompted to take over. But that is easier said than done, and in the largely African-American Missouri community, where those passions are particularly raw, there has been daily unrest and clashes with the local police.

The police arrested more than 10 people on Wednesday, including Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman, and two reporters writing up their stories inside a McDonald's, who said they were treated roughly by the police, which was ""horrifying.""

The police chief's refusal to name the officer who killed Brown has only exacerbated tensions, so on Thursday morning, the computer hacking collective known as Anonymous disclosed his name and is threatening to publish more information about him unless it hears from the St. Louis County Police Department.

Attorney Gen. Eric Holder is monitoring developments and FBI agents have been dispatched to supplement the investigation. But members of the Congressional Black Caucus strongly believe that the police department at the center of the controversy cannot be trusted to properly investigate itself, especially given the decades-long tension with residents, and is calling on the Justice Department to lead the inquiry.

Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill also has little faith in the local police and admonished their handling of the protesters.

For people in Ferguson and beyond, a central question now is: When will things return to normal?

With the exception of one night of calm, the days since the killing of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/features/michael-brown.html"">, a Black teenager shot by a white police officer, have been filled with violence, chaos and discord. Each night has brought some degree of violence and many here continue to wonder when it will all end.

But the theories on how Ferguson might someday emerge from this scenario vary widely. However, there seem to be a few central points that elected officials, activists and others seem to agree on.

“What would help the situation here would be the arrest of the officer and having him charged with a crime,” said {Courtney A. Curtis}<hyperlink=""http://www.house.mo.gov/member.aspx?district=073"">, a Missouri state representative who represents portions of Ferguson, speaking with BET.com.

“Another thing that might help is having the Ferguson police chief resign and the Department of Justice taking over the investigation,” Curtis said. “County prosecutor McCulloch needs to resign after giving up the case. I think all of that would help the situation here pretty quickly.”

Indeed, the calls for an arrest and an indictment have come from nearly all quarters. The family of Michael Brown insists that it believes that calm in the streets will be the direct result of an arrest of Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot the unarmed Brown.

“The family believes that the arrest of the man who killed their child would help deal with the situation in the streets,” said Anthony Gray, a lawyer for Michael Brown’s parents, speaking with BET.com.

“From the family’s point of view, this is central,” Gray said. “They believe, whether anyone else does or not, the accounts from witnesses who said that their son was shot and killed in broad daylight without provocation.”

Meanwhile, there are several local officials and activists who contend that, while the overwhelming numbers of protesters are demonstrating peacefully, there is a small group that seems to be committed to violence.

Speaking on MSNBC on Tuesday, Missouri State Senator {Maria Chappelle-Nadal}<hyperlink=""http://www.senate.mo.gov/13info/Members/D14/bio.htm""> said that there were small numbers of out-of-town “anarchists” determined to create havoc in Ferguson. That has also been discussed widely on social media. 

On the other hand, many describe genuine anger with longstanding conditions in Ferguson over the years that have made life difficult for African-American residents. They describe a high number of police stops of Black residents and a history of antagonistic relations between a 53-member police department that has only three Black officers in a city of 22,000 people that is two-thirds Black.

Still, it is clear that a level of fatigue is slowly setting in among Ferguson residents who are eager for things to return to normal, where they can send their children to school and where they can sleep without overnight turmoil.",4,NA,"After more than 10 days of unrest, there are many in this St. Louis suburb who long for an end to the violence.",NA

They are heartbroken, but hope to use the fatal shooting of Michael Brown and the aftermath to teach an important civics lesson.

{Rep. James Clyburn}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/topics/j/james-clyburn.html"">, the third-most powerful Democrat in the House, speaking on MSNBC, said that while people are reacting to what's happening in Ferguson now, the disrespect that the police have shown African-Americans these past several days didn't start with Brown's shooting, nor is such treatment limited to Ferguson.

Clyburn said that he has been talking with {Congressional Black Caucus}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/topics/c/congressional-black-caucus.html""> {Chairwoman Marcia Fudge}<hyperlink=""https://fudge.house.gov/""> (D-Ohio) about ways to use what's happening in the Missouri community to engage African-American communities around the nation. The ultimate goal is to help them understand ""the relationship between the treatment they get from elected officials and their participation in the electoral process,"" he explained. The voters are there, Clyburn added, ""but for some reason they're not participating and we've got to do something about that because we're not going to solve these problems if we stay out of the arena.""

The South Carolina Democrat supports being tough on crime, but a seemingly growing epidemic of ""death on blacks"" looks deliberate to him, he said, citing the police chokehold that killed Eric Garner. He also supports law enforcement, but believes a way must be found to weed out the bad people wearing badges.

""We can't let Ferguson be just another statistic. We've got to get involved,"" Clyburn said. ""Hopefully this will jump start a movement that will have people all over this country taking a hard look at their communities, the treatment they're getting from elected officials and whether or not that's going to start them participating [in the electoral process] at a greater level as we go forward.""

{Rep. John Lewis}<hyperlink=""https://johnlewis.house.gov/""> (D-Georgia), an icon of the civil rights movement, said that the events unfolding in Ferguson have taken him back to that painful period in history. He also suggested that it's very difficult to expect peace and order in a city where so few symbols or people in positions of power, particularly in law enforcement, reflect the majority of people they represent and serve.

Lewis urged elected officials and community leaders to work together to address what's been happening in Ferguson, but said change starts with law enforcement treating all citizens with respect.

""If we fail to act, the fires of frustration and discontent will continue to burn not only in Ferguson, Missouri, but all across America,"" he said.",1,NA,Lawmakers hope African-Americans have been spurred to engage.,NA

Hicks,8/14/2014,9/14/2016,"The television coverage depicts tear gas being hurled at demonstrators and smoke bombs being detonated amid citizens. These are not scenes from Gaza or the Ukraine. Instead, this is the carnage taking place in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, where police officers are confronting citizens who are seeking to demonstrate their anger and frustration over the death of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/photos/2014/08/what-s-happening-in-ferguson.html#!050415-national-ferguson-michael-brown"">, an an unarmed 18-year-old student.

The death of Brown, a college-bound, African-American teen, is shocking and outrageous in its own right. However, the response of St. Louis County police to a deeply held desire of citizens of the largely Black Ferguson to vent their frustration has added a good deal of fuel to the fire.
Another factor is the utter failure of the police in St. Louis County to provide any information on the results of their findings so far, including the number of bullets fired at the young teenager (as though that fact would usurp the effectiveness of an investigation). They also have refused to release the name of the police officer who shot Brown.

The police in St. Louis County and in Ferguson have behaved badly. They have treated local residents like an occupying force, much like what one would see in a war zone. They matched the presence of citizens simply attempting to demonstrate with the kind of military presence one would find in Iraq.

Before long, the overzealous force of the police department extended to the media. And the local police wound up arresting two reporters — one from the Huffington Post and another from The Washington Post — for doing nothing more sinister than sitting in a McDonald's. 

According to the journalists detained, the arresting officers continued to urge the journalists to ""stop resisting arrest,"" although both insisted they had no such intention.  

Meanwhile, the scenes from Ferguson bring back images of Bull Connor’s attempt to shut down Black demonstrators in another era. They have been obscene, shocking and scandalous.

None of this has been lost on {President Obama}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/topics/b/barack-obama.html"">, who interrupted his vacation in Martha’s Vineyard to address the situation in Ferguson. The president condemned lawlessness and looting that followed the day after Michael Brown’s killing. On the other hand, he made clear that the local police carried their share of blame. 

The president said he was “deeply concerned” about “the deployment of military equipment and vehicles” to combat protesters in Ferguson.

""Ferguson resembles Fallujah more than it does the Ferguson that we had right off I-70 during the 1960s and '70s.

""And all you have to do is look at the demographics and then look at positions that people hold in the community.

Cleaver fears that until ""the hoodlums who have kind of pushed themselves into this situation"" are out of the equation, it may be impossible for the Justice Department and the FBI to conduct thorough investigations.

Neither he nor {Rep.

""He was already assassinated, so now you’re going to assassinate his character?"" Clay asked angrily. ""[W]hat they did today was to negatively influence a jury pool in St. Louis County."" 

For Clay, the longtime history of strife between the Missouri town's majority white police force and majority African-American residents isn't just political; it's personal.

Hicks,8/11/2014,9/14/2016,"Community activists and elected officials in a St. Louis suburb are trying to come to grips with a weekend of high strung emotion, including an evening of rioting following the shooting by police of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed Black man.

Brown was shot and killed on Saturday amid conflicting accounts of the events that led to his death. Police said the teenager had physically assaulted an officer from the police force in Ferguson, Missouri, who fired multiple shots at Brown.

A friend of the teenager said he had been stopped by the police walking in the neighborhood and told to get off the sidewalk. The friend said Brown started walking away and put his arms in the air to indicate that he was compliant and the police shot him and he fell to the ground and died.

The incident and the violent aftermath have created a highly charged situation in this normally quiet St. Louis suburb. And the attention now is on curbing the violence and ensuring that an investigation of the death of Brown is open and transparent.

“It’s important to get all the city and community leaders, clergy and nonprofits on board to deal with this situation,” said {Lewis E. Reed}<hyperlink=""https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/aldermen/profiles/profile-president-lewis-reed.cfm"">, president of the St. Louis Board of Alderman, in an interview with BET.com.

“One thing is for sure: To meet this thing with more violence is not going to help,” Reed said. “All it does is put more young people at risk. We need to give people some confidence that there will be a thorough and complete investigation that it’s transparent. That will move us past where we are.”

He added: “As long as people feel justice will not be serviced, we will see the kind of things we saw. It’s important to give people some confidence that justice is being attained.

Even before the rioting, the death of the teenage Brown sparked widespread attention in the world of social media, with photos of the uncovered, dead teenager lying in the street. And the {Rev. Al Sharpton}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/topics/a/rev-al-sharpton.html""> said he would dispatch one of his aides from the National Action Network to assess the situation.

Sunday afternoon began with a protest rally that included clergy and community leaders. Later in the day, however, the event turned violent as younger members of the community started looting businesses and rioting in the streets of Ferguson. Police said roughly 150 officers in riot gear were dispatched from throughout St. Louis County.

“The violence takes away the focus from the issue of the death of Michael Brown,” said {Courtney A. Curtis}<hyperlink=""http://www.house.mo.gov/member.aspx?district=073"">, a state representative who represents portions of St. Louis County, speaking with BET.com.

”The family said they are seeking justice and peace and they have made clear that violence and looting are not what they wanted to see. They feel they are not signs of justice or peace. “

Curtis said that the violence was generated by young people in the community “who are leery of the police and who are not as inclined to put their stock in peaceful action. Before long, it was pandemonium.”

Curtis and other elected officials say that, now that the cleanup has begun following the rioting, it is important to refocus the community’s attention on the events that led to the death of Brown. 

“He was an 18-year-old kid who, by all accounts was a good kid,” Reed said. “He was headed to college and had his whole life ahead of him.”

Reed added that there was a wide gulf between the police account of what led to the shooting and the version described by onlookers.

“But the common theme was that both his hands were up and he was unarmed,” Reed said. “There are a number of troubling questions that need to be asked.”",NA,NA,An unarmed 18-year-old man was shot by police in an event that led to rioting and looting in a St. Louis suburb.,NA

“The police need to be very transparent and forthright in this investigation,” said {Benjamin Crump}<hyperlink=""http://parkscrump.com/attorneys/benjamin-crump/"">, who is one of the lawyers for the family, speaking with BET.com. “The important thing is that this is open and transparent enough that people don’t think things are being swept under the rug.”

Anthony D. Gray, the other lawyer working with Crump in the Michael Brown case, said he had misgivings about the objectivity of law enforcement officials in St. Louis County. He said they had conducted interviews with police officials who were on the scene when Brown was shot but had failed to interview any of the witnesses.

“I believe St. Louis County lost their objectivity,” Gray said, speaking with BET.com. 

“There is video footage that the police confiscated,” said Gray, who is based in St. Louis. “The police asked one young lady who was a witness for her phone. The police have what we think is raw footage. We’re not here to indict all police officers. We have strong suspicions on this one.""

On Saturday, the teenage Brown was shot multiple times after an altercation with a police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. There are varying accounts of the interaction, with police saying he had been excessively belligerent and witnesses saying Brown had his hands up to indicate compliance.
Meanwhile, it has become clear that the shooting is generating scrutiny from beyond authorities in the St. Louis area, including Attorney General Eric Holder.

“The shooting incident in Ferguson, Missouri, this weekend deserves a fulsome review,” Holder said, in a statement. “In addition to the local investigation already underway, FBI agents from the St. Louis field office, working together with attorneys from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office, have opened a concurrent, federal inquiry.”

He added: “I will continue to receive regular updates on this matter in the coming days. Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”
Following the shooting, there was a peaceful demonstration led by clergy, community leaders and elected officials. However, that was followed by looting and rioting in the St. Louis suburb, leading to a number of injuries.

“We’re concerned that the rioting will shift the focus from the death of Michael Brown,” Crump said. “We can’t have people getting hurt when we’re standing up against police violence. At the end of the day, we have to put the message out that we want people to be responsible, especially the police. We can’t illustrate how to be responsible by engaging in irresponsible behavior.

In a statement, {President Obama}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/topics/b/barack-obama.html""> expressed sympathy for the family of Brown.

""The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time,"" read the president's statement. ""As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed.”

The president added: ""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.""

Crump added that it is “heartbreaking” to be involved in another case involving the death of an unarmed young Black man.

In less than one week, Johnson has become a nationally recognized figure in the aftermath of the {killing of the unarmed 18-year-old}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/national/photos/2014/08/what-s-happening-in-ferguson.html#!042915-national-ferguson""> in this St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. After being tapped by the Missouri governor to command the security operation in the aftermath of several chaotic nights, Johnson has attracted attention for his plain-spoken talk about the importance of the community to be heard. 

“This is my neighborhood,” Johnson said to the cheering audience. “You are my family, friends. And I am you. I will stand to protect you, to protect your right to protest.”

Johnson continued: “The last 24 hours have been tough for me. I did an interview last night and the reporter said, 'Something is wrong, your tone has changed. Are you tired or is something bothering you?' I said my heart is heavy. Last night I met members of Michael Brown’s family. They brought tears to my eyes.”

Johnson has become one of the best known figures to emerge from the thorny and controversial events playing themselves out with unpredictable drama each day here. On Saturday, for example, his image appeared on the front page of the New York Times. 

But keeping the peace in Ferguson has proven a painful and difficult task with a continued strong police presence in the aftermath of Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon imposing a state of emergency and midnight curfew in Ferguson. Apart from one violence-free night since Michael Brown was shot more than a week ago, there have been episodes of unrest on a nightly basis. 

“When the governor first gave me this opportunity, there was a lot of fear,” Johnson said, speaking with BET.com. “But the first time I stepped out into the crowd and saw the people, it became truly an honor. And that’s what it’s been ever since – just an honor.”

He continued: “Watching the events change and the attitudes change has truly been an honor. We’ve had some bumps in the road. But it’s getting better. We know there will be some time to see change and get that healing process going.”

In many ways, Johnson, who is 51 and was raised in Ferguson, grew up in a typical suburban, middle-class African-American household. He was raised in a home where his father worked in campus security for St. Louis University and a mother who worked as a chemical receiving clerk. Johnson wanted to be a police officer from the time he was a child. 

Soon after graduating from Florissant Valley College, he joined the Missouri Highway Patrol in 1987. He rose quickly through the ranks and was made a captain on the force in 2002. He now lives in Florissant, adjacent to Ferguson, with his wife. He has a son and daughter, both in their 20s.

In the midst of this challenging environment, the question is how will Johnson and his fellow law enforcement officials move forward and bring calm to the community.

“We have to continue talking, continue to have an understanding and continue reaching out and just listening,” he said. “We want people to express their opinion, but we have to listen.”

Despite the attention he has received, he said he is under no illusions that the media coverage of him necessarily converts into popularity.

“Some of the people I encounter are angry,” he said. “Some of the people don’t want me there. They tell me that I’m just a speaker face, just a box. But I will continue to come back. But at the end of the day, my integrity will still be there.”",4,NA,The Missouri Highway Patrol officer has received national attention after being placed in charge of the law enforcement response in Ferguson.,NA

He also said that the constitutional rights to speak freely, peacefully protest and to report on it in the press must be ""vigilantly safeguarded"" and condemned excessive force by police.

""In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,"" Obama said, adding that he hopes to change both perception and reality through programs like his My Brother's Keeper initiative. ""But that requires that we build and not tear down. And that requires that we listen and not just shout. That's how we're going to move forward together: by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another.""

He also will meet with community leaders, ""whose support is so critical to bringing about peace and calm"" there. On Tuesday, Ronald Davis, who heads DOJ's {Community Oriented Policing Services}<hyperlink=""http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/"">, will travel to Ferguson to work with police officials on the ground.

Despite the president's call for {peace and calm last Thursday}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/politics/2014/08/14/obama-addresses-crises-in-ferguson-and-iraq.html"">, chaos has escalated in Ferguson, prompting Nixon to declare a state of emergency and call in the National Guard. Obama said he would assess the National Guard's impact to determine whether it is helping or hindering the situation.

Since taking office as the nation's first African-American president, race and race relations have served as landmines around which Obama treads carefully. Black leaders were both appreciative of and surprised when he delivered heartfelt and very personal remarks in response to the George Zimmerman verdict and spoke very frankly about the still very sensitive subject. So far that hasn't been the case with Michael Brown and some critics are asking whether the president is personally doing enough.

One of those critics is professor and frequent MSNBC guest Michael Eric Dyson, who is an ardent supporter of the president. Speaking on this week's edition of {Face the Nation}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-august-17-2014-nixon-brooks-rogers/"">, Dyson called on Obama to have a bigger voice in the Ferguson crisis.

""I yearn for more response from the White House. This president knows better than most what happens in poor communities that have been antagonized historically by the hostile relationship between black people and the police department.  It is not enough for him to come on national television and pretend there is a false moral equivalency between police people who are armed and black people who are vulnerable constantly to this,"" Dyson said. ""He needs to use his bully pulpit to step up and articulate this as a vision, not necessarily in terms of public policy alone, because Eric Holder is doing a tremendous job in filling in those gaps, but we need presidential leadership. He needs to step up to the plate and be responsible.""

When asked at Monday's press conference if there is more that he could do personally, Obama defended his cautious approach.

""I have to be very careful about not pre-judging these events before investigations are completed because although these are, you know, issues of local jurisdiction, you know, the DOJ works for me, and when they’re conducting an investigation, I’ve got to make sure that I don’t look like I’m putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other,"" he said.

His way of helping young men of color, some of whom for whatever reason are more likely to end up in the criminal justice system instead of college or a good job, he said, is through My Brother's Keeper and other similar efforts to get them on a better track.

""Part of my job that I can do I think without any potential conflicts is to get at those root causes,"" he said, but also acknowledged the disparate treatment African-American and Latino boys receive as early as elementary school.

And, as he has in previous remarks about Ferguson, Obama noted the ""danger and difficulty of law enforcement,"" which he said must be respected.

""But what is also true is that given the history of this country, where we can make progress in building up more confidence, more trust, making sure that our criminal justice system is acutely aware of the possibilities of disparities in treatment, there are safeguards in place to avoid those disparities, where, you know, training and assistance is provided to local law enforcement who, you know, may just need more information in order to avoid potential disparity. All those things can make a difference,"" the president said.",6,NA,President Obama provides updates on investigation into Michael Brown shooting.,NA

Obama acknowledged the ""strong passions"" the tragedy has unleashed in the Missouri community and in communities across the nation, and cautioned everyone to act cautiously and thoughtfully.

""As details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" the president said. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.

Local residents have been protesting the racially charged shooting and have faced off with the police in Ferguson, where African-Americans comprise more than half of the population and more than 90 percent of law enforcement officers are white.

Holder, in a statement released Monday, said the shooting incident deserves a ""fulsome review,"" and although the FBI will participate in the investigation, its work would ""supplement, rather than supplant,"" the local authorities' inquiry.

""At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right. I will continue to receive regular updates on this matter in the coming days. Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve,"" he said.

(AP) — Michael Brown Sr. stood alone in the center of the narrow street where the blood of his namesake son still stained the gray pavement, two days after the 18-year-old was shot dead by a police officer. He straightened a waist-high wooden cross and re-lit the candles erected as part of a makeshift memorial.

""He was funny, silly, he would make you laugh,"" his father said, and when there was ""any problem going on, any situation, there wasn't nothing that he couldn't solve. He could bring people back together.""

Brown, who was unarmed, was shot Saturday by a Ferguson police officer while walking with a friend down the center of the street. Police have said a scuffle broke out after the officer asked the boys to move to the side. Witnesses say Brown's arms were in the air — in a sign of surrender — as a white policeman repeatedly shot the black youth.

After a vigil Sunday night, an angry crowd looted stores, and a night later police in Ferguson fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse protesters.

Civil rights activist {Al Sharpton}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/topics/a/rev-al-sharpton.html""> was to meet with Brown's family on Tuesday as tensions remained high.

Brown, who had recently graduated from Normandy High School, had been staying at his grandmother's apartment, where he would often hang out in the parking lot tossing a football with friends, said Markese Mull, a neighbor whose 17-year-old-son was one of Brown's closer friends.

Brown was an aspiring rapper, though it was more of a hobby. This week, he was supposed to start college in pursuit of a career as a heating and air conditioning engineer. On the day of this death, Brown had walked with another friend to a nearby convenience store. Mull saw them in the street and honked his horn to say to ""hi"" — just minutes before the police officer came by.

""He was never a person who liked confrontation,"" Mull said. ""His smile was going to make you smile.""

Neighbors described Brown as quiet and respectful — a ""good boy,"" who ""was never in trouble,"" said Sharon Johnson, 58, who lives just a little ways down the street. Johnson said Brown would frequently stop to chat.

""We talked about how when you turn yourself to the Lord you feel so good — and good things come your way,"" Johnson said. ""He had a more mature mind than a little boy's mind.""

On Monday, Johnson was standing at the side of the street where Brown was shot as a woman who had driven in from a nearby community preached loudly to anyone willing to listen about the importance of peaceful protests and parental discipline for teenagers.

A passing car stopped, letting out a man wearing a newly made black T-shirt bearing Brown's baby picture and the words ""NO JUSTICE NO PEACE.""

""I'm his father,"" he said somberly, eliciting hugs.

The older Brown picked up a piece of cardboard that had been lying on the ground. ""End police brutality,"" it read. He placed it on a pile of toy animals stacked by a streetlight pole, then set about straightening up his son's mid-street memorial.

From 2005 to 2012, a white police officer killed a Black person almost two times a week in the U.S., according to a recent USA Today {report}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/police-killings-data/14060357/"">.

Additionally, victims under age 21 make up 18 percent of the Blacks killed during those seven years, compared to 8.7 percent of whites. 

The data was attributed to an FBI database that contains the most recent accounts of justifiable homicide reported to the agency.

Yet, many have complained that the database, which remains the most complete nationwide account of police-involved killings, is limited and grossly underestimates the actual number of deaths.

As USA Today {reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/police-killings-data/14060357/"">:

-- The killings are self reported by law enforcement.

-- Only about 750 of the 17,000 law enforcement agencies in the U.S. participate.

-- The number of deaths are not audited after they are submitted to the FBI.

-- The statistic on “justifiable” homicides have conflicted with independent investigations of police-involved fatalities.

The New York Times reported ({http://nyti.ms/1mZThz0}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?ref=us&_r=1"">) that the autopsy by Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, found that one of the bullets entered the top of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.bet.com/news/features/michael-brown.html"">'s skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when he suffered a fatal injury.

Baden said it was likely the last of bullets to hit Brown, 18, whose death has spurred a week of rancorous protests in Ferguson, in suburban St. Louis.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

Baden told the Times that Brown was also shot four times in the right arm and that all the bullets were fired into his front. The newspaper said the bullets did not appear to have come from very close range because there was no gunpowder on his body.

That determination could change if there were residue on Brown's clothing, which Baden did not examine, the newspaper said.

Some of the bullets entered and exited Brown several times, the newspaper said, including one that caused at least five wounds. It said one shattered his right eye, went through his face, left through his jaw and re-entered his collarbone. The last two shots in the head would have stopped him in his tracks and were likely the last fired, the Times said.
