Lieb; Jim Salter,08/14/14,02/19/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — The Missouri Highway Patrol seized control of a St. Louis suburb Thursday, stripping local police of their law-enforcement authority after four days of clashes between officers in riot gear and furious crowds protesting the death of an unarmed black teen shot by an officer.

The intervention, ordered by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, came as President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting of Michael Brown and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town that is nearly 70 percent black patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

Obama said there was ""no excuse"" for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.

Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening in the neighborhood where looters smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and police repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

But the latest protests were a world apart from the earlier demonstrations, with a light, even festive atmosphere and no hint of violence. The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter.

Protester Cleo Willis said the change was palpable.

""You can feel it. You can see it,"" he said. ""Now it's up to us to ride that feeling.""

After a particularly violent Wednesday night, Nixon said local police would no longer be in charge of the area, although they would still be present. He said Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, would be in command.

The change was meant to ensure ""that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately,"" Nixon said.

""Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,"" the governor said at a news conference in the nearby community of Normandy.

The governor was joined at a news conference by the white mayor of St. Louis and the region's four state representatives and the county executive, all of whom are black.

Johnson said he grew up in the area and ""it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence."" He said he planned to keep heavily armored vehicles away from the scene and told his officers not to bring their gas masks.

By late afternoon, Johnson was walking down the street with a large group of protesters as they chanted ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" a reference to witness accounts that described Brown as having his hands in the air when the officer kept firing. He planned to talk to the demonstrators throughout the night.

""We're going to have some conversations with them and get an understanding of what's going on.""

At one point, Johnson spoke to several young men wearing red bandanas around their necks and faces. After the discussion, one of the men reached out and embraced him.

At the burned-out QuikTrip near the shooting scene, children drew on the ground with chalk and people left messages about Brown.

Earlier Thursday, Obama appealed for ""peace and calm"" on the streets.

""I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,"" Obama said, speaking from the Massachusetts island where he's on a two-week vacation. ""But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.""

Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control — a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police took over, leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the request of the smaller city.

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said his officers have responded with ""an incredible amount of restraint"" as they've had rocks and bottles thrown at them, been shot at and had two dozen patrol vehicles destroyed.

The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others.

The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said later that the name was incorrect.

Like last year's Trayvon Martin shooting, social media brought international attention to a tragedy that might otherwise have been known only to the immediate community. Ferguson spawned a proliferation of hashtags and was the dominant subject Thursday on Twitter, Facebook and other sites. Journalists and protesters offered real-time pictures, videos and text reports, and the world responded, often in outrage.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

The officer involved was injured, with one side of his face swollen, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told reporters that the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Attorney General Eric Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed eyewitnesses to the shooting. A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said federal authorities have interviewed Johnson.

Holder spoke by telephone Thursday with Brown's family to offer condolences and to tell them that the Justice Department was committed to a full and independent investigation.",9921,NA,NA,AP

The plan was announced Monday by St. Louis County police. It was not clear what would happen to those who refuse to use the area along West Florissant Avenue, where the majority of protests have occurred.

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney.

The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday. But she declined further comment, saying the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.

Family attorney Benjamin Crump said Brown's parents wanted the additional autopsy because they feared results of the county's examination could be biased. Crump declined to release copies of the report.

""They could not trust what was going to be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child,"" he said during Monday's news conference with Parcells and Baden, who has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

The second autopsy, Crump said, ""verifies that the witness accounts were true: that he was shot multiple times.""

Baden said one of the bullets entered the top of Brown's skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when he suffered that fatal injury. The hired pathologists said Brown, who also was shot four times in the right arm, could have survived the other bullet wounds.

Baden also said there was no gunpowder residue on Brown's body, indicating he was not shot at close range. However, Baden said he did not have access to Brown's clothing, and that it was possible the residue could be on the clothing.

Crump also noted that Brown had abrasions on his face from where he fell to the ground, but there was ""otherwise no evidence of a struggle.""",7409,NA,NA,AP

""Feels good to be home. I'll be standing with everyone in Ferguson all weekend #HandsUpDontShoot"" the billionaire posted late Friday, before unleashing dozens of Tweets and Vine video posts from protests in the Missouri town.

The hashtag references the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was shot dead by police a week ago, with some witnesses saying the young African American had his hands in the air when he was shot.

Over the weekend the social media maven shared scores of Tweets, many of them video posts from Twitter-owned Vine.

""We're here. My whole family! And @2000F,"" Dorsey posted, calling Square co-founder Jim McKelvey by his Twitter handle.

Dorsey's tweets from his @jack account chronicled a day of peaceful marching and protests, with photos and videos showing people holding placards, playing drums, singing, and chanting ""Hands up, don't shoot!""

He even posted video as rain swept over the evening's events: ""Huge lightning storm is our backdrop. #Ferguson""

Brown's slaying by a police officer sparked multiple nights of rioting and looting, with police resorting at times to tear gas, smoke bombs and rubber bullets.

The incident also renewed a national debate about relations between law enforcement and African Americans.

On Saturday Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and curfew that would last from midnight (0500 GMT) until 5:00 am for the St. Louis suburb.

(AP) — Nights of unrest have vied with calls for calm in a St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teenager was killed by police, while the community is still pressing for answers about the weekend shooting.

Hundreds of residents packed two churches Tuesday evening for community meetings about the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was confronted by a Ferguson officer while walking with a friend in the street near his grandmother's home.

People also gathered in the streets Tuesday night, shouting at police. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that police again fired tear gas into a crowd. One person was injured in a drive-by shooting, although it was not clear if the shooting was related to the protests. The Post-Dispatch also reported that a St. Louis County police officer shot and critically wounded a man who authorities said pulled a handgun on the officer.

The fatal shooting of Brown has exposed deep racial and economic fault lines in the community. At one church gathering with dozens of clergy members and elected officials, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon urged calm ""in the face of crisis.""

""We stand together tonight, reeling from what feels like an old wound torn open afresh,"" Nixon said. ""A wound that hadn't quite healed right in the first place, and now the pain is just as searing as when the injury first occurred.""

The other church rally featured the Rev. Al Sharpton, who earlier in the day pressed police to release the name of the police officer involved — but also pleaded for calm after a night of looting and vandalism and instances of police using tear gas.

""The local authorities have put themselves in a position — hiding names and not being transparent — where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,"" Sharpton said at a news conference with Brown's parents.

Ferguson police initially planned to release the name of the officer, who is on administrative leave, on Tuesday. But they said death threats to its officers prompted them to withhold it. . Computer hackers have also targeted the city's website and released details online about individual city employees.

""If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,"" Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said. ""We're taking the threats seriously.""

Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. Jackson said the city has had trouble recruiting and retaining black officers.

Investigators have released few details about the deadly encounter, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer on a routine patrol asked Brown and another teen to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, according to the St. Louis County Police Department, which is handling the investigation at the smaller city's request.

Several hundred protesters rallied Tuesday morning in the county seat of Clayton, urging St. Louis County's prosecutor to file criminal charges against the Ferguson officer.

Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., said at the news conference to ""come together and do this right ... no violence."" President Barack Obama also urged calm, saying people must comfort each other ""in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.""

Ferguson's mayor and police chief were among the speakers at the meeting Nixon attended. Both were welcomed with polite applause.

The forum was intended as an alternative response after two nights of unrest in which crowds had burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers. Organizers shared plans for numerous nonviolent responses, such as a prayer walk planned to mark the one-week anniversary of Brown's death and assembling teams of greeters to welcome back students at the high school from which Brown recently graduated.

The fullest account of Brown's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home with Brown when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who ordered them to move to the sidewalk. Johnson told news crews that he and Brown kept walking and the officer then reversed his car ""to where it almost hit us.""

The officer, Johnson said, tried to open his door, but it ""ricocheted"" back. Johnson said the officer reached through the window, ""grabbed my friend around the neck"" and tried to pull him into the car. The officer then reportedly pulled out his weapon and said, ""'I'll shoot you,' or 'I'm going to shoot,'"" Johnson said.

When the officer opened fire, Brown was hit, said Johnson, who hid behind a car. Brown kept running, Johnson said. Johnson said the officer pursued Brown and fired again. When Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. The officer kept firing, Johnson said.

Yahoo,yahoo7,http://news.yahoo.com/turmoil-tear-gas-way-hope-ferguson-053336976.html,"Police, protesters clash again in Ferguson",Jim Salter,08/16/14,02/29/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Police and about 200 protesters clashed again in Ferguson, Missouri late Friday after another tense day in the St. Louis suburb that included authorities identifying the officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager and releasing documents alleging the young man had been suspected of stealing a $48.99 box of cigars from a convenience store in a ""strong-arm"" robbery shortly before he was killed.

Several hundred people congregated on a busy Ferguson street Friday night as protests continued nearly a week after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer. It was peaceful until about midnight, when a large crowd broke into the convenience mart that Brown allegedly robbed the day he was killed.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson said some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police. Police used tear gas to disburse the crowd but no arrests were made. One officer was hurt, but information on his injuries was not immediately available. No protesters were hurt.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson earlier Friday said the officer who shot Brown did not know the teen was a robbery suspect at the time of the shooting and stopped Brown and a companion ""because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.""

Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white officer, has patrolled suburban St. Louis for six years and had no previous complaints filed against him, Jackson said.

Brown's relatives said no robbery would justify shooting the teen after he put his hands up. Family attorneys said Brown's parents were blindsided by the allegations and the release of a surveillance video from the store.

""It appears to be him,"" attorney Daryl Parks said, referring to the footage, which he said was released without any advance notice from police.

The police chief described Wilson as ""a gentle, quiet man"" who had been ""an excellent officer."" He has been on the Ferguson force for four years and served prior to that in the neighboring community of Jennings.

Wilson, who was placed on administrative leave after the Aug. 9 shooting, ""never intended for any of this to happen,"" Jackson said.

According to police reports released Friday, authorities received a 911 call at 11:51 a.m. on the day of the shooting reporting a robbery at the Ferguson Market. An unidentified officer was dispatched to the store, arriving within three minutes. The officer interviewed an employee and customer, who gave a description of a man who stole the cigars and walked off with another man toward a QuikTrip store.

Descriptions of the suspect were broadcast over the police radio. The officer did not find the suspects either on the street or at the QuikTrip, the reports said.

The robber took a box of Swisher Sweets, a brand of small, inexpensive cigars. The suspects were identified as 18-year-old Michael Brown and 22-year-old Dorian Johnson, according to the reports.

Separately, Wilson had been responding to a nearby call involving a sick 2-month child from 11:48 am until noon, when he left that place. A minute later, he encountered Brown walking down Canfield Drive. The documents contained no description of what happened between Brown and Wilson.

Johnson has told reporters that the officer ordered the pair to move onto the sidewalk, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He said Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, noted that police did not release a photo of the officer but released images from the security video that they say show Brown grabbing a man inside the store. Crump said he had not seen the photos.

Police ""are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style"" killing, said Crump, who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.

The Aug. 9 video appears to show a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store's door. A police report alleges that Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and ""forcefully pushed him back"" into a display rack.

Police said they found evidence of the stolen merchandise on Brown's body. Authorities determined that Johnson was not involved in the robbery and will not seek charges against him, Jackson said.

Brown's uncle, Bernard Ewing, said the shooting was unnecessary, even if his nephew was a robbery suspect.

A robbery ""still doesn't justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,"" he added. ""You still don't shoot him in the face.""

Brown's death ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. The tension eased Thursday after the governor turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators.

On Friday night, the Rev. Jesse Jackson linked arms with protesters as they marched to the site where Brown was killed. Jackson bent over in front of a memorial cross and candle and sighed deeply. He urged people to ""turn pain into power"" and to ""fight back, but not self-destruct"" through violence.

The scene was eclectic Friday night as hundreds gathered for a sixth straight evening. A man on a bullhorn called for a revolution. A young man waved a Bible while citing scripture. Some took selfies in front of a convenience store that had been burned by looters Sunday. Boys tossed a football, and horns and loud music blared. At a nearby shopping center, about 100 police cars were on hand.

To Vida Weekly, 51, it was still a somber occasion. She walked through the crowd holding high a sign that read: ""The police killed Michael Brown and now they are trying to kill his character.""

U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, a Democrat from St. Louis, took a bullhorn and spoke to people gathered at the QuickTrip.

""They have attempted to taint the entire investigation,"" Clay said to a cheering crowd. ""They are trying to influence a jury pool by the stunt they pulled today.

Also Friday, the Justice Department confirmed in a statement that FBI agents had conducted several interviews with witnesses as part of a civil-rights investigation into Brown's death. In the days ahead, the agents planned to canvass the neighborhood where the shooting happened, seeking more information, the statement said.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street.",33140,NA,NA,AP

Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who's in charge of security at the Ferguson protests, said at a press conference that police actions were prompted by violent acts, including shootings, hurled Molotov cocktails, and vandalism of various businesses, before the curfew went into effect. Johnson said police had to call in additional support to deal with the escalating situation.

Three people were injured and seven or eight were arrested throughout the night, according to police reports. No officers were injured.

Yahoo,yahoo9,http://news.yahoo.com/police-hurl-tear-gas-us-protesters-ferguson-034422257.html,Police hurl tear gas at US protesters in Ferguson,Loic Hofstedt,08/18/14,02/29/16,"Ferguson (United States) (AFP) - Police hurled tear gas and marched on protesters late Sunday in Ferguson, the St Louis suburb wracked by race riots since police shot dead an unarmed black teenager.

Police in body armor, helmets and gas masks moved in with armored vehicles to disperse a mob of mostly young people about three hours before the midnight (0500 GMT Monday) curfew came into effect.

Some of the youths carried signs protesting police brutality. Many had their hands up in the air, and others taunted police and threw back tear gas canisters.

Police dispersed the protest after rioters threw Molotov cocktails at officers,the St. Louis County Police said on Twitter.

Officer from St. Charles County said that gunshots were fired in the direction of the police.

The city has endured days of violence since a white police officer on August 9 shot dead Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old.

Images posted by the Post-Dispatch showed vandals smashing the windows of a McDonald's restaurant.

""We were walking up peacefully towards the command center to kneel in protest in front of the police, to say 'our hands are up,'"" said Lisha Williams, who was in the march.

""They started firing tear gas at us out of the blue. I know what tear gas is, my face was burning,"" said Williams, who described herself as an army veteran.

- Brown shot six times -

Brown was shot at least six times -- twice in the head and four times in the right arm -- the New York Times reported, citing a preliminary private autopsy.

All the shots were fired into his front, the Times reported, citing Michael Baden, the former New York City chief medical examiner who conducted an autopsy at the family's request.

""People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day One,"" Baden told The Times.

""They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that,"" he said.

Baden, 80, is a famous forensic pathologist who has testified at the trial of OJ Simpson, and was consulted for investigations into the deaths of John F. Kennedy and actor John Belushi.

Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Brown's family, said on Twitter that he and Baden would hold a press conference Monday morning.

Crump, who called Brown's death an ""execution,"" earlier represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black 16-year-old shot dead in Florida in 2012.

Brown's family has accused authorities of a ""devious"" attempt to smear their son's character after police named him as a suspect in the robbery of a Ferguson convenience store and released a surveillance video of the incident.

Police said the officer, unaware of the robbery, stopped the teen merely for walking in the middle of the street.

- Peaceful church gathering -

The late Sunday protest, held near the site where Brown was killed, followed a much larger and peaceful event at the Greater Grace Church in Ferguson earlier in the day honoring Brown.

Captain Ron Johnson, the African-American state patrol officer put in charge of Ferguson security, apologized for the shooting.

""I want to start off by talking to Mike Brown's family. I want you to know my heart goes out to you, and I say that I'm sorry,"" Johnson said to loud cheering and applause from a crowd of more than 1,300.

""I will be here as long as it takes.""

Johnson, who grew up in St Louis, also acknowledged the personal toll the violence has taken on him.

""The last 24 hours have been tough for me,"" he said.

Hundreds more people stood outside the church that was filled to capacity, where passing cars honked at length.

Young people who had gathered outside the church held their hands in the air, paying homage to what some witnesses said was Brown's last gesture before being shot.

Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who was at the morning event, was surprised later about the evening violence.

""I'm astonished at the reversal of the mood,"" he told CNN, saying that the mood earlier among Ferguson residents had been more constructive.

- Federal involvement -

Amid the growing violence, the federal government has stepped up its involvement in the investigation.

Attorney General Eric Holder is due to brief President Barack Obama on the violence in Ferguson on Monday, the White House said in a statement.

""Our immediate goal is to make sure that the residents of Ferguson are safe, that the looting stops, that the vandalism stops, that the people who are living in the community are confident that justice will be done,"" Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett told AURN radio.

FBI agents are already in Ferguson interviewing witnesses to the shooting, officials said.

The US Justice Department said that a federal medical examiner would carry out an autopsy on Brown's body, citing the case's ""extraordinary circumstances.""

It will be the third autopsy after Baden's and an autopsy performed by state medical examiners.",2016,NA,NA,AFP

""It's appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,"" Nixon said.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

The officer who shot Brown has been identified as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting, and the department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

About 150 people gathered in St. Louis on Sunday to show support for Wilson. The crowd protested outside a TV station because it had broadcast from in front of the officer's home.

The station, KSDK, later apologized on its website. Others in the group, composed mostly of police and relatives of officers, carried signs urging people to wait for all the facts in the shooting case.",16360,NA,NA,AP

“There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement. And we don’t want those lines blurred — that would be contrary to our traditions,” Obama said. “And I think that there will be some bipartisan interest in re-examining some of those programs.”

Obama, taking a two-day break from his family vacation on Martha’s Vineyard, also expressed skepticism about Missouri Governor Jay Nixon’s decision to call out the National Guard to help keep the peace in Ferguson, a low-income suburban St. Louis community torn asunder by the killing of an unarmed 18-year-old black man by a police officer nine days ago.

“I’ll be watching over the next several days to assess whether, in fact, it’s helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson,” the president said, underlining that he had expressed his concerns to Nixon by telephone.

Obama, who received a briefing from Holder earlier in the day on the crisis in Ferguson, said the attorney general would travel to the St. Louis suburb on Wednesday. Holder will meet with FBI agents and Department of Justice personnel running the federal response.

“He will receive an update from them on their progress. He will also be meeting with other leaders in the community whose support is so critical to bringing about peace and calm in Ferguson,” the president said.

Obama condemned violence on the part of “a small minority” of demonstrators and warned that “there’s no excuse for excessive force by police.”

“Ours is a nation of laws for the citizens who live under them and for the citizens who enforce them,” the president said.

“While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos. It undermines rather than advancing justice,” Obama said.

Turning to a violent conflict overseas, the president savored the role U.S. airstrikes played in helping Kurdish and Iraqi forces recapture the strategically pivotal Mosul Dam from the rampaging extremist forces of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), also known as ISIS.

Obama said U.S. bombardments had “pushed back the terrorists” and made it possible for local forces to take “a major step forward by recapturing the largest dam in Iraq, near the city of Mosul.”

But the president underlined that long-term success will hinge on the formation of a new, inclusive Iraqi government that unites the war-torn country’s fractious sectarian groups.

“They’ve got to get this done, because the wolf’s at the door,” he said.

Obama brushed aside concerns of American “mission creep” in Iraq, insisting that he had been “very firm” about imposing limits on U.S. operations there.

“We’re not the Iraqi military. We’re not even the Iraqi air force,” he said.

“Typically, what happens with mission creep is when we start deciding that we’re the ones who have to do it all ourselves, and, you know, that — because of the excellence of our military, that can work for a time,” he said. “We learned that in Iraq. But it’s not sustainable. It’s not lasting.”

Still, he admitted, “this is going to take time. There are going to be many challenges ahead.”

The president’s brief return to Washington had been scheduled before he ordered military action against the Islamist extremists and before chaos erupted in Ferguson with the killing of Michael Brown.

Obama’s two-day Washington, D.C., pit stop provided the opportunity to address those serious matters publicly with the White House as a backdrop rather than the beautiful settings of his Martha’s Vineyard resort vacation.

The president's remarks came after the U.S. military reported carrying out 15 airstrikes on ISIL targets near the Mosul Dam in Iraq. The assault brought the total number of U.S. airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq to 68 since August 8.

At the State Department, spokeswoman Marie Harf declared that ""we believe that ISIS needs to be taken out.”",7475,NA,NA,yahoo news

Yahoo News confirmed the award through the February 11 {Ferguson City Council meeting minutes}<hyperlink=http://www.scribd.com/doc/236968228/Ferguson-City-Council-Meeting-Minutes> and photos Wilson’s father posted to his Facebook page.

“Very proud of my son, Darren Wilson on his receiving a Commendation from his Police Department,” John Wilson wrote on February 11. “Congratulations Son.”

One image shows Wilson shaking hands and receiving the commendation from Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson. In a second photo, the tall and slender Wilson brandishes smile as he returns to his seat with his honor.

Details of what the 28-year-old officer did to earn the commendation weren't immediately available. (The Facebook page for the officer's father appears to have been deactivated shortly after Yahoo News first published this story on Saturday morning.)

Yahoo News tried to reach John Wilson by phone late Friday. Tonya Wilson, his wife and the officer’s stepmother, answered and said “we’re not talking to anybody — thank you” before hanging up. A text message seeking the name of Wilson’s attorney wasn’t returned.

Four days ago John Wilson turned to Facebook for support without mentioning his son by name.

“Dear FB friends, Our family is in need for prayers to be sent up for a family member,” John Wilson wrote. “Circumstances do not allow for us to say anything further. Please pray with our family in mind. Put a covering of protection over our family member please.”

A woman who replied in the comment thread told John that she could put him in touch with someone that “has been through many difficult times with his children. Prayers are what brought the family through the rough times. We are just a phone call away.”

John Wilson thanked his many friends who were quick to offer encouragement.

“Please continue to do so as we deal with a family situation that is very challenging,” he wrote.

In his last post this week, John Wilson shared a saying from a Texas evangelical pastor: “When something is ‘out of control’ it is merely out of your control — not God’s!”

On Friday, Chief Jackson told reporters that the young officer was taking the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown very hard.

“He never intended for any of this to happen,” Jackson said. “It’s devastating, absolutely devastating.”

The officer’s modest ranch-style house in the Crestwood suburb southwest of downtown was quiet on Friday. Neighbors told reporters that the area had seen a heavy police presence all week and that Wilson apparently left a couple of days ago.

The Ferguson chief said Wilson has been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of multiple investigations into the shooting.

Police said Brown, a recent high school graduate, was shot after Wilson encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol. The department says a skirmish ensued and that Brown physically assaulted Wilson and tried to take his weapon. According to a brief timeline given by Chief Jackson, the altercation lasted no more than three minutes before Wilson shot Brown multiple times.

But Dorian Johnson, Brown’s friend, has told reporters that it was Wilson who was the aggressor and that Brown never went for the weapon. Instead, Johnson says Brown had his hands in the air and was pleading for Wilson not to shoot.

The circumstances surrounding the shooting and the department’s delay in naming the officer fueled a {week of turmoil in Ferguson}<hyperlink=http://news.yahoo.com/guide-developments-missouri-police-shooting-065319079.html> and outcry across the nation. Jackson said he delayed identifying Wilson because the officer fears for his safety.

Wilson, a longtime Missouri resident, has been an officer in Ferguson for four years and served in nearby Jennings for two years prior. Jackson said Wilson has no history of disciplinary action and described him as a “gentle man” and a “quiet officer.”

“He has been an excellent officer for the police department,” Jackson said.",20047,NA,NA,yahoo news

The essays are the extreme example of what Pew shows is a common trend: 47 percent of white people think race is getting too much attention, as opposed to only 18 percent of blacks and 25 percent of Hispanics. Sixty-one percent of Republicans think race is receiving too much focus, compared to 46 percent of Independents and 21 percent of Democrats. The divide is more extreme now than when Trayvon Martin was killed, but still in both cases there was a divide between whites and blacks.

The military appearance of the St. Louis County police prompted an outpouring of responses from veterans and policymakers on social media and in statements. Brandon Friedman, a U.S. Army veteran, tweeted a photo of himself deployed in Iraq next to an image of a police officer in Ferguson. “The gentleman on the left has more personal body armor and weaponry than I did while invading Iraq,” Friedman wrote.

Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia announced that {he will introduce a “Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act”}<hyperlink=http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/democratic-congressman-will-introduce-police-demilitarizatio?utm_term=rbaj8n#2zjjerb> in Congress next month. And the issue even attracted a rare moment of bipartisan concern, as Republican Sen. Rand Paul {wrote Thursday that local police departments}<hyperlink=http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter> are now “essentially small armies.” Attorney General Eric Holder, meanwhile, said in a statement that he was ""deeply concerned"" about the the ""deployment of military equipment and vehicles"" in the town.

So how did small-town cops end up with tanks and so much other military gear?

The vast majority of America’s police departments have special paramilitary units — called SWAT teams — to respond to emergency situations, conduct drug raids and even, as we’re seeing in Ferguson, patrol the streets and control crowds. In the past few years, more of these SWAT teams have received armored vehicles and other military-grade equipment provided for free by the federal government to expand their capabilities.

The first SWAT team was formed to respond to the Watts race riots 50 years ago near Los Angeles, and the command structure soon spread to other police departments as the federal government began funding aggressive local responses to the “war on drugs” in the 1980s. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the federal government funneled even more money to municipalities for equipment to battle terror threats. 

The Defense Department’s 1033 program, which began in the late 1980s to recycle old military equipment to local police, {has given out tens of thousands of machine guns, military fatigues, and, more recently, at least 600 MRAPs}<hyperlink=http://news.yahoo.com/as-wars-wind-down--small-town-cops-inherit-armored-vehicles-233505138.html> (mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles) to help outfit SWAT teams. Police departments can also apply for grants through the Department of Homeland Security to buy lighter armored vehicles, like BearCats, and other military equipment to combat terrorism and drug dealing.

Police departments in St. Louis County have received equipment from the Pentagon program, including six Humvees, 12 M-16 rifles, and a bomb-defusing robot, according to DoD spokesman Mark Wright. The Bearcat, however, was not given to the county by the 1033 program.

Thanks to these programs, the presence of fully equipped SWAT teams in small-town America has become the norm. Eighty percent of small towns had SWAT teams by 2005, up from just 20 percent in 1980, according to research by criminology professor Pete Kraska of Eastern Kentucky University. More than 90 percent of city police departments have the special units.

The federal government argues that giving local police tanks and other leftover war equipment is a great way to avoid the waste of throwing away expensive gear that taxpayers have already paid for. But critics counter that militarizing police forces escalates conflicts and creates needless violence. Nearly 50 civilians were injured in 818 SWAT raids over two years in 11 states, {the ACLU found in a June report}<hyperlink=https://www.aclu.org/smart-justice-fair-justice/aclus-report-police-militarization-finds-weapons-and-tactics-war-used>. Only seven percent of the SWAT deployments the ACLU studied were responses to hostage or active-shooter scenarios — the majority were for drug raids.

It’s unclear how many armored vehicles have been used in Ferguson since the protests began Saturday. But at least one of the deployed vehicles, which appears to be a BearCat, had a large military-style rifle attached to the top, with an officer handling it. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon recently said he was ordering the St. Louis County Police Department out of Ferguson.

The clashes began after police shot a black 18-year-old, Michael Brown, saying he had grabbed for a white officer’s weapon. They have declined to release the name of the officer who shot him, angering residents. A friend of Brown’s who was with him at the time of the shooting said both he and Brown were attempting to run from police, without struggle, when an officer shot Brown. President Obama announced Thursday that he is ordering the FBI and Justice Department to investigate the shooting. ",6302,NA,NA,yahoo news

""We here in the United States will put our record for confronting our problems transparently and honestly and openly up against any other countries in the world,"" said deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf.

Egypt, which itself has been under international scrutiny for a deadly crackdown on protesters, is ""closely following the escalation of protests in Ferguson and the reactions,"" foreign ministry spokesman Badr Abdelatty said Tuesday.

Abdelatty pointed to a statement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon calling for restraint.

Ban's remarks ""represented the position of the international community towards these events, especially (Ban's) call for restraint and the right to peaceful assembly,"" Abdelatty said.

When there is social unrest like in Ferguson, Americans look at it ""transparently, honestly and openly, and we, of course, would suggest that other countries do the same thing,"" said Harf, speaking at a State Department briefing.

""People are free to say whatever they want. That's something we believe in very deeply here. It's freedom of expression.""

Protests in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, broke out after a white police officer shot dead an unarmed black teenager on August 9.

Regarding Egypt, ""we are very clear when we have very serious concerns about the human rights situation, about what happened over the last year ... to peaceful protesters, to journalists being thrown in jail for over a year now, to very huge numbers of death sentences being handed down as we’ve seen recently as well,"" said Harf.

In Egypt, at least 1,400 people, mostly Islamist protesters, have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces, including around 700 on a single day in Cairo in August 2013.

The violence was unleashed after the military ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi last year that also led to a spike in militant attacks in which scores of soldiers and policemen have been killed.

A reporter mentioned that China and Iran have also used the riots to criticize Washington.

""I would certainly strongly disagree with the notion that what's happening here is comparable in any way to situations in some of those countries you've named,"" Harf said.",230,NA,NA,AFP
Yahoo,yahoo16,http://news.yahoo.com/ferguson-clashes-highlight-a-leadership-vacuum-at-the-department-of-justice-s-civil-rights-division-190152728.html,Justice department division leading Ferguson investigation hasn't had a director in more than a year,Meredith Shiner,08/14/14,03/02/16,"The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, {which has been tasked by Attorney General Eric Holder}<hyperlink=http://news.yahoo.com/www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-844.html> to help lead an investigation into the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, has been without a confirmed leader since July 2013.

And because of Congressional gridlock and election-year politics, it’s likely that the civil rights department will not get a confirmed assistant attorney general any time soon.

In March, the Senate blocked President Barack Obama’s pick to lead the division, civil rights lawyer Debo Adegbile. Seven Democrats joined Republicans in opposing Adegbile because of his leadership role at the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, which in 2009 submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court on behalf of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted in the 1981 murder of a Philadelphia policeman.

Major police unions lobbied senators, especially in the Philadelphia area, to vote against proceeding on the Adegbile vote on the grounds that he sympathized with a cop-killer. A mix of senators up for re-election in 2014, red-state Democrats, and those representing Philadelphia-area constituents voted to filibuster the nomination.

Democratic Senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Chris Coons of Delaware, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and John Walsh of Montana all voted “no” on proceeding with the Adegbile nomination. At the time, Coons, Pryor and Walsh were in active re-election campaigns, though Walsh has since ended his campaign amid a plagiarism scandal.

Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, a Democrat who has served in the Senate for three decades and is retiring this winter, {called the Adegbile filibuster “the lowest point” of his career.}<hyperlink=http://www.msnbc.com/all/harkin-adegbile-vote-shameful> He pointed to the successful Senate confirmation of John Roberts to be chief justice of the United States, even though Roberts previously had worked for a law firm that took on a murderer as a pro-bono client.

“Earlier today a vote was taken in the United States Senate that, to this Senator, marked about the lowest point that I think this Senate has descended into in my 30 years here,” Harkin said, hours after the March vote.

“If you are a young black person, and you go to work for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and … they assign you to appeal a case of someone who committed a heinous murder … the message sent today is don’t do it. Don’t do it. Because you know what, if you do that, in keeping with your legal obligations and your profession, you will be denied by the U.S. Senate from being an attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice,” Harkin continued. 

Though the Adegbile nomination was shelved, it could be brought up again at any time.

In the wake of the protests in Missouri and new attention to a wave of shootings of unarmed young, black men by police officers nationwide, {the Department of Justice}<hyperlink=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-854.html> has publicly committed to ensuring that justice is served. But there does not seem to be any pressure on the Senate to act to install a leader at the civil rights division. Even if such pressure did exist, it seems unlikely that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who would do most anything to keep his fragile majority, would hold the vote again — or that the Obama administration would withdraw Adegbile’s nomination and admit that a qualified civil rights lawyer is unconfirmable.

The only natural window to confirm Adegbile, if Obama sticks with his choice, would be the lame-duck session after the November 4 midterm elections, when both parties are more likely to take on more challenging votes.

More than a half-dozen Senate Democratic aides were approached for this story, but only a Reid spokesman responded, saying that it would be up to White House officials to determine ""how they want to handle"" it.

Spokespeople for the Department of Justice referred inquiries to the White House because the agency does not “really comment” on nominations. A Department of Justice spokeswoman provided comment after publication of this story to reflect that the civil rights division's work is not compromised in pursuing the Ferguson probe: ""While it is important to have a confirmed Assistant Attorney General, Molly Moran is providing strong leadership since being named as acting head and will ensure a full and fair investigation,"" spokeswoman Dena Iverson wrote in an e-mail.

When asked why, then, Moran would not be sumitted to the Senate for confirmation instead of Adegbile, given the department's current support of her work, Iverson said, ""You have our statement.""

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",2258,NA,NA,yahoo news

Yahoo,yahoo18,http://news.yahoo.com/obama-briefed-violence-st-louis-suburb-113651850--politics.html,Obama appeals for 'peace and calm' in Ferguson,Julie Pace,08/14/14,03/02/16,"EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) — For President Barack Obama, the intersection of race and the law has revealed both the pitfalls and the power of wading into these delicate matters as the nation's first black president.

Just months after being sworn in, Obama rapped police in Massachusetts for acting ""stupidly"" by arresting a black Harvard professor at his own home. After more details of the case were revealed, Obama was forced to clarify his statements and tried to make amends by hosting an awkward ""beer summit"" at the White House with the professor and police officer.

Four years later, unburdened by re-election, Obama spoke out passionately about the 2013 acquittal of the man who fatally shot Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teen gunned down near his family's home in Florida. In unusually personal terms, Obama declared that Martin ""could have been me 35 years ago"" and gave voice to the pain felt by the African-American community.

Now the president is again wading into a racially charged matter that has riveted the nation, this time in Ferguson, Missouri, the St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teen was shot and killed by a white police officer. The death of 18-year-old Michael Brown Saturday has been followed by violent clashes between police and protesters.

In his first in-person statement on the situation, Obama appealed Thursday for ""peace and calm"" in Ferguson and called for restraint by all involved.

""There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" Obama said, speaking from the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard where he is in the midst of a two-week vacation. ""There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.""

The president decided to speak on the matter after receiving a late-night briefing Wednesday from Attorney General Eric Holder on the violence that had escalated while Obama mingled with former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others at a birthday party. Until then, Obama had held off to give local law enforcement a chance to quiet the situation, but by Wednesday night it was clear that wasn't happening, according to a White House official who insisted on anonymity in order to describe the president's thinking.

There are conflicting reports about what led to Brown's death. Police say that an officer encountered Brown and another man on the street, and one of the men assaulted the officer and struggled with him over his weapon. During the struggle, which spilled onto the street, Brown was shot multiple times, according to police.

But a man who says he was with Brown during the shooting has told a much different account. Dorian Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.

Obama's carefully worded statement reflected the lack of clarity about what happened. He urged police to be ""open and transparent"" as the investigation unfolds, but made no judgments about what led to Brown's death.

Obama avoided mentioning race in his statement, and he called on people to ""remember that we're all part of one American family.""

The president's approach stood in contrast to his initial handling of the 2009 arrest of his friend Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates. Obama declared during a White House news conference that a white police officer had acted ""stupidly"" in arresting Gates outside his home. Obama conceded days later that his own remarks had inflamed the situation and that Gates had probably overreacted in the moment, contributing to his arrest.

The incident was a searing one for a new president and his team, trying to navigate a black president's role in sensitive racial matters. Throughout the remainder of his first term, Obama largely steered clear of controversial discussions of race, at times irking African-American leaders who wanted to see him take a more active role in racial issues.

But the president's reserve did memorably give way when discussing the death of Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old killed near his family's Florida home by a neighborhood watch volunteer.

Obama addressed the matter in unusually personal terms, declaring that if he had a son, ""he would look like Trayvon."" A year later, when the man who shot Martin was acquitted, the president again used deeply personal language to try to explain the outrage of many in the African-American community.

""The African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,"" Obama said, recalling instances where he had been followed in a department store or heard car locks clicking on doors as he walked down the street.

Obama made no such statements Thursday when discussing Brown, saying only that the teen died in ""heartbreaking and tragic circumstances.""

NAACP president Cornell William Brooks said Obama was right to tread carefully in his remarks given that emotions remain raw and the city of Ferguson remains on edge.

""The president as the chief executive has to be careful and thoughtful in his choice of words, particularly at a moment when there's unrest — unrest in the streets, but also unrest in the American conscience,"" Brooks said.",1406,NA,NA,AP

(Reuters) - Missouri's governor moved on Thursday to calm days of racially charged protests over the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, naming an African-American captain of the Highway Patrol to oversee security in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.

Captain Ron Johnson, who grew up in Ferguson, told reporters he would take a new approach after complaints that police have used heavy-handed tactics, arresting dozens of protesters and using teargas and pepper pellets to break up crowds.

Ferguson, a mostly black town of 21,000 with a predominantly white police force that has been accused of racial profiling in the past, was bracing for a fifth straight night of protests on Thursday after a police officer shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown last weekend.

Since Sunday, there have been peaceful vigils and demonstrations - with hundreds of protesters holding their hands in the air and chanting ""hands up, don't shoot"" - as well as episodes of looting, vandalism and violence.

U.S. President Barack Obama, seeking to defuse tensions in Ferguson, called on police to respect peaceful demonstrations.

""There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" Obama said.

""There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protesters or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights,"" he said in remarks broadcast from Edgartown, Massachusetts, near where he is vacationing with his family.

The protests have cast a spotlight on racial tensions in greater St. Louis, where civil rights groups have complained in the past that police racially profiled blacks, arrested a disproportionate number of blacks and had racist hiring practices.

Governor Jay Nixon praised Ferguson on Thursday for being a diverse, hard-working community, but he said, ""lately it has looked a little bit more like a war zone, and that is unacceptable.""

Police have pledged to do better but have also justified the tactics, saying they have responded to the threat of violence during protests.

""We are going to have a different approach,"" Johnson said at the news conference where Nixon announced his role in directing Ferguson's security. He said he would go to ""ground zero"" on Thursday evening, the area where Brown was killed and also where a convenience store was burned down on Sunday in riots.

Additionally, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement that police had accepted an offer of technical assistance from the Justice Department ""to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.""

The Justice Department, the FBI and the St. Louis County prosecutor's office are all investigating Brown's death.

HANDS IN THE AIR

Protesters have decried what they say is a lack of transparency by police investigating the incident - including the refusal to release the officer's name. And some have called for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCullough to be removed from the case.

Early on Thursday, a member of the Anonymous hacker activist collective tweeted the name of a person alleged to be the police officer who shot Brown. But police and other Anonymous tweeters said the activist had named the wrong person.

Police said threats from cyber activists were one reason they continued to be reluctant to release the officer's name. But Nixon said on Thursday that authorities should be expeditious about identifying the officer.

There is little clarity on what occurred during Saturday's incident.

Police have said that Brown struggled with the officer who shot and killed him. The officer involved in the shooting was injured during the incident and was treated in a hospital for swelling on the side of his face, they said.

But some witnesses have said that Brown held up his hands and was surrendering when he was shot multiple times in the head and chest.",5428,NA,NA,Reuters

Khamenei is a odd person to be criticizing violent police crackdowns on peaceful protestors.

This movement, collectively called the Green Movement, met with brutal repression from Iranian police and paramilitary operatives, called the basij, loyal to the regime. The New Yorker's John Lee Anderson {breaks down}<hyperlink=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/16/after-the-crackdown> the human toll:

Riot police and Basij, armed with knives and guns, were sent into the streets to attack the protesters. Between forty and eighty people were killed, Mousavi's nephew among them, and thousands were arrested.
In show trials held in August, more than a hundred detainees were paraded in court, many of them thin and pale and clearly terrified; according to Amnesty International, many detainees had been beaten, tortured, and raped by guards and interrogators, often at secret detention centers. Several ""confessed"" to an improbable range of political crimes, including treason.

The Iranian government itself does not treat minorities particularly well. Take Iran's Kurds, for example. About 6.5 million Kurds live in western Iran, but not in peace. A 2009 Human Rights Watch report {documents}<hyperlink=http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/iran0109_web.pdf> widespread restrictions on Kurdish free speech (like banning books), denial of due process rights to Kurds suspected of political dissidence, and torture of Kurdish detainees.

But here's the catch: Khamenei, awful as he may be, still has a point about Ferguson. Despite the staggering hypocrisy of his tweet, he's correct that the police conduct in Ferguson is unconscionable and racist. The United States doesn't, or shouldn't, want human rights-abusing enemies to be able to point to things like this to whitewash their own abuses.

There are earlier echoes of this. During the Cold War, American presidents were worried that Jim Crow and America's brutal response to the civil rights movement were undermining America's image abroad. That wasn't the first, second, third, or twentieth reason any American leader should have cared about equal rights for their citizens. But it'd be good if the police in Ferguson, and others like them around the country, discovered a little bit of that old attention to how violent American racism looks around the world.",584,NA,NA,vox news

Yahoo,yahoo25,http://news.yahoo.com/ferguson-curfew-lifted-national-guard-deploys-180906833.html,Dozens arrested in Ferguson after night of violence,Robert MacPherson; Loic Hofstedt,08/19/14,03/09/16,"Ferguson (United States) (AFP) - The midwestern US town of Ferguson was recovering from another night of violence on Tuesday as a police crackdown on protests against the killing of an unarmed black teenager continued.

In the past ten days, this mainly black suburb of St Louis, Missouri has become a global symbol of the tensions created by the United States' racial divide and heavy-handed law enforcement tactics.

Overnight, protesters shot at police and threw rocks and firebombs in a new spasm of violence that left six wounded and led to 31 arrests.

Police responded with tear gas to disperse the crowd of about 200 in the town, Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol said.

Johnson said two demonstrators and four officers were injured, and argued that police had showed restraint by not opening fire.

On August 9, 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed in broad daylight on a residential street by Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white police officer -- triggering a wave of community protests.

Although police have since fingered Brown as a robbery suspect, he was unarmed at the time of shooting and some witnesses have said he was surrendering when he was hit six times, twice in head.

Monday's demonstration started peacefully, only hours after President Barack Obama, made a televised appeal for calm.

But, according to Johnson, a loud group of about 200 moved toward the police and a small minority among them attacked officers in riot gear.

""There is a dangerous dynamic in the night,"" Johnson said. ""It allows a small number of violent agitators to hide in the crowd and then attempt to create chaos.""

He added: ""Our officers came under heavy gunfire.""

Johnson stood behind a table on which a gun and a Molotov cocktail he said had been seized from protesters were on display.

Some of those in the crowd were not locals but rather people from as far away as New York and California, he said. The news conference began with a prayer for peace led by a county chaplain.

""Protesters are peaceful and respectful. Protesters don’t clash with police,"" Johnson said. ""It is criminals who throw Molotov cocktails and fire shots that endanger lives and property.""

US National Guard troops had rolled into Ferguson earlier in the day, but they kept a low profile as police in riot gear dispersed the demonstrators around 11:00 pm (0400 GMT).

Obama, the nation's first African-American president, said Attorney General Eric Holder would arrive in Ferguson on Wednesday to oversee a federal civil rights investigation into the case.

Obama said there was no excuse for local police to use ""excessive force"" and urged Missouri to make only ""limited"" use of the National Guard, which is operating under police supervision.

- 'Gulf of mistrust' -

The Guard reinforcements allowed State Governor Jay Nixon to lift an overnight curfew, but tempers were still running high.

""They're supposed to protect the American citizens, but they're fighting a war with unarmed citizens,"" said demonstrator Ron Henry, who wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""Stop Killing Us.""

A forensic pathologist retained by Brown's family revealed that the student had been shot at least six times -- twice in the head.

A total of three autopsies have been requested -- by local authorities, the family and the Justice Department.

Officials told news media that a Missouri grand jury could hear evidence in the case as early as Wednesday.

Obama warned of a ""gulf of mistrust"" between residents and police in many cities and towns across America, particularly in those where racial minorities feel excluded from opportunities for a better life.

""To a community in Ferguson that is rightly hurting and looking for answers, let me call once again for us to seek some understanding rather than simply holler at each other,"" he said.",222,NA,NA,AFP
Yahoo,yahoo26,http://news.yahoo.com/officer-missouri-shooting-unaware-teen-suspect-police-003654230.html,"Missouri governor declares emergency, sets curfew in Ferguson",Ellen Wulfhorst,08/16/14,03/09/16,"FERGUSON Mo. (Reuters) - Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew in Ferguson on Saturday, trying to restore order after a week of racially charged protests and looting over the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer.

The curfew will run midnight until 5 a.m. until further notice, said Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson. Johnson was named by the governor this week to oversee security in the suburban St. Louis community that has been roiled by the Aug. 9 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

""The eyes of the world are watching. This is the test of whether a community, this community, any community, can break the cycle of fear, distrust and violence, and replace them with peace, strength and, ultimately, justice,"" Nixon told a gathering at a church near Ferguson.

Some in the crowd reacted angrily to the news and several said the police officer who killed Brown must be prosecuted for murder if peace is to return to the community. There were shouts of ""hands up, don't shoot,"" a phrase that has become a rallying cry in Ferguson over the last week.

But Nixon said public safety had to be protected. ""We cannot have looting and crimes at night, we can’t have people fearful,” he said.

The unrest erupted after police officer Darren Wilson, 28, shot and killed Brown shortly after noon a week ago as Brown and a friend walked down a street that runs through an apartment complex where Brown's grandmother lives.

Tensions have been high all week but escalated on Friday evening as protesters again swarmed through a residential and retail district that has become a center of the unrest, pitting mostly black protesters against mostly white police.

On Saturday, people marching through city streets held signs that read ""black lives matter,"" and ""Don't shoot.""

Brown's family and supporters have demanded for days that the officer who shot Brown be held accountable. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the shooting for any civil rights violations, and the St. Louis County Police department is also investigating the shooting.

ROBBERY ACCOUNT FUELED PROTESTS

For days, police repeatedly refused to identify the officer involved, citing concerns for his safety. On Friday, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson gave in to community pressure and identified Wilson as the officer involved.

But at the same time, Jackson added to the community's outrage when he announced Brown had been a suspect in the robbery of a convenience store at the time he was shot.

Jackson later told a news conference that when Wilson shot Brown, the officer did not know the teen was a suspect in the robbery. There was no connection between the shooting and the alleged robbery, Jackson said.

Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Brown's family, said in a statement issued on Friday that the family was ""beyond outraged"" at the police attempts to ""assassinate the character of their son.""

Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton said he would lead a rally with Brown's family in Ferguson on Sunday.

Other law enforcement agencies have criticized the Ferguson police department for trying to make the alleged robbery an issue connected to the shooting, and for releasing a video from inside the store that shows Brown violently shoving a store clerk before he walks out the door.

The U.S. Justice Department asked Ferguson police on Thursday not to release the video, out of a concern it would roil the community further, but on Friday it was released over the objections of federal officials, said a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity.

CONFUSION OVER KILLING

The police version of Brown's shooting differs markedly from witness accounts, including that of the friend who was walking with Brown at the time, Dorian Johnson, 22.

In the police version, after Wilson asked Brown to move out of the road onto a sidewalk, Brown reached into the patrol car and struggled with Wilson for the officer's service gun. Wilson, who sustained a facial injury, then shot Brown a number of times.

Johnson and at least one other witness have said the officer reached out through his car window to grab at Brown and the teenager was trying to get away from the officer when he was shot. Brown held up his hands in a sign of surrender but the officer got out of his patrol car and shot Brown several times, they said.

FBI agents were at the scene of the shooting on Saturday interviewing residents, and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson also visited the site, leading a prayer near a makeshift memorial to Brown just a few feet from where he died.",2368,NA,NA,Reuters

Yahoo,yahoo28,http://news.yahoo.com/curfew-imposed-missouri-city-where-black-teen-shot-001221724.html,Missouri governor lifts Ferguson curfew as National Guard called in ,Ellen Wulfhorst,08/18/14,04/11/16,"FERGUSON Mo. (Reuters) - Missouri Governor Jay Nixon lifted the curfew for the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on Monday and began deploying National Guard troops to help quell days of rioting and looting spurred by the fatal shooting of a black unarmed teenager by a white policeman.
Nixon, who had declared a state of emergency for the town on Saturday and ordered that the streets be cleared for a curfew that ran from midnight to 5 a.m., said the National Guard would fall under the supervision of the Missouri Highway Patrol.
The deployment of the National Guard is the latest in a series of steps taken by authorities to end the looting and burning of stores that have punctuated protests since the shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, more than a week ago.
But retired local business owner Marshall Tucker said: ""It ain't getting no better with the National Guard coming in. That'll be worse,"" he said. ""Tonight it's going to get really sticky.""
As daylight was coming to an end on Monday, police with plastic handcuffs took positions and tried to clear a main thoroughfare where protests have taken place at night, directing crowds into designated protest areas.
Video from the scene showed one journalist, with cameras slung around his neck and his hands bound behind him, being led off by police. He was identified by colleagues as Getty photographer Scott Olson.
President Barack Obama said he told the governor that the National Guard use should be limited and urged healing instead of violence. Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Ferguson on Wednesday, Obama added.
""While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos. It undermines rather than advancing justice,"" Obama told a news conference.
The president met with Holder on Monday to discuss the unrest. Holder said more than 40 FBI agents were canvassing Ferguson neighborhoods in an investigation that included federal and local officials.
""Moreover, at my direction, an additional medical examination is being performed on the body of Michael Brown,"" Holder said. Results of official autopsies by federal authorities and the county are pending.
An autopsy conducted on behalf of Brown's family showed he was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. The path of one bullet indicates the 18-year-old may have been lowering his head in surrender when the fatal shot hit, according to Brown family attorney Daryl Parks.
Parks told a news conference one bullet hit Brown in the very top of his head and another shattered his right eye.
""His head was in a downward position,"" Parks said. ""Given those kind of facts, this officer should have been arrested,"" Parks said.
There were no signs of struggle with the officer and no gunshot residue on the body.
According to police, the officer involved in the shooting said he fired initially after Brown reached into his police car.
NIGHTLY PROTESTS
Darren Wilson, 28, the officer who shot Brown as the teenager was walking through a Ferguson residential neighborhood on Aug. 9 with a friend, was put on paid administrative leave and is in hiding.
Edward Magee, a spokesman for the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office, said the case could be presented this week to a grand jury, which will decide whether Wilson will be indicted.
The National Bar Association, the country’s largest network of black attorneys and judges, filed a lawsuit on Monday against the city of Ferguson and its police department over evidence related to Brown’s shooting.
The suit asks the department to preserve all videos, photographs, police logs and investigative reports about the shooting, as well as arrest reports for protesters who were detained in the days and nights that followed.
The shooting set off protests in Ferguson, whose population of about 21,000 is mostly black. Thousands of demonstrators, angry that the police officer was not arrested, have filled the streets.
The protests have been marred by rioting and looting, leaving some stores badly damaged, as well as attacks against police with Molotov cocktails, officials said
Law enforcement officials have been widely criticized for using excessive force. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged U.S. authorities to protect protesters' rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.
According to accounts by local police, Brown and a friend were walking down a road when Wilson asked them to move onto the sidewalk. Wilson reported that Brown reached into his patrol car and struggled for his service gun when the officer fired the initial shot.
Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, 22, said Wilson had reached out through his car window to grab at Brown and the teenager was trying to get away when he was shot. Johnson said Brown held up his hands to surrender but that Wilson got out of his patrol car and shot him several more times.",7186,NA,NA,Reuters

Images of the police clashing with protesters have highlighted the racial tensions in the town. Many of the protesters are black, while the police force is nearly entirely white.
The police department has three black officers and 47 white officers, or about 6 percent black officers, according to the Ferguson police chief. The city of Ferguson, meanwhile, is about 68 percent African American, according to {U.S. Census data}<hyperlink=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=29:2923986>.
Brown, 18, was shot multiple times by the unidentified officer, police said. His body lay slain on the sidewalk for hours as first Ferguson police and then the St. Louis County Police Department processed the scene, drawing immediate criticism aimed at the police for not removing his body more quickly.
Though the St. Louis County PD has taken over the investigation into the shooting, Ferguson police have been on the forefront of clashes with protesters in the days since Brown's death. They have been criticized by Brown's family, as well as the Rev. Al Sharpton and NAACP leaders, for not naming the shooting officer and for their heavily-armed response to protesters.
On Sunday night, violence erupted in Ferguson after the protests, as some individuals vandalized and looted stores, set fires and vandalized patrol cars. Protests resumed Monday night and Tuesday night without looting, but Ferguson police continued to fire rubber bullets and tear gas into crowds of demonstrators as they instructed everyone to go back to their homes.
One of the demands of protesters this weekend, printed on a flier handed out to crowds, was for a police force that more accurately represents the racial makeup of the community.
Protesters said that blacks have long been targeted by police.
""We have to stick together because we are targets,"" Robert Bredfford, an African-American 26-year-old, told the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-ferguson-teen-struggled-over-officer-s-gun-before-being/article_f9d627dc-e3c8-5bde-b2ab-7f0a3d36a083.html> at the protests on Sunday.
""There’s a lot of talk about mentoring. I’m going to be working with the U.S. Justice Department community relations people to improve relations between the community particularly the young black males,"" Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told ABC News following the unrest.
Statistics from the {state attorney general back up that claim,}<hyperlink=http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf> showing that in 2013, police pulled over black drivers 4,632 times and white drivers 686 times. Even after accounting for the difference in the number of black residents and white residents living in the city, blacks are pulled over at a 37 percent higher rate.
The data also show that blacks were twice as likely to be searched and arrested and African Americans in Missouri were 66 percent more likely to be stopped by police in 2013, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
But those numbers have to be taken in the context of the region, according to criminal justice expert David Klinger, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri at St. Louis.
""This area is surrounded by areas with a higher concentration of black population than the city, so when we do an analysis we need to look at that whole area. It's entirely possible that what is going on here is that it's not just residents [being pulled over],"" Klinger said.
""The real issue is not who gets stopped, unless there is evidence showing that they are stopping black people in a disproportionate number, but how are the stops being conducted?"" Klinger said.
The Ferguson Police Department does not have a record of racial profiling or transgressions. But the NAACP has an active complaint against the St. Louis County Police Department, according to the St. Louis Post Dispatch. But Klinger said that the St. Louis metropolitan area is on par with other cities in terms of relations between white police officers and black residents.
""To my knowledge there’s nothing more than the standard tensions in policing. I could be missing something but I’m unaware of any civil disturbance, on a large scale. Certainly nothing like the Los Angeles riots,"" he said.
The Ferguson Police Department and police union did not respond to requests for comment by ABC News. The Missouri state Fraternal Order of Police also did not respond.
""Any time you have any population that is relatively deprived, for lack of a better term, and has fewer resources, there’s going to be resentment,"" Klinger said. ""Unfortunately these types of communities have higher crime, so these communities will have a higher police presence because good people need more protection from knuckleheads,"" he said.
""My understanding is there’s nothing out of round in my current community as opposed to Los Angeles or New York or Washington, D.C.,"" he concluded. ""It goes with the territory that there's going to be some tensions.""",31,NA,NA,ABC news

Protesters insist that Wilson be arrested for shooting Brown at least six times. Police have said the shooting erupted after Brown, 18, wrestled with Wilson for his gun while witnesses have said Brown was shot while his hands were in the air.
The St. Louis County prosecutor said today that a grand jury is expected to begin hearing evidence Wednesday in the Ferguson shooting. Wilson will be offered an opportunity to testify before the grand jury, said Edward Magee, spokesman for the prosecutor's office.
""I wasn’t there, I don’t know exactly what happened, but I do know Darren is a good man and he cares about other people a lot,"" said the friend who asked to not be identified.
Wilson has been a police officer for six years, the last four with the Ferguson Police Department. His chief said that Wilson's record has no disciplinary incidents.
""When I first heard [Wilson identified as the shooter] I didn’t believe it. I thought it was a mistake in all honesty,"" his friend said. ""I can never imagine him shooting anybody, even as a police officer.""
The two men continued to play sports as adults, particularly hockey.
""He did not have a temper,"" even during the rough checking on the hockey rink where fights are common. ""Always just on an even heal. Really laid back.""
He added, ""He’s a really quiet guy, really well-mannered. He is very respectful.""
The angry descriptions of Wilson by protesters don't match the person that he knows, the friend said.
""I feel like maybe he’s been unfairly portrayed as a villain definitely. He was just doing his job and he was put in a bad situation where he had to make a decision that nobody really wants to make,"" the friend said.
Wilson's friend said he feels bad for the families of both Wilson and Brown.
""The whole situation is a tragedy for both Michael Brown and his family, and Darren and his family. Both of their lives are ruined,"" he said.
Wilson's spirits were buoyed by friends who organized a benefit for him, the friend said.
""Just knowing that people are behind him and aren’t as quick to jump to conclusions as everybody else I think is what means the most to him,"" the friend said.
""I can tell he’s struggling. I can tell this is really hard on him. He’s been very careful about who he talks to, so he hasn’t spoken much about the situation,"" his pal said.
""I don’t know if true justice can ever really be served. But I hope that some sort of change comes from this. Maybe police officers wear body cameras so no question as to what happened. I hope Mike Brown’s family finds peace somehow, if that’s possible,"" the friend said.

Yahoo,yahoo31,http://news.yahoo.com/9-essential-facts-ferguson-shooting-150002799.html,9 essential facts about Ferguson and the shooting of Michael Brown,Amanda Taub,08/18/14,04/12/16,"On August 9, a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In the days since his death, Ferguson has been rocked by protests, some of which have turned violent. On Saturday, August 16, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew on Ferguson, closing the streets from midnight to 5am.

Here are the essential facts you need to know to understand who Brown was, how he was killed, and why the nation's eyes are on Ferguson.

1) Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed teenager Michael Brown on Saturday, August 9

Michael Brown was {shot to death}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-police-officer-darren-wilson> by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson around noon on Saturday, August 9. Wilson, 28, is six-year veteran of the Ferguson police department, with no prior disciplinary record. Although the exact circumstances of the shooting remain unclear, {Brown was unarmed}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-shooting-facts-details> at the time of the shooting. All shells found at the scene were from Wilson's gun.

Brown had graduated from Normandy High School in Wellston in the spring of 2014. He was planning to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday, August 11, two days after he was killed.

2) Ferguson is a majority-black city with an overwhelmingly white police force and city government

Ferguson is a {majority-black town.}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/12/5994181/ferguson-is-67-percent-black-and-its-police-force-is-94-percent-white> According to the 2010 census, about 67 percent of residents are black and 29 percent are white.

That racial makeup is not reflected in the town's institutions. Ferguson's {mayor}<hyperlink=http://www.fergusoncity.com/directory.aspx?EID=6> is white. Five of the six members of its {city council}<hyperlink=http://www.fergusoncity.com/171/Council-Members> are white. Six of the seven members of its {school board}<hyperlink=http://www.fergflor.org/pages/Ferguson-Florissant_SD/About_Us/Board_of_Education/Board_Roster> are white.

And, most importantly, its {police force}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/12/5994181/ferguson-is-67-percent-black-and-its-police-force-is-94-percent-white/in/5757650> is overwhelmingly white. Out of the 53 commissioned officers in the Ferguson Police Department, only three are black. And the chief of police, Thomas Jackson, is also white.

There is also evidence that the Ferguson police department, like many other local law enforcement agencies, disproportionately stops and arrests black residents. According to a racial profiling {report}<hyperlink=http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf> from the Missouri Attorney General's office that was obtained by {Buzzfeed}<hyperlink=http://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/blacks-overwhelmingly-get-stopped-by-the-police-in-ferguson>, of the 5,384 traffic stops made last year, 4,632 of them — 86 percent — targeted black drivers. Only 684, or 12.7 percent, targeted white drivers, even though Ferguson is almost 30 percent white.

The report also found that innocent black people were much more likely to be searched than innocent white people were:  21.7 percent of black people who were searched were found to be carrying contraband, which means that about four out of every five of them were innocent.  However, searches of white people produced a contraband ""hit"" 34 percent of the time.

Yet black people were also far more likely to be arrested than whites. According to the same report, 92.7 percent of all people arrested by the Ferguson police in 2013 were black, and 6.9 percent were white.

3) Police and eyewitnesses gave contradictory accounts of the shooting

Some details of {what occurred during the shooting}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-shooting-facts-details> are undisputed. Brown was originally stopped for jaywalking, because he and a friend were walking in the middle of the street. Wilson fired multiple shots at Brown, at least one of which was fired from his squad car. Brown was unarmed, and all of the shells found at the scene were from the officer's gun.

There is also some physical evidence available. On Sunday, August 17, the Brown family {released}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6029685/autopsy-michael-brown-shot-at-least-six-times> a preliminary report on the private autopsy they had commissioned. Dr. Michael M. Baden, who conducted the examination, found that Brown was shot at least six times, and all of the bullets were fired into his front. Baden also determined that Brown had been shot twice time in the head, and that a bullet that hit the top of his head was most likely the shot that killed him.

However, many of the other details of what happened remain unclear, and a police account of the shooting are different from what eyewitnesses have said happened.

Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, who was with him when the shooting occurred, gave {this account to MSNBC}<hyperlink=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri>: Johnson said that he and Brown had been walking in the middle of the street when a police officer approached and told them to use the sidewalk. They complied, and the officer began to drive away, but then threw his car into reverse and came back alongside the teens, nearly hitting them. Johnson heard Wilson say something like ""What'd you say?"", before trying to open his car door, slamming it into Brown. Then the officer reached out and grabbed Brown by the neck with his left hand. The two men struggled briefly, and then Wilson, still in his car, shot Brown once.

Johnson said that he and Brown both attempted to flee, but Brown was shot a second time. After the second shot, Brown turned around and surrendered, putting his hands in the air and saying, ""I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!"" Johnson said that Wilson then approached Brown and fired several more shots, killing him.

Eyewitness Piaget Crenshaw {told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/anger-confrontation-after-fatal-shooting-of-teen-by-ferguson-police/article_04e3885b-4131-5e49-b784-33cd3acbe7f1.html> that she was waiting for a bus when she saw a police officer try to place Brown in his squad car. Then she saw Brown attempt to flee, with his hands in the air. The officer shot Brown multiple times as Brown ran away, said Crenshaw, who has provided photographs of the scene to law enforcement.

The local police who are tasked with investigating the shooting, by contrast, claim that Brown was killed after he assaulted Wilson. St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar {said}<hyperlink=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/10/justice/missouri-police-involved-shooting/index.html> that the shooting occurred after Brown pushed Wilson back into his squad car, ""where he physically assaulted the officer"" and then struggled over Wilson's weapon. According to Belmar, Wilson then fired once from the car, and then several more times as Brown attempted to flee. Belmar's verbal account has thus far been the only source for Wilson's version of events, as no incident reports of the shooting have been released despite media requests. During a briefing on Wednesday August 13, Ferguson Police chief Tom Jackson said that Officer Wilson was injured during the encounter with Brown, and that the side of his face was ""swollen"" afterwards.

4) Several different law enforcement agencies are involved in the response to the shooting and the protests

Many law enforcement agencies have played roles in the investigation into Brown's death, and in the security response to the protests that followed. At times, this has caused {serious problems.}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002291/ferguson-police-st-louis-county-in-charge-jay-nixon-tear-gas-officer-fired>

Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, works for the Ferguson Police Department. After the shooting, Ferguson's police chief asked the St. Louis County Police to take over the investigation, so they are the ones who are tasked with gathering evidence for a potential case against Wilson.

From August 9 through August 13, there were at least four police departments in Ferguson participating in the security operation: the Ferguson Police Department, the St. Louis County Police Department, the St. Louis City Police Department, and the Missouri Highway Patrol. There were also reports that additional police from other nearby towns were also on the scene.

For the first few days of the protests, command of the security operation in Ferguson rotated between different departments, Jackson, Ferguson's police chief, said during a press conference. As my colleague Dara Lind points out, that system was a disaster in terms of police accountability:

More importantly, it made it impossible for one police chief to be held accountable for what officers are doing in Ferguson. It wasn't clear what the relationship was between an ""incident commander"" who was making decisions at the protest site, and the chief of his police department. But because the public didn't even know which agency the ""incident commander"" was with, it was impossible to demand that that police chief restrain his officers. When Ferguson chief Jackson gave his press conference Wednesday, he was asked whether there would be tear gas used on Wednesday night. He said, ""I hope not."" But he honestly couldn't make any promises, because it turned out that the St. Louis County police were the ones in charge. Now, Governor Nixon has officially designated the Missouri Highway Patrol as the agency to whom the public should be directing their demands for accountability and de-escalation.

On Thursday, August 14, Gov. Nixon {""reframed""}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6003199/possible-deescalation-in-ferguson-as-two-police-departments-pull-out/in/5757650> the command for the security operation in Ferguson, placing Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, a Ferguson native, in charge of security operations.  Although multiple departments are still participating in the operation, they are now under a single non-rotating command. Johnson has {publicly acknowledged}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6006343/local-police-didnt-inform-the-highway-patrol-about-todays-news-release> that communication between departments is poor, with Ferguson police releasing information about the case without telling him first.

On Monday, August 18th, Gov. Nixon {announced}<hyperlink=https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/following-coordinated-attacks-civilians-and-law-enforcement-governor-nixon-signs> that he had also ordered {the state national guard}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/6030619/missouri-governor-orders-national-guard-to-ferguson> to Ferguson, to assist in ""restoring peace and order to this community.""

5) The police have refused to release the autopsy report or any information about their investigation of what happened during the shooting

The St. Louis County Police are in charge of {the local investigation}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-shooting-investigation-facts-details> into Brown's death. However, they have refused to release the report from the autopsy conducted by the St. Louis County medical examiner, or any details about the evidence they have gathered so far. This lack of information has become a major rallying point for the protesters, who have made repeated demands that Wilson be brought to justice.

Despite the lack of detail, there are worrying signs that investigators may not be approaching the investigation in a thorough, professional manner. For instance, the police apparently {did not interview Brown's friend Dorian Johnson}<hyperlink=http://m.stltoday.com/online/ferguson-statement-on-brown-shooting-call-for-daylight-only-protests/pdf_2dd60ce0-1834-52db-b948-ec38f4c528ee.html?mobile_touch=true> until Wednesday, August 13, even though he was a key eyewitness.

6) Protests began immediately after Brown's death, and continued throughout the week

Protests erupted in Ferguson as soon as news of Brown's death began to spread. A crowd began to gather around the scene of the shooting almost immediately, while Brown's body was still lying in the road. His body would remain there for {several hours}<hyperlink=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-three-minutes--and-two-lives-forever-changed/2014/08/16/f28f5bc0-2588-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html>. (Ferguson Police Chief Jackson later said that he was ""uncomfortable"" with the amount of time that Brown's body had been left on the ground.) After the demonstration at the scene dispersed, a smaller group of approximately 100 people gathered outside Ferguson police headquarters and continued to protest.

Non-violent protests continued on Sunday, but tensions began to rise between the demonstrators and the police, who had deployed with military equipment and body armor. One {video}<hyperlink=http://www.colorlines.com/archives/2014/08/police_officer_calls_ferguson_protestors_animals.html>, from CNN, showed an officer shouting at protesters to ""bring it, you fucking animals! Bring it!""

The protests briefly erupted into violence on the night of Sunday, August 10, when a group of people looted and burned a QuikTrip convenience store. A SWAT team used tear gas to disperse the looters, and at least 32 people were arrested.

Protesters remained largely non-violent during the demonstrations from Monday to Thursday, but on Friday night there was more looting. A group of community leaders {organized}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/16/6022277/antonio-french-ferguson-looting> non-violent protesters to protect the businesses being targeted, and they eventually managed to defuse the situation, and the looters dispersed by about 4am.

On Saturday August 16, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency, and announced that there would be a curfew from midnight to 5 am. Most protesters {obeyed the curfew}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6025931/first-night-of-ferguson-curfew-ends-in-brief-clashes> over the next two nights, but the the areas did not clear without a certain amount of {turbulence}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6029591/tear-gas-curfew-riot-police-ferguson-sunday>, with police using tear gas to disperse crowds — in some instances hitting children and journalists — and in response to what they say was violence from protesters.

7) The protests were met with an aggressive police response

Although the protests have been largely peaceful, they have nevertheless drawn an extremely heavy {police response}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/police-ferguson-mo-st-louis-military-militarized-army-tear-gas>. On Saturday, more than 100 officers from 15 different local departments arrived at the scene, bringing police dogs in an effort to control the crowd. The departments' use of dogs has since been roundly criticized by law enforcement experts, with former Seattle Police Chief Norman Stamper {saying}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002451/ferguson-police-militarization-seattle> that ""using dogs for crowd control is operationally, substantively, and from an image point-of-view just about the worst thing you can do.""

The aggressiveness of the security operation escalated even further during the following days, and involved the use of {military equipment and tactics}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6003239/police-militarization-in-ferguson>. Officers deployed through the streets wearing full body armor and gas masks, and carrying rifles. They also used MRAP armored vehicles originally designed to withstand explosions from land mines or IEDs, and a sound weapon called a Long Range Accoustic Device, or LRAD.

Some improvement was seen on Thursday the 14, after Capt. Johnson from the highway patrol was placed in charge of the security operations.

Johnson's tactics emphasized communication over confrontation, and they immediately produced a {much calmer}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6004215/a-considerably-different-atmosphere-in-ferguson-tonight/in/5757650> atmosphere in Ferguson. On Thursday evening, he marched with protesters, and apologized for the use of tear gas. Later that night, he spoke to the press while {holding a photograph}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5988925/mike-brown-killing-shooting-case-ferguson-police-riots-st-louis#Thursday14> of Michael Brown — a powerful symbol of respect.

8) The police released information suggesting Brown had stolen from a convenience store, but that wasn't the reason Wilson stopped him

In marked contrast with the lack of detail about the autopsy or investigation into the shooting, the Ferguson police did release {information}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5988925/mike-brown-killing-shooting-case-ferguson-police-riots-st-louis#Friday15> on Friday that suggested Brown may have stolen cigars from a local convenience store shortly before his death, including a copy of a police report and surveillance video footage of the alleged crime, which Ferguson police Chief Tom Jackson referred to as a ""strong-arm robbery.""

The video footage released by police appears to show a man cigars from behind the counter, and then shoving the store clerk aside when he attempted to block the door.

Jackson has been heavily criticized for releasing the footage, particularly after he indicated, hours after the release, that Wilson was not aware that Brown was a robbery suspect at the time. Jackson {said}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6007055/mike-brown-robbery-shooting-unrelated> that the ""initial contact was unrelated to the robbery,"" and that Wilson was not responding to a call about the robbery. Instead, he had stopped the teen for jaywalking. As Vox's {Dara Lind}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/5994305/michael-brown-case-investigation-legal-police-kill-force-murder> and {Ezra Klein}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6005861/michael-brown-darren-wilson-ferguson-shooting> have noted, even if Wilson had stopped Brown because of a robbery, that fact alone would not make it legal for Wilson to shoot Brown while he was surrendering. (Jackson {later told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/michael-brown-a-suspect-in-robbery-of-cigars-from-store/article_52c40b84-ad90-5f9a-973c-70d628d0be04.html> that Wilson thought Brown could be the robbery suspect during the course of the stop, when he saw the packet of cigars Brown was holding.) He said he released the information to comply with requests from journalists.

On Saturday, it was reported that Jackson had released the robbery footage and police report over objections from the Department of Justice. An unnamed law enforcement source told {NBC News}<hyperlink=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/feds-urged-police-not-release-michael-brown-robbery-video-n182346> that the DOJ had urged local police not to make the footage public, arguing that it could inflame tensions in the town.

Many local residents greeted Jackson's announcement with outrage. Brown's family {said}<hyperlink=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-releasing-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown/>, through their lawyer, that they believed the release of the robbery footage was ""strategic,"" and an ""attempt at character assassination."" And a handful of protesters in Ferguson did turn violent for several hours that night, prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency the following day.

9) The federal government is also investigating Brown's death

The Justice Department is investigating the shooting to determine whether it violated Brown's civil rights.

Two days after Brown was killed, on August 11, Attorney General Eric Holder said that the shooting deserved ""a fulsome review"" and {announced}<hyperlink=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-844.html> that FBI agents from the St. Louis field office would conduct a ""concurrent"" investigation into Brown's death, working with attorneys from the DOJ's Civil Rights Division and the US Attorneys' Office.

On Saturday, August 16, Johnson, of the Highway Patrol, announced that {40 FBI agents}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/16/6024539/federal-investigation-begins-40-fbi-agents-arrive-in-ferguson-michael-brown/in/5757650> were on the ground in Ferguson and would be canvassing door-to-door in the neighborhood where the shooting took place in the hope of finding eyewitnesses to testify about what had happened. The FBI also handed out cards requesting information from local residents.

The DOJ announced Sunday, August 17, that a federal medical examiner would conduct a {new autopsy}<hyperlink=http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/17/6026843/holder-doj-michael-brown-federal-autopsy/in/5757650> of Brown's body. That will be the third time an autopsy is done in this case: the St. Louis County medical examiner performed the first one, and Brown's family also commissioned its own private autopsy.

According to a statement by Justice Department spokesperson Brian Fallon:

Due to the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family, Attorney General Holder has instructed Justice Department officials to arrange for an additional autopsy to be performed by a federal medical examiner. This independent examination will take place as soon as possible. Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.",1615,NA,NA,vox news

Yet presumption of innocence prevails and sober minds know both the need to wait for an investigation and the reality that we may never really know what happened that fateful Saturday in Ferguson, Missouri. But watching events unfold Wednesday night in the St. Louis suburb, there can be no doubt that what happened on August 13 was an outrage.



The local authorities clearly have no idea what they're doing, and higher powers from the state or federal government need to intervene before things get even worse.

The {arrest of two reporters}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/6000785/wesley-lowrey-and-ryan-reilly-arrested"">, Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, with whom many of us in Washington, DC, are acquainted was neither the beginning nor the most important part of the outrage, but it drives home in a visceral way the extent to which the situation is being monumentally mishandled.

Crowd control is a normal complement to any modern protest. And as I remember well from the late-Giuliani days in New York, crowd control sometimes gets heavy-handed when relationships between the police and the community are strained. But you do crowd control with horses, batons, and shields, not rifles. You point guns at dangerous, violent criminals, not people out for a march.

A number of wags have gotten mileage over the past few days out of joking that it's hard to tell if you're looking at photos of Missouri or Baghdad. But military veterans say the display of force from the cops last night went beyond any sound wartime practice.
[tweetbegin  tweetend]
[tweetbegin  tweetend]
Of course cops, like soldiers, must be prepared to use serious weapons from time to time. But there was no rioting last night in Ferguson. No looting. And it's difficult to imagine any scenario that would call for police officers to be dressed in the kind of military-style camo fatigues that are visible in many pictures from last night.

Lowery and Reilly were released soon after being detained, and the Ferguson police chief {told Matt Pearce}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/499719019747090433""> from the LA Times that the arrestor was ""probably somebody who didn't know better.""

That sounds about right. There were an awful lot of somebodies who didn't know better out on the streets of Ferguson last night wielding an awful lot of deadly equipment. Quite a few people have been injured over the past few days by rubber bullets and rough handling (although in a Wednesday press conference, a police spokesperson insisted that no one had been injured during the protests).

Wednesday night's outing ended for many protestors in a cloud of tear gas. In my experience, these ""nonviolent"" crowd-control tactics are a good deal more painful than people who've never been at the receiving end appreciate. There's no real reason they should be inflicted on demonstrators who weren't hurting anyone or even damaging property. We are lucky, to be honest, that nobody's been killed yet. But somebody who does know better needs to take charge. And soon.

The state's governor, Democrat Jay Nixon, spent the early evening tweeting about an education policy dispute in the state legislature, and was MIA on the issue at hand as events unfolded.
[tweetbegin 499701373823229953 tweetend]

But it is clear at this point that local officials in the town of Ferguson and St. Louis County don't know what they are doing. Of course people will not be calm while police officers charged with protecting them trample their rights.

The governor needs to either step in and ensure — not urge — that law enforcement do its job properly, or else to appeal to the federal government to come in and take charge. Obama and his team are, with good reason, reluctant to see the president involved in highly racialized controversies.

Dorsey is from St. Louis, so the story hits home for him. His tweets have been a mix of videos and snapshots illustrating the protests. He has also retweeted posts from political figures who have  commented on the situation.  In a recent interview with Yahoo News and Finance anchor Bianna Golodryga, Dorsey discussed the role Twitter plays in coverage of events and stories that people are talking about.

""You can just simply get out your phone wherever you are, and you can add to the conversation, you can read the conversations and you can contribute, and that was something that we always wanted to empower more.  And fortunately the world wants the same thing.""

The times are taken from documents provided by the Ferguson Police Department, including dispatch logs and an incident report on a robbery at a convenience store.

11:48 a.m. — Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson arrives at a residence in response to an unrelated call about a 2-month-old child having difficulty breathing when she coughs.

11:51 a.m. — Ferguson police receive a call of a robbery in progress at the Ferguson Market convenience store.

11:54 a.m. — A different, unidentified officer arrives at the Ferguson Market and gets a physical description from an employee and customer of a suspect who took some cigars.

11:57 a.m. — A police dispatcher broadcasts a detailed description of the robbery suspect, saying that he was wearing a red St. Louis Cardinals ball cap and yellow socks and was walking with another man toward another convenience store called QuikTrip.

12:00 p.m. — Officer Wilson leaves the scene of the call about a sick child.

12:01 p.m. — Officer Wilson encounters Michael Brown walking on a street and the shooting follows. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said Friday that Wilson did not know about the robbery at the convenience store when he encountered Brown.

12:04 p.m. — Another officer arrives on the scene after the shooting, and an ambulance is contacted to treat Brown's wounds.",58,NA,NA,AP

In a caption with a photograph showing the arrest of Scott Olson, the agency said he was being ""placed in a paddy wagon after being arrested by police as he covers the demonstration following the shooting death of Michael Brown.""

Getty Images did not say why Olson was detained.

But it later said he had been released, and would continue to cover the story in Ferguson.

""Getty Images condemns Scott's arrest and is committed to ensuring that he and our other photographer colleagues are able to report this important story,"" said Pancho Bernasconi, Getty's vice president of news.

AFP is an image distribution partner of Getty.

The dispute has fueled resentment in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis with a majority African American population but a mainly white police force -- now backed by a detachment of National Guard soldiers.

At least 10 journalists have been arrested or detained since Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was killed Aug. 9 by officer Darren Wilson. Reporters for CNN, Al Jazeera America and other outlets say they have been harassed or physically threatened.

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, in charge of security in Ferguson, said Tuesday that members of the media have had to be asked repeatedly to return to the sidewalks, because of safety concerns. In some cases, he said, it was not immediately clear who was a reporter, but once that was established, police acted properly.

""In the midst of chaos, when officers are running around, we're not sure who's a journalist and who's not,"" Johnson said at a news conference. ""And yes, if I see somebody with a $50,000 camera on their shoulder, I'm pretty sure. But some journalists are walking around, and all you have is a cellphone because you're from a small media outlet. Some of you may just have a camera around your neck.""

The arrests and detainments, which have ranged from several minutes to several hours, have been widely criticized: President Obama said last week that police ""should not be bullying or arresting"" reporters for merely doing their jobs. Last Friday, 48 American media organizations, including The Associated Press, sent a letter to law enforcement officials in Ferguson, criticizing the treatment of reporters.

""Officers on the ground must understand that gathering news and recording police activities are not crimes,"" the letter read. ""The actions in Ferguson demonstrate a lack of training among local law enforcement in the protections required by the First Amendment, as well as the absence of respect for the role of newsgatherers. We implore police leadership to rectify this failing to ensure that these incidents do not occur again.""

Overall, at least two people were shot and at least 57 arrested during protests overnight Monday, authorities said.

On Tuesday, Ryan Devereaux of The Intercept, an online investigative publication, tweeted that he was arrested and jailed, then released several hours later. Getty photographer Scott Olson said Monday that he was arrested ""for just doing my job"" and eventually released. As with previous arrests of journalists, no charges were filed against Olson, who by Monday night was back shooting photos.

Two German reporters were arrested and detained for three hours Monday. Conservative German daily Die Welt said correspondent Ansgar Graw and reporter Frank Herrmann, who writes for German regional papers, were arrested after allegedly failing to follow police instructions to vacate an empty street. They said they followed police orders.

On Sunday night, Sports Illustrated reporter Robert Klemko tweeted that he was tear-gassed, handcuffed and then released a few minutes later. The Telegraph's Rob Crilly and the Financial Times' Neil Munshi also reported that they were briefly detained Sunday.

Last week, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post said they were handcuffed and put into a police van after officers came into a McDonald's where they were doing some work. The Washington Post reported that Lowery said he was slammed against a soda machine. Reilly told MSNBC that an officer slammed his head against the glass ""purposefully"" on the way out of the restaurant.

The reporters were subsequently released without any charges.

Ryan Grim, Washington bureau chief for The Huffington Post, said in a statement that ""compared to some others who have come into contact with the police department, they came out relatively unscathed, but that in no way excuses the false arrest or the militant aggression toward these journalists.""",7,NA,NA,AP

While protests and unrest sparked by the death of Michael Brown have captured the nation’s attention, grass-roots campaigns backing the officer who killed him are gaining ground.

At least a half-dozen pro-Wilson pages have popped up on Facebook in recent days. Combined, the pages are approaching 100,000 likes. An online campaign to help the Wilson family with “any financial needs they may have including legal fees” has taken in nearly $40,000 in two days.

{I Support Officer Wilson}<hyperlink=”https://www.facebook.com/I-Support-Officer-Wilson-276961059165311/”> surpassed 39,000 Facebook likes on Tuesday. The page was launched by the wife of a Missouri police officer who said it could have been her husband or any other officer instead of Wilson.

 “I put myself in that family’s shoes,” she said. “I would want to know that not everyone hated me for doing my job.”

The 33-year-old woman, who has no ties to Wilson or the case, asked that Yahoo News not identify her by name due to the violence and hatred displayed in the St. Louis area since the 18-year-old’s death.

“I’m not scared,” she said. “If I wasn’t concerned about what could happen to me and my family, I would absolutely stand proud and say who I was.”

Allegations of racism have been at the core of demonstrations. Brown was a black teenager shot multiple times in broad daylight by Wilson, a white Ferguson officer. A preliminary autopsy commissioned by Brown’s family shows he was struck by at least six bullets.

Authorities haven't released an official version of how the killing happened, but Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said that Brown attacked the officer and tried to take his gun. Eyewitnesses, however, claim it was Wilson who was the aggressor.

The officer went into hiding last week, and his {family declined to answer questions}<hyperlink=”https://www.yahoo.com/news/photos-ferguson-officer-darren-wilson-received-police-award-earlier-this-year-021255893.html?ref=gs”> from Yahoo News.

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence on Wednesday to determine whether Wilson will face charges for Brown’s death, according to a spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney.

“Officer Darren Wilson” {T-shirts, hoodies and tank tops}<hyperlink=”https://teespring.com/”> are being hawked to help support his potential legal fund.

“Arresting this man and making him accountable for his actions; that’s justice,” Lesley McSpadden said in an exclusive interview with ABC News.

The St. Louis suburb has been wracked by clashes and violence since Brown’s Aug. 9 death. Brown, 18, was unarmed when he was shot by a Ferguson police officer, identified by the department as Darren Wilson.

McSpadden said she spoke Sunday with Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson.

“He had a heartfelt message for me, and it was that that could have been his son, and he was sorry, and he’s, like everybody else, supporting and hoping and praying that this doesn’t happen again,” McSpadden said, holding back tears.

A private autopsy performed Sunday at the request of Brown’s family showed that the teen was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, said Shawn Parcells, the medical investigator who performed the autopsy with Dr. Michael Baden.

It’s unclear whether Brown’s arms were raised when he was shot, but he was not shot in the back, despite witnesses’ claims, Parcells told ABC News.

Family attorney Benjamin Crump said the autopsy results are troubling.

“It confirms our worst fears that the witnesses were telling the truth, that her son was shot multiple times,” Crump said. “The most troubling was the head shot, you know, it’s just not justified in any way, fashion or form to execute this child like this in broad daylight.”

Crump said the family wanted an independent autopsy in order to find out the truth about Brown’s death. The St. Louis County Medical Examiner’s office previously conducted an autopsy, concluding that Brown died of gunshot wounds but releasing no details.

Attorney General {Eric Holder}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/eric-holder.htm”> has ordered a federal medical examiner to perform a separate autopsy because of the circumstances surrounding the shooting.

The shooting death of Brown has sparked riots and protests in the St. Louis suburb, a situation that intensified after Ferguson police released video Friday they say shows Brown robbing a convenience store before the fatal shooting.

McSpadden said she was surprised by the video’s release, and that it doesn’t help to explain the shooting that followed.

“I feel like it has nothing to do with what he did to my child. Nothing,” McSpadden said.",7511,NA,NA,ABC Good Morning America

Johnson and that police officer are the only witnesses to the interaction that ultimately ended with Brown's death.

That police shooting has led to a week filled with protests, a week marred by accusations of police violence.

One photograph has stood out as emblematic of the police response to these protests. It's a photo of an African-American man, arms raised to surrender, walking backward. Nearly a dozen heavily armed St. Louis County officers march towards him.

But look closely at the picture above.

Do you see it? There, near the center of the photo, bolted to one of the officer's black helmets.

It's a video camera.

Serve and protect

When the St. Louis County Police prepared themselves to deploy to the scene of the protests this week, they loaded their M-4 carbines, they checked their gas masks and they strapped on their body armor. 
And they made sure their cameras had batteries, turned them on and headed into the streets of Ferguson.

Last year, while I was conducting research for my feature called {Watch_Dogs: Invasion}<hyperlink=” http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/10/16/4817988/watch-dogs-invasion”>, I spent some time at the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) convention here in Chicago. One of the items I took the time to learn about was the {Vievu LE3}<hyperlink=” http://www.vievu.com/vievu-products/hardware/”>, a wearable camera designed for duty officers to take with them on patrol.


Not the camera you see in the photo above. Something intended to be much more commonplace, a device built to patrol alongside regular beat cops.

The Vievu camera was designed by a Seattle SWAT officer. It is small, about the size of a pack of cigarettes, and light enough to clip to the front of an officer's shirt and wear all day. It has 90 minutes of recording time, including high-definition video and audio. It's built so that an officer can activate it even while they're holding a weapon with both hands, and encrypted to secure the video from the street all the way to the courtroom.

It is a silent witness, an innovative piece of technology that's been on the market for several years now. Comparable devices are made by companies like {Taser}<hyperlink=” http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/5/4162478/tasers-axon-flex-cop-camera-takes-aim-at-privacy”>.

And they're in Watch Dogs as well. Every time you come up against an Elite enemy, there's the chance that one of them will be wearing a ""hidden camera."" The main character, Aiden Pearce, can hack into those cameras and use them against the paramilitary forces in the game.

But the reality, like much of the fiction in Watch Dogs, is something very different.

Steve Lovell, the president of Vievu, told Polygon that his camera wasn't designed to be a covert device. Vievu cameras are designed to be highly visible, so the public knows that they're on camera.

The largest deployment of Vievu devices was, at the time of our interview, for the city of Oakland's police department, who commonly wore them openly during protests as a way to show citizens they were accountable for their actions.
In fact, certain states require that officers inform citizens that they're on camera. Lovell said that anecdotally, these types of interactions had the effect of calming the emotions on both sides of tense police interactions. After all, people like to smile for the camera.
""Our cameras have a green halo around the lens,"" Lovell said. ""This is designed to let other folks know that they're being recorded. ... There's a calming effect that goes with that because people that are engaged with officers, maybe they're stressed out ... and when they know that they're being recorded, there could be a calming effect that helps resolve the situation.
""If I'm on a traffic stop,"" Lovell said, ""and I walk up to the car and I turn this on, the citizen knows that we're recording — that I've got a recording device pointed right down at them — maybe their verbal [confrontation] will be reduced. Hopefully it's a calming situation that doesn't escalate into violence, but law enforcement is a rough environment.
""If the tool provides a calming effect for the citizen and it calms them down, that's great. It's a benefit that's not measurable.""
Your tax dollars at work
When a police officer wears a camera, when he or she makes it a part of their everyday interaction with the public, it serves to keep people's emotions in check. And, most importantly, it serves to create an irrefutable artifact. It preserves the truth.
In Ferguson today, the truth is unclear. We have the story of Michael Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, and we have the story of the officer involved in the shooting. It will take months, maybe years, to sort things out.
The sad fact is that the Ferguson police purchased wearable devices like the Vievu. Polygon repeatedly emailed and called Ferguson officials to discuss the matter, but other news outlets {confirm}<hyperlink=” http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-angry-protests-continue-in-ferguson-missouri/”> that they are sitting on the shelf and have not been deployed to officers in the field.
(Ed. note: Polygon submitted an open records request with the city of Ferguson for details on those cameras.)
When the St. Louis County Police arrived to assist the Ferguson police, they didn't come armed to calm the situation. They came with M-4s, tear gas launchers and refitted, military-class armored vehicles on a mission to clear the streets. That's where the bulk of {their taxpayer funding}<hyperlink=” http://www.vox.com/2014/6/9/5793204/why-the-feds-are-putting-grenade-launchers-in-the-hands-of-local-cops”> was spent.
And by then it was too late. Emotions were running high on both sides. Any calming effect a camera would have had on the situation was lost, just like it is in the photo above, amid a stunning display of militarized force.
As they {marched through the streets}<hyperlink=” http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-police-cite-safety-risk-in-decision-not-to-name-officer-in-shooting.html?smid=fb-nytimes&WT.z_sma=US_PCT_20140812&bicmp=AD&bicmlukp=WT.mc_id&bicmst=1388552400000&bicmet=1420088400000&_r=2#slideshow/100000003051653/100000003051666”> of Missouri, the St. Louis County Police looked every bit as fearsome as the shadowy cartoon villains in a Ubisoft video game.
How different it could have been if there had been a camera on the Ferguson police officer that stopped Michael Brown. How different it could have been had that officer been trained in its use.
Perhaps a camera could have saved a life. Or helped solve a murder.

The Ferguson Police Department received the two Humvees as well as a generator and a flatbed trailer under the surplus equipment program run by the Defense Logistics Agency, which is in charge of getting supplies of all types for the military.

News footage and photos of police outfitted in paramilitary gear clashing with protesters in Ferguson — a largely black suburb of St. Louis with a mostly white police force — have provided new impetus to efforts to rein in the Pentagon program. It provides assault weapons and other surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies across the country.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his committee will review the program to determine if the Defense Department surplus is being used as intended.

The program began in 1990 as a way to help states and local agencies fight drug-related crime. It was expanded in the mid-1990s.

""Congress established this program out of real concern that local law enforcement agencies were literally outgunned by drug criminals,"" Levin said in a statement Friday. ""We intended this equipment to keep police officers and their communities safe from heavily armed drug gangs and terrorist incidents.""

Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., plans to introduce legislation when Congress returns in September to curb what he describes as an increasing militarization of police across the country. Police responding to protesters angry about the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown wore riot gear and deployed tear gas, dogs and armored vehicles, sometimes pointing assault rifles at protesters.

""Our Main Streets should be a place for business, families and relaxation, not tanks and M16s,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""Militarizing America's Main Streets won't make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent.""

A spokeswoman for the logistics agency said its Law Enforcement Support Office distributed nearly $450 million worth of equipment last year ranging from blankets and computers to armored vehicles, boats and assault weapons. About 8,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide participate in the program, known as 1033 for its section in the National Defense Authorization Act, said spokeswoman Michelle McCaskill.

Weapons account for just 5 percent of the equipment distributed, McCaskill said.

St. Louis County, which includes Ferguson, has received a dozen 5.56mm rifles, half a dozen .45-caliber pistols, night-vision goggles and a bomb-disposing robot in recent years, the defense agency said.

The 1033 program is just one of several federal programs that provide military-style equipment to local police. The Homeland Security Department offers grants for armored vehicles and other equipment, while the Justice Department provides grants for rubber bullets, tear gas and other equipment used to control crowds.

Homeland Security grant money paid for the $360,000 Bearcat armored truck on patrol in Ferguson, said Nick Gragnani, executive director of St. Louis Area Regional Response System, which administers such grants for the St. Louis area.

Since 2003, the group has spent $9.4 million on equipment for police in St. Louis County. Most of the body armor worn by officers responding to the Ferguson protests was paid for with federal money, Gragnani said.

""We are given 15 different scenarios we are supposed to be prepared for, and one of those is terrorist attacks or civil unrest,"" Gragnani said Friday. ""Those are the response capabilities we are building up for in the St. Louis area.""

Kara Dansky, senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the police response in Ferguson is just the latest example of what she called the excessive militarization of policing. Heavily armed Special Weapons and Tactics groups, or SWAT teams, are forcing their way into people's homes across the country, often with little justification, she said.

""Neighborhoods are not war zones, and our police officers should not be treating us like wartime enemies,"" said Dansky, the lead author of a June report on the issue.

Militarization encourages officers to adopt a ""warrior"" mentality and think of the people they are supposed to serve as enemies, Dansky said. The ACLU report outlined a number of examples of equipment transfers that it said were cause for concern. For example, police in North Little Rock, Arkansas, obtained at least 34 automatic and semi-automatic rifles, two robots capable of being armed and a tactical vehicle. Many of those weapons could not be accounted for later.

Attorney General Eric Holder said he was concerned that use of military equipment by police in Ferguson was sending a ""conflicting message.""

The response by law enforcement to protests ""must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them,"" Holder said. The Justice Department and FBI are investigating Brown's death.

Johnson said his bill would limit the kinds of military equipment that can be transferred to local police and require states to certify that they can account for all equipment received.

He said he is disturbed by reports that some weapons and other equipment distributed to police have gone missing. He also expressed concern that the militarization trend has moved beyond local police departments and sheriff's offices, saying Ohio State University recently acquired a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle, or MRAP.

""Apparently, college kids are getting too rowdy,"" Johnson said.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a possible GOP presidential contender in 2016, blamed the trend on the federal government.

""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies — where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement,"" Paul wrote in an opinion column in Time magazine.

""There should be a difference between a police response and a military response"" Paul said.",2336,NA,NA,AP

Dominique Clemons is standing at the corner of Canfield and Caddiefield streets, pointing to the middle of the road where Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen, was shot and killed by a white police officer five days earlier.

“Last time I drove by here you could still see spots of blood on the ground,” says Clemons, holding back tears. “I can’t believe something like this is happening where I live.”

This St. Louis suburb has been the scene of turmoil and escalating public tension for several days. Earlier this week, protesters looted and destroyed businesses less than a half-mile from where Brown took his last breath. Then police dressed in fatigues waved military-style weapons and lobbed tear gas to disperse crowds from Florissant Avenue, a main thoroughfare in this town of 21,000.

Thursday night’s demonstration was far less eventful from a public safety standpoint. Still, thousands of protesters paraded down Florissant on foot and in a bumper-to-bumper convoy. Some of them hung outside car widows chanting “No justice, no peace.” Horns shrieked for hours.

“Madness,” said David, a 34-year-old father of three who asked that his name not be published because “it’s just a bad time for bad things to happen.”

Other residents made similar requests, saying that they are less trusting in a town that is nearly 70 percent black but patrolled by nearly an all-white police force.

Instead of joining the pack on Florissant, David has led a daily peaceful protest on the residential street where Brown was shot.

“This is ground zero,” he says, looking over at a makeshift memorial in the street. “We can’t let people forget that a murder took place.”

But while thousands rallied at Thursday’s main event, only a few dozen stopped by during the evening to see the candles and other remembrances left for the teen teachers reportedly described as a “Gentle Giant.”

David, a maintenance worker and electrician, has logged almost 25 hours this week at the corner of Canfield and Caddiefield streets. At times a few friends have brought out their lawn chairs to join him.

“It’s sad that it took a neighbor to die for us to come out and start talking to each other,” he said. “God has a strange way of working.”

On Thursday evening — over the chorus of horns coming from Florissant — David, his friends and a few strangers talk politics, racial injustices and a lot about children.

“My kids need a future. All of our kids need a future,” he said. “It’s time we stand up and start showing some leadership.”

Later in the evening David’s wife, Aurellia, joins him. To get there, she had to walk by where Brown died.

“I’ll never be able to walk in that spot again,” Aurellia said. “I’ll have to walk around it. I don’t even want to get close to it.”

Earlier in the day David had to stop their 3-year-old daughter from trying to pick up one of the teddy bears left at the makeshift memorial.

“She didn’t understand,” he said, shaking his head. “Once my children get old enough I’ll have to explain it to them. And I will tell them the truth.”

For now, David tries to wield his wisdom on other youths in the community. Late Thursday, he stopped three teenage boys who were walking home from the big protest on Florissant. The young men listened politely as he encouraged them to stay in school and out of trouble.

“If you act like animals they are going to put you in a cage,” David told them. “I want you to get an education so you can be the police officers.”

As he spoke, two of boys removed the makeshift masks they had been wearing to mimic some of the protesters at the rally.

“Thank y’all for coming out,” David told the teens as they walked off. “Stop and show Brother Mike some love because that could have been any of y’all.”",1506,NA,NA,yahoo news

Yahoo,yahoo49,http://news.yahoo.com/obama-promises-to-ensure--justice-is-done--for-michael-brown-173136668.html,Obama promises to ensure 'justice is done' in Michael Brown shooting,Oliver Knox,08/14/14,04/25/16,"Vowing to see that “justice is done” for slain teenager Michael Brown, President Obama appealed for calm Thursday from police and demonstrators clashing in Ferguson, Missouri.

“Let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family,” Obama said in a measured, even businesslike, tone from the Martha’s Vineyard resort island where he has been spending a family vacation.

“Now is the time for healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done,” he added. “Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority.”

The president said that he had received an update on the situation from Attorney General Eric Holder and underlined that federal law-enforcement officials were monitoring the local investigation.

The remarks were the president’s first public words about the crisis in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson that erupted after a police officer shot and killed the unarmed black teenager in a confrontation on Saturday.

“He was 18 years old, and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again. And when something like this happens, the local authorities, including the police, have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death and how they are protecting the people in their communities,” Obama said.

The president weighed in as the country grappled with stark footage of police in camouflage uniforms, weapons aimed at demonstrators, alongside armored vehicles of the type more often seen in footage from war zones in Iraq or Afghanistan. And he rebuked local officers for detaining two reporters on the scene.
“There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,” Obama said. “There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.

“And here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground,” he said.

Obama spoke after reports that Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, planned to announce that St. Louis County police would be removed from duty in Ferguson.

In remarks to clergy in Ferguson, Nixon said he would unveil unspecified “operational shifts” to “the chain of command” at a 3 p.m. press conference. Nixon also said he had just spoken by telephone with Obama.

The president conveyed his and first lady Michelle Obama’s “wishes of peace and justice,” Nixon said, as some in the crowd applauded. “I appreciate greatly his leadership and his tone and his willingness to assist us in any way,” he added.

Local police had said they would investigate the shooting. On Monday, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the FBI and attorneys from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division would conduct a “concurrent” investigation.

Obama issued a written statement on Tuesday calling Brown’s death “heartbreaking” and pleading for people to “remember this young man through reflection and understanding.”",7289,NA,NA,yahoo news

Some of the bikers are reportedly from the Outcast MC, which touts itself as America's oldest, all-black motorcycle club. It was founded in Detroit in 1969, but has chapters across the country.

Journalists and protesters shared snapshots of the bikers, clad in signature black jackets and skull masks, on social media.

They joined students, families, churches and members of groups including {Amnesty International}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/amnesty-international.htm”> and even the Black Panther Party, who have joined in the rallies.

Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union tried to produce a comprehensive report on the militarization of America's police forces. But they couldn't. ""The militarization of policing in the United States has occurred with almost no public oversight,"" they {concluded}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf”>. ""Not a single law enforcement agency in this investigation provided records containing all of the information that the ACLU believes is necessary to undertake a thorough examination of police militarization. Some agencies provided records that were nearly totally lacking in important information. Agencies that monitor and provide oversight over the militarization of policing are virtually nonexistent.""

The people charged with protecting us are afraid of what will happen if we know what they're doing.

But the ACLU did discover something worth knowing: after aggregating the reports and data on SWAT raids they could find, they found that the militarized police operations were overwhelmingly aimed at minorities. ""Overall, 42 percent of people impacted by a SWAT deployment to execute a search warrant were Black and 12 percent were Latino. This means that of the people impacted by deployments for warrants, at least 54 percent were minorities."" (For comparison, 72 percent of Americans identified as white in 2010.) The feel of the police presence is much more militarized in minority communities than white communities.

ACLU

There was a time when crime drove American politics. It was a top issue in 1984, and 1988, and 1992. The infamous Willie Horton ad was about race, but it was also about crime. The crack epidemic was ongoing, and murders were rising, and people were afraid. Washington's answer was cops, prisons and harsher sentencing rules.

Today, the crack epidemic is over, the murder rate has fallen, and Americans feel much safer. But cops, prisons and sentencing rules are coming back as an issue. This time, though, they're not seen as the answer. This time they're the problem.

There is no reason to be subtle on this point: the American criminal justice system is racist.

White and black people are {similarly likely}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/7/1/5850830/war-on-drugs-racist-minorities/in/5452637”> to use drugs, but black people are 3.6 times likelier to be arrested for drug use than white people — a disparity that has grown much worse in recent years. That's because America's criminal justice system is racist.

Until 2010, triggering the mandatory 5-year sentence for cocaine, which is used more often in the white community, required possession of 100 times as much of the drug as for crack, which is used more heavily in the black community. After the 2010 reforms, the disparity was {brought down}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/7/1/5850830/war-on-drugs-racist-minorities/in/5452637”> to a (still huge) 18:1. That's because America's criminal justice system is racist.

Prison sentences for black men {tend}<hyperlink=”http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324432004578304463789858002”> to be almost 20 percent longer than prison sentences for white men who commit similar crimes. That gap actually widened after 2005, when the Supreme Court gave judges more control over sentencing. That's because the criminal justice system is racist.

The result is that more than 60 percent of the people in prison are minorities. The Sentencing Project {estimates}<hyperlink=”http://www.sentencingproject.org/issues/racial-disparity”> that among black males in their 30s, more than one in 10 is in prison on any given day. That's because our criminal justice system is racist.

New York's stop-and-frisk program gave police the power to stop people on the street for essentially no reason. More than 80 percent of those {stopped}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/stop-and-frisk-racist-and-ineffective”> were black or Latino (and 88 percent of those stopped were not charged with any crime). That's because our criminal justice system is racist.

African Americans are often hugely underrepresented on police forces. In Ferguson, MO, for instance, the city is 67 percent black, but just {three of its 53 police officers}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/12/5994181/ferguson-is-67-percent-black-and-its-police-force-is-94-percent-white”> are.Incidents of excessive force are commonplace, and increasingly, there's a list of young black men who have died for no other reason than that they ran into a police officer at the wrong time and in the wrong way. The result, as UCLA's Darnell Hunt {says}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/5999929/shooting-mike-brown-final-straw-ferguson-st-louis-missouri/in/5757650”>, is that ""there's a standoff attitude between police and the communities.""

Something very dangerous has happened here: we have let the people and the system that's supposed to protect our communities become a threat to some of them. This is not tenable in a democracy; you cannot have the men and women who carry guns be seen as enemies by so many of the people whose taxes pay their salaries.

We are again entering a period in American politics where the criminal justice is a central issue. But this time, cops and prisons and sentencing laws aren't the answer. They're being seen as the problem. And politicians on both sides of the aisle recognize it.

Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, said in a {statement}<hyperlink=”http://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/media-center/news-releases/mccaskill-in-ferguson-time-to-de-militarize-this-situation”> that ""we need to de-militarize this situation — this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution.""

In a {column}<hyperlink=”http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter”> for Time magazine, Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, wrote, ""given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.""

Prominent politicians ranging from Rand Paul to Paul Ryan to Cory Booker to Dick Durbin to Mike Lee to Barack Obama have started putting forward reforms to the nation's sentencing laws. ""When people are in prison, their skills and social networks deteriorate,"" wrote Ryan in his recent poverty report. ""And when they get out, certain laws and business practices make it even harder for them to find a job. In short, having a prison record makes it very difficult to move up the economic ladder. Minority men are much more likely to serve time and therefore feel the weight of these effects.""

Yahoo,yahoo52,http://news.yahoo.com/obama-says-missouri-shooting-death-tragic-reflection-needed-064133933.html,Police chief says officer in Missouri shooting was injured,Nick Carey; Carey Gillam,08/13/14,04/25/16,"FERGUSON Mo. (Reuters) - The police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager last weekend in Ferguson, Missouri, was injured in the incident that has sparked racially charged protests, the city's police chief said on Wednesday.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson told a news conference the unidentified officer was treated at a hospital for swelling on the side of his face, one of the few details released about events surrounding the Saturday night shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

After three nights of tense standoffs between protesters and heavily armed police - and instances of violence and looting - Jackson urged demonstrators to rally only during daylight hours.

He said it was not a curfew and said that protesters could get their point across with peaceful demonstrations.

In protests on Wednesday in the St. Louis suburb, about 150 demonstrators marched chanting ""hands up, don't shoot"" and carried signs including ""Mike did not have to die.""

A handful of police in riot gear were in place at the end of the march. Police from neighboring districts have been brought in to reinforce the Ferguson police department.

Jackson said he could not release any more information on the shooting because witness statements were still coming in.

What police have said is that the shooting followed a struggle between the officer and Brown.

But that, along with much else about the incident, is a matter of dispute. A witness who was walking with Brown at the time has said in media interviews that Brown put his hands in the air and was not struggling with the officer. He said the officer fired multiple times into Brown's head and chest.

The witness, Dorian Johnson, was expected to meet on Wednesday with prosecutors and investigators, local media reported. His lawyer, Freeman Bosley, a former St. Louis mayor, did not immediately answer requests for comment.

Police have declined to release the name of the officer involved in the incident, citing concerns for his safety, a decision that has been criticized by demonstrators who have asked for more transparency. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.

Jackson said his priority was improving race relations in Ferguson, which has seen a stark demographic shift in recent decades, going from mostly white to mostly black. About two-thirds of the town's 21,000-strong population are black. On a police force of 53, three officers are black.

""This is an opportunity to fix what's wrong,"" he said. He said that the U.S. Department of Justice was advising Ferguson officials on how to improve relations with the community and would work with civil rights groups.

Jackson said investigation would last two weeks.

TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT

Ferguson residents were still trying to make sense out of what happened on Wednesday.

""I cannot condone violence, but I definitely understand where the anger of young black men comes from at times like this. I don't think until you've experienced that kind of treatment that you can understand it,"" said Mike McCoy, 41, who runs an African-American youth program.

McCoy, who said he has been a victim of racial profiling by local police, was visiting a memorial of candles, teddy bears and messages near where Brown was killed.

National figures from President Barack Obama to civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton have called for a peaceful response to the shooting.

About 40 protesters have been arrested since Saturday.

After Tuesday night's protests were broken up by tear gas, a St. Louis County Police officer shot and critically wounded a 19-year-old male who allegedly pointed a gun at the officer. The man who was shot had been involved with the earlier protests, police said.

Meanwhile, police in California were investigating a separate incident of an officer fatally shooting an unarmed 25-year-old black man in Los Angeles.

On social media, groups claiming to be associated with the Anonymous hacker activist group called for nationwide protests and threatened to reveal personal information about Ferguson police officers.

The Ferguson police said there have been attempts to hack their website and that it was temporarily disrupted.

Ferguson Police spokesman Tim Zoll said the cyber-threats prompted the decision not to release the officer's name.

Anonymous groups, using Twitter names @TheAnonMessage and @OpFerguson, posted a two-hour audio file they said was of dispatch center conversations after Brown was shot. St. Louis County Police Department spokesman Brian Schellman said the police response to the incident is part of the investigation.

On the recording a dispatcher is heard telling another dispatcher that she is learning of the officer-involved shooting through reporters who were calling. The dispatchers were not heard requesting rescue personnel to respond but did send K-9 units and more police to the scene to control the crowd.",9976,NA,NA,Reuters

In the case of Ferguson, police were firing rubber bullets, not real ones, along with tear gas and smoke bombs in an effort to tamp down protests and disperse demonstrators who had gathered for a fourth consecutive night Wednesday to demand justice for Michael Brown.

{Michael Brown's Parents: 'Stop the Violence'}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/US/video/michael-brown-shooting-parents-interview-stop-violence-24948918”>

Brown, 18, was unarmed when he was shot multiple times by a police officer in broad daylight Saturday afternoon, authorities said. The officer has not been identified to the public and he has been placed on paid administrative leave, authorities said. Protesters have demanded he be identified and brought to justice.

The response of the Ferguson and St. Louis County police to the protests has highlighted a growing trend in policing in the United States: police SWAT teams look increasingly like military forces, using military-grade equipment and justifying that use by noting that the public has increasingly-sophisticated weapons themselves.

The distribution of military equipment to local law enforcement began in the 1990s to help agencies fight the so-called war on drugs. It was expanded after 9/11, with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, to help law enforcement fight terror threats, experts said.

An official with the U.S. {Department of Defense}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/department-of-defense.htm”> told ABC News today that last October, Ferguson police received ""non-tactical"" equipment under the so-called ""1033 program"" that included two unarmored Humvees, a trailer and a generator.

The armored vehicle used by Ferguson, and seen in many of the images from Wednesday night, was not given to the town by the DoD, the official said. It was not a military vehicle.


There’s no information yet about what other tactical equipment the Ferguson Police Department may have received, the official said, but a complete list of the equipment provided to St. Louis County by the DoD shows the types of weapons being distributed: six .45-caliber pistols, 12 rifles, two sight reflexes, one explosive ordnance disposal robot, one helicopter, seven utility trucks, three trailers, one motorized cart, one pair of elbow pads, one pair of knee pads, one industrial strength face shield, two night-vision viewers, and computers.

The weapons that Ferguson police are using appear to be non-military issue, the DoD official said, and their camouflage uniforms were likely commercially purchased.

But experts said police equipment and training around the nation have been getting military upgrades. And critics say this can be a problem.

""When you arm police like soldiers and outfit them with military weapons and train them on military tactics and tell them they’re fighting a war, whether it's a war on crime or drugs or looters and rioters, they’re going to start seeing themselves as soldiers, and seeing the people they serve less as citizens with rights and more as potential threats, and that’s what we’re seeing,"" said Radley Balko, author of the book ""Rise of the Warrior Cop"" and a reporter for the Washington Post.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson was asked at a press conference on Wednesday why his department was using military-grade equipment to tamp down unarmed protesters angry over the death of Michael Brown.

""None of that was military equipment, all of the SWAT teams have big vans and that was the city SWAT team and [St. Louis] County SWAT Team,"" he said. When pressed why his department was using armored vehicles and rifles, he countered, ""People are using bombs now, pipe bombs and so forth.""

Since 1990, the federal government has distributed surplus military weapons to town and county police forces under a program known as 1033, through the Law Enforcement Support Office. In 2013, LESO distributed $450 million worth of supplies, including automatic weapons to towns such as Ferguson and counties such as St. Louis, according to a {report from the ACLU}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/report/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-police?redirect=criminal-law-reform/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-police-report”> released this summer.

Other law enforcement personnel, including former Los Angeles Police Chief and current New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton, have defended the equipment as necessary for defending themselves from a more dangerous citizenry.


“I don’t see us as militarizing police,” Bratton told the {Center for Investigative Reporting in 2011}<hyperlink=”http://cironline.org/reports/local-police-stockpile-high-tech-combat-ready-gear-2913”>. “I see us as keeping abreast with society. And we are a gun-crazy society.”

Balko said that isn't necessarily true.

""There are more guns out there but there’s not much evidence that there’s a problem. The crime rate’s been dropping since 1994, and the Justice Department's done a couple of studies that show the type of gun typically used in a homicide, overwhelmingly, is low caliber handgun,"" Balko said. ""The job of police officer has been getting safer as crime rate has been dropping.""

""What’s happening in Ferguson is a reflection of militarization of policing happening across America,"" said Kara Dansky, senior counsel at the ACLU and the author of the report. ""It's the routine use of paramilitary tactics, using weapons directly from the U.S. military, in towns across America.""

""As we’re seeing in Ferguson, it tends to escalate the risk of violence, makes people less safe, and undermines the public's trust in law enforcement,"" Dansky said.

Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby was asked about criticism about the increased militarization of police forces in the U.S. at a news conference today.

""There is a law enforcement support program that the Defense Department administers which provides to law enforcement agencies around the country surplus military equipment, gear, arms, ammunition, vehicles,"" he said. ""This is a useful program that allows for the reuse of military equipment that otherwise would be disposed of that can be used, again, by law enforcement agencies to serve their citizens.""

""That said, it is up to law enforcement agencies to speak to how and what they gain through this system. And I'm not going to inject the Pentagon into this discussion. How this equipment is used to serve local citizens, again, is up for local law enforcement agencies to speak to,"" Kirby said.",56,NA,NA,ABC news

(AP) — The Missouri prosecutor overseeing an investigation into the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown has deep family roots among police: his father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for St. Louis' police department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect.

The connections now are being cited by some local residents and black leaders who question whether St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch can remain impartial. Brown, who was black, was fatally shot in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on Aug. 9 by local police officer Darren Wilson, who is white.

Grand jurors may begin hearing the case Wednesday, though it could be weeks before they decide whether to indict Wilson on state criminal charges. The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a separate civil rights investigation, which could also result in charges.

McCulloch's spokesman, Ed Magee, said Monday that the prosecutor plans to remain in charge of the case, despite mounting pressure to step aside amid violent clashes between police and protesters demanding that Wilson be charged.

McCulloch, a Democrat who has been in office since 1991, referenced his father's death in his initial campaign. He survived a Democratic primary earlier this month and faces no Republican opposition in his re-election bid.

Protesters questioned his objectivity when grand jurors returned no charges against two officers who fired 21 bullets into a vehicle in June 2000, killing two black men during an attempted drug arrest.

But at the time, McCulloch said his father's 1964 shooting by a black man at a public housing complex was an ""incredibly irrelevant facet"" as he sought to ""make sure everybody gets a full and fair hearing."" McCulloch was 12 when his father was killed.

U.S. attorneys also reviewed the case and decided a year later not to bring any civil rights charges against the officers.

In Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb of St. Louis, many residents say they have long been harassed and intimidated by the police department, which has just three black officers on its 53-member force. They also have little confidence in McCulloch.

""He's not going to prosecute the police officers,"" said Robert Fowler, a 48-year-old electrician. ""In the ghetto ... every police officer, he's letting go free. They call it justifiable homicide.""

McCulloch has not responded to Associated Press requests for an interview. But he recently told television station KMOV: ""I've been as fair and impartial and done as thorough of a job as we could.""

Police allege that Brown failed to move out of the center of the street when Wilson asked him to, and a scuffle ensued before he was shot. Witnesses say Brown had his hands up as Wilson fired multiple rounds.

Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

In some other prominent cases — most notably, the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida — special state prosecutors have been appointed to determine whether to pursue charges. That at times occurred only after local authorities took no action.

But under Missouri law, it ""would be highly, highly, highly unusual"" for a prosecutor to step aside merely because of racial tensions in a high-profile case, said Peter Joy, a Washington University law professor who directs the school's Criminal Justice Clinic.

In Missouri, ""the buck stops with the head prosecutor"" in each county, Joy said.

Missouri law allows two avenues for outside prosecutors: The local prosecutor can ask for help from the governor, who can appoint the state attorney general's office to the case; or a court can appoint a special prosecutor if the elected one has a conflict of interest.

Police shootings don't automatically qualify as conflicts of interest and often are handled by local prosecutors.

""Just because the case is really hot and really controversial would not be a reason why I would seek a special prosecutor,"" said Eric Zahnd, a Kansas City-area prosecutor and past president of the Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys.

But some black leaders — including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley and state Sens. Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Jamilah Nasheed — have called on McCulloch to consent to a special prosecutor.

Nasheed started an online petition that has gotten about 25,000 signatures in four days seeking a special prosecutor.

""In the past, justice has not been achieved in these types of police shootings,"" said Clay, who represents the area. ""So I have no comfort with local-authority prosecution, the judicial system or even police conducting a thorough and conclusive investigation that delivers justice to the family of Michael Brown.""

""Simply put: he has a natural bias,"" added Chappelle-Nadal. ""My community doesn't trust him.""",4066,NA,NA,AP

Yahoo,yahoo58 ,http://news.yahoo.com/vandalism-looting-vigil-missouri-man-043816425.html,"Vandalism, looting after vigil for Missouri man ",Jim Salter; Jim Suhr,08/11/14,04/25/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — The FBI said it opened an investigation Monday into the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by police in suburban St. Louis, a day after tension surrounding the case erupted in unrest following a candlelight vigil for the teen.

Questions loomed over the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was unarmed and shot multiple times Saturday after an altercation with an officer in Ferguson. It's unclear whether Brown or a man he was with was involved in the alleged scuffle, and authorities have been vague about what led an officer to open fire.

But Dorian Johnson told WALB-TV that he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and then outside his car.

Johnson said the officer fired, and he and Brown were scared and ran away.

""He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and he started to get down,"" Johnson said. ""But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""

""We wasn't causing harm to nobody. We had no weapons on us at all,"" Johnson told the television station.

The St. Louis County Police Department, which is leading the investigation, refused to discuss Johnson's remarks, citing the ongoing investigation. But County Police Chief Jon Belmar has previously said that an officer encountered Brown and another man outside an apartment complex in Ferguson, and that one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled before the shooting.

The FBI is looking into possible civil rights violations arising from the shooting, said Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI's St. Louis field office. But she noted that the FBI would be investigating such a shooting regardless of the public attention surrounding it.

Nearly three dozen people were arrested after tensions around the case following a candlelight vigil Sunday night, as crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted officers who tried to block access to parts of the city.

Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used Brown's death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.

""Most came here for a peaceful protest but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. ... I can understand the anger and unrest but I can't understand the violence and looting,"" Trout, 53, said.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said 32 people were arrested for various infractions, including assault, burglary and theft. Schellman said two officers suffered minor injuries and that there were no reports of civilians hurt.

Several businesses were looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer, and carted rims away from a tire store. Some climbed atop police cars as the officers with riot shields and batons stood stoic nearby, trying to restrict access to the most seriously affected areas.

There no immediate reports of serious injuries. Pat Washington, a spokeswoman for St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, said tear gas had been used.

""The small group of people are creating a huge mess,"" Mayor James Knowles said. ""Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.""

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV that there's no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn't yet put to use.

Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and it wasn't clear if he was armed.

Jackson said blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him. Toxicology tests can take weeks to complete.

Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting ""Don't shoot me"" while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn't use force; the crowd eventually left. A similar protest that attracted about 250 people was held Monday morning.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she didn't understand why police didn't subdue her high school graduate son with a club or stun gun, and that the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,"" she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

Brown's family planned to speak further at a Monday afternoon news conference with their attorney, Benjamin Crump, who also represented Martin's family.

""We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,"" said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.

""I'm very concerned about the increased use, and the much laxer attitude we've developed towards the potential health effects,"" says Sven-Eric Jordt, a scientist at Duke University who researches tear gas.

Jordt says we know a decent amount about how tear gas effects the body in the short-term: it activates pain receptors, especially in the eyes, forcing the eyelids to squeeze shut and tear uncontrollably. Jordt, who himself was tear-gassed during a protest in Germany in the 1980s, describes the sensation as ""like cutting an onion but about 100 times more severe.""

There is little known, however, about whether the main chemical in modern tear gas — a compound called 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile — can have longer lasting effects on the body. That's something Jordt and his colleagues are currently researching.

Jordt and I spoke Thursday morning about the history of tear gas, how the compound effects the body and what we still don't know about how tear gas works.

Sarah Kliff: Can you start by walking me through the history of tear gas. How was it developed, and why does it exist in the first place?

Sven-Eric Jordt: The first tear gas agents were developed during {the First World War}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/a/world-war-i-maps”> as warfare agents. These were highly aggressive, organic compounds used in trench warfare and other situations alongside other, more lethal war gases like mustard gas.

The tear gas that's used by law enforcement now is typically CS gas. It's a compound that was developed because its less toxic. It's used for clearing wider areas. It was used in the Middle East and Turkey recently to a scale that was unprecedented. Use has increased tremendously over the last few years; its also been used in the US more and more. I think it's what's being used in Ferguson.

SK: How do these gases work?

SEJ: The way these gases work, and this is what we do research on, is that they activate pain receptors — the pain sensing nerves in our body. The cornea is densely covered with these receptors. When tear gas activates these pain receptors, that leads to body reflexes like profuse tear secretion and a muscle cramp in the eyelid that causes them to close. These are all protective responses that the body has to pain, and with the gas they become extremely exaggerated.

There are situations where this can be very dangerous or lethal. If somebody has asthma, for example, or a hypersensitivity or an airwave disease that can be very dangerous. It's not very frequent, but it has been a problem in the Middle East and other places.

""There are situations where [tear gas] can be very dangerous or lethal""

Tear gas can also lead to profuse mucus production, and that can lead to the feeling of suffocation. That's especially true if it's used in closed environments, like what you saw in Cairo. That's not the case here in Ferguson.

SK: Can you explain what it feels like to be tear-gassed? I understand that you've experienced it yourself once.

SEJ: That was in the 1980s when I was a student, and I protested against nuclear waste transport in Germany. It's extremely painful. Your face starts burning very quickly and your eyes start tearing. The eyelids shut and you can't do much. It's like cutting an onion but maybe 100 times more severe. It actually is the same pain receptors being activated as what happens with an onion, except you're dealing with something that is about 100 or 1000 times more potent.

What happens next is you get severe pain in your nose and throat and you also get a lot of mucus and snot production, and that obstructs your breathing. It's like a burn injury or a chemical burn that happens.

SK: What do we know about the long-term effects of tear gas exposure?

SEJ: There are very few studies on that. We don't have very much information from humans; we've mostly looked at it in animal models.

What we know is that tear gas causes inflammatory responses that are very rapid, and causes skin and eye inflammation that takes several days to clear. If someone has a chronic, underlying disease — if they have a skin disease, for example — this could aggregate that condition. There are very few long term studies on this though.

""It's extremely painful. Your face starts burning quickly.""

SK: I know your work focuses more on the research of how tear gas works, but I was curious if you had any thinking on why we've seen an increase in tear gas use over the last few years?

SEJ: I think tear gas is seen as safe and somewhat effective, especially when the alternatives are weapons and rubber bullets that can cause much more severe injury. There's a perception that these are relatively harmless compared to other riot controlling measures.

SK: As somebody who studies tear gas, do you think that perception is accurate?

I frankly think that we don't know much about the long-term effects, especially in civilian exposure with kids or elderly or people in the street who might have some kind of lung disease already. There's very few follow-up studies. These are very active chemicals that can cause quite significant injury, so I'm concerned about the increased use of these agents.

The question is: what else could the police use when attacked? It's hard to say, and most people do recover okay after being exposed. But then you see, in the Middle East, tear gas being used to essentially fumigate a city with tens of millions of people, and that's a really big concern.

I'm very concerned that, as use has increased, tear gas has been normalized. The attitude now is like, this is safe and we can use it as much as we want.",4,NA,NA,vox news

If you post something on Facebook that its formulas deem unworthy of friends’ feeds, you will know that only from a lack of feedback.

But there is a way to get more direct feedback: If you {create a public page separate from your personal profile}<hyperlink=”https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/”>, Facebook will say exactly how many people saw its updates.

Twitter policy changes: Don’t tell, don’t ask

At Twitter, there’s no mystery about what fills your timeline; advertisers’ promoted tweets aside, it’s a reverse-chronological list of what people you follow tweeted and retweeted.

But while Twitter doesn’t make its members decode any mystery math, it can annoy them by changing its rules without explanation.

Last December, for instance, Twitter weakened its {block function}<hyperlink=”https://support.twitter.com/articles/117063”>, the option to lock an abusive tweeter out of most interaction with your account, in a way that would {let a harasser continue to abuse people in front of their friends}<hyperlink=”http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/”>.

People distributed buttons featuring Brown's picture. ""Justice for Michael Brown,"" the buttons state, featuring silhouettes of raised hands. A witness says Brown's hands were raised when he was fatally shot.

The heavily armed police at times trained weapons on the citizens from an armored truck.

Police, dressed in riot gear, repeatedly warned the protesters to leave.

Police fired smoke bombs soon after, trying to get the crowd to disperse.

Smoke rose on the street.

Protesters returned fire.

The clashes marked the fourth consecutive night of fighting in Ferguson.

One demonstrator tried to kick a smoke grenade back in the direction of police.

Police worked their way down the street, clearing the area of people.

The situation showcases Ferguson's racial divide. Two-thirds of the city's 21,000 residents are black, while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who has been the public face of the city torn by Saturday's death of 18-year-old Brown, told reporters Wednesday that his department welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations.

""Unfortunately, an undertow (of racial unrest) has bubbled to the surface,"" said Jackson. ""Race relations is the top priority right now.""

Brown was shot multiple times by an officer the police have refused to identify. His body lay slain on the sidewalk for hours as first Ferguson police and then the St. Louis County Police Department processed the scene, drawing immediate criticism aimed at the police for not removing his body more quickly.

Antonio French, an Alderman of St. Louis City's 21st Ward, was also arrested, French's wife said. French had spent previous nights posting videos from the streets of Ferguson online, revealing first-hand perspectives into the devastation and suffering.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon weighed in, calling for law enforcement to respect the rights of residents and media members.

A Ferguson store clerk told police that Brown stole cigars from the store and that when he confronted Brown, the teen shoved him.

Video aired by Fox News shows who police believe to be Brown taking the cigars. The video also shows the store clerk confronting him. A woman and a young child are seen in the video as well.

Three minutes after a 911 dispatcher reported the incident, Brown had been shot.

Jackson has received heavy criticism for the release of both the officers’ name and the robbery allegation. Protesters say that police have covered up information about the altercation between Brown and Wilson.

Police have maintained that Brown assaulted Wilson and tried to gain control of the officer’s weapon. Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson, who is named in a police report for the robbery and was walking with him at the time of the shooting, has said that Wilson confronted them about walking in the middle of the street.

Incidents from a ""tiny minority of lawbreakers"" prompted the police response, including shots fired and Molotov cocktails thrown, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said, speaking at an early-morning news conference.

""Our officers came under heavy gunfire,"" he added.

Two people were shot and at least 31 people were arrested during Monday night's unrest, Johnson said, with some of those arrested coming from as far away as New York and California.

Four St. Louis police officers were hit by rocks and bottles and sustained injures, Johnson said.

Protesters stood defiantly in the middle of the street amid the smoke and confusion. The tear gas hit journalists on the scene, too.

Police marched on the protesters and, shortly after, told members of the media that shots had been fired and that they should move to the command center.

Johnson said journalists need to be more mindful of police efforts.

""In the midst of chaos, trying to move people along, we have to be safe,"" Johnson said.

Johnson encouraged protesters to rally during the daytime hours.

Just before the clashes picked up, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon shared encouraging messages online, tweeting, “Let’s show the world that we can protest peacefully & passionately. Let’s keep #Ferguson safe tonight.” He also tweeted a photo of himself speaking earlier in the day with President Obama.

Obama denounced the ongoing clashes at a Monday press conference. Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Ferguson Wednesday to meet with FBI and Department of Justice officials working the case, Obama said.

National Guard troops, called in by Gov. Jay Nixon Monday, protected the police command center.

Angela Tate, a counselor and director of the region’s Behavioral Health Response, said her 14-year-old daughter keeps asking over and over what exactly is going on.

“Her questions [are], ‘How long is this going on.’ She wants to go back to school,” Tate said. “Her questions haven’t been the deeper-thought level questions. It’s been more on the surface is what happens first and what happens next.”

Tate’s daughter is just one of 11,000 students in the Ferguson-Florissant school district who remain unable to go to school because of the protests. The district has postponed school twice since the protests began, meaning thousands of children have been left without their normal day-to-day routine.

The delayed school date is more than a minor annoyance because it can create more stress for young students already living through stressful and new event, some experts say.

Dr. Alan Kazdin, a professor of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale University, said an everyday routine is key to keeping down stress levels.


""Routines and rituals help keep a lid on anxiety,” Kazdin said. “You can’t reason a person out of these things.”

Tate said her daughter didn’t talk too much about her fears surrounding the situation, until a window was broken at a store next to Tate’s husband’s barber shop.

“’Is Daddy’s shop still safe?’” Tate recalled her daughter asking. “We have responded to her by watching the news reports together but not too much because that can become overwhelming. We can watch it once a night and try to talk to the facts. “

Tate said her goal has been to support her daughter but also be transparent with her if she does not know the answer to a question and to be clear it is ok to feel scared, afraid or unsettled.

“We talk about normalizing these emotions and the effects of this type of trauma,” Tate said.

Kazdin said monitoring how much children -- both teens and younger ones -- are exposed to events, either on TV or in person, is key in helping them feel safe and calm.

“Many children during September 11 [terrorist acts] had post-traumatic stress symptoms and it was perplexing,” Kazdin said. “They had no contact with September 11[events.] It turns out it was related to the amount of TV they watched [of events.]”

Carolyn Landis, a psychiatrist and professor of pediatrics at the UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, said parents can frame the scary events happening outside in a more positive manner to make children feel safe and secure.

“They can be anxious about going back to school and now there is unrest,” Landis said. “Definitely with younger children [parents should] be very careful about having a TV on because [of] nightmares. What they’re exposed to is what they’re going to be dreaming about, try to be as positive as possible.”

Gayle Babcock of the Ferguson Youth Initiative said she has heard from parents that young children have been unable to sleep after seeing or hearing violence in their neighborhood or on the television.

“As an adult I’m traumatized; most of the kids are [too,]” said Babcock, who works mainly with teenagers in the area as part of a traveling youth center. “The kids are saying the police need to talk to youth and need to hear them. The youth are not bad just because they’re teenagers.”

Both Tate and Babcock are working to provide young people and children in the community with access to counselors or other resources so that they don’t feel overwhelmed. Tate has been going to rallies with other counselors to talk to families or teens.

The St. Louis County Children’s Service Fund is planning to send an additional 25 counselors to the school district when classes start, effectively doubling the amount of counselors available to students.

While younger children may be without a clear schedule because of the protests, older teens have had the opportunity to participate in large daily protests likely for the first time. Amy Hunter, director of Racial Justice at the YWCA in St. Louis, said she has talked to many of the younger protesters, some of whom are the same age as her teenage children. She said she has found signs of hopefulness among the protesters, in addition to their anger over the death of Michael Brown.

“For many of the young people it’s one of the first times to have their voice and have their voice heard,” Hunter said. “This is how social movements change forever. I think a lot of the older middle-aged people are encouraging them to have their voices heard in a nonviolent way.”",1130,NA,NA,ABC Good Morning America

The umpteenth take on the buddy cop formula, greeted by {poor reviews}<hyperlink=”http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lets-be-cops”>. But this week, the timing of Let's Be Cops's release yesterday seemed terrible.

It's not just that Let's Be Cops has that title on a week when events in Ferguson, Missouri, bring to mind not low-level police officers trying to bring down petty criminals but, instead, officers armed with military-grade weaponry confronting protesters (or, worse, the unknown officer who sparked the incident by killing the unarmed {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5993609/michael-brown-ferguson-shooting-protests-riots-police-violence-unarmed”>). It's that the whole release strategy behind the modern movie machine involves blanketing the world with marketing, which results in the following bit of awful incongruity on Twitter last night, as pointed out by my friend and former A.V. Club colleague Erik Adams. [tweetbegin 499751497224429568 tweetend]


There probably wasn't much 20th Century Fox could do about the film's release. The protests (and overcompensating response to said protests) didn't begin in earnest until Monday night, only a little over 24 hours before Let's Be Copsbegan midnight screenings. And {early box office returns}<hyperlink=”http://deadline.com/2014/08/lets-be-cops-opens-to-1-2m-in-late-night-tuesday-818733/”> suggest the movie will do fine, if not be a massive hit. It's a comedy, smartly released at a time when there aren't a lot of comedies, and Fox could probably scale back its marketing efforts (which it will almost certainly have to after last night's events in Ferguson) and not lose too many ticket sales because of that counterprogramming.

But the terrible timing of Let's Be Cops points to a larger problem in the ways Hollywood tells stories about the police: though the film and television industries continue to tell stories about cops by the boatload, those stories have done a horrible job of evolving to reflect the ways the militarization of police forces can create rifts between officers and the people they're ostensibly protecting.

How we think about crime

To be sure, art usually reflects life, and it can take time for these sorts of things to filter their way into the public consciousness. The horrifying night-vision images of Wednesday's confrontation in Ferguson will eventually be reflected somewhere in something Hollywood produces, because they have been so widely spread and commented upon.

But movies and TV shows about police officers have long been one of the foremost ways Americans process and reflect upon their feelings about both crime and efforts to stop that crime. We might have more stories about cops than ever, but they seem largely unable or unwilling to think about the issues that have reached a crisis point in Ferguson.

It seems silly today, but at the time of its debut in 1968, The Mod Squad was widely acclaimed for helping make sense out of things like the era's youth culture and the struggles of both women and people of color to find equality in the workplace. Growing anxiety about violent crime in the ‘70s found its expression in films like The French Connection andDirty Harry, while the 1980s' Hill Street Blues is one of the smartest, most compassionate TV shows ever made and an earnest plea for understanding and empathy about the plight of American inner cities that also managed to become a top 30 Nielsen hit.

Consider, also, the wave of buddy cop movies that arrived in the ‘80s, many of which had surprisingly thoughtful attempts to deal with issues like racial relations (48 Hours) or mental health (Lethal Weapon) at or near their cores. Those attempts can seem cloying now, but at the time, they were revolutionary. Even ersatz ‘90s cop show The X-Filesreflected that era's growing suspicion of government action, to say nothing of how Law & Order directly confronted the issues of the day.

If there's a demarcating line here, it's likely the debut of CSI in 2000. The CBS series was too big to ignore, meaning that essentially every cop show on TV had to grapple with it in some way. Most shows chose to just copy it. Oddly enough,CSI is, at least metaphorically, about the growing reliance of police departments on advanced technology that cuts said departments off from the people they're meant to protect. Hill Street and its descendants built out whole universes around their central police precincts. In contrast, CSI's Las Vegas was divided between the police officers and their cool toys and a city full of cardboard cutouts who existed mostly to kill or be killed.

There's nothing inherently wrong with this approach. Early CSI was a lot of fun, and even in its dotage, the show is capable of a handful of solid episodes per season. There have always been straightforward ""cops vs. robbers"" stories, and they can be good fun. But what happens when this is the only story viewers get told?

Shiny new toys

The CSI approach rapidly became essentially the only approach TV had for telling stories about police officers, while movies about cops were increasingly relegated to the sidelines in favor of big budget extravaganzas. And when the primary story being told about police officers is that all of their new toys are fantastic and they're living in a crime wave straight out of viewers' worst nightmares, it sends subconscious assumptions that are easy to filter out into reality.

There are a couple of major exceptions to the CSI rule, but neither has proved as fruitful as that show in terms of shifting the TV landscape. The Wire is one of the greatest television shows ever made, a beautiful, bruising, realistic look at all sides of the war on drugs and the death of the American city that has immense empathy for every character within its universe. But it's also sui generis, and therefore much too hard for other shows to copy (to say nothing of how it was never a massive hit and teetered on the brink of cancellation for its entire run).

More successful in this regard was The Shield, which looked at the uneasy relationship Americans often have with cops who break the law but, nonetheless, get results — in both fiction and reality. In some ways, that show was a very delayed response to the Rodney King beating and the culture of corruption within the Los Angeles Police Department that was made glaringly public after that incident. But in other ways, it was also (inadvertently) the perfect post-September 11 show, about how easy it is to cross moral lines when working to fight crime. If Hollywood is ever going to deal with the militarization of police forces, The Shield's creator, Shawn Ryan, who has also done several solid military series (The Unit, Last Resort), would be a good choice to consider those questions.

But if you're looking for the TV show or movie that directly deals with these issues, it doesn't exist yet. Hollywood can occasionally be a little slow at dealing with social issues, but this creeping militarization has been going on for a while, with little on TV to reflect either the simple fact of its existence or the moral and ethical issues that go along with it. Indeed, the upcoming CBS show Battle Creek is a series that feels unstuck in time, dealing as it does with an underfunded police department that can't get its hands on good equipment. Real world police departments are getting more and more advanced technology; fictional ones are devolving.

Obliterating the stakes

To some degree, that has something to do with the fact that stories about police officers usually have police officers as protagonists. It's much easier to level the playing field between protagonist and antagonist when the hero is a beat cop up against a serial killer than it is when the hero can ride a tank into battle with civilians. Good storytelling demands dramatic stakes, and tanks tend to skew that equation.

Consider, for instance, the Fox summer series Gang Related, which did deal with a militarized police department, but set it up against a gang that also possessed such technology, creating a show where open war essentially raged on the streets of Los Angeles. That might be fun for an action show, but it doesn't reflect the images from Ferguson, where the conflict was decidedly imbalanced.

We need more TV shows and movies that reflect the world we're seeing in news reports from Ferguson, and we need ones that do so directly. Fiction helps us process and make sense of the world, and there's room in the images out of Ferguson (and so many other cities) for an earnest and nuanced consideration of what happens when police officers are given military-grade weaponry. That story could be told from the point-of-view of cops or ordinary citizens or even criminals. But it's there to be told, and it too rarely is — certainly not in projects like Let's Be Cops.

And if nothing else, it's time for the CSI template to gain that nuance. There are times when technology is helpful in solving crime (especially in a lab setting), but it's not a de facto good for police departments around the country. To suggest otherwise does a disservice to viewers and storytelling.

Yahoo,yahoo69,https://www.yahoo.com/news/missouri-crowd-shooting-kill-police-230624269.html,Missouri crowd after shooting: 'Kill the police',Alan Scher Zaiger,08/10/14,04/18/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — The fatal shooting of a black teenager by police sent hundreds of angry residents out of their apartments Saturday in a St. Louis suburb, igniting shouts of ""kill the police"" during a confrontation that lasted several hours.

A St. Louis County chapter of the NAACP called for the FBI to look into the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, said she saw him running in her neighborhood Saturday afternoon when she passed him in her car. Just minutes later, after she returned home, she heard a commotion and went outside to check on it. Less than two blocks away, she found Brown's body.

""He was running this way,"" she said. ""When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.""

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported several distraught relatives were outside talking with neighbors, including Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and stepfather, Louis Head. Head held a sign that read: ""Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!""

A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting at the request of the local department, confirmed a Ferguson police officer shot the man. The spokesman didn't give the reason for the shooting. St. Louis County police said a large crowd confronted officers following the shooting, yelling such things as ""kill the police.""

John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, said the FBI should get involved ""to protect the integrity of the investigation."" He alluded to the 2012 racially-charged shooting of a 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, as well as the death of a New York man from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes on the street.

""With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,"" Gaskin said.

Gaskin said officials in the organization spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who told them teenager had been shot twice.

By early Saturday night, dozens of police cars remained parked near the shooting scene as mourners left votive candles, rose petals, a large stuffed animal and other remembrances at a makeshift memorial in the middle of the street. At the height of the post-shooting tensions, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents, about two-thirds of whom are black.

Harris said her grandson had recently graduated high school and was looking forward to the future, including possibly attending college.

""My grandson never even got into a fight,"" she said. ""He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.""

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told the Post-Dispatch that the officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave.

""We are hoping for calm and for people to give us a chance to conduct a thorough investigation,"" Jackson said.

Gaskin said the angry crowd was reacting to a ""trauma.""

""Anytime you have this type of event that's taken place, emotions are going to run high,"" he said. ""But for 600 people to gather around an area to see where a man is lying in the street, that means something happened that should have not happened.""

Yahoo,yahoo70,https://www.yahoo.com/news/missouri-protests-calm-black-police-captain-state-officers-082540007.html,Officer in Missouri shooting unaware teen was a suspect: police,Nick Carey,08/15/14,04/18/16,"Minutes before a police officer shot him dead, Michael Brown had become a suspect in the theft of cigars from a store, according to police reports released on Friday after days of protests in a St. Louis suburb over the unarmed black teenager's death.

But what, if anything, that had to do with the fatal encounter became less clear as the day went by. Hours after the reports' release, police said that Officer Darren Wilson, 28, had no idea 18-year-old Brown was a robbery suspect. He simply wanted Brown to move from the road to the sidewalk, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said at a news conference

""He was walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic. That was it,"" Jackson said.

After nearly a week of accusations that the Ferguson Police Department did not know how to communicate with the public, Jackson did little to dispel that image during two appearances on Friday.

He was visibly nervous, stuttering as he fumbled his notes, and made announcements that only sowed more confusion. After releasing the robbery incident report without any attempt to explain its fuller context, he let more than five hours pass before confirming, and only when asked, that Wilson did not know about the robbery when he encountered Brown.

The decision by the police department, which is overwhelmingly white, to release a report on the robbery while keeping details of the shooting secret only served to fuel outrage that has roiled the St. Louis area.

After identifying Wilson as the officer involved in the shooting, Jackson described the officer as a ""gentleman"" who has been devastated by the incident. Wilson worked four of his six years as an officer on the Ferguson police force, the chief said.

Wilson's identity has been kept a secret since the Aug. 9 shooting and authorities had been under mounting pressure to both identify the officer and to provide details about the investigation to ease unrest in the largely black community.

Since Saturday's killing, which took place shortly after noon on a street running through a quiet, tree-lined residential neighborhood, protesters have converged on Ferguson, casting a spotlight on area racial tensions.

Anger over the shooting brought thousands of protesters into the streets of Ferguson, and triggered nightly clashes from Sunday through Wednesday with police officers in riot gear.

Civil rights groups have complained that Brown's death is the latest in a long history of racial profiling and harassment by police, and discriminatory arrests.

Some residents saw the police report on the robbery as the latest example of the pattern.

""This is how the police operate here, they always defame the name of the victim,"" said area resident Arthur Austin, 39. ""The more I hear, the less I trust what the police are saying.""

RALLY ON SUNDAY

A Brown family attorney said it appeared to be Brown in the convenience store's security-camera footage, which showed the teenager shoving a store clerk during an apparent robbery. Dorian Johnson, the friend who was with Brown that day, told the FBI and Justice Department officials about the robbery this week, his lawyer said.

Anthony Gray, a Brown family attorney, said the talk of a robbery was ""unfair"" to the family and a ""distraction"" raised by police. He said the real issue was why Wilson shot an unarmed Brown as the teenager held his arms in the air in a sign of surrender, as two witnesses described.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the civil rights group National Action Network, which is paying for Brown's funeral, issued a statement on Friday condemning what he called a ""smear campaign"" against the teenager.

Sharpton said he would lead a rally in Ferguson on Sunday with Brown's family, who expressed outrage at the police report in a statement on Twitter.

""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender,"" the statement said.

According to the account given by Jackson and the police reports his department released, police received a call about the robbery and an ensuing altercation with a clerk at 11:51 a.m. on Aug. 9. A suspect description went out over police radio.

Officer Wilson left a prior call he was on and then encountered Brown at 12:01 p.m. Three minutes later Wilson had fatally shot Brown, and other officers and an ambulance were dispatched to the scene, Jackson said.

Wilson, who has been put on paid administrative leave, has been shielded from the public since the incident. A lone police car sat outside Wilson's single-story brick house on Friday, and neighbors posted signs on their doors asking to be left alone. One neighbor said Wilson had not been seen for days.

Another posted a sign on their door that read simply: ""We don't know anything. Pray for peace.""

The police version that has thus far been provided of Brown's shooting differs markedly from witness accounts, including that of his friend Johnson.

In their earlier account, police said Brown reached into the patrol car and struggled with Wilson before the officer pulled his service gun and shot Brown multiple times. Wilson sustained a facial injury, which was treated in a hospital, they said.

But Johnson and one other witness have said that Brown was trying to get away from the officer, who tried to grab him after telling him to move off the street and onto a sidewalk.

Brown held up his hands in a sign of surrender but was shot several times, they said.

Police have acknowledged that Brown's body was more than 30 feet away (nine meters) from the police car when he collapsed and died and that multiple shell casings were found at the scene.

Yahoo,yahoo71,https://www.yahoo.com/news/legal-cop-shoot-194600452.html,Was it legal for Daren Wilson to shoot Michael Brown?,Dara Lind,08/15/14,04/21/16,"On August 15, six days after the death of Michael Brown, the Ferguson Police Department {finally identified}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6005675/ferguson-police-department-releases-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael”> the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson.

The department {also released documents}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6005809/ferguson-police-say-michael-brown-was-a-robbery-suspect”>  about the circumstances of the shooting — suggesting that Brown was the primary suspect in a ""strong-arm robbery"" of a convenience store shortly before Wilson encountered him.

But the documents released on Friday don't automatically exonerate Wilson. Even if a robbery did take place, it's still possible that the police officer could be charged with murder or another crime for shooting Brown. And even if Wilson isn't charged with a crime, it's still possible he could be fired.

All of those things depend on the outcome of a criminal investigation currently being conducted by the St. Louis County Police Department (at the request of the Ferguson police).

That investigation is supposed to collect {all the facts about what happened}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-shooting-facts-details”> : There's the story Wilson gave the St. Louis County police on the weekend of the shooting, which is that Brown initiated a violent confrontation and tried to grab his gun. There's the conflicting story told by eyewitnesses, which is that Brown was shot twice while facing the officer with his hands up. There's also forensic evidence that could show which of those stories is true.

Once all of that is taken into account, it's up to St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch to determine whether a crime was committed, and it's on the police department to determine whether the officer should be fired.

So what are the standards by which Wilson will be judged for killing Michael Brown? There are plenty of guidelines for use of force by police, but it often boils down to what the officer believed when the force was used — something that is notoriously difficult to quantify — regardless of how much of a threat actually existed. We talked to two experts to break down the fraught issue.

How do you determine if a police officer was justified in using deadly force?

When a police officer shoots and kills someone on the job, there's a two-track investigation. That's because there are actually two different sets of standards that govern when a police officer can use deadly force.

One set of standards is state law, informed by a couple of Supreme Court precedents that lay out the circumstances under which law enforcement officers are justified in using lethal force on suspects.

The other set of standards is the policy of the officer's police department, which tells its employees when it is and isn't appropriate for them to use force. If a police officer were to murder someone in cold blood while on the job, he wouldn't just be breaking the law — he'd be violating his equivalent of an employee handbook.

So when a cop uses deadly force in an officer-involved shooting, there's a standard criminal investigation: detectives collect evidence and present it to the local prosecutor. The prosecutor then determines whether the shooting fits the standards in state law for permissible homicide. If it doesn't, then a crime has been committed, and the prosecutor's job becomes figuring out which crime it was and whether there's enough evidence to charge the officer with it.

But there's also an internal investigation within the cop's department to evaluate whether the incident violated their use-of-force policy. Many departments' policies are stricter than state law — but an officer can't be charged with a crime just for violating the policy. He or she can, however, be fired for it.

In Ferguson, the St. Louis County Police Department is conducting the criminal investigation. After collecting the facts, they'll then pass their report to the prosecutor, McCulloch, who'll decide whether a crime was committed.

David Klinger, a University of Missouri-St. Louis professor who studies use of force, said he assumes their report will also be the basis of the internal investigation within the Ferguson police department. After St. Louis County gives the Ferguson police the results of their investigation, Klinger says, ""the Ferguson chief will either do it himself or convene a group to make a determination about whether the use of deadly force was consistent with Ferguson policy.""

The FBI is also conducting an investigation into Brown's death and the events in Ferguson. But the FBI is evaluating whether or not the police violated civil-rights law — which is a different question from whether or not Wilson was justified in killing him.

The legal standards governing justifiable force

In the 1980s, a pair of Supreme Court decisions set up a framework for determining when deadly force by cops is reasonable. Those decisions have governed how state laws are applied. Furthermore, many agencies simply use identical standards to the Supreme Court's for their own use-of-force policies — though some departments don't let officers use deadly force even when the Court decisions say they'd be allowed to.

Constitutionally, ""police officers are allowed to shoot under two circumstances,"" says Klinger. The first circumstance is ""to protect their life or the life of another innocent party"" — what departments call the ""defense-of-life"" standard. The second circumstance is to prevent a suspect from escaping, but only if the officer has probable cause to think the suspect's committed a serious violent felony.

The logic behind the second circumstance, says Klinger, comes from a Supreme Court decision called Tennessee vs.Garner. That case involved a pair of police officers who shot a 15-year-old boy as he fled from a burglary. (He'd stolen $10 and a purse from a house.) The Court ruled that cops couldn't shoot every felon who tried to escape. But, as Klinger says, ""they basically say that the job of a cop is to protect people from violence, and if you've got a violent person who's fleeing, you can shoot them to stop their flight.""

Some police departments' policies only allow deadly force in the first circumstance: defense of life. Others have policies that also allow deadly force to prevent escape in certain cases, within the limits of the Supreme Court decision.

Does the convenience store robbery matter?

The question of what counts as a violent felony might be crucial in the investigation of Brown's death. The Ferguson Police Department says that Wilson was dispatched to track down two people who committed a ""strong-arm robbery"" of a convenience store, and that Brown was the primary suspect in that robbery.

It might then be up to the investigators and county prosecutor McCulloch to decide whether a strong-arm robbery counts as a violent felony — if they decide it does, that will go some way towarda legal justification for Wilson's action.

On the other hand, Wilson would only be able to claim that he was justified if Brown was fleeing — which eyewitnesses say he wasn't.

""Objectively reasonable""

The police report of the robbery says that the suspect shoved the store clerk twice, and stood over him aggressively. That doesn't sound violent enough to pose a threat to an officer with a gun. But it's not clear how much Wilson knew about the robbery, other than that it was ""strong-arm."" And the question isn't whether Brown actually posed a threat to Wilson -- it's whether it was ""reasonable"" for Wilson to think he did.

The key to both of the legal standards -- defense-of-life and fleeing a violent felony -- is that it doesn't matter whether there is an actual threat when force is used. Instead, what matters is the officer's ""objectively reasonable"" belief that there is a threat.

That standard comes from the other Supreme Court case that guides use-of-force decisions: Graham v. Connor. This was a civil lawsuit brought by a man who'd survived his encounter with police officers, but who'd been treated roughly, had his face shoved into the hood of a car, and broken his foot — all while he was suffering a diabetic attack. The Court didn't rule on whether the officers' treatment of him had been justified, but it did say that the officers couldn't justify their conduct just based on whether their intentions were good. They had to demonstrate that their actions were ""objectively reasonable,"" given the circumstances and compared to what other police officers might do.

There are plenty of cases in which an officer might be legally justified in using deadly force because he feels threatened, even though there's no threat actual threat there. Klinger gives the example of a suspect who has is carrying a realistic-looking toy gun. That example bears a resemblance to the shooting death of {James Crawford}<hyperlink=”http://cleveland.cbslocal.com/2014/08/07/family-man-shot-by-police-at-wal-mart-was-carrying-toy-rifle/”> , an Ohio man who was killed by police last week while carrying a toy rifle in Wal-Mart.

Hypothetically, if the gun looked real, Klinger says, ""the officer's life was not in fact in jeopardy, but that would be an appropriate use of force. Because a reasonable officer could have believed that that was a real gun."" In fact, toy gun manufacturers — including the maker of the air rifle Crawford had — have started using this standard to limit their liability, putting on a warning label that tells consumers police could mistake their products for real guns.

Walter Katz, a California attorney who specializes in oversight of law enforcement agencies — particularly during use-of-force investigations — points out that it's hard to determine whether an officer's fear is reasonable because the decision to shoot is so fast.

""Officer-involved shootings happen extremely quickly. Usually, the point from where the officer believes he has to use deadly force to the point where he uses deadly force — where he pulls the trigger — is about two seconds."" That can make it much harder for investigators to decide whether or not the officer was reasonable in thinking he had to shoot. (The police records indicate that three minutes after Wilson encountered Brown, Brown was dead.)

That puts a lot of weight on an officer's immediate instincts in judging who's dangerous. And those immediate instincts are where implicit bias could creep in — believing that a young black man is a threat, for example, even if he is unarmed.

But each use of deadly force does have to be evaluated separately to determine if it was justified. ""The moment that you no longer present a threat, I need to stop shooting,"" said Klinger. According to the St. Louis County Police Department's account, Wilson fired one shot from inside the police car. But Brown was killed some 25 feet away, after several shots had been fired. To justify the shooting, Wilson would need to demonstrate that he feared for his life, or thought Brown was fleeing, not just when Brown was by the car, but even after he started shooting. The officer would need to establish that, right up until the last shot was fired, he felt Brown continued to pose a threat to him, or a threat to flee, whether he actually was or not.

""There's a difference between the moment you cease to be a threat and the moment I perceive that you ceased to be a threat,"" says Klinger. And Katz points out that if an officer has been assaulted and the suspect runs away, the officer's threat assessment is probably going to be shaped by having just been assaulted. But, Katz says, ""one can't just say, 'Because I could use deadly force ten seconds ago, that means I can use deadly force again now.'""

How to tell if an investigation is thorough and objective

When Katz evaluates an investigation of an officer-involved shooting, what he looks for ""is really twofold. Number one, in the microscopic analysis: what happened? The more macroscopic question: how is the agency asking and answering the question of what happened? Is the investigation thorough, and is it objective?""

Katz and Klinger both run through a list of ways they'd expect investigators to gather evidence. Investigators should look for any video or still camera footage available: from a camera in the officer's car or nearby surveillance cameras.

They should also be using physical evidence to corroborate the accounts of witnesses. In cases where the eyewitness accounts contradict the officer's account, such as the Brown shooting, physical evidence can tell investigators who's telling the truth. If the victim has powder burns on his hands, for example, it means he was grabbing the officer's gun when it fired. If the bullet wounds show that the bullets hit a hard surface and bounced back into the body, that means the victim was almost certainly shot when he was on the ground. The St. Louis County prosecutor's office announced on Tuesday that the results of the autopsy on Michael Brown's body would not be released to the public — meaning that the public won't know whether the forensic evidence validates eyewitnesses who say that Brown was killed while facing Wilson and holding his hands in the air. That's especially important because, if Wilson claims he shot Brown for fleeing a violent felony, the forensic evidence could establish whether Brown was still likely to flee as Wilson continued to shoot.

Even though physical evidence can prove eyewitness accounts wrong, interviewing civilian witnesses is important — and, Katz says, it's important that investigators do it ""in a manner that seems the investigating agency is interested in the truth.""  (Professionally, Katz would have access to recordings of interviews if he were evaluating a case; the public doesn't.)

When investigators don't have any physical evidence that tells them who's telling the truth, the trustworthiness of the witnesses becomes crucial. ""If I've got Officer X and Officer X is a knucklehead, and the citizen who gives the statement has a pristine record,"" says Klinger, ""the weight's probably going to be toward the witness. If the witness is a six-time loser who's on active parole for shooting three people and beating his wife, and the officer has a clean record,"" the officer will probably be seen as more credible. (Wilson is a six-year veteran of the Ferguson police with no record of misconduct.)

But both Klinger and Katz urge that it's not the job of the investigators to decide who's credible — much less to decide that someone's not credible enough to interview at all. Investigators are just supposed to present the facts and witness accounts to the prosecutor and the department, and let them make their own decisions.

So if a police department is neglecting to interview eyewitnesses, that's a reason for concern. Katz also says that the public should be looking at the public statements the police department conducting the investigation is making — whether they focus on the need to continue to interview witnesses and gather evidence, or ""make it seem like they're adopting the officer's version of events.""

When St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar gave a press conference on Sunday morning, he did say that his department would be investigating what happened after Brown left the officer's car. But he maintained that Brown had assaulted the officer (later identified as  Wilson) while in the car, and grabbed the officer's gun. In fact, the only reason the public knows Wilson's version of the story at all is because it was told to the press by the head of the department conducting the investigation. And Dorian Johnson, the young man who was with Michael Brown when he was killed, told {MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”>  via his attorney Monday that the police haven't asked to speak to him. ({On Wednesday,}<hyperlink=”http://m.stltoday.com/online/ferguson-statement-on-brown-shooting-call-for-daylight-only-protests/pdf_2dd60ce0-1834-52db-b948-ec38f4c528ee.html?mobile_touch=true”>  Johnson finally met with police.)

According to the advice laid out by Katz, both Belmar's public statements and the fact that an eyewitness wasn't interviewed until several days after the shooting are good reasons to be less confident that it's going to be an objective investigation.

The importance of public confidence

Is it ever possible for cops to be objective in evaluating something a fellow officer has done? Klinger says that it is. ""Police officers who are reviewing their fellows know something the average person doesn't know, and that is what it's like to be on the street and be confronted with these difficult circumstances where you have to make split-second decisions. And in that regard, the officer might be getting a break because he is being judged literally by a jury of his peers."" But he says it could easily go the other way: ""those other officers are in good standing to call him on his BS and go 'This is not how any reasonable officer would have behaved.'""

Katz looks at the problem a different way. The key, he says, is whether the public has confidence that the investigation is being conducted objectively. ""When it comes to officer-involved shootings, confidence is the only currency which that agency has — that the public has confidence that it is going to be an objective and fair and transparent investigation. Once that confidence is lost, people will not trust the outcomes.""

In Ferguson, the public reaction to Brown's death makes it pretty clear that residents don't have a great amount of trust in the investigation. They definitely don't trust the St. Louis County police, who were the most visible agency shooting tear-gas canisters and rubber bullets at them in the days of protests after Brown was killed. In fact, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon believed the county police were escalating the situation so much thst he pulled them out of Ferguson and placed state troopers in charge of responding to protesters. But the county is still running the investigation.

In such a tense environment, how the investigation unfolds, and whether the St. Louis County Police Department can conduct it objectively, will be an important factor in whether peace in Ferguson can last. Residents will continue to be angry with police, even to the point of civil unrest, if they can't be confident that the cops are trying.

Yahoo,yahoo72,https://www.yahoo.com/news/riot-erupts-following-shooting-death-unarmed-black-teen-050037811.html,FBI probes killing of black Missouri teen; mom urges non-violence,Jason McLure,08/11/14,04/21/16,"The mother of a black teenager from suburban St. Louis who was shot to death by police over the weekend begged for non-violence on Monday in the wake of riots, as the FBI opened a probe into the racially charged case.

Michael Brown, 18, was shot to death in the mostly black suburb of Ferguson, Missouri on Saturday afternoon after what police said was a struggle with a gun in a police car.

A witness in the case told local media that Brown had raised his arms to police to show that he was unarmed before being killed.

""He just graduated and was on his way to college,"" said Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, speaking through tears at a news conference. She said her first-born son's first day back at school would have been Monday.

""We can't even celebrate,"" she said.

Brown's family has hired Benjamin Crump, the attorney who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager who was shot to death by a community watch volunteer in 2012.

The FBI opened a concurrent federal inquiry into the case intended to supplement the main investigation by St. Louis County police, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

It was not immediately clear from police why Brown was in the police car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.

OFFICER NOT IDENTIFIED

The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, police said. The officer's race has not been disclosed.

Dorian Johnson told television station KMOV that he and Brown had been walking when an officer confronted them, drew a weapon and shot. Johnson said that Brown put his hands in the air and started to get down, but the officer kept shooting.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said there was plenty of physical evidence and eyewitness testimony. ""I really believe we can get to the truth of what happened here,"" he said.

Demonstrations to call for justice for Brown turned violent Sunday night, with crowds breaking the windows of cars and stores, setting a building on fire and looting shops. At least two dozen businesses were damaged, 32 people were arrested, and two police officers were injured.

Hundreds of demonstrators gathered at the town's police station on Monday to demand murder charges against the officer responsible for the shooting. Police arrested up to 15 people on Monday during the mostly peaceful demonstration in which protesters put their hands in the air as if surrendering and chanted ""Stop the killer cops.""

Brown's mother said her son had been planning to study heating and air conditioning repair at a technical college.

Michael Brown, Sr., the teen's father, told reporters his son was ""silly"" and ""could make you laugh.""

""We need justice for our son,"" he said.

Three of the Ferguson Police Department's 53 members are black, Jackson said. About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures.

Ferguson's median household income is $37,517, less than the Missouri average of $47,333.

Most of the communities around Ferguson have gone from white to mostly black in the last 40 years, said Terry Jones, political science professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis.

""There's a long history of racial injustice,"" said Jones. ""Slowly and not so surely, the St. Louis metropolitan area has been trying to figure out a way forward. As the Michael Brown shooting indicates, there are often setbacks.""

The email was sent by Charles ""Chuck"" Murray, who says he is the director of the New Empire Knights in South Carolina.

{The email was obtained by Hatewatch, a blog by the Southern Poverty Law Center}<hyperlink=”https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/08/13/kkk-raising-money-police-officer-who-shot-african-american-teen”>:

We are setting up a reward/fund for the police officer who shot this thug. He is a hero! We need more white cops who are anti-Zog and willing to put Jewish controlled black thugs in their place. Most cops are cowards and do nothing while 90% of interracial crime is black (and non-white) on white."" 

It's not surprising that an organization known for their hatred of African Americans would unequivocally support a white police officer who has killed one, as the Klan demonizes the black community as a threat to law and order. However, this grab for publicity and fundraising was distasteful even to others in the Klan. Other top officials affiliated with the Klan are not supporting the effort, causing a rift within the community.

The fundraising email is actually in violation of the traditional Klan constitution, according to another Imperial Wizard, Frank Ancona. Ancona leads the Traditionalist American Knights, one of the largest branches of the KKK, approaching 10,000 members in the lower 48 states. Their headquarters are in Missouri. 

There are a lot of these little fragmented groups, and when you kick someone out for bad behavior, once someone is kicked out, we call it a banishment, they can decide they want to start their own thing.""

The KKK is split into many smaller subdivisions, explained Ancona, and often times, banished members of a larger branch will attempt to start their own. Ancona believes this is the case with Murray, who is not even known to the Traditionalist American Knights. 

""He basically made up his own name,"" Ancona said, explaining that Murray may not even be on his birth certificate. ""We are a registered organization. We have a charter with the state... Half of them don’t have the rituals for our ceremonies."" 

Ancona worked with senior members of his organization to attempt to find Murray and confirm his connection to the larger group, but they could not. ""No one has ever heard of the guy, I talked to the older members of our group,"" he said. ""There are other legitimate Klan organizations, but this group here sprang out in the last year or so I don't believe he has any members. I think it's just him.""

Additionally, Ancona believes Murray's fundraising effort is a scam, because technically, members of the Klan cannot speak with the media, let alone solicit their help with raising donations. All members sign an agreement that forbids conversations with the press. Only highly vetted officials interact with reporters, and even then, interviews are rare. 

""This is not even a Klan member, they don't even have their own legitimate website. It’s a scam, he is just trying to capitalize on the situation,"" said Ancona. ""The Klan is not out soliciting money. We do ask for donations from members for different events, we have dues, but this is not the case here."" 

Murray's Wordpress avatar. 

However, Ancona is not ruling out supporting Wilson in some other way. When asked if Ancona's chapter of the Klan would consider helping the officer, he said he would have to consider all of the facts, as they become available. ""Maybe we will do something to assist, once the justice system does its diligence. We may help around his home,"" Ancona offered. ""We are sitting here waiting to see what the prosecutor comes up with. Will this goes to a grand jury? Will they indict him? We would like to look at what they're charging him with, what the police report says, to see what’s going on, and then we will decide if we will help him.""

Having said that, Ancona has already been sharing tweets online {that would attempt to exonerate Wilson}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/KKKOfficial311/status/501390295657758720”>, and seems inclined to believe the shooting was justified. ""From what I have seen, from a witness account, if that’s true, that’s what [Wilson] had to do in that situation.""

While this larger group of Klan members does not currently have plans to formally support Wilson, they say the Missouri headquarters has already received calls for assistance from within Ferguson. Ancona said that a number of members are on the ground there. He said that they are ""patrolling neighborhoods where people are concerned and reporting to law enforcement in regards to what they are seeing."" Members have been instructed not to wear their regalia in public or protest.

Some store owners also requested the Klan's assistance in protecting stores from looting. Ancona would not disclose which particular neighborhoods or stores are being watched by Klan members ""for their safety.""

For his part, Charles Murray – who would not disclose how many Klan members were under his leadership — offered only this comment to The Wire, ""I could care less what another Imperial Wizard said. The KKK has raised funds. We have already raised nearly $1,200.""

Police have not disclosed the name of the man who was killed, but family members say it was 18-year-old Michael Brown.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference that an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and the struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where one of the two people was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known, but ""It was more than just a couple."" He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the man who was shot was unarmed.

Jackson said police are in contact with the second person who was involved in the altercation, but that the person has not been arrested or charged and is expected to be interviewed later Sunday. Authorities aren't sure if the second person was unarmed, Jackson said.

During the news conference, which was held in a separate building, some protesters walked into the Ferguson Police Department chanting ""don't shoot me"" and holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase and stopped the crowd without using force.

Others outside shouted ""We want answers"" and ""no justice, no peace,"" and some carried signs saying ""stop police terrorism"" and ""disarm the police.""

The St. Louis County Police are in charge of the investigation. On Saturday, John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, said the FBI should get involved ""to protect the integrity of the investigation."" And State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch she would ask the U.S. Justice Department on Monday for a formal investigation.

Gaskin alluded to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, as well as the New York man who died from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes.

""With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,"" Gaskin said.

The officer has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years and that he wasn't aware of other issues involving the man, Belmar said. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is a common procedure after officer-involved shootings.

After the news conference, several protesters yelled at the officers who surrounded the crowd.

""I don't want you killing my child just because he walked out the door,"" Shontell Walters, of Ferguson, said.

Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, said Saturday she saw him in her neighborhood, and minutes later, she heard a commotion and went outside. She found Brown's body less than two blocks away.

""My grandson never even got into a fight,"" she said of Brown, who she added had recently graduated high school. ""He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.""

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, had harsh words Saturday for authorities.

""You're not God, you don't get to decide when you get to take somebody from here,"" she told KSDK.

Yahoo,yahoo75,https://www.yahoo.com/news/nation-fergusons-why-americas-police-230003910.html,Why America's police forces look like invading armies,Amanda Taub,08/09/14,04/21/16,"Americans have been watching in shock as images come out of Ferguson, Missouri that look more like the streets of a conflict zone in Iraq or a crackdown in China than a quiet suburb of Saint Louis. Protesters began to gather in the town of 21,000 after Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by a police officer on the afternoon of Saturday, August 9th.  The gatherings on Saturday were reportedly quiet and non-violent, but the police immediately responded with overwhelming force, sending 100 officers to the vigil being held at the apartment complex where Brown was killed.

Since then, police have used heavily militaristic equipment and tactics, including armored vehicles, officers in full combat gear, tear gas, and rifles with rubber bullets. Images from Ferguson have prompted several observers to note that the response was as heavily armed as actual military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Protesters and journalists alike have found themselves in the line of fire, including an {eight-year-old}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5988925/mike-brown-killing-shooting-case-ferguson-police-riots-st-louis#Sunday17”> boy who was caught in a cloud of tear gas, and a {reporter}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5988925/mike-brown-killing-shooting-case-ferguson-police-riots-st-louis#Monday18”> from First Look media, who was shot with rubber bullets and bean bags by police, and then arrested.

Although shocking, what is happening in Ferguson is merely a particularly severe example of a much broader and long-running phenomenon: the militarization of police weaponry and tactics in the US. In part thanks to federal programs that provide military equipment to local police (though not military training), and encourage its use as part of ordinary law enforcement, police are increasingly using SWAT-style tactics in routine policing. However, experts say, this phenomenon is extremely dangerous, and can make otherwise peaceful situations dangerous — as police appear to have done in Ferguson.

Federal programs have been funneling heavy military gear into American police forces since the early 1990s

If the gear in photos from Ferguson look like military equipment, that's probably because a lot of it is military equipment. Officers have been patrolling the streets in combat fatigues and full body armor, carrying rifles that an ex-Marine {described in Business Insider}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8”> as ""short-barreled 5.56 mm rifles based on the military M4 carbine."" They have also deployed MRAPs, tank-like armored trucks built by the military to withstand land mines and IEDs in Iraq, and have made heavy use of tear gas, including in residential areas.

That's happening thanks to the United States military. The Department of Defense Excess Property Program, usually known as the ""1033 program,"" distributes surplus military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies for use in counter-terrorism and counter-narcotic activities. Put another way, this means that the US military is giving its weapons to cities and states, with the express intention they be used on American citizens, in the course of local police work.

""It allows police departments to get pretty much any equipment that they want from the defense department,"" Kara Dansky, who studies the program for the American Civil Liberties Union, told me. ""We've seen across the country police departments getting some pretty heavy weaponry that was built and designed for use in combat overseas, and using that equipment domestically.""

The 1033 program's roots lie in the drug war — hence the counter-narcotics impetus. It was originally created in 1990, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, which authorized the Pentagon to transfer military equipment to local law enforcement if it was ""suitable for use in counter-drug activities."" In the wake of the September 11th attacks, the program's focus has expanded to include counter-terrorism activities as well.

While the 1033 program's intent may have been to equip specialized units for extreme, dangerous situations, fighting al-Qaeda sleeper cells or powerful drug cartels, the effect has been to incorporate SWAT-style raids into ordinary police operations. That includes, but is certainly not limited to, the serving of search warrants. This may partly be because the program requires that all equipment issued through the 1033 program be used within one year of the date it is granted. That means that if police departments want to keep their new gear, they can't wait for a rare emergency like an active shooter or hostage situation in order to use it.

It is likely that the 1033 program is the source of some of the equipment being used in the streets of Ferguson. In the past two years alone, according to a {list}<hyperlink=”http://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537”> obtained by Newsweek, the 1033 program has provided St. Louis County law enforcement agencies with vehicles, gun sights, night vision equipment, an explosive ordinance robot, and more.

Other federal programs add to the effect. The Edward R. Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program gives state and local governments funds to improve the functioning of their criminal justice systems and to enforce drug laws. Most of that money goes to law enforcement, including weapons purchases. ""In 2012-2013,"" the ACLU reports, ""state and local agencies used JAG funds to purchase hundreds of lethal and less-lethal weapons, tactical vests, and body armor.""

Likewise, the Department of Homeland Security has programs like the State Homeland Security Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative that provide money to police but requires they spend at least 25 percent on ""terrorism prevention-related law enforcement activities.""

Police get military equipment, but not training — making the gear even more dangerous

All this equipment is provided to police departments with little accompanying training or supervision. The ACLU's Kara Dansky, who {authored their report}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/report/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-police?redirect=criminal-law-reform/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-police-report”> on the rising militarization of law enforcement, said that she was ""not aware of any training that the government provides in terms of use of the equipment,"" or of ""any oversight in terms of safeguards regarding the use of the equipment by the Defense Department.""

The program does have some safeguards, Dansky said, but they tend to focus on tracking the equipment itself, to prevent police departments from illegally selling it second-hand.

The lack of formal training, or often even full documentation, leaves police departments to improvise. That can be true in police departments of all sizes that receive military equipment, but smaller departments can be especially susceptible to poor or limited training.

When the ACLU asked officials in the town of Farmington, Missouri (less than a 90 minute drive from Ferguson) to provide a copy of training materials for its Special Response Team, which is roughly like a SWAT team, the town sent only a copy of a single article. The article warned that ""preparations for attacks on American schools that will bring rivers of blood and staggering body counts are well underway in Islamic training camps,"" and went on to say that ""because of our laws we can't depend on the military to help us ... By law, you the police officer are our Delta Force.""

In contrast, SWAT programs in larger cities tend to train extensively, and constantly. The Los Angeles police department's SWAT teams go through months of intensive training before being brought on, and once there spend at least fifty percent of their on-duty time training, former LAPD Deputy Police Chief Stephen Downing told me.

It is effectively impossible, Downing suggested, for small police departments to appropriately train their officers in the use of SWAT-style equipment, because they simply do not have sufficient resources or personnel. Small departments simply do not have the resources to support that type of program, but they do have the guns and trucks and armor, which they use.

Training does a lot more than just tell people how to safely use the equipment. It teaches them when and how to responsibly bring that gear into tense situations, like the one in Ferguson, in a way that will de-escalate tensions rather than escalate them, and how a police officer should change his or her behavior when upgrading from a regular uniform and sidearm to camo fatigues and an assault rifle.

""When cops, just like other human beings, are frightened - and sometimes they are! - there's a tendency to act impulsively. Which is to say: to do exactly the opposite of what they need to be doing,"" former Seattle police chief Norman Stamper told me. That risk is heightened significantly when cops roll heavy equipment into suburban streets.

""That's a function of training,"" Stamped explained. ""That's on individual cops to be sure, but it's also on the organization itself. You should ask, have you trained your officers? Have you helped them develop psychological resilience and the kind of emotional heartiness that is necessary to keep cool and calm even in the face of provocation?""

Militarizing police often makes tense situations more dangerous, not less

SWAT teams and other specialized police units are deployed at inappropriate times, in inappropriate ways, or with insufficient training, they can escalate conflict unnecessarily, putting both officers and civilians in greater danger. The overreach in Ferguson is just one example of a broader trend of SWAT teams and military equipment being used as part of ordinary police operations — often with tragic results.

Stamper, Seattle's Chief of Police during the 1999 WTO riots, explained that his decision to use heavy-handed tactics against protesters then was the ""worst mistake of my career."" This police response, Stamper now believes, was ""the catalyst for heightened tension"" and a significant reason the situation escalated out of control.

In Seattle, the police department went out dressed in full body armor and gas masks that made them look ""like ninjas,"" and used tear gas against largely-peaceful protesters.  Stamper now believes that putting officers on the streets in military gear from the beginning was ""an act of provocation,"" and that keeping officers in their normal uniforms would have been ""a huge step in the right direction towards de-escalation.""

""It's a lesson, unfortunately, that American law enforcement in general has not learned,"" said Stamper. Indeed, it is easy to see the parallels between recent police operations in Ferguson this past week and the tactics used in Seattle in 1999, with armored police showing up in overwhelming numbers in response to largely-peaceful protests.  ""Had you set out to make matters worse,"" says Stamper, ""you couldn't have done a better job.""

The ACLU's {report}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf”> on police militarization documents numerous incidents in which innocent people were injured or killed by SWAT teams during the execution of warrants — an activity SWAT teams were never intended to be used for in the first place.

It's not hard to see how a bunch of heavily armed cops who have not been adequately trained might make mistakes. Eurie Stamp, a grandfather of 12, was shot and killed when SWAT officers raided his home in search of a suspect who had actually already been arrested. 19 month-old Bou Bou Phonesavanh went into a medically-induced coma after a SWAT team threw a flashbang grenade into his crib. The grenade blew a hole in his face and chest, leaving a wound so deep his ribs were exposed, and covering his body in third degree burns. (The baby has since awoken from his coma, but the county is {refusing to pay}<hyperlink=”http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/lawyer-county-refuses-pay-medical-bills-toddler-hu/137524203”> his medical bills.) 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones was also hit by a flashbang grenade while sleeping, then shot by a SWAT team member who fired a single shot as he entered her home.

Experienced law-enforcement officers have long warned against deploying SWAT teams too aggressively and frequently. Downing, the former LAPD chief, co-authored a paper urging police department to learn that, ""The SWAT teams, their vehicles, armor, and weapons systems have a specific purpose and should properly be restricted to only those high-risk incidents requiring extraordinary tactics and skills that exceed the capabilities and training of traditional first responders.""

""The one thing I would say is to reserve SWAT,"" Stamper stressed. ""Reserve that equipment and those tactics for active shooter cases, barricaded suspects, armed and dangerous barricaded suspects with hostages. Do not employ those tactics, that equipment on routine drug raids or warrants service, or any other situation where you don't have what I would consider to be inherently dangerous circumstances.""

Ferguson's crisis may have been driven, in part, when law enforcement indulged this same habit of over-using heavily armed police units, putting them into situations where their presence would escalate the situation rather than de-escalate it. Largely peaceful protests in Ferguson were quickly met with dramatic shows of force: camo-wearing police carrying assault rifles and aiming high-powered rifles from sniper positions atop mine-resistant armored vehicles.

This doesn't just militarize a suburban area and introduce a dangerous potential for accidents, it means that police are escalating the situation when their role, Stamper says, should be finding ways to de-escalate.

""Your mission is not to provoke, it is to de-escalate,"" he said, explaining that how police dress and arm themselves is a real part of that. ""I think it's so important to hold those kinds of weapons in reserve, and use them or show them only when you're dealing with a violent confrontation. Keeping the peace at a demonstration essentially means having police officers in standard everyday uniforms not military garb.""

There are signs that Ferguson law enforcement is finally making de-escalation a priority. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon {announced}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6003519/missouri-governor-announces-police-leadership-changes-in-ferguson/in/5757650”> on Thursday that law enforcement officials would take steps to ""begin the process of lowering the intensity of [police-community] interactions and potential risks,"" but it is not yet clear what that will involve.

When police dress like soldiers, they put the community at a distance and make actual policing harder

Experienced former law-enforcement officials I spoke to all emphasized that communication, rather than confrontation, was the best way to de-escalate a situation like the Ferguson protests in order to ensure community safety.

Ideally, Downing said, a police department would have a ""reservoir of good will"" in the community to rely on: established relationships with members of clergy and other local leaders who could assist with communication and conflict resolution during times of crisis. Standing behind an arsenal of military gear sends the opposite message, treating the community as an inherently hostile force to be suppressed, rather than as neighbors.

If that reservoir of good will is unavailable — as certainly seems may be the case in Ferguson — then it is still on law enforcement departments, the ex-officials said, to find a way to establish community trust. All emphasized that peace simply cannot be won by turning police into a military occupation force.

""Good police officers understand that they need to be hearing what is actually being said, listening actively to the concerns the grievances of the community, paraphrasing it and feeding it back, and saying okay, now what can we do jointly to address these problems?"" Stamper explained. It's not something that can be achieved with kevlar and MRAPs. ""It's a function of collaboration.""

The public has absorbed images of heavily armed police, snipers trained on protesters and tear gas plumes. Against that backdrop, Attorney General Eric Holder said that when police and citizens need to restore calm, ""I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.""

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said police responses like that in Ferguson have ""become the problem instead of the solution."" Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., said he will introduce legislation to curb the trend of police militarization.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his committee will review the program to determine if the Defense Department's surplus equipment is being used as intended.

One night after the violence that accompanied the presence of military-style equipment in Ferguson, tensions eased when a police captain, unprotected and shaking hands, walked through a crowd in a gesture of reconciliation. The contrast added to the perception that the tanks and tear gas had done more harm than good.

As the country concludes its longest wartime period, the military has turned over thousands of surplus weapons and armored trucks to local police who often trained alongside the military.

A report by the American Civil Liberties Union in June said police agencies had become ""excessively militarized,"" with officers using training and equipment designed for the battlefield on city streets. The report found the amount of goods transferred through the military surplus program rose in value from $1 million in 1990 to nearly $450 million in 2013.

""Every police force of any size in this country has access to those kinds of weapons now,"" said David Harris, a police expert at the University of Pittsburgh law school. ""It makes it more likely to be used (and) is an escalation all by itself.""

In Louisiana, masked police in full body armor carrying AR-15 assault rifles raided a nightclub without a warrant, looking not for terrorists but underage drinkers and fire-code violations. Officers in California train using the same counterinsurgency tactics as those used in Afghanistan.

""They're not coming in like we're innocent until proven guilty,"" said Quinn Eaker. SWAT teams last August raided his organic farm and community, the Garden of Eden, in Arlington, Texas. ""They're coming in like: 'We're gonna kill you if you move a finger.'""

Police found no drugs or weapons and filed no charges after their search, which authorities said followed standard procedure.

In 1990, Congress authorized the Pentagon to give surplus equipment to police to help fight drugs, which then gave way to the fight against terrorism. Though violent crime nationwide is at its lowest level in generations and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have largely concluded, the military transfers have increased.

Police say the equipment, which includes free body armor, night vision goggles and scopes, keeps officers safe and prepares them for the worst case.

""A lot evolved from the military, no question,"" said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Chief Bill McSweeney, who heads the detective division. ""Is it smart for them to use that stuff and perhaps look like soldiers from Iraq going into a place? Is that smart or over the top? I'd say generally that's smart. Now, if you use that every time a guy is writing bad checks, that's getting rather extreme.""

The U.S. has provided 610 mine-resistant armored trucks, known as MRAPs, across the country, nearly all since August 2013, including at least nine in Los Angeles County, according to Michelle McCaskill, a spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency.

In rural western Maine, the Oxford County Sheriff's Office asked for an MRAP. Cpl. George Cayer wrote in his request that Maine's western foothills face a ""previously unimaginable threat from terrorist activities.""

In Orange County, Florida, masked officers in tactical gear helped state inspectors raid barber shops in 2010 to find people cutting hair without a license. Using a mini battering ram and pry bar at times, police arrested dozens of people. Officials said they found illegal items such as drugs and a weapon.

McSweeney said it's hard to argue that police shouldn't use the best equipment available.

""It's tempting to say, 'Shouldn't we wear these things? Shouldn't we approach this as if we could get shot?'"" he said. ""How do you say no to that question?""

Nick Gragnani, executive director of the St. Louis Area Regional Response System, said such supplies have proved essential in hurricane relief efforts and other disaster responses.

""The shame of it will be ... if somebody does a brushstroke and takes out all the funding and then we can no longer be prepared for that big incident,"" he said.

The LAPD's deputy chief, Michael Downing, who heads the department's counterterrorism and special operations bureau, said officers are dealing with ""an adversary who is more sophisticated, more tactically trained.""

Downing emphasized that though police might train with soldiers, they're not warriors with a mission to kill but public servants with no ""enemies.""

""In police work there are times we have to become soldiers and control through force and fear,"" Downing said. ""But we have to come back to being a public servant as quick as we can to establish that normality and that ethical stature with communities, because they're the ones who give us the authority to do our police work.""

People could be seen carrying hubcaps out of an auto supply store. A shoe store also was looted, with police swarming into the store's parking lot. A QuikTrip convenience store was overrun, with people grabbing items and running out of the store, glass shattered and items strewn about the sidewalk.

A fire later broke out, destroying the QuikTrip store.

Other witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows in the St. Louis suburb.

Police in riot gear stood on the street, trying to keep the situation under control. Police dogs were also brought to the area.

The protests followed a candlelight vigil for Brown, who wasn’t armed when he was shot Saturday. At the vigil, people placed candles, flowers and a teddy bear at the exact location where Brown was killed. One group of young men broke off to spray paint ""R.I.P. Michael"" on the street.View gallery

Demonstrators held their hands up in protest -- reflecting a witness’s statements that Brown had his hands up when he was shot by police.

“No justice, no peace,” demonstrators yelled.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie A. Dooley called for a peaceful dispersal following Sunday’s protests.

“Just need people to keep calm and [disperse] so no one gets hurt,” Dooley wrote.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after an officer encountered two people -- one of whom was Brown — on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson.

Belmar said a struggle began inside the officer’s squad car and spilled into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Police later said at a news conference that they “cannot say” how many times the unarmed teen was struck.

""Was the other subject, the deceased, the 18-year-old, armed with a handgun or rifle or any type of weapon at the time? The answer to that is no,"" Belmar said.

The Ferguson police officer involved has been put on leave as St. Louis County Police investigate the incident.

St. Louis 21st Ward Alderman Antonio French -- who posted video of Sunday night’s frenzy online -- told ABC News that anger from the shooting ""boiled over,"" and that residents want a full investigation into Brown’s death.

“I think it's too many men, especially young, black men, who feel like, you know, that they don't have equal citizenship and that the relationship between them and the police is adversarial and that they're on the losing end, and that their lives are not valued,"" French said.

“We have a lot of work to do as a greater community, black and white, to come together to let these young men know that they are a part of the community and that we have a place for them.” 

Brown’s relatives remain stunned by the shooting.

The store owner argued with the man and when police arrived, he refused to let go of the knife. He then threatened two officers who fired on the suspect, killing him.

He was pronounced dead at the scene. No police officers were injured during the incident.

Police also say the suspect was acting ""erratically"" and according to some witnesses, told police to ""Shoot me. Kill me now."" The Wire spoke with legal expert Jens David Ohlin, who is a professor of law at the Cornell Law School. He explained that if, indeed, the suspect said ""Shoot me"" or ""kill me now"" this would be deemed ""death by cop."" ""When someone deliberately provokes a cop to get them to kill them, as kind of a suicide rather than killing themselves, that is death by cop.""

Crowds have already gathered at the site of the shooting, adding to an already tense and emotional atmosphere.

The law comes down on the side of the person defending their bodily integrity.' 

 Ohlin explained that the legality of this situation is murky, depending heavily on what the suspect was doing with the knife. ""If the police officer was in danger from the knife attack, he or she is permitted to use lethal force to repel the attack. Normally speaking, it is not permitted to use force against loss of property. You can't use deadly force to defend your property, but if he was wielding a knife and threatening to use it against the police officer, and the officer reasonably believed they couldn't disarm the individual using different means, it may have been appropriate to shoot him.""

Questions have arisen about the police officers ability to disarm the suspect, rather than killing him, and details remain few. Others have questioned why the officer did not choose to disarm him by shooting the suspect in the leg or arm: [tweetbegin 501808277207138304 tweetend]

Ohlin explained that police officers are actually trained not to shoot in the leg. Officers are taught two kinds of defensive force: ""non-lethal measures and lethal measures. Once it is appropriate for the police officer to fire their weapon, you are in the territory of lethal measures and it is justified to kill the individual.""  

The Wire's expert specifically addressed the concept of shooting someone in the leg, ""A lot of people have a popular misconception of 'Why didn't the officer shoot them in the leg?' It is neither part of their training or a requirement of the law. Once you are allowed to use lethal force to protect from the attack, you are entitled to kill the person. Police officers are trained to repel the attack. They are not trained to shoot people in the leg. Shooting someone in the leg will not repel the attack. You are either entitled to use legal force or you're not.""

Around 10 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday night, a St. Louis County police line demanded that a crowd of protesters turn off their cameras. Minutes earlier, the police had ordered what appeared to be a peaceful crowd to disperse, firing smoke grenades and rubber bullets. But none of them have to turn their cameras off.

Police have not disclosed the name of the man who was killed, but family members say it was 18-year-old Michael Brown.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference that an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and the struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where one of the two people was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known, but ""It was more than just a couple."" He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the man who was shot was unarmed.

Jackson said police are in contact with the second person who was involved in the altercation, but that the person has not been arrested or charged and is expected to be interviewed later Sunday. Authorities aren't sure if the second person was unarmed, Jackson said.

During the news conference, which was held in a separate building, some protesters walked into the Ferguson Police Department chanting ""don't shoot me"" and holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase and stopped the crowd without using force.

Others outside shouted ""We want answers"" and ""no justice, no peace,"" and some carried signs saying ""stop police terrorism"" and ""disarm the police.""

The St. Louis County Police are in charge of the investigation. On Saturday, John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, said the FBI should get involved ""to protect the integrity of the investigation."" And State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch she would ask the U.S. Justice Department on Monday for a formal investigation.

Gaskin alluded to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, as well as the New York man who died from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes.

""With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,"" Gaskin said.

The officer has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years and that he wasn't aware of other issues involving the man, Belmar said. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is a common procedure after officer-involved shootings.

After the news conference, several protesters yelled at the officers who surrounded the crowd.

""I don't want you killing my child just because he walked out the door,"" Shontell Walters, of Ferguson, said.

Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, said Saturday she saw him in her neighborhood, and minutes later, she heard a commotion and went outside. She found Brown's body less than two blocks away.

""My grandson never even got into a fight,"" she said of Brown, who she added had recently graduated high school. ""He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.""

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, had harsh words Saturday for authorities.

""Was the other subject, the deceased, the 18-year-old, armed with a handgun or rifle or any type of weapon at the time? The answer to that is no,"" said Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County Police Department, which was investigating the shooting by a Ferguson Police Department officer. Police have not disclosed the name of the teen.

""It started out, the genesis of this, was a physical confrontation,"" Belmar said.

The shooting Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, sparked outrage, which continued today as residents marched to police headquarters to demand answers.

People in a crowd of about 200 people outside the Ferguson Police Department shouted ""We want answers"" and ""no justice, no peace."" Some carried signs saying ""stop police terrorism"" and ""disarm the police.""

Belmar said today that the incident began with when the officer allegedly had an altercation with two people, one of whom he said assaulted him in his police car.

""It is our understanding at this point in the investigation that within the police car there was a struggle over the officer's weapon,"" Belmar said.

According to the police chief, the officer said he then got out of his vehicle and shot ""at a subject.""

""There were shell casings recovered. The shell casings are all matched to one weapon, that's the officer's weapon,"" Belmar said. ""There were more than a few shell casings recovered. I cannot say at this time how many times the subject was struck.""

The officer was able to get out of the car and the fatal shooting occurred approximately 35 feet from where the vehicle was parked.

Belmar was not able to say how many times the subject was struck by police fire, but that it was more than a couple of shots.

The chief said that it was not yet clear whether the other person allegedly involved in the confrontation was armed.

The medical examiner is conducting the investigation to determine how many times the young man was shot, Belmar said.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson contacted the St. Louis County police immediately after the shooting to have the St. Louis Police Department Crimes Investigation Force take over the investigation. He told the Associated Press that at least one shot was fired in the patrol car.

The officer who shot the 18-year-old has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years, and has not had any other issues since he has been on the force, Belmar said. His name has not been disclosed.

He will be interviewed extensively today and will have a physiological evaluation before returning to duty, the chief said. The officer is currently on paid administrative leave.

Jackson told The Associated Press that police have contacted the second person who was involved in the altercation with the officer before the shooting, but that the person has not been arrested or charged.

The local chapter of the NAACP has called for the {FBI}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/federal-bureau-of-investigation.htm”> to handle the investigation of the shooting. Belmar said that the FBI could become involved, but had not as of today.

For the fourth straight night, the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, erupted as heavily armed police officers fired tear gas, smoke bombs and rubber bullets at demonstrators protesting Brown's death.
The Missouri Highway Patrol seized control of the St. Louis suburb this morning, stripping local police of their law-enforcement authority after four days of clashes between officers in riot gear and furious crowds.

The intervention, ordered by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, came as President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting and the subsequent violence that has threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town that is nearly 70 percent black patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

Obama said there was ""no excuse"" for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.

Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening in the neighborhood where looters smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and police repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

The change was meant to ensure ""that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately,"" Nixon said.

""Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,"" the governor said at a news conference in the nearby community of Normandy.

Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who is black, said he grew up in the area and ""it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence."" He said he planned to keep heavily armoured vehicles away from the scene and told his officers not to bring their tear gas masks.
By late afternoon, Johnson was walking down the street with a group of more than 1000 protesters as they chanted ""Hands up, don't shoot"".

Johnson planned to talk to the demonstrators throughout the night.

""We're going to have some conversations with them and get an understanding of what's going on.""

While serving as a U.S. Marine on patrol in Afghanistan, we wore desert camouflage to blend in with our surroundings, carried rifles to shoot back when under enemy attack, and drove around in armored vehicles to ward off roadside bombs.
We looked intimidating, but all of our vehicles and equipment had a clear purpose for combat against enemy forces. So why is this same gear being used on our city streets?
On Saturday, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, an unarmed black man. In the days that have followed, the town with a population of about 21,000 has seen massive protests in response to the shooting, as some witnesses said Brown had his hands up when he was killed.
Putting aside what started the protests for a moment, it's worth discussing the police response to the outrage. In photos taken Monday, we are shown a heavily armed SWAT team.
They have short-barreled 5.56-mm rifles based {on the military M4 carbine}<hyperlink=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_carbine”>, with scopes that can accurately hit a target out to 500 meters. On their side they carry pistols. On their front, over their body armor, they carry at least four to six extra magazines, loaded with 30 rounds each.

I'm failing to see any scenario where telling the police to meet the protesters in military gear is a sign of good judgement.
When did this become OK? When did ""protect and serve"" turn into ""us versus them""?

Eighteen-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed Saturday afternoon near his grandmother's house by a Ferguson police officer. St. Louis County police have not given a reason for the shooting, which happened in a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.
After the shooting, a confrontation between police and hundreds of neighborhood residents lasted several hours, with shouts of ""kill the police."" At the height of the post-shooting tensions, police called for about 60 other units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents, about two-thirds of whom are black.
The St. Louis County Police are investigating the shooting. But John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, said the FBI should get involved ""to protect the integrity of the investigation.""
He alluded to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, as well as the New York man who died from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes.
""With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,"" Gaskin said.
State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that she would ask the U.S. Justice Department on Monday for a formal investigation.
Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, said she saw him running in her neighborhood Saturday afternoon. Just minutes later, she heard a commotion and went outside to check on it. She found Brown's body less than two blocks away.
""When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.""
Harris said her grandson had recently graduated high school and was looking forward to the future.
""My grandson never even got into a fight,"" she said. ""He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.""
Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, had harsh words Saturday for authorities: ""You're not God, you don't get to decide when you get to take somebody from here,"" she told KSDK.
Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told the Post-Dispatch that the officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave.

The two shots that hit Brown in the head were likely among the last that hit him and traveled from the back of his head to the front, indicating that Brown's head was tilted forward, either because he was bending over or falling over, forensic expert Dr. Michael Baden said at a news conference today. Brown had abrasions on his face from where he ""fell flat down unprotected,"" Baden said.
""The kill shot is right here, at the apex of his head,"" attorney Darrell Parks said.
A gunshot wound to his arm could show either that he was hit while walking away from the shooter with his back to the officer, or that he was facing the shooter with his arm up, either in a surrender position, defensive position, or other motion, Baden said.
Brown likely did not suffer, Baden said. The shot to the top of his head would have rendered him unconscious immediately, he said.
""Michael Brown's mom had the same question as any mother would have, which is was my child in pain?"" attorney Benjamin Crump said. ""And Dr. Baden shared with her in his opinion he did not suffer.""
""His mother also wanted to ask a question that neither Dr. Baden nor the lawyers could answer, which is what else do we need to give them to arrest the killer of my child?"" Crump said to applause in the church where the press conference was held.
The St. Louis County medical examiner's office confirmed that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and chest, and said that a toxicology report was complete. But the county medical examiner would not release any details from the autopsy or the toxicology report.
Baden said that in his experience, it calms the family and community to have the official autopsy report released right away after an incident.
""We found that the sooner the information goes out, the family is talked to, the family has a right to know how their loved one died, this calms the community and the family concerns over a cover up and not getting told truth,"" Baden said.
""There are very simple things that are found on day one of the autopsy, and the next day the autopsy report comes out to answer these types of questions, such as how many bullet wounds and most importantly did my loved one suffer,"" Baden said. ""We can answer those questions on day one.""
The autopsy was performed Sunday at the request of Brown’s family.
Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, was hired to perform the private autopsy along with Prof. Shaun Parcells for the Brown family after St. Louis County would not release the results of its autopsy.
The attorneys representing Brown's parents criticized the St. Louis authorities for not releasing autopsy results and said that the results show evidence that the shooting officer, Darren Wilson, should be arrested.
""There are two shots I want you to focus on today for my purpose because they show the bullets were moving in a back-to-front direction,"" family attorney Darrell Parks said. ""The kill shot is right here, at apex of his head, and it is a clear back-to-front position. The second shot to the head is a little dot right by his hairline and came out by the eye. That’s very important because it shows a back-to-front motion.""
""It supports what witnesses said about him trying to surrender, that he had his head in a downward position,"" Parks said. ""The officer needs to be arrested. Why would (Brown) be shot in the very top of his head? A 6-foot-4 man, it makes no sense. We believe those two things alone are ample evidence for the officer to be arrested.""
In addition to the two shots to the head, Brown was shot four times in the right arm and chest.
Attorney General {Eric Holder}<hyperlink=” http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/eric-holder.htm”> has ordered a federal medical examiner to perform a separate autopsy because of the circumstances surrounding the shooting.
The St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office has also conducted an autopsy, concluding that Brown died of gunshot wounds but releasing no details.
The shooting death of Brown has sparked riots and protests in the St. Louis suburb.

Baden conducted the autopsy on Sunday, according to the Times.
One bullet entered the top of Brown’s skull. Four struck him in the right arm. All bullets hit Brown in the front of the body, according to the autopsy.
According to Baden, the shots did not appear to have been fired at close range given the lack of gunpowder on Brown’s body. A further determination on gunpowder will have to be made after assessing the teen’s clothes.
Baden provided a diagram to the Times, which shows that the bullet that that struck Brown in the head entered while he was bent forward.
“It can be because he’s giving up, or because he’s charging forward at the officer,” Baden said.
Witnesses to the shooting have told the media that Brown was surrendering by crouching on the ground and holding his hands up as Wilson shot him. The autopsy undermines a common belief circulating among those who think Brown was executed that he was shot in the back as he ran from Wilson.
Nevertheless, Benjamin Crump, who is representing the Brown family, said that the autopsy reveals a “brazen disregard” for Brown.
“The sheer number of bullets and the way they were scattered all over his body showed this police officer had a brazen disregard for the very people he was supposed to protect in that community,” Crump told the Times.
Ferguson police have claimed that Wilson shot Brown after the teen punched him in the face during a struggle inside of the officer’s police cruiser. Wilson claimed that Brown tried to grab his service weapon.  
Earlier Sunday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal autopsy conducted on Brown. His family has said that it does not trust local law enforcement to conduct a thorough review.
The results of local law enforcement agencies’ autopsy have not been released.

(AP) — About 200 people are rallying outside of a suburban St. Louis police department to protest the death of a black teenager who was shot by police.
The crowd chanted ""We want answers"" and ""no justice, no peace,"" on Sunday morning before a police news conference.
Eighteen-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed Saturday afternoon near his grandmother's house by a Ferguson police officer.
St. Louis County police have not given a reason for the shooting, which happened in a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.
A few police officers came out of the building to observe the crowd, which carried signs saying ""stop police terrorism"" and ""disarm the police.""

Brown, who was African American, was shot multiple times and killed during a scuffle with a police officer Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis. Shell casings matched the officer's gun and he was placed on administrative leave, authorities said.
Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told ABC News he would be holding a press conference to announce the officer's name sometime within the next 24 hours, by 2 p.m. Tuesday.
Meanwhile, lawyers for Brown's family and NAACP leaders met with reporters today to discuss the case the violence that it has sparked in the community. NAACP CEO Cornell William Brooks said they were there to ""honor [Brown's] memory by seeking justice through non-violence.""
Attorney Benjamin Crump said that Brown's parents were supposed to drop their son off at a technical college today, but instead they are planning his funeral. “It is not about getting angry, it is about us getting justice for Michael Brown,” he said. ""Their baby was executed in broad daylight.""
Brown's family, he added, ""rejects what the police said at their press conference how this played out.""
Earlier today the FBI announced it had opened its own investigation into the case, in addition to the investigation being led by St. Louis County police.
""The FBI has initiated a federal investigation into a potential civil rights violation that will supplement the St. Louis Co PD inquiry. We will continue to work closely with the PD and coordinate efforts as appropriate,"" a spokesperson for the FBI told ABC.
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder confirmed the FBI probe and said in a statement, “The shooting incident in Ferguson, Missouri, this weekend deserves a fulsome review."" He said the FBI would be working with attorneys from the department's civil rights division.
The {FBI}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/federal-bureau-of-investigation.htm”> is ""reviewing"" the shooting death of an unarmed teenager by a police officer, federal authorities said today.Brown's death sparked outrage in the community and across the nation. One witness, Piaget Crenshaw, told ABC News that Brown was facing the officer with his hands raised in the air when the officer shot him.
The struggle began when the officer encountered two men, one of whom was Brown, in the street outside of an apartment complex, and one of the men pushed the office back toward his squad car, according to police. A shot was fired inside the squad car and then multiple shots were fired at Brown outside the car, killing him, authorities said.
A candlelight vigil was held Sunday night in Brown's honor.
The vigil later erupted into violence, with some individuals breaking into stores and looting goods while others vandalized police vehicles. A fire broke out in a QuickTrip store that had been looted earlier.

Three teenagers from Georgia have decided to take the issue into their own hands.
Caleb Christian, 14, and his two sisters — Ima, 16, and Asha, 15 — are about to roll out an app called “Five-O,” which will let users document police abuse and join together as a community to problem-solve.
“We’ve been hearing about the negative instances in the news, for instance most recently the Michael Brown case, and we always talk about these issues with our parents,” Ima Christian told Business Insider. “They always try to reinforce that we should focus on solutions. It’s important to talk about the issues, but they try to make us focus on finding solutions. That made us think why don’t we create an app to help us solve this problem?”
Five-O lets users submit the details of any incident of police abuse and rate the specific officer. The app also has community boards for different counties so that users can communicate and plan responses to any difficulties with local police.
The idea is to collect data that users can then bring to community activists, the media, and other forms of law enforcement. That way, it’s not just “he said, she said,” Caleb said.
And they’re hoping to illuminate both the negative and the positive interactions users have with police officers. They want the good examples to serve as motivation for officers to do better.
Don’t be fooled by these teenagers’ young age. They are determined to make a difference.
“You’re never too young to learn, and you’re never too young to make a difference,” Caleb said.
The Christian siblings all have a strong background in coding, which made it possible for them to create Five-O along with two other apps (Coily and Froshly), all under their app development company called {Pinetart Inc. }<hyperlink=”http://pinetartinc.com/”> Caleb, Ima, and Asha all participated in MIT’s k12 Scratch and App Inventor program, and with their parents’ encouragement (both have backgrounds in technology), continued to learn JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java.
Five-O will be available August 18 for both iOS and Android devices.
Here’s the video preview for Five-O:

Yahoo,yahoo94,https://www.yahoo.com/news/why-tear-gas-painful-why-155002853.html,Why tear gas is so painful – and why exposure is so hard to treat,Joseph Stromberg,08/18/14,04/26/16,"Police {have made heavy use of tear gas}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/police-ferguson-mo-st-louis-military-militarized-army-tear-gas”> to break up the {ongoing protests}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/protests-ferguson-mo-peace-violent-violence-looting”> in Ferguson, Missouri.
Tear gas is effective at dispersing crowds because its key ingredient — called 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile — {triggers the activation of huge numbers of pain receptors}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6001995/ferguson-missouri-tear-gas-painful”> in the eyes, as well as irritation in the throat and difficulty breathing. This causes a person's eyes to start tearing and closing involuntarily, effectively incapacitating that person within seconds.
A large number of {people in Ferguson}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6025917/police-protesters-ferguson/in/5757650”> — including an {eight year-old boy}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6029589/report-8-year-old-hit-with-tear-gas-in-ferguson/in/5757650”> and {a group of journalists}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/6001193/al-jazeera-journalists-teargassed-by-security-forces-in-ferguson”> — have suffered from these symptoms, and there are various photos showing them using a number of different remedies (such as milk and water) to treat tear-gas exposure.
But the unfortunate truth is that effectively treating exposure to tear gas is very difficult, and the best protections and remedies are solely in the hands of medical professionals. Even worse, we still know virtually nothing about the gas' long-term effects. Here's a rundown of what researchers have discovered about dealing with the effects of tear gas:
1) Most makeshift masks don't work perfectly
The {most effective defense}<hyperlink=”http://facingteargas.org/bp/70/if-youve-been-gassed”> against tear gas is a gas mask. But gas masks and filters aren't easily available to civilians.
Some protestors have often used a pair of goggles and a wet bandana worn over the mouth to minimize the tear gas' effects on the respiratory system (historically, protesters have used bandanas soaked in lemon juice, cider vinegar, Coca-Cola, or other acidic solutions, though {it's not proven}<hyperlink=”http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/02/numb_and_coke.html”> that this is more effective). These measures won't fully protect someone by any means, but they can temporarily reduce the amount of tear gas entering the body, giving a person a few extra moments to escape.
2) The best step is usually to leave the area
Once someone has been exposed to tear gas — whether wearing protection or not — the best thing to do is to get out of the gas-filled area as soon as possible. Simultaneously, {experts recommend}<hyperlink=”http://facingteargas.org/bp/70/if-youve-been-gassed”> that victims cough, spit, and blow their noses in an attempt to get as much of the chemical out of their bodies as soon as possible.
People with conditions that make them especially vulnerable to tear gas — such as asthma, other respiratory diseases, or immune system disorders — as well as infants and the elderly should seek professional medical help immediately.
3) Victims' eyes need to be washed out thoroughly

Once in a secure location, it's crucial for anyone exposed to tear gas to wash out their eyes thoroughly until the symptoms begin to subside. If the person is wearing contacts, they need to be removed and thrown away.
Protestors in Ferguson have sometimes been using milk as a rinse — and victims of tear gas in other protests around the world have used a variety of remedies, such as {lemon juice}<hyperlink=”http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tear-gas-and-lemon-juice-in-the-battle-for-taksim-square-525101”> or a mix of {Maalox (or other antacid) and water}<hyperlink=”http://www.rawstory.com/2011/10/maalox-and-water-solution-used-as-anti-tear-gas-remedy-by-protesters/”>. But these treatments haven't been clinically tested, so it's hard to say if they're better than water, which is still the rinse {proven most effective}<hyperlink=”http://columbia.library.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/wvn/2012/00000009/00000003/art00002?token=00511dc2482dd44d4ea91405847447b496e2f7831446f7c4779474833757e6f4f2858592f3f3b5723”> in clinical trials.
(There is also a chemical called diphoterine that {has been shown}<hyperlink=”http://www.jem-journal.com/article/S0736-4679(05)00064-8/abstract”> to be a more effective rinse and is sometimes used in emergency rooms, but it's not widely available apart from medical supply companies.)
4) Longer-term care is often necessary
Apart from tearing and involuntarily blinking, tear gas also causes a longer-term inflammatory response in a person's eyes and skin — and this can take a few days to subside. Initially, it's recommended that victims take cold showers, because warm water can open up a person's pores, allowing further tear gas particles to enter.
Afterward, any piece of clothing or object that was exposed to the tear gas needs to be thoroughly washed or thrown away. Structures hit by tear gas need to be similarly decontaminated of residue, a process that's {especially difficult}<hyperlink=”http://www.cmmonline.com/articles/231761-a-plan-for-removing-tear-gas-residue”> if tear gas has been deployed indoors.
The long-term effects of tear gas on people {have barely been studied}<hyperlink=”http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6001995/ferguson-missouri-tear-gas-painful”> and are essentially unknown.",87,NA,NA,Vox
Yahoo,yahoo95,https://www.yahoo.com/news/national-guard-americas-citizen-soldiers-224732320.html,"The National Guard, America's citizen soldiers ",Michael Mathes,08/18/14,04/20/16,"The National Guard is a centuries-old militia network that has served crucial roles in several US security operations, testing its mettle in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as on riot-plagued streets back home.

Its Missouri units deployed on Monday to help police in the heartland town of Ferguson, the latest hot spot where the citizen soldiers have been ordered in to help keep the peace and secure public safety.

Whether rushing to help the hurricane-battered US Gulf Coast in 2005, conducting counter-terrorism or peacekeeping operations abroad, or facing off with deadly consequences against unarmed anti-war demonstrators in 1970, the National Guard has served important but often controversial roles.

Its roots pre-date the United States, tracing back to the 17th century regiments of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Such militias formed the bulk of men doing battle against British forces in the Revolutionary War, or US War of Independence.

The state militias were further empowered under the US Constitution and their members served in large numbers in the Civil War, World War I and other conflicts.

In 1933 Congress brought them under a nationalized system that formed the basis of a US military reserve force.

Today's US Army and Air Force National Guard is 460,000 strong, mostly reservists -- teachers, farmers, engineers and the like who commit to serving ""one weekend a month and two weeks a year.""

But the reservists have been called up in huge numbers since the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, for tours of duty lasting as long as a year. They have evolved from being the nation's strategic reserve to serving a fuller operational role in battle.

- Missions foreign and domestic -

More than 700,000 have served one or more tours in Afghanistan or Iraq, and 497 National Guard members have been killed in the global war on terror.

""Many National Guardsmen have spent so much time on active duty since 9/11 that they are virtually indistinguishable from the regulars in terms of their military capabilities,"" Charles Dunlap, director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke University School of Law, told AFP.

Even the National Guard itself stresses its units are designed for war.

""The combat skills and equipment that enable a brigade combat team or flying squadron to mobilize and succeed in Afghanistan also enable them to respond to a natural disaster in the United States,"" spokesman Rick Breitenfeldt said.

That ability was on show in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina rammed headlong into Louisiana.

More than 50,000 National Guard members from all 50 states deployed to the Gulf Coast in one of the largest domestic response operations in US history.

They conducted search and rescue, cleared roads, delivered relief supplies, and helped local police restore order after the deluge brought chaos to New Orleans.

But decades earlier, the militias had also gained notoriety during landmark civil rights confrontations.

In 1957, the Arkansas governor used members of the state's National Guard to bar black students from entering Little Rock Central High School.

President Dwight Eisenhower reversed the move, ordering the federalization of the Arkansas National Guard and using its members to safeguard the desegregation of the school.

The Guard helped restore order during rioting in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1964, in Washington in 1968 after civil rights leader Martin Luther King's assassination, and again in Los Angeles following 1992 race riots.

In 1970 the National Guard suffered its darkest hour, shooting dead four unarmed students at Ohio's Kent State University during protests against the US-led war in Vietnam.

Dunlap said military officials should ensure that reservists play a purely support mission in Ferguson, and not antagonize an already tense community.

""Any time you use the National Guard to quell civil disorder you risk eroding the respect and affection the American people have for the military,"" potentially undermining future army recruitment efforts, Dunlap said.",5,NA,NA,AFP

Ezell Ford, 25, was killed by police in Los Angeles on Monday, two days after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in the St. Louis suburb where he lived.

""He was a humble guy,"" said Ford's cousin, Ceebo Ship, 22.

Ship and other family members said Ford suffered from an unspecified mental illness and was ""slower than the rest of us,"" and a gentle person who loved basketball.

Ford's family said he was cooperating with officers and lying on the ground when shot. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said Ford had struggled with officers and was trying to grab one of their guns when he was shot.

The protesters on Sunday remained peaceful, many holding up signs that read, ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" in reference to witness reports that Brown had his hands up when he was shot dead Aug. 9. Drivers honked their horns as they went by.

Over time, he said, such wounds, rooted in America's painful history on race, can be healed.

Six years later, the stalemate suddenly seems more entrenched than ever. As Obama pleads for calm and understanding in Ferguson, Missouri, he's struggling to determine what role — if any — the nation's first black president can play in defusing a crisis that has laid bare the profound sense of injustice felt by African-Americans across the country.

As Obama sought to strike the appropriate tone Monday, he appeared to be trapped between the need, as president and commander in chief, to stand up for the government's right to ensure law and order, and the inclination, as an African-American, to empathize with those whose say the killing of an unarmed black man just goes to show how blacks are treated differently by police.

""In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,"" Obama said at the White House, in his most expansive comments to date about the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown just outside St. Louis.

But while Obama lamented the disproportional apprehension of young black men, he pointedly argued that's not solely the fault of overzealous cops. Police officers must be honored and respected for the difficult job they perform, Obama said.

""There are young black men that commit crime,"" the president said. ""We can argue about why that happens — because of the poverty they were born into and the lack of opportunity or school systems that fail them or what have you — but if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted, because every community has an interest in public safety.""

It's a delicate balance that's likely to leave no one fully satisfied.

Aiming to reassure edgy Americans that the federal government is fully engaged, Obama announced that Attorney General Eric Holder would travel Wednesday to Ferguson to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death. Obama said he also spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who has deployed National Guard units, and urged him to ensure the use of those units is limited and constructive. ""I'll be watching over the next several days,"" the president said.

But there are no plans for Obama himself to visit Ferguson soon. White House officials said they were mindful that a presidential visit, with all the security and logistics required, could divert law enforcement resources that are already stretched thin.

Obama also called for the U.S. to reassess the militarization of local police departments that have purchased military gear from the Pentagon. Federal grants for such equipment have come under intense scrutiny amid the alarming images of armored vehicles and tear gas canisters filling the streets of an American suburb.

""There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement,"" Obama said. ""We don't want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions.""

Yet for all the talk of procurement and sentencing disparities and police tactics, Obama has steadfastly avoided personalizing this latest bout of racial friction.

Unlike in 2013, when Obama declared that slain teen Trayvon Martin ""could have been me,"" Obama has been careful not to describe Brown's death through the lens of his own experience as an African-American.

And unlike in 2009, when Obama exacerbated tensions by saying police acted ""stupidly"" by arresting a black Harvard University professor at his own home, this time Obama is leaving the fault-finding to investigators. Obama said Monday he has to be careful about appearing to put his thumb on the scale by weighing in while a federal probe is underway.

Witnesses have said Brown's hands were above his head when an officer shot him repeatedly on Aug. 9 in Ferguson. But police have said the officer was physically assaulted during a struggle over his weapon. Meanwhile, the aggressive police response to the subsequent protests has drawn criticism from across the U.S.

Obama's impassive response to the unrest in Ferguson contrasts with a second-term approach in which he generally has been more willing to engage on issues of race. In his remarks Monday, which came during a brief break from Obama's two-week vacation on Martha's Vineyard, the president pointed to his signature initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which aims to bring government, business and nonprofit groups together to empower young minorities to pursue a better future.

""We're making some significant progress as people of good will of all races are ready to chip in,"" Obama said. ""But that requires that we build and not tear down, and that requires we listen and not just shout.""",5801,NA,NA,The Associated Press

Brown’s death, a black teenager at the hands of a white police officer, has sparked tense racial outrage in the town of Ferguson and across America, highlighted most viscerally by the nights of unrest that have followed in the community.

Photographs, live streaming footage and first-hand accounts of Wednesday night clashes between protesters and heavily-armed police forces are jaw-dropping. Armoured tactical vehicles can be seen pawing down the town’s darkened streets. Officers are visible through thick clouds of tear gas, dressed in gear that shouts soldier, not peacekeeper.

Acoustic Riot Control Devices, or sound cannons, stand at the ready, grenade launchers filled with rubber bullets are seen being fired at will into crowded streets. It’s military action, on North American streets.

What is happening in Ferguson is a singular instance, comparable only in scope and response to previous conflicts between police and the public on the streets of America, and Canada. But such police responses have indeed happened before.

In Moncton earlier this summer, the RCMP manhunt for a gunman who allegedly shot and killed three officers involved, {according to}<hyperlink=""http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/canadian-police-forces-want-to-protect-you-with-military-battle-gear""> {Vice}<hyperlink=""http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/canadian-police-forces-want-to-protect-you-with-military-battle-gear"">, armoured vehicles, helicopters and a cadre of heavily-equipped officers in full combat uniforms. Faced with a threat with a proven willingness to shoot, this is perhaps the best argument for access to such equipment.

Other instances are more troubling. A peaceful anti-fracking First Nations protest in New Brunswick ended in violence earlier this year after a large police presence featuring camouflaged snipers descended on the scene and employed military-like tactics to clear their encampment.

Four years ago, when the G20 Summit brought protesters to the streets of downtown Toronto, an army of officers from various forces responded with strength of numbers against peaceful demonstrators. The result, similar to Ferguson, was allegations of police brutality, an unnecessarily violent response and the wanton use of the weapons available, including rubber bullets and tear gas.

Darryl Davies, a professor of criminology at Carleton University, says local Canadian police agencies have not gone the way of militarization and are in principle committed to service-based policing.

But he says Canadian officers and the general public must resist the pressure to perceive the role of police this way, which indeed comes from south of the border, often from fictional television shows.

“What do we see? We see police officers breaking doors down, we see SWAT teams and tactical units going in,” Davies told Yahoo Canada News. “We got a bit of this during the G8 and G20, so we are seeing some signs of it. What that points to is basically the way which policing is being framed in Canada is absolutely, completely out of sync with the majority of what police do on a day-to-day basis.”

Davies added: “In the United States right now, police in many cities have gone the direction of this militarization approach.”

As Newsweek reports, the militarization of American police forces is all but official policy. The 1990 National Defence Authorization Act, updated in 1996, allows the Secretary of Defense to transfer surplus military equipment to federal and state agencies. The policy is known as the “{1033 Program}<hyperlink=""http://www.dps.mo.gov/dir/programs/cjle/dod.asp"">”  and has seen everything from aircrafts and armoured personnel carriers to guns, boots and canteens transferred to local police forces.

The 1033 Program accounts for some, though possibly not all, of the military-grade presence on the streets of Ferguson on Wednesday night. It also accounts for scores of other community police forced decked out with gear more often seen in action overseas. It explains how a small Connecticut town received a $733,000 mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle (MRAP) for transfer fee of $2,800 (an apparent necessity, despite the historical absence of landmines in Watertown, Conn.).

And it also accounts for how Bloomingtown, Georgia, with a population of 2,713, secured its police force four grenade launchers.

{Newsweek’s Taylor Wofford writes}<hyperlink=""http://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537"">:
Given the proliferation of military weapons and military training among America’s police departments, the use of military force and military tactics is not surprising. When your only tool is a hammer, after all, every problem looks like a nail.
Michael Kempa, a criminology professor at the University of Ottawa, says he feels Canadian police forces are trending in the same direction as their American counterparts.

“There is a long history in Canada of police militarization,” Kempa told {CBC’s The Current}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2014/08/14/what-michael-browns-shooting-says-about-the-militarization-of-american-police/"">, pointing to policing around large events, such as Toronto’s G20 or the Vancouver Olympics, which are turned over to the RCMP, a national force that does not have the same direct accountability to the community.

“If they are doing the planning, and much of it has been militarized with sound cannons and armoured vehicles and the rest of it, we actually have much less control over that as citizens as we would have had in the past.”

Things may not seem so bleak north of the border, but we have seen our own police forces secure military-grade equipment. The {Windsor Star}<hyperlink=""http://blogs.windsorstar.com/news/windsor-police-to-be-equipped-with-armoured-vehicle""> reported earlier this year that the local police force secured a 10-ton armoured fighting vehicle from the Department of National Defence.

And the Nova Scotia community of {New Glasgow}<hyperlink=""http://www.ngnews.ca/News/Local/2013-03-06/article-3194268/Police-respond-to-publics-concerns-about-armoured-vehicle/1""> received a similar vehicle around the same time, telling local media they intended to use it in situations that require bulletproof cover for officers and civilians.

Several other towns and cities have also seen their forces equipped with tactical armoured vehicles (TAVs), nicknamed Cougars by the military. Such vehicles have been donated to York Regional Police, Saskatoon police and others through a “Cougars for cops” program over the past several years.

In 2012, the RCMP received a fleet of TAVs from the Canadian military, complete with gun ports, sentry hatches and capable of high ballistic and explosive protection. A request for information about the use of these vehicles was not immediately returned. At the time, however, {Commissioner Bob Paulson said}<hyperlink=""http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=687329&_ga=1.124043145.2090486974.1408047282"">, “It will keep our members safe, and increase their ability to intervene when communities face dangerous circumstances.”

There have been other instances of local forces securing powerful equipment. In May, the Montreal police service acquired two sound cannons to use in the case of future protests and demonstrations, according to {La Presse}<hyperlink=""http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/montreal/201405/22/01-4768807-la-police-de-montreal-se-dote-de-canons-a-son.php"">.Toronto police kept four similar devices that had been obtained ahead of the G20 Summit. In both cases, forces were said to value their communication ability over their ear-piercing crowd dispersal function.

In his interview with Yahoo Canada News, criminology professor Darryl Davies said he’s not opposed to equipping police with the proper equipment, “But I want them in police uniforms. And I want them using those weapons properly under Canadian law, as dictated by the criminal code.”
“For me, policing has to be what the community wants the police to do and that is provide a service,” he said. “Don’t call yourself a police service in Canada and run around in army fatigues like they do in the States, kicking doors down in the pursuit of drugs.”

What’s playing out in Missouri this week is not the same as those instances that have occurred in Canada or anywhere else. But the response, those powerful and overwhelming suppression tactics by a militarized police force, are troubling. Police have a balance to maintain.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association wrote recently, in response to the Toronto police shooting of teenager Sammy Yatim, that “police play a critical role protecting public safety in our communities.”

“It is our view that the motto of ‘to serve and protect’ be a true starting point for police officers to guard against the tensions and ‘us against them mentality’ that can arise between police and the communities they are to serve,” {the CCLA wrote}<hyperlink=""http://ccla.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/CCLA-Submissions-to-Iacobucci-Review.pdf"">.

Michael Brown, 18, was shot multiple times and killed him during a confrontation with a Ferguson, Missouri, cop on Saturday afternoon, according to authorities.

Brown was not carrying a weapon and, according to one witness, was facing the officer with his hands raised in the air when the officer shot him, Piaget Crenshaw told ABC News.

The officer has not been identified and has been placed on administrative leave by the Ferguson police department. The St. Louis County police department is the lead agency on the shooting. The FBI is ""reviewing the matter,"" an FBI spokesman told ABC News.

The struggle began when the officer encountered two men, one of whom was Brown, in the street outside of an apartment complex, and one of the men pushed the office back toward his squad car, according to police. A shot was fired inside the squad car and then multiple shots were fired at Brown outside the car, killing him, authorities said.

Brown's death sparked outrage in the community and prompted residents to march to the police station, demanding answers before holding a candlelight vigil Sunday night.

The vigil erupted into violence, with some individuals breaking into stores and looting goods while others vandalized police vehicles. A fire broke out in a QuickTrip store that had been looted earlier.

""I wish I had a word of automatic comfort but I don’t,"" Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, writes in the {letter}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3136685/travyon-sybrina-fulton-ferguson/"">. ""I wish I could say that it will be alright on a certain or specific day but I can’t. I wish that all of the pain that I have endured could possibly ease some of yours but it won’t.""

Martin, a 17-year-old unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Florida, on Feb. 26, 2012, sparking demonstrations around the country. Zimmerman, who said he acted in self-defense, was later acquitted of second-degree murder charges.

""I hate that you and your family must join this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence,"" Fulton wrote. ""But Michael is much more than a police/gun violence case; Michael is your son. A son that barely had a chance to live. Our children are our future so whenever any of our children — black, white, brown, yellow, or red — are taken from us unnecessarily, it causes a never-ending pain that is unlike anything I could have imagined experiencing.""

The letter comes a day after Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, called for Wilson's arrest, telling ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that the officer should be held ""accountable for his actions.""

""Further complicating the pain and loss in this tragedy is the fact that the killer of your son is alive, known, and currently free,"" Fulton continued. ""In fact, he is on paid administrative leave. Your own feelings will bounce between sorrow and anger.""

Fulton urged the Brown family to ignore the theories about their son's killing:


Facts, myths, and flat out lies are already out there in Michael’s case. Theories, regardless of how ridiculous, are being pondered by the pundits. My advice is to surround yourselves with proven and trusted support. Through it all, I never let go of my faith, my family, or my friends. Long after the overwhelming media attention is gone, you will need those three entities to find your ‘new normal.’ Honor your son and his life, not the circumstances of his alleged transgressions. I have always said that Trayvon was not perfect. But no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed.

Beyond some circumstances related to the killings, there is a tangible connection between the Brown and Martin families: Benjamin Crump, the lawyer who represented Fulton and the Martin family, is representing the Brown family.

Fulton concluded her letter with a message of hope:


Know this: neither of their lives shall be in vain. The galvanizations of our communities must be continued beyond the tragedies. While we fight injustice, we will also hold ourselves to an appropriate level of intelligent advocacy. If they refuse to hear us, we will make them feel us. Some will mistake that last statement as being negatively provocative. But feeling us means feeling our pain; imagining our plight as parents of slain children. We will no longer be ignored. We will bond, continue our fights for justice, and make them remember our children in an appropriate light.",2593,NA,NA,Yahoo News

In a rare move for him, the president took a break in the middle of his Martha's Vineyard vacation to return to Washington just after midnight Monday for meetings with Vice President Joe Biden and other advisers on the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and tensions between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.

The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions. He's received multiple briefings on both issues while on vacation. The White House had also already announced Obama's plans to return to Washington before the U.S. airstrikes in Iraq began and before the shooting of a teen in Ferguson that sparked protests.

Part of the decision to head back to Washington appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises.

Yet those crises turned the first week of Obama's vacation into a working holiday. He made on-camera statements Iraq and the clashes in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. He also called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas.

""I think it's fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that's why you've seen the president stay engaged,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.

Obama is scheduled to return to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend.

Even though work has occupied much of Obama's first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island.

He hit the golf course one more time Sunday ahead of his departure, joining two aides and former NBA player Alonzo Mourning for an afternoon round. He then joined wife Michelle for an evening jazz performance featuring singer Rachelle Ferrell. They left for Washington late Sunday night.

Obama's vacation has also been infused with a dose of politics. He headlined a fundraiser on the island for Democratic Senate candidates and attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan's wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

That get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama's vacation. Just as Obama was arriving on Martha's Vineyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest criticism of Obama's foreign policy.

Clinton later promised she and Obama would ""hug it out"" when they saw each other at Jordan's party. No reporters were allowed in, so it's not clear whether there was any hugging, but the White House said the president danced to nearly every song.",7431,NA,NA,The Associated Press
Yahoo,yahoo105,https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-faces-un-review-racial-discrimination-record-235746531.html,US faces UN review of racial discrimination record,AFP,08/13/14,04/20/16,"A UN watchdog body took the United States to task Wednesday over continued discrimination of minorities, amid heightened tensions in the country after the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager.

The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination interrogated US officials in Geneva about a raft of issues, including discrimination of minorities at different levels of the criminal justice system, unequal access to education and harsh treatment of non-citizens.

Committee vice chairman Noureddine Amir expressed concern at the large overrepresentation of African Americans among people who are ""arrested, charged, convicted, incarcerated and sentenced to life without parole, especially for non-violent offences, as well as sentenced to death"".

He also slammed ""racial profiling"" by police and lamented ""reports of abusive conduct and excessive use of force by law enforcement agents against persons belong to ethnic or racial minorities"".

The review by the committee's 18 independent experts, which all UN members must undergo periodically, began just days after a police officer shot an unarmed black 18-year-old, Michael Brown, in a Missouri suburb, sparking a riot.

The 24-member US delegation was set to answer questions Thursday, but delegation head and ambassador to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva Keith Harper emphasised in his opening statement his country's dedication to fighting discrimination.

The United States is a ""vibrant, multi-racial, multi-ethnic, and multi-cultural democracy"", said Harper, who himself is a Native American.

He stressed the great advances the United States has made in recent decades, pointing to President Barack Obama as evidence.

""Thirty years ago, the idea of having an African American president would not have seemed possible. Today, it's reality.""

Delegation member William Bell, the black mayor of Birmingham, Alabama, also hailed the progress made since he was born into the segregated South.

""I am a direct result of the initiative that was taken by our federal government to assure that all of our citizens be treated fairly and equally,"" he said.

- Stringent immigration laws -

But the committee pointed to a range of areas where minorities stand at a disadvantage.

Gun violence in the United States disproportionately impacts minorities, Amir said, pointing out that African Americans account for 13 percent of the population, but 50 percent of homicide victims.

Black males are reportedly seven times more likely to be shot to death than their white counterparts in the country, he said, also highlighting the proliferation in many US states of ""Stand Your Ground"" and other self-defence laws, used to justify the 2012 shooting in Florida of unarmed black teen, Treyvon Martin.

The UN committee, carrying out its first review of the United States since 2008, also raised concerns about the treatment of non-citizens and the enforcement of ""stringent immigration laws"".

Amid harsh criticism from the right of Obama for being too soft on illegal immigration and not doing enough to stem a recent flood of unaccompanied minors across the US-Mexico border, Amir pointed out that two million people had been deported since the president first took office six years ago -- ""more than any other administration in the same period of time"".

The committee review of the United States is scheduled to wrap up Thursday, and it will publish its findings on August 29.",6,NA,NA,AFP

Mann said ""Remember Mike Brown and the police brutality"" (or possibly ""RIP Mike Brown, police brutality..."") and then TSN quickly cut away. That led to plenty of Twitter praise for Mann for taking a stand, but criticism for TSN for their quick cut:

Mann's own background on this issue may be notable. In early 2011, a friend of Mann's, 25-year-old Reggie Doucet, was {shot dead by police in Los Angeles}<hyperlink=""http://www.laweekly.com/informer/2011/01/14/reggie-doucet-jr-25-year-old-hollywood-model-and-college-football-star-shot-to-death-by-lapd-in-front-of-playa-vista-home"">. Mann and Doucet grew up together in California near Monterey Bay and trained together at times. Both also went on to play Division I college football, at Nevada and Middle Tennessee State respectively. Doucet's death led to Mann putting up Facebook posts about the issue, and he later spoke to Drew Edwards of The Hamilton Spectator {about how his friend's death affected him}<hyperlink=""http://scratchingpost.thespec.com/2011/04/ticats-maurice-mann-finds-inspiration-among-the-tragedy-of-friends-shooting-cfl.html"">:
Maurice Mann's anger came exploding across his Facebook page just hours after Reggie Doucet Jr., his friend and training partner, was gunned down after a confrontation with police.
""I do not understand how this can happen! They killed my friend on his doorstep! 2 shots to his chest!"" Mann wrote. "" ... police officers kill a black man in the wrong neighbourhood at the wrong time. I guess we're not allowed to live in those parts ....""
On Jan. 14, according to police and media reports, Doucet got into an early-morning argument with a cab driver in the upscale Playa Vista neighbourhood of Los Angeles, after a night on the town. By the time police arrived, Doucet was naked and ""behaving erratically."" After a short chase and a scuffle with two cops - the police report was later revised to allege that Doucet tried to grab the gun of one of the officers - Doucet was shot twice and died a short time later.
""I'm lost without my family right now,"" Mann wrote later that same day. ""God has answers, but ... my heart is somewhere else right now."" ...
Doucet's death - the LAPD investigation into the shooting is still ongoing - has sparked an intense bout of soul-searching for the 28-year-old Mann, as he's tried to put the loss of his friend into a larger, more meaningful context.
""I was angry when it happened, then I was sad about it,"" Mann says. ""But when I realized what he had done for me, it gave me inspiration.""
He's spent time reviewing the correspondence the two of them shared on Facebook, watching old videos of his friend in all phases of his life.
""We all think of Facebook as just this temporary thing, but I really take it as he left me a message in the bigger sense,"" Mann said. ""I want to carry on being the type of person he was: a respectful, courageous and faithful guy.""
So, the events in Ferguson obviously hit home for Mann. While some dislike any mixing of politics and sports, it's hard to criticize him here for saying what he thought. As for TSN's decision to cut away from him, that does seem like a poor choice. Those kinds of decisions have to be made instantaneously, though, and it may not have been immediately clear what Mann was trying to say and whether it was going to get the network in trouble. It's notable that they did go back to him in a shot on the bench not long after (at which point he appeared to deliver a more standard shoutout to friends and family). Still, cutting away from Mann so fast doesn't necessarily look good for the network. As {David Larkins}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/larkinswsun""> pointed out, it's in sharp contrast to their usual procedure:
[tweetbegin 499357023390416896 tweetend]
Again, that's probably more of just a quick trigger finger in the TSN truck and a desire to protect the network than any desire to censor Mann. It would be really interesting for some media outlets to talk to him about this afterwards, though. A few-second soundbite after a touchdown is a prominent statement, but it would be interesting to get more of the story from him about why he elected to do so. We'll see if anyone does.",22,NA,NA,Yahoo Canada Sports

Under a program established by President Barack Obama's administration, the White House is compelled to review and officially respond to a petition if it receives more than 100,000 signatures.

As of early Monday, the petition to create the Mike Brown Law, named after the 18-year-old shot by police, and that would require all state, county and local police to wear a video camera had more than 112,000 signatures.

The petition, according to its text, is ""an effort to not only detour (sic) police misconduct (i.e. brutality, profiling, abuse of power), but to ensure that all police are following procedure.""

Ferguson has been plagued by protests and race riots following the August 9 shooting of Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager.

The majority black town's police force is predominantly white, and the shooting and subsequent reaction has focused national attention on the continuing problems with race relations in America, particularly between security forces and young blacks.

Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and a midnight curfew after looting and violence overnight Friday, and Missouri's National Guard has been deployed to restore order.

Residents have taken to the streets in anger over an apparent lack of police accountability in Ferguson.

The petition seeks to rein in police misconduct, as well as enhance accountability of citizens who engage with law enforcement.

With video and surveillance technology rapidly improving, US police forces have begun experimenting with systems that make use of small, body-mounted cameras that objectively record all interactions between a police officer and private citizens.

The transparency brought about by the systems' use has reportedly led to reduced use of force and complaints in some locales.

In the town of Rialto, California, within the first year of the cameras' introduction, use of force by officers declined 60 percent, while complaints against police plunged by 88 percent, the New York Times reported.",9,NA,NA,AFP

The executive order comes after police used tear gas to clear protesters off the streets of the St. Louis suburb, action that police say was necessary because of shooting, looting and vandalism.

“When we saw violent acts … We had to act to protect lives and property,” Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson said at an early-morning news conference.

The situation “took a very different turn after dark,” Johnson said, deteriorating at 8:25 p.m. with a civilian shooting. Protesters fired at police and threw Molotov cocktails, he said.

Sunday’s clashes continued a week’s worth of unrest in Ferguson after the Aug. 9 death of Brown, 18. Activists raised their hands, reflecting reports that Brown had his hands raised when the officer fired.

Police shouted over a bullhorn Sunday, warning the protesters.

They fired tear gas to clear the area.

Some people sprinted away from the gas.

One of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, meaning his head was bent forward, ABC News has confirmed. Brown was also shot four times in the right arm, the autopsy found.

The autopsy was performed Sunday at the request of Brown’s family.

Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform a separate autopsy because of the circumstances surrounding the shooting.

The St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office has also conducted an autopsy.

But compared to the violent aftermath of Michael Brown's shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, the fallout from the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York now seems notable for what's been absent: no guns pointed at raging protestors, no billows of tear gas, no lengthy delay in revealing an officer's name, no National Guard troops.

The relative calm in New York followed a carefully calibrated response by city and police officials intended to neutralize possible unrest. The response drew on the lessons from other high-profile use-of-force cases involving black victims that roiled the city in the late 1990s.

""What you want in a democracy is the ability express your concerns, but you don't want it to spill over into disorder,"" Police Commissioner William Bratton said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. ""I think we've had a very informed and reasonable response to the issues raised by everybody. There's been no violence.""

Initial outrage over Garner's death on July 17 was fueled by an amateur video showing an arresting officer appearing to put him in a chokehold — banned under police policy — and Garner gasping ""I can't breathe"" before falling unconscious. The next day Mayor Bill de Blasio postponed a family vacation, spoke with African-American community leaders and called a news conference with Bratton.

De Blasio called the death a ""terrible tragedy"" and the video ""very troubling."" Bratton conceded that ""this would appear to have been a chokehold."" Both promised a thorough investigation.

Officials say local police commanders reached out to community activists and offered condolences to Garner's family. On July 19, two days after the death, the NYPD released the name of the officer and announced he had been placed on desk duty. On July 31, de Blasio and Bratton were photographed seated next to the Rev. Al Sharpton at a City Hall roundtable about community concerns.

Demonstrations after Garner's death have been peaceful, even after the medical examiner ruled it a homicide. A rally in Times Square last week protesting the deaths of both Michael Brown and Garner resulted in five arrests for minor offenses, but no serious clashes. Police officials said Tuesday that they are in contact with organizers of a Sharpton-led march planned for Saturday — an effort to preserve calm headed by a Community Affairs Division staffed with hundreds of officers citywide.

Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan also announced that an extra grand jury will be asked to hear evidence next month in Garner's death.

The challenges harken back to the torture of Abner Louima with a broken broomstick by an officer in a police station bathroom in 1997 and the death of Amadou Diallo in a hail of 41 bullets in 1999 by four white officers searching for an armed rapist. Both cases sparked demonstrations resulting in hundreds of arrests and frayed then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already tense relationship with the black community.

But Howard Safir, who served as police commissioner under Giuliani amid both crises, says conditions could have been worse if city and police officials hadn't taken swift and deliberate steps to keep the peace. During a closed-door meeting in the aftermath of the Louima assault, it was decided he and the mayor should visit Louima in the hospital and meet with community leaders in Brooklyn, Safir recalled on Tuesday.

Similarly, the pair decided to attend Diallo's funeral after the administration concluded, ""This one has legs and we have to get on top of it real quick,"" he said.

One measure used to quell unrest was to negotiate with Diallo demonstrators and convince them to use designated protest areas policed by officers in unimposing ""soft uniforms"" — windbreakers and baseball caps.

The department then, as now, also benefited from racial diversity in its ranks, experience with crowd control at large events like the New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square and a robust community affairs operation geared toward developing relationships in communities before tragedy strikes, Safir said.

""In the final analysis, police officers are human beings who make mistakes,"" he said. ""You have to be prepared to deal with it.""",6,NA,NA,The Associated Press

It is a smartphone app called Five-O. Across the nation, people who buy the app can use it to document every step of an encounter with police.

The app has several functions. There is a ""Know Your Rights"" tab that summarizes what your rights are when you are stopped by the police, while the community message forums discuss local law enforcement issues. 

It's like a Yelp of sorts but for local police officers instead of restaurants, so users can complete incident reports to gauge good and bad behavior, with aims to increase efficiency, set positive examples, and in negative cases, serve as a starting point for problem-solving.

The creators behind the app are 16-year-old Ima, 15-year-old Asha, and their brother, 14-year-old Caleb Christian.

""We've been hearing about the negative instances in the news, for instance most recently the Michael Brown case, and we always talk about these issues with our parents,"" Ima Christian {told Business Insider}<hyperlink=""http://www.businessinsider.com/fiveo-app-built-by-teenagers-to-document-police-abuse-2014-8""> ""They always try to reinforce that we should focus on solutions.""

Familiar with technology and versed in coding language, the teens already had an app development company. In addition to two other apps, they built Five-O on their own.
