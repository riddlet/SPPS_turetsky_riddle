(AP) — Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon says no curfew will be in place early Tuesday morning in Ferguson, and the National Guard keeping watch there will have immediate and limited responsibilities.

A midnight to 5 a.m. curfew had been in place the previous two nights.

Nixon ordered the National Guard into the St. Louis suburb following another night of rioting, more than a week after a Ferguson police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown.

In a statement Monday, Nixon said Missouri National Guard Brigadier General Gregory Mason will oversee Guard operations in Ferguson under the overall command of the state highway patrol. He says the Guard’s limited role will be to provide protection and ensure the safety of the police command center that was believed to be targeted Sunday night.",81,164,NA,NA

The popular children’s show, Barney, ended every episode with a diverse group of kids singing, “I love you, you love me, we’re a great big family…” This instilled in many of my peers and myself a true sense of seeing past the issue of race and having acceptance of all.

Millennials have been raised in an environment where African Americans have been elected to Congress, won Grammys, become leading medical professionals, Heisman winners, and now president of the United States.

Truly integrated into a society as equals where many of their ancestors were slaves. A dream of one of the greatest Americans to live, Martin Luther King Jr., is now a reality.

I have grown up seeing no difference when it comes to race, but acknowledge there are still individuals in the millennial generation and older generations that can only see skin deep.                                                                                                                                    From what I have observed, as a millennial, I believe one of those people is Al Sharpton.

I am very engaged in politics and love contributing to the national conversation as a millennial voice and the only time I ever hear from or about Al Sharpton is when a white person kills a young African American. These are awful tragedies by any ones standards, but it seems that the actions of Al Sharpton, and other so called race hustlers, are trying to turn back the clock on all the progress made for their own political and financial gain.

The Rev. Al Sharpton’s largely inflammatory words and actions almost always make the situation more volatile. I have never once read an article or seen a news segment, in my short millennial life, where the great reverend was marching for better education in primarily African American communities, or the large number of {African American’s on welfare}<hyperlink=http://www.statisticbrain.com/welfare-statistics/> (39.8 percent), and the staggering number of {African American youth unemployed}<hyperlink=http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/05/04/economy-youth-unemployment-jobs-america-column/8471769/> (23.8 percent).

Never has there been an outrage by the reverend by the overwhelming number of black-on-black crime that happens in this country. According to the {Department of Justice}<hyperlink=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/bvvc.pdf>, African Americans are around 13 percent of the population but they are 50 percent of the homicide victims. Most importantly 90 percent of those victims are killed by other African Americans.

Al Sharpton thinks he is judge and jury. I can’t think of a time where he made a situation better.

It seems to me that liberals, like the Rev. Sharpton, only make it more difficult for African Americans to succeed and receive justice. The reverend seems to think that he can litigate controversies over wrongful deaths (or murders) using the media and his power grip as a “civil rights” activist and MSNBC anchor.

Al Sharpton believes he is the judge and the jury. I cannot think of one instance, at least in my lifetime, where he has made a situation better.

Solely based on the statistics provided by the Justice Department, it seems that the reverend and others could better assist their community by focusing on the black-on-black homicides rather than on selective, racially-charged incidences for the pure purpose of {raising money}<hyperlink=http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/jesse-jackson-booed-fergusen-rally> for their charities and increasing name recognition for future books sale.

There is absolutely no doubt that the officer involved in the death of young Michael Brown used excessive and unnecessary force and should be prosecuted. Although, the evidence being produced is now largely contradicting the story many leaders of these Ferguson protests have been spreading.

And the inflammatory presence by Al Sharpton and his colleague, Jesse Jackson, have only incited more violence and looting by protestors looking for answers.

If anything significant came from the presence and leadership from Rev. Sharpton and Mr. Jackson, that didn’t include violence and predetermined judgment, their presence would be welcomed. These two “civil rights” leaders have now become what many refer to as race hustlers or race baiters and {even those in the African American community are beginning to see this.}<hyperlink=http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/former-nba-star-calls-al-sharpton-coon-and-thot>

Millennials have been a part of the successful transformation of America where all men are created equal, a place where men like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson are needed less and less. We have come so far as a country, proven by the election of Barack Obama, and as millennials begin to take more prominent leadership positions in this country we can become closer to a more completely color blind nation.

And the less we hear from those who make their living off of and fame from racial tension the better we will be as a nation.",9,178,NA,NA

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Thursday said that the aggressive use of force by police in Ferguson, Missouri in response to rioting there shows that America needs to demilitarize its police forces.

“There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response,” Paul wrote in an {op-ed for Time.}<hyperlink=http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/>

“The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action,” he said.

Paul said police forces around the country have been allowed to obtain and use military-style gear because of easy money from Washington DC.

“Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies — where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement,” he wrote.

He noted work done by the Heritage Foundation, which found that the Department of Homeland Security has given out federal funds for local forces to fight terrorism, which has let them buy more advanced weapons. Paul said that weaponry becomes even more of a threat given the erosion of civil liberties in recent years.

“When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury — national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture — we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands,” he wrote.

“Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them,” Paul added. “Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.”

“There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,” Obama said Thursday, speaking from Martha’s Vineyard. “There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who were just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.”

Obama Appeals for Peace and Calm in Ferguson

Brown, who was black, was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson over the weekend, triggering unrest in the city over the past several days and a harsh crackdown by police, including the arrest of journalists.

“I made clear to the attorney general that we should do what is necessary to determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done,” Obama said.

Obama also provided an update on the situaiton in Iraq, saying the situation on Mount Sinjar had “greatly improved” after the humanitarian effort by the United States to aid the religious minorities under siege from Islamic State militants.

“We broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar and we helped save many innocent lives,” Obama said. “Because of these efforts, we do not expect to need an additional operation to evacuate people off the mountain, and it’s unlikely we’re going to need to continue humanitarian air drops on the mountain.”",209,130,NA,NA
TheBlaze,blaze5,http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/what-ferguson-teaches-us-about-the-second-amendment-2/,What Ferguson Teaches us About the Second Amendment ,Chad Kent,08/14/2014,11/09/2015,"By now I’m sure you are well aware of what has happened in {Ferguson, Missouri over the last week}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/10/teen-killed-by-officer-confirmed-as-unarmed-angry-crowds-renew-protests-stop-police-terrorism/>.

Countless articles have been written examining the situation from just about every angle you could imagine. But we shouldn’t forget that there’s a Constitutional lesson to be learned here as well.

As KTVI in St. Louis reports, during the looting some business owners took action to defend their stores from further damage:

This situation gives us a perfect opportunity to put the Second Amendment in context.

As we’re searching for the meaning of the {Second Amendment}<hyperlink=https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights>, it’s not about trying to come up with clever arguments for what the words could possibly mean. It’s about figuring out what the people who wrote and ratified the Second Amendment honestly intended it to mean and what effect they intended it to have.

As I discussed recently on TheBlaze ({here}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/gun-control-activists-are-trying-to-disarm-the-american-public-of-knowledge-and-guns/> and {here}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/its-time-to-disarm-the-liberal-talking-point-that-the-second-amendment-is-meant-for-militias-only/>), a lot of people claim that the Second Amendment only protects the rights of people in a militia to own a gun and only for militia-related purposes. Let’s look at that claim in the context of the looting in Ferguson.

Based on the interview above, the police made it clear that they were not going to be able to help these business owners out. According to the “militia only” interpretation of the Second Amendment, that means the business owners are expected to sit back helplessly and allow looters to destroy their stores.

It is just outside the realm of possibility that that is what the Framers of the Second Amendment intended the amendment to do. These were people who were dedicated to the protection of individual rights. They were also people who lived in a time when Americans who lived on the western frontier of the country faced all kinds of personal threats; everything from wild animals to attacks from Native Americans.

It’s just not realistic to believe that those same Second Amendment Framers wanted to give the federal government the power to deny American citizens the ability to protect themselves and their property.

Try to imagine what would happen if somehow influential Founders like James Madison, George Washington, and Roger Sherman were able to come back from the beyond and watch the interview with those business owners. Do you honestly think their first reaction would be, “Oh my gosh, those citizens have guns!! Are they in a militia?!”

Of course not. Their first reaction would be, “Holy crap, this television thingy is so awesome!!”

Seriously though, it is very hard to believe that those Founders would have supported the idea that the federal government should have the power to prevent those business owners from defending their rights. In fact, {Roger Sherman}<hyperlink=http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/signers/sherman.htm> believed that it was:

“the privilege of every citizen, and one of his most essential rights, to bear arms, and to resist every attack upon his liberty or property, by whomsoever made.”

In other words, what Roger Sherman would have seen in that interview was this group of Ferguson business owners exercising one of their “most essential rights.”

When you look at a situation like this and keep in mind who the Founders actually were, it’s very easy to see how silly it is to argue that they would have supported disarming these men.

That tells you pretty much all you need to know about the Second Amendment. It protects the right of individual citizens to own personal firearms for the purpose of defending their liberty and property from anyone who might attack them.

I’ll be discussing this issue this upcoming Saturday during my Constitution Revolution segment on {TheBlaze Radio’s Chris Salcedo Show}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/author/chris-salcedo/> as well. Don’t miss it!",7,62,NA,NA
TheBlaze,blaze6,http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2014/08/18/fbi-searching-for-witnesses-to-ferguson-police-shooting/,FBI searching for witnesses to Ferguson police shooting,Pete Kasperowicz,08/18/2014,11/09/2015,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Monday it is looking for witnesses to the police shooting of an 18-year old black student who was fatally shot in Ferguson, Missouri, as part of its ongoing investigation into an event that has led to a week of racial tension and protests.

The Justice Department has said it would conduct its own parallel investigation of the shooting, which was welcomed by many who said the mostly white Ferguson Police Department cannot be trusted to run the investigation on its own.

Monday morning, the department said the FBI and Justice Department lawyers have conducted several interviews of witness who were nearby when the shooting occurred.

“Over the next several days, teams of FBI agents will be canvassing the neighborhood where the shooting took place to identify any individuals who may have information related to the shooting and have not yet come forward,” they said. “We ask for the public’s cooperation and patience, and again urge anyone with information related to the shooting to contact the FBI.”

“The FBI can be reached at (800) CALL-FBI, option 4,” they added.

The statement was released by FBI Special Agent in Charge William Woods, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri Richard Callahan, and Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Molly Moran.

Over the weekend, the Justice Department said it would conduct another autopsy of Michael Brown, the 18-year old black student who was shot. Justice Spokesman Brian Fallon said the “extraordinary circumstances” involved in the case demand another autopsy.

Fallon said Justice would still consider the state-run autopsy into account in its investigation.

A private autopsy released over the weekend, conducted at the request of Brown’s family, said Brown was shot six times, twice in the head.

In the meantime, protestors and police have continued to clash at night in Ferguson, which prompted Missouir Gov. Jay Nixon (D) to call in the {National Guard}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/18/missouri-governor-orders-national-guard-to-ferguson-to-help-restore-peace-and-order> to restore order in the streets.

The police’s reaction to the protests has prompted another wave of criticism from both Republicans that the police are too heavily armed, and are being overly aggressive in detaining citizens and reporters. One Democrat, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), said he would introduce new legislation in September that would limit the types of {military-grade weapons}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2014/08/15/dem-bill-no-high-caliber-weapons-armored-cars-stun-grenades-for-police/> that police officers can use.",3,18,NA,NA
TheBlaze,blaze7,http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/16/missouri-governor-declares-emergency-imposes-curfew-in-ferguson/,"Missouri Governor Declares State of Emergency, Imposes Curfew in Ferguson",Dave Urbanski,08/16/2014,11/10/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew Saturday in a St. Louis suburb where police and protesters have clashed in the week since a black teenager was shot to death by a white police officer.

Nixon said that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow looters to endanger the community where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot in a street. The curfew will run from midnight to 5 a.m. Sunday.

“I am committed to making sure the forces of peace and justice prevail,” Nixon during at a press conference at a church that was interrupted repeatedly by people objecting to the curfew and demanding that the officer who shot Brown be charged with murder.

“We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching,” Nixon said. “We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.”

Nixon’s curfew announcement came after tensions again flared in Ferguson late Friday night. Earlier that day, local police identified the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson and released documents and video footage alleging that Brown had robbed a convenience store just before he was shot. Police said Wilson was unaware Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Nixon said the U.S. Department of Justice is beefing up its civil rights investigation of the shooting.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door in the neighborhood starting Saturday, talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting.

Johnson assured those at the news conference that police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas but would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave. Nixon and Johnson were flanked by numerous local elected officials, including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., who urged Johnson to be flexible with the midnight curfew.

But they were interrupted repeatedly.

“Why is the focus on security and not getting justice? Why is there not an arrest?” one women yelled.

Among the many people shouting questions was Malik Shabazz, the president of Black Lawyers for Justice, who said that members of his group and the New Black Panther Party and the Nation of Islam had been helping to maintain order and deter protesters from violence.

“It seems to be a tight curfew line that could be a prescription for confrontation,” said Shabazz, who asked unsuccessfully that the curfew’s start be delayed by an hour.

Brown’s death had already ignited several days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But Friday night marked a resurgence of unrest.

On Saturday, some residents said it appeared the violent acts were being committed by people who came from other suburbs or states.

“Who would burn down their own backyard?” asked Rebecca McCloud, a local who works with the Sonshine Baptist Church in St. Louis. “These people aren’t from here. They came to burn down our city and leave.”

On Friday night, Greg Thomas didn’t see the familiar faces of protesters who have taken to the streets each night this week. Instead, he saw new people, younger, more eager for a confrontation with police. The 28-year-old former Marine said he left as quickly as he could when he heard people talking about getting their handguns.

“Who would burn down their own backyard?”
Share:
“There’s three agendas out there,” Thomas said. “People who want to party, people who want to be martyrs and get killed by police, and the people here to protest.”

Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly and several officers got trapped and injured.

Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, is a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, the local police chief has said.

The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson’s whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley asked Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster on Friday to take over the case, saying he did not believe McCulloch could be objective. Koster said Missouri law does not allow it unless McCulloch opts out, and McCulloch spokesman Ed Magee said the prosecutor has no plans to surrender the case.",398,3500,NA,NA

Authorities in Ferguson, Missouri, on Friday identified the officer who fatally shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown as Darren Wilson, nearly a week after the deadly encounter took place.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson was dispatched to investigate a “strong-arm” robbery at a convenience store shortly before his encounter with Brown, 18, on Saturday.

An {incident report}<hyperlink=http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2014/images/08/15/ferguson-police-report.pdf> said Brown and another man, Dorian Johnson, were suspected of taking a box of cigars from the store.

Police said Wilson encountered Brown minutes after the 911 call reporting the robbery. Police had previously said Brown was shot multiple times after an officer encountered him and another man.

Conflicting stories have emerged about whether Brown and the other man physically assaulted the officer, pushing him into his squad car and struggling for his weapon, or whether Brown put his hands up and was trying to flee when he was shot, as Johnson has said. While Johnson has been vocal in media interviews over the past week talking about what happened to Brown, he has not mentioned a robbery.

The police report information released Friday contains no details about what happened during the actual shooting.

Protests over Brown’s killing gave way to chaos and looting in the city, triggering a harsh and much-criticized police crackdown against demonstrators. The situation changed Thursday night, when Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon gave Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson control over security operations. Johnson did away with the SWAT and police riot gear on the streets and marched with protesters instead. After nightly clashes all week, no arrests were made.

Authorities initially declined to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting, citing death threats. Wilson has been a police officer for six years and never had any disciplinary action taken against him, Jackson said.

After Ferguson police released Wilson’s name, the Ethical Society of Police, a nonprofit organization that represents black police officers in St. Louis, put out a {statement}<hyperlink=https://www.facebook.com/Ethical-Society-of-Police-436831003071448/info/?tab=overview> on its Facebook page saying that the officer involved is not their president, who is also named Darren Wilson.

“As a result of public outcry and a demand for justice, the Ferguson police officer’s name was released and happens to be, Darren Wilson,” the statement said. “The first thing we would like to assure the world is that this is a horrific coincidence. May I assure the world that this is not the President of the Ethical Society of Police’s Sergeant Darren R. Wilson who is African-American, and happens to be an 18 year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department.”",592,6200,NA,NA

He was the 18-year-old gentleman who, depending on which narrative you read, either provoked an argument with a police officer and another individual or put his hands in the air and continued on his way to his grandmother’s house. Conversely, the police officer who ultimately shot and killed Brown was either threatened by the two young men and shoved back into his own official vehicle, or he simply opened fire on a young kid who was complying with his every direction.

Common sense suggests that neither is completely blameless. Maybe Brown postured a bit, thinking that since he was unarmed he would be all right. Maybe the police officer misread the situation, or maybe the other individual involved was armed and the police officer shot Brown by accident.

The reality is that right now, none of that matters.

Yes, it is relevant to determine what happened and who was at fault. Yes, they should probably allow the FBI to take control of the {investigation}<hyperlink=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/fbi-opens-investigation-into-shooting-of-michael-brown/> and wait for the results of blood toxicology tests. But the small percentage of citizens who are unwilling to wait for these things are the ones defining the narrative.

Right now, the voices of people claiming that they need to “teach the cops a lesson” are louder than the voices of Brown’s family members, who ask that supporters refrain from dishonoring their slain son by rioting and looting local businesses. The voice of the Rev. Al Sharpton serves to draw attention to the alleged racial components of this incident – racial components that may not actually exist, considering the fact that the identity of the police officer who fired on Brown has {not yet been released.}<hyperlink=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-wont-identify-officer-who-shot-and-killed-michael-brown/>

In the aftermath of this incident, however, the city of St. Louis faces several problems.

First, there is a pending investigation into a tragic shooting. A lack of trust in local law enforcement and local leadership – exacerbated by the racially lop-sided nature of said leadership – has necessitated that the investigation be overseen by the FBI rather than at the county or even state level. The investigation is likely to take time, and if history is an accurate predictor, developments along the way could lead to further instances of unrest.

Second, the city of Ferguson must rebuild. Businesses must decide whether it is profitable to stay in an area where they could be looted and even destroyed at the whim of the public over issues completely unrelated to their business. They must weigh the probable increase in insurance costs against the likelihood that they will face similar attacks in the future. Families must decide whether or not they still feel safe allowing their children to play outside or walk to school. Police officers must decide if the pay is worth being labeled the enemy before all the facts have been tallied.

But most importantly, on a national level, we must address the public’s insistence on responding to issues before the evidence is compiled, and the inability to respond in a way that makes sense. Because we live in an age where technology allows a 24-hour news cycle and an army of citizen journalists, we have become accustomed to having information at our fingertips and on demand. The downside of that is that often times, that information may come quickly but it comes without context. And particularly in cases which result in a police-involved shooting, context is key.

People on the scene in Ferguson claimed to be responding to the unequal application of force against young black men. However, the context is still lacking. The name and even the race of the officer involved have yet to be released. The actions taken by Brown and the other young man involved have yet to be released to the public. No one knows yet if the officer had a legitimate reason to shoot or if Brown was completely innocent.

In regards to the actual response, even if the shooting was completely out of line, there is a legitimate way to make that point. Immediately following the shooting, Brown’s stepfather took to the street wearing a sandwich board that read, {“Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son.”}<hyperlink=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html?_r=1>

That is an action that demands justice and explanation. That is an action that draws attention to a situation that should be investigated. That is a legitimate response to a police action that you believe bears further scrutiny.

People who claimed to be “supporting” the Brown family, however, took to the streets and began looting local businesses. They claimed that they did so in order to “{send a message to cops that they can’t run things.}<hyperlink=https://screen.yahoo.com/protesters-ferguson-riots-needed-happen-123335700.html>” But when you loot and burn a convenience store, you only send two messages: First, that cops are justified in thinking of you as mindless thugs.

This is what happens when you ignore the warning signs.

Here’s the problem, though, as I explain in my book “A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State,” in the American police state that now surrounds us, every time and every place is the wrong time and the wrong place, especially if you still believe you have the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a court of law.

In the American police state, there is no longer such a thing as innocence. We are all potentially guilty, all potential criminals, all suspects waiting to be accused of a crime.

Why is this happening?

Why is it that not a week goes by without more reports of hair-raising incidents by militarized police imbued with a take-no-prisoners attitude and a battlefield approach to the communities in which they serve?

Who or what is responsible for the growing spate of police shootings, brutality and overreach?

As journalist Benjamin Carlson points out, “In {today’s Mayberry}<hyperlink=http://benjaminfcarlson.com/?p=396>, Andy Griffith and Barney Fife could be using grenade launchers and a tank to keep the peace.”

This is largely owing to the increasing arsenal of weapons available to police units, the changing image of the police within communities, and the growing idea that the police can and should use any means necessary to maintain order.

To our detriment, local police – clad in jackboots, helmets and shields and wielding batons, pepper-spray, stun guns, and assault rifles – have increasingly come to resemble occupying forces in our communities. “Today,” notes Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, “{17,000 local police forces are equipped with such military equipment as Blackhawk helicopters, machine guns, grenade launchers, battering rams, explosives, chemical sprays, body armor, night vision, rappelling gear and armored vehicles. Some have tanks.}<hyperlink=http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/january2007/240107_b_Empire.htm> ”

Unfortunately, whatever the threat to so-called security – whether it’s rumored weapons of mass destruction, school shootings, or alleged acts of terrorism – it doesn’t take much for the American people to march in lockstep with the government’s dictates, even if it means submitting to martial law, having their homes searched, and being stripped of one’s constitutional rights at a moment’s notice.

Americans will march in lockstep with the police state, that is, until suddenly they are the ones being held at gunpoint, terrorized and stripped of their rights. At that point, as Ferguson makes clear, it’s almost too late to dial back the police state.

So what’s to be done?

As with all things, change must start locally – in your hometown.

For instance, take a close look at your local police officers, the ones who patrol your neighborhoods and ensure the safety of your roadways. Chances are they look less and less like the benevolent keepers of the peace who patrolled Andy Griffith’s Mayberry and more like inflexible extensions of the military.

Who calls the shots for your local police? Who do they answer to? Who provides oversight for their interactions with local police? What drives the decision-making process for your local police – revenue or the rule of law? How transparent are your local police about their activities, their equipment and their processes?

In other words, who polices your local police? If it’s more police or politicians benefiting from revenue-generating programs by the police, that’s no answer.

These are just a few of the questions we should all be asking of our local police and governing bodies. And when the answers don’t satisfy, we should ask them louder and insist that changes be implemented immediately to ensure that it is “we the people” calling the shots in our hometowns and not armed extensions of the police state.

Remember, a police state does not come about overnight. It starts small, perhaps with a revenue-generating red light camera at an intersection. When that is implemented without opposition, perhaps next will be surveillance cameras on public streets. License plate readers on police cruisers. More police officers on the beat. Free military equipment from the federal government. Free speech zones and zero tolerance policies and curfews. SWAT team raids. Drones flying overhead.

No matter how it starts, however, it always ends the same. Remember, it’s a slippery slope from a questionable infringement justified in the name of safety to all-out tyranny.",22,169,NA,hyperlink for [today's Mayberry} no longer exists

“I said, ‘I want to go and talk to the people,’” Hoech told Glenn Beck Thursday. “[The police] said, ‘You’re not going back there.’ I said, ‘This is America. I’ll do what I want, and I’ll go where I want. And I believe in the rule of law. You’re just going to have to shoot me because I’m going.’ And I did.”

Hoech, 74, said he lives about 60 miles west of St. Louis, and his wife passed away last year. According to {the Daily Beast}<hyperlink=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/13/go-ahead-and-shoot-me-the-veteran-who-defied-ferguson-s-cops.html>, he arrived with an oxygen tank, demanding to speak with the protesters.

Hoech told Beck that after they came out of the “shock they were in,” the police were “polite” and let him pass.

The veteran said there were a number of “agitators” on the ground, but most of the people were “peaceful and very nice.”

“The biggest agitator of all of this is CNN,” Hoech added. “They’ve been fanning this all morning, and now there’s talk they’re going to have rallies in every city. … We’ve got to stop this now.”

Hoech said the protests are getting “out of control” because the demonstrators, the press and law enforcement are getting “frazzled.”

“Some of them are running on three or four hours a sleep a night, and this thing needs to be put to sleep soon,” he said.

Hoech said if he was in charge, he would tell every minister, rabbi and religious leader in St. Louis to meet him in Ferguson to put a stop to the rioting.

“We’re not going to do anything except destroy ourselves” if this continues, he said.

Hoech said he wasn’t there when the police shot Brown, so he is not going to judge the family or the police. But he does know that Brown’s mother is in pain so he said he’s going to write her a letter.

He added that this is “nothing” like the Watts riots yet, but, “the more it gets fanned,” the more the fire is going to spread.

The president was slammed by his critics for attending the lavish party as unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, seemingly neared a boiling point as police and protesters clashed for the fourth night in a row following the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Read the full press briefing via Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz:

Tonight, the President and First Lady attended the birthday celebration for Mrs. Ann Jordan at an event at the Farm Neck Golf Club. There were approximately 150 guests in attendance.

Among the attendees seated with the Jordans and the President and First Lady were former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Valerie Jarrett and her mother Mrs. Barbara Bowman, Ursula Burns, Kenneth Chenault and his wife Kathy, along with other friends and family of Mrs. Jordan. President Obama honored Mrs. Jordan with a toast before dinner, as did Mr. Jordan and Secretary Clinton and others.

The President and First Lady have known the Jordans for over twenty years, and were grateful to have been able to share this special evening with them.

The President and First Lady also were happy to have the chance to spend time with Secretary Clinton and former President Clinton.

A little color: in his toast for Mrs. Jordan, President quipped that he met Vernon and first, but liked Ann more. The menu consisted of surf and turf and pasta. The Obamas danced nearly every song. A good time was had by all.

Since Sunday, there have been riots, multiple arrests, looting and some violence in the disgruntled St. Louis suburb. Police have responded with heavy-handed tactics, using military-style vehicles and tear gas in an attempt to quell the unrest.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who has been the public face of the city torn by Saturday’s death of Brown, told reporters earlier in the day that the St. Louis County investigation of the shooting could take weeks to complete. In the meantime, he said, his department welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force’s 53 officers are white.

“Unfortunately, an undertow (of racial unrest) has bubbled to the surface,” said Jackson. “Race relations is the top priority right now.”

The looting and violence that occurred after the tragic shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, resulted not only in multiple arrests, but also a stronger police response.

That brings us to the seemingly glossed over aspect of the unrest in Ferguson: the startling militarization of local police forces.

Some of the photos coming out of Ferguson more closely resemble a war zone than a suburban community in Missouri.

Officers — some riding in military vehicles — responded to the unrest wearing full-camo riot gear, combat boots and armed with “short-barreled 5.56-mm rifles based on the military M4 carbine, with scopes that can accurately hit a target out to 500 meters,” according to {Business Insider’s Paul Szoldra.}<hyperlink=http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8>

Szoldra, who served on a U.S. Marine on patrol in Afghanistan, brings a {unique perspective}<hyperlink=http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8> to the police situation in Ferguson:

While serving as a U.S. Marine on patrol in Afghanistan, we wore desert camouflage to blend in with our surroundings, carried rifles to shoot back when under enemy attack, and drove around in armored vehicles to ward off roadside bombs.

We looked intimidating, but all of our vehicles and equipment had a clear purpose for combat against enemy forces. So why is this same gear being used on our city streets?

[...]

Their uniform would be mistaken for a soldier’s if it weren’t for their “Police” patches. They wear green tops, and pants fashioned after the U.S. Marine Corps MARPAT camouflage pattern. And they stand in front of a massive uparmored truck called a Bearcat, similar in look to a mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle, or as the troops who rode in them call it, the MRAP.

“Why do these cops need MARPAT camo pants again,” I asked on Twitter this morning. One of the most interesting responses came from a follower who says he served in the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division: “We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone.”",541,13900,NA,NA

“The attorney general himself will be traveling to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with the FBI agents and DOJ personnel conducting the criminal investigation and he will receive an update from them on their progress. He will also be meeting with other leaders in the community,” Obama said during a Monday press conference.

Obama called again for restraint from both protesters and police to “seek some understanding, rather than simply holler at each other.”

“It is clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting, what is also clear is a small minority of individuals are not,” Obama said. “Giving into that anger by looting, carrying guns, or even attacking the police, only serves to raise tensions and stir up chaos. It undermines rather than advancing justice.”

“Let me also be clear that our constitutional rights to speak freely, assemble, and to her wart in the press must be vigilantly safeguarded — and to report in the press must be vigilantly safeguarded. Ours is a nation of laws. The citizens who live under them and for them — for the citizens who live under them and for those who enforce them,” Obama said.

Obama returned from his vacation in Martha’s Vineyard to meet with administration officials before delivering remarks, and addressed the unrest in Missouri resulting from a police shooting.

Byers made a splash when she reported on Monday night: “Police sources tell me more than a dozen witnesses have corroborated cop’s version of events in shooting.” The tweet sparked several news reports and more than 2,600 retweets.

On Tuesday, Byers then tweeted: “On FMLA from paper. Earlier tweets did not meet standards for publication.” Her message was meant to convey that she is on leave and not actively covering the Ferguson situation for the newspaper.

FMLA is the abbreviation for the Family and Medical Leave Act, which permits qualified employees to “take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave.”

(AP) — Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the National Guard to Ferguson early Monday, hours after police used tear gas to clear protesters off the streets following a week of demonstrations against the fatal police shooting of a black Missouri teenager.

In a statement, Nixon said the National Guard would “help restore peace and order” to this the St. Louis suburb that has been filled almost nightly with angry, defiant crowds.

The latest confrontation came on the same day that Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on a black Missouri teenager who was fatally shot by a white police officer. A preliminary private autopsy found that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

As night fell in Ferguson, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated after marchers pushed toward one end of a street. Police pushed them back by repeatedly firing tear gas, and the streets were empty well before the curfew took effect at midnight.

Authorities said they were responding to reports of gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails.

“Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of response,” said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is command in Ferguson.

At least two people wounded in shootings, he said.

The “extraordinary circumstances” surrounding the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown and a request by Brown’s family members prompted the Justice Department’s decision to conduct a third autopsy, agency spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.

The examination was to take place as soon as possible, Fallon said.

The results of a state-performed autopsy would be taken into account along with the federal examination in the Justice Department investigation, Fallon said.

Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, told The New York Times that one of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when he suffered a fatal injury.

Brown was also shot four times in the right arm, and all the bullets were fired into his front, Baden said.

The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation into the shooting. A day earlier, officials said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson neighborhood where Brown, who was unarmed, was shot to death Aug. 9.

A federally conducted autopsy “more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises” might help that investigation, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami’s U.S. attorney’s office. The move is “not that unusual,” he added.

Federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case, Weinstein said.

Back in Ferguson, Sunday’s clashes erupted three hours before the midnight curfew imposed by Gov. Jay Nixon.

Officers in riot gear ordered all the protesters to disperse. Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley of tear gas.

Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the street near the QuikTrip convenience store that was burned down last week. It was an apparent attempt to block police vehicles, but the vehicles easily plowed through. Someone set a nearby trash bin on fire, and the crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away.

Within two hours, most people had been cleared off West Florissant Avenue, one of the community’s main thoroughfares. The streets remained quiet as the curfew began. It was to remain in effect until 5 a.m.

Earlier in the day, Johnson said he had met members of Brown’s family and the experience “brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart.”

“When this is over,” he told the crowd, “I’m going to go in my son’s room. My black son, who wears his pants sagging, who wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, but that’s my baby.”

Johnson added: “We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael’s going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.”

The protests have been going on since Brown’s death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Missouri’s governor to put the state highway patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before he was killed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a robbery suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Nixon said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that he was not aware the police were going to release surveillance video from the store where Brown is alleged to have stolen a $49 box of cigars.

“It’s appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,” Nixon said.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

The officer who shot Brown has been identified as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting, and the department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Also Sunday, about 150 people gathered in St. Louis to show support for Wilson. The crowd protested outside a TV station because it had broadcast from in front of the officer’s home.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the station, KSDK, later apologized. Other in the group, composed mostly of police and relatives of officers, carried signs urging people to wait for all the facts.",298,3700,NA,NA

The curfew was in effect until 5 a.m. Monday, as protests showed no sign of abating after the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/news/michael-brown/> in the St. Louis suburb last weekend.

Saturday, the first night of a state-imposed curfew in Ferguson, ended with tear gas and seven arrests after police dressed in riot gear used armored vehicles to disperse defiant protesters. Sunday was much the same.

After marchers pushed toward one end of a street, police pushed them back by repeatedly firing tear gas; the streets were empty well before the curfew took effect at midnight.

Authorities said they were responding to reports of gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails.

“Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of response,” said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is command in Ferguson.

At least two people wounded in shootings, he said.

Friday, he doubled down in a passionate appearance on Fox News, calling out everyone from President Obama to the NAACP and Al Sharpton.

“I hate to say this, but I’m going to tell you what you need to hear as opposed to what you want to hear!” Gentry, identified by Fox as a {minister}<hyperlink=http://video.foxnews.com/v/3731606825001/ministers-explosive-rant-on-violence-in-ferguson-goes-viral/?playlist_id=930909787001#sp=show-clips> and who is {based in Los Angeles}<hyperlink=https://www.facebook.com/johnathangentrydotcom/timeline>, said earlier in the week. “All we know how to do is blame the police and white folks for our actions. That’s all we know how to do is blame police and white folks.”

“‘They mistreating us,’” he added in a mocking voice. “‘They beating on us. Oh slavery still exists. Oh oh.’ I’m sick of it!”

On Friday, he picked up right where he left off, turning his attention to Al Sharpton and others after he was asked about them.

He started by asking Sharpton “Where were you?” in regards to shootings in Chicago and California.

“You only come around when something happens with the police or Caucasians. You’re not there for the black community so you need to stop fronting — and NAACP as well. I want to call them out as well! They’re good for nothing. All they do is perpetuate hate.”

He also referenced comments from NBA player Gilbert Arenas, {who called out Sharpton, too}<hyperlink=http://www.mediaite.com/online/nba-star-calls-al-sharpton-a-coon-for-stepping-into-ferguson/>.

As for Obama? “Same old song and dance.”

“It’s just PR in my opinion,” he added. “Someone just handed him a note and said, ‘Speak.’”

He also went on to place blame on Brown and his friend for what happened:

If you two brothers would have just moved to the sidewalk like the officer said, we would not be here. If you would have just moved to the sidewalk and obeyed, we would not be here. 1 Samuel 15:23: “Rebellion is at the sin of witchcraft.” This went from stage one, stage two, stage three, here we are, stage five.

Those events were prompted by the weekend shooting of an 18-year old black student by an unnamed white police officer.

Nixon said Captain Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol would lead the effort. Johnson, who is black, spoke briefly with Nixon and said he grew up in Ferguson, and wants to break the cycle of violence seen over the last few days.

When asked what he would do differently, Johnson said, “We are going to have a different approach, and have the approach that we’re in this together.”

Nixon’s decision to take control away from local police came after a press conference to be held by Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson was taken over by members of the {New Black Panther Party}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/14/raw-video-new-black-panther-party-protesters-take-over-ferguson-police-chiefs-news-conference/>.

Nixon said it was also made after several discussions with people in the town, who said they want to be able to feel safe in their community.

“They told me that they want a community that’s healthy and happy and safe,” Nixon said. “They want their streets to be free from intimidation and fear. They told me they want peace, they want the truth, and they wanted to be treated with respect.”

“Today, my message to the people of Ferguson is that these voices have been heard,” he added.


One of the issues concerning residents — as well as members of Congress and the Obama administration — is the use of military-style equipment to control protestors. When asked whether the equipment being used to control protesters would change Thursday night, Nixon said operational teams were working on trying to bring a different “tone” to police efforts.

Earlier in the day, Attorney General Eric Holder said his department has warned Missouri officials about using {military-style technology}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/14/holder-warns-missouri-police-on-use-of-military-equipment/> and tactics against civilians.

Nixon declined to offer specifics about what would change, and said only people would see a “different picture.”

Nixon was also asked about whether police would release the name of the officer who shot 18-year old Michael Brown. When pressed on whether the law requires the release of that name, Nixon said, “I don’t want to get into a debate what the law is or what the law is not.”

Nixon said he did not know the name of the officer. He did say, however, that the name of the officer should be released at some point, and that steps would likely be taken to protect that officer from violence",63,72,NA,NA

Simpson’s trial to George Zimmerman’s shooting of Trayvon Martin — always bring along one thing: endless media speculation.

The story from {Ferguson, Missouri, where a young, unarmed black man was shot dead by police}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/10/teen-killed-by-officer-confirmed-as-unarmed-angry-crowds-renew-protests-stop-police-terrorism/>, seems to be no different, and when police released video footage Friday that purportedly showed the victim, Michael Brown, robbing a convenience store shortly before the shooting incident, many jumped to {interpret the video}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/15/police-officer-who-shot-michael-brown-did-not-know-he-was-a-robbery-suspect/> and its implications for the developing case.

But later Friday night, a vacationing Bill O’Reilly called into Fox News with a simple message: take a step back.

“You don’t want to try this case on television,” O’Reilly said on Fox’s “The Five.” “We in the media, we should not be trying this case on either side.”

O’Reilly spoke out against people who have ”no blankin’ idea what happened” trying the case before the facts are clear.

“Decent people step back and allow the facts to emerge,” O’Reilly said, adding that witness statements should be taken with a grain of salt until those statements are made in a court of law.

“It doesn’t matter what you say on television,” he said. “It matters what you say under oath.”

Besides the media, O’Reilly laid into “racial agitators,” like Al Sharpton, who he said have seized on the incident and fanned the flames of unrest before the facts surrounding the shooting could come to light.

“People unfortunately these days believe what they want to believe, and they’re not waiting to see what really happened,” he said, later adding:

I hate this ‘No Justice, No Peace’ slogan. I hate this. Whose justice are you talking about? Yours? Al Sharpton’s justice? If you want Al Sharpton’s justice, you are going to have anarchy in this country.

O’Reilly also criticized Ferguson law enforcement for mishandling the incident:

They’re in over their heads there in Ferguson, they don’t know how to handle it. They don’t know how to hold a press conference, they don’t know how to ask questions, they don’t know how to do anything. Let the professionals come in. The State of Missouri should be running this show.

Over all, O’Reilly urged people not to jump to conclusions.

“When the story first broke we were told that the victim was just a regular guy, but now we see he wasn’t a regular guy,” O’Reilly noted of the released surveillance video.

As for the cop who shot Brown, identified Friday as Darrell Wilson, O’Reilly said, ”Even if you’re a cop, you’re presumed innocent until proven guilty.”",234,5400,NA,NA

A crowd gathered inside the Ferguson fire department as New Black Panther Party leader Hashim Nzinga addressed the crowd, mostly focusing his anger on President Barack Obama.

“This is a shame that as we speak the president of United States is talking to Russia, he’s talking to China, he’s talking to North Korea, he’s talking to Iraq and the Middle East about treating their people better,” he said. “But as he look out the window at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, he’s watching the black man, who built the White House, shot down like dogs.”

Nzinga also claimed Obama is from Kenya, calling him a “Mau Mau.”

“He need to go back to his roots and stop people from killing Africans in the streets,” he added.

The man had a point, but certainly not the one he was trying to make with me.

According to the latest {full-year FBI crime statistics}<hyperlink=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2012.xls> compilation, 2,648 black Americans were murdered in the 2012 calendar year. Here’s the shocker: of the 2,648 black murder victims, 2,412 were murdered by a member of their own race. Just 193 of the killings were perpetrated by a white person. (Incidentally, in the same year, 480 more white Americans were murdered than black Americans.)

And yet – every time a tragedy occurs – we hear the {exact same narrative}<hyperlink=http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/12/jesse-jackson-ferguson-riots-column/13957197/>:

“[Insert name here] has joined a long line of blacks, especially black males, who have recently been gunned down, wrestled down and killed by white men and/or white police officers who claim ‘reasonable fear’ or ‘self-defense’ as their defense.”

I remind you: under 200 of nearly 2,500.

Regardless of the facts, it’s always “whitey’s” fault, and it’s always about race.

L.Z. Granderson – CNN contributor and ESPN commentator – wrote {a piece}<hyperlink=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/opinion/granderson-missouri-police-shooting/index.html> on Tuesday in response to the recent Ferguson, Missouri shooting of a unarmed black teenager by a police officer.

Let’s talk candidly for a moment. You know what, Mr. Granderson? Two can play at this game. I’m tired of a few things too.

I’m tired of seeing {internet campaigns}<hyperlink=http://fox2now.com/2014/08/11/hacker-group-anonymous-threatens-ferguson-police-department/> calling for MORE violence. I’m tired of hearing that our court system is only considered to have dealt out “justice” when it rules in favor of the black American in question. I’m tired of the assumption that cops are always wrong – and never in any “real” danger.

I’m tired of the arm-chair critics who instantly extend the benefit of the doubt to the black American in the situation, {without stopping to consider any culpability on their part}<hyperlink=http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2014/08/13/officer-in-ferguson-shooting-was-injured.html>, while summarily placing full blame on the cop.

Most of all, I’m tired of the assumption that every altercation that occurs between a police officer and a black American is definitive proof that it’s all part of some grand racist scheme.

Regardless of what actually happened (and that remains to be seen – as does whether or not {so militarized a response}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/13/reporters-say-ferguson-officers-assaulted-arrested-them-for-not-leaving-mcdonalds-quickly-enough-upon-request/> is indicative of another problem in our nation), can we please, please just look at this like it is: a sad situation where someone lost their life, and someone else’s life is forever ruined; a situation where due process should be fully allowed to run its course without the dehabilitating cloud of race hanging heavily over it?

“This country has moved in a way with anti-cop rhetoric about ‘don’t trust police and resist them openly,’” said Ron Hosko, president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund. “There’s no lack of specific instances where police are acting questionably, but over and over again we’re seeing more instances of citizens saying, Why can’t I give a cop the finger? Why can’t I challenge what a cop does?”

Hosko, a former assistant director of the FBI, blamed what he considers excessive media coverage of a few incidents – such as the deadly police confrontations in Staten Island and Baltimore – as well as the Obama administration and other politicians for what he considered maligning 800,000 police officers nationally.

The consequences, he said, are that good police officers who consider themselves under scrutiny will be reluctant to act, and it will be tougher to recruit good people to be cops.

On Aug. 9, 2014, {Ferguson}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/08/09/legacy-of-ferguson-were-seeing-more-instances-of-citizens-saying-why-cant-i-give-a-cop-the-finger/> police officer Darren Wilson, 28, shot and killed Michael Brown, 18, after a confrontation between the two. Video later showed that Brown had robbed a convenience store, and Wilson alleged he was attacked. On Nov. 24, a prosecutor announced there would be no indictment against Wilson, and riots ensued in the St. Louis suburb.

On March 4, the Justice Department declared that it would not prosecute Wilson for Brown’s death and released a scathing report on the Ferguson police department, asserting that blacks are disproportionately stopped and are the subject of use of force in the city.

“Hands-up don’t shoot turned out to be a lie,” Hosko said. “Now that police officer’s judgments were ratified and justified by local and federal investigations, but Daren Wilson has to hide in society. I was also disturbed that this {administration would send representatives}<hyperlink=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/25/more-white-house-officials-at-michael-browns-funeral-than-thatchers.html> to the funeral of a store robber who assaulted a cop.”

He adds that there are bad cops. The Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund defends law enforcement officials, but Hosko said the organization does turn many cases away when the police officer is wrong.

“I hope we do get unaccountable cops out of the profession,” Hosko said. “Crooked cops tarnish the badge. I’m troubled that across the country, police chiefs fire people for corruption then arbitration puts them back on the job.”

The White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing was established after Ferguson. Since that time, a police officer {choked Eric Garner}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/07/13/new-york-city-will-pay-5-9-million-to-family-of-eric-garner-to-settle-chokehold-death-case/> to death after a confrontation in Staten Island, and other officers were blamed for the {death of Freddie Gray}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/06/23/leaked-autopsy-report-reveals-freddie-grays-official-cause-of-death-report/> in Baltimore.

The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, or NOBLE, has played a central role some of the reform efforts, meeting with local law enforcement officials and community leaders in Ferguson, Missouri New York, Cleveland, Baltimore and elsewhere.

“We will continue to serve as the conscience of law enforcement through our continuing work with the U.S. Department of Justice and other government, community and civic partners, all in an effort to focus on the broader issue of improving policing in communities in America and to reform, where needed, the American criminal justice system at large.” NOBLE President Gregory A. Thomas said in a statement.

“We also pledge to provide support to our long standing member, Police Chief Andre Anderson, as he takes steps to lead change in Ferguson, Missouri, an effort that we are confident will be recognized as another seminal moment in the history of American policing,” Thomas added.

White House spokesman Frank Benenati told TheBlaze that the administration has prioritized criminal justice reform in part to help police.

“The president made it clear that we as a nation are spending $80 billion on incarceration when the money could be better spent on programs that support officers,” Benenati said. “The money is there.  It is just being misspent.”

The White House further referred TheBlaze to a previous comment by press secretary Josh Earnest on funding the recommendations of the task force report, regarding grants for 50,000 body-worn cameras in a pilot program.

“I know of one particular study that indicated that police officers who were wearing body-worn cameras were much less likely to be involved in confrontations with members of the community,” Earnest added. “So that’s one preliminary piece of evidence that would indicate that body-worn cameras could be helpful in this regard.”

Hosko does see a positive side in the conversation that has happened since.

“Ferguson was an incredibly significant impact on law enforcement. In the positive, it renewed conversations about professionalism, training and about resources,” Hosko said. “Body cameras will be put in place, which I support. But there are policies and procedures in place to collect and store that data, and how we share it with the public and the media. There will be a lot of growing pains with body cameras. Rational people will do the right thing when they know they are being watched.”

However, Hosko has some issues with the task force report and argues funding is not there for enough of the suggestions.

“President Obama’s task force broadly, rather than exposing the challenges law enforcement faces, is 100 pages of how police can improve,” he said. “It gives a shopping list that will cost communities and state governments tens-of-millions of dollars.”",213,3200,NA,NA

(AP) — The Missouri Highway Patrol seized control of a St. Louis suburb Thursday, stripping local police of their law-enforcement authority after four days of clashes between officers in riot gear and furious crowds protesting the death of an unarmed black teen shot by an officer.

The intervention, ordered by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, came as President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday’s fatal shooting of Michael Brown and the subsequent violence that has threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town that is nearly 70 percent black patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

Obama said there was “no excuse” for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.

Nixon’s promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening in the neighborhood where looters smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and police repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

[textbegin 500048780188979201 textend] 

After a particularly violent Wednesday night, Nixon said Thursday that local police are no longer in charge of the area, although they would still be present. He said Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson was in command.

[textbegin 500049827015979008 textend] 

The change was meant to ensure “that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately,” Nixon said.

“Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,” the governor said at a news conference in the nearby community of Normandy.

Johnson, who is black, said he grew up in the area and “it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence.” He said he planned to keep heavily armored vehicles away from the scene and told his officers not to bring their tear gas masks.

By late afternoon, Johnson was walking down the street with a group of more than 1,000 protesters as they chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot,” a reference to witness accounts that described Brown as having his hands in the air when the officer kept firing.

Johnson planned to talk to the demonstrators throughout the night.

“We’re going to have some conversations with them and get an understanding of what’s going on.”

Earlier Thursday, President Barack Obama appealed for “peace and calm” on the streets.

“I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,” Obama said, speaking from the Massachusetts island where he’s on a two-week vacation. “But let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.”

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said officers on Wednesday night tossed tear gas to disperse a large crowd of protesters after some threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers. More than 10 people were arrested in Ferguson.

“In talking to these guys, it is scary,” Schellman said of officers on the front lines of the protest. “They hear gunshots going off, and they don’t know where they’re coming from.”

[textbegin 500075189779329024 textend] 

Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown’s shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control — a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police force took over, leading both the investigation of Brown’s shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the smaller city’s request.

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said his officers have responded with “an incredible amount of restraint” as they’ve had rocks and bottles thrown at them, been shot at and had two dozen patrol vehicles destroyed.

The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others. The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said later that the name was incorrect.

Twitter quickly suspended the Anonymous account that posted the officer’s purported identity and personal information. The site’s code of conduct strictly forbids the publication of private and confidential information without permission.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer’s weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

The officer involved was injured, with one side of his face swollen, Jackson said.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told reporters that the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend’s neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

The group also threatened on Thursday to publish the officer’s photograph and other information if they didn’t get a response from St. Louis County Police Department.

However, St. Louis County police reportedly told St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter {Joel Currier}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/joelcurrier> that the name released by Anonymous is false and is not a Ferguson or St. Louis County officer.

St. Louis County Police also responded to the Anonymous group on Twitter, refusing to release the identity of the officer involved in the shooting.

[textbegin 499932127664676864 textend] 

“Do not release more info on this random citizen,” the police department added.

Police in Ferguson have decided against naming the officer involved in the shooting due to concerns for his safety after several death threats were made against him and his family.

The Anonymous group threatened to release a photo of who it claimed was the officer at 10 a.m. CT, his address at 12 p.m. CT and everything else they know about the officer at 2 p.m. CT if they get no response from St. Louis County police, which is overseeing one of the investigations into Brown’s death.


Despite being told by police that the name they released was false, the hacker group released the man’s alleged photo anyway at roughly 10 a.m. CT.

An outraged community has been calling for the name of the officer ever since Brown was fatally shot on Saturday following what police described as a physical altercation. There has been unrest in the streets and a strong police presence in Ferguson ever since, including instances of looting and some violence.

“We only release suspect information after the investigation is complete and charges have been issued,” the St. Louis County Police Department wrote in another Twitter response on Thursday.

Protesters were seen on Wednesday night with firearms and attempting to light molotov cocktails. Police used tear gas and LRADs — long-range acoustic devices — in attempts to disperse demonstrators. There were also several arrests made, including that of two journalists and a St. Louis alderman.

Ferguson resembled more of a war zone than a suburb of a major U.S. city on Wednesday night.

Castro was not more specific, although his tweet seems to imply that Cruz does not object to either the shooting incident, or police efforts to suppress the rioting over the last few days.

But by Thursday morning, Cruz had released a statement that said the events in Ferguson show more work is needed to “keep our communities safe and free.” Like many other politicians have, Cruz called for an end to the violence of the last few days, but said afterwards, the events surrounding the shooting of Michael Brown needed to be investigated.

“Once the unrest is brought to an end, we should examine carefully what happened to ensure that justice is served,” he said.

Cruz also criticized the police in Missouri for arresting two reporters on Wednesday night. “Reporters should never be detained — a free press is too important — simply for doing their jobs,” he said.

Morales was later reportedly among four men from Brooklyn to be arrested in Ferguson:

Obviously, it is highly unlikely that Johnson and Morales traveled to Ferguson alone — though it’s unclear how many of their colleagues are currently in the area.

The presence of communist revolutionaries at the demonstrations is not unusual, however. Revolutionaries like Johnson and Morales seek to use chaos and unrest to further their radical agenda to transform America away from its capitalist system.

“After being placed in a holding cell, he was released with no charges and no explanation.

“I’ll tell you what will happen. They’ll have a trial. The white jurors will see it one way, the black jurors another,” Rivera said. “The white jurors will look at that convenience store surveillance tape. They will see Michael Brown menacing that clerk. The white jurors will put themselves in the shoes of that clerk. They’ll say, of course the officer responded the way he did — he was menaced by a 6-foot 4-inch, 300-pound kid, 10 minutes fresh from a strong armed robbery. The officer was defending himself.

“The black jurors will see Michael Brown despite his flaws as the surrogate for every black youngster ever shot by a cop,” he concluded.

“What you are saying is that the nation is divided, particularly in a microcosm way,” she told him. “Ferguson, Missouri is divided black and white and that’s the only issue here. That is poor-sighted, it’s short-sighted and it’s just not true.”

Faulkner insisted that there are “a lot of things happening” in Ferguson contributing to the unrest, including economics and the militarization of police.

Calling into {The Dana Loesch Radio Show}<hyperlink=http://danaloeschradio.com/alleged-friend-of-officer-darren-wilson-offers-his-side/> on Friday, “Josie” claimed that Brown “bum-rushed” officer Darren Wilson moments after pushing him into his squad car, punching him in the face and trying to grab the cop’s gun.

Though TheBlaze {reported on the call over the weekend}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/17/does-this-video-vindicate-the-officer-who-shot-michael-brown/>, CNN’s Don Lemon reported on Monday that a “source with detailed knowledge of the investigation into the Missouri shooting of Michael Brown” confirmed that the caller’s account “matches the account of officer Darren Wilson as to what happened at the time of the shooting.”

Josie said Wilson first noticed Brown and his friend when they were walking in the middle of the street. She said Wilson told them to get out of the street and the two men yelled back at him, including some obscenities.

“He pulled up ahead of them. And he was watching them, and then he gets the call-in that there was a strong-arm robbery. And, they gave a description,” Josie told Loesch on Friday. “And, he’s looking at them and they got something in their hands and it looks like it could be what, you know those cigars or whatever.”

Police later released surveillance video and revealed that Brown was a suspect in a “strong-arm robbery” at a nearby convenience store.

The alleged friend of Wilson continued: “So he goes in reverse back to them, tries to get out of his car. They slam his door shut violently. I think he said Michael did. And, then he opened the car again, you know, he tried to get out. He stands up. And then Michael just bum-rushes him and shoves him back into his car, punches him in the face and then, of course, Darren grabs for his gun. Michael grabbed for the gun. At one point, he got the gun entirely turned against his hip. And he shoves it away, and the gun goes off.”

The caller went on to claim that Brown then ran from the officer, making it about 35 feet away before Wilson got up and ordered the suspect to “freeze.”

“Michael and his friend turn around. And Michael taunts him… And then all the sudden he just started bumrushing him. He just started coming at him full speed. And, so he just started shooting. And, he just kept coming. And, so he really thinks he was on something,” she concluded. “The final shot was in the forehead, and then he fell about two or three feet in front of the officer.”

The Washington Post, citing a source “familiar with the county’s investigation,” reported that Brown {had marijuana in his system}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/18/report-michael-brown-had-pot-in-his-system-when-he-was-shot/> when he was fatally shot by Wilson.

King, whose store in Bridgeton is about 7 miles from Ferguson, told KMOX that nearly all of his customers said they’re purchasing guns for defensive purposes — and a wide variety of them.

“They’re buying AR-15s, home-defense shotguns, handguns, personal defense handguns, something for conceal carry,” King said. He said some have even been dipping into their savings in order to arm themselves.

In a radio interview, King related a ”touching” story of “an elderly black man” who came into his store on Monday, just hours after violence and looting raged in Ferguson Sunday night, and bought a shotgun and a handgun.

King said the man told him, “`This is embarrassing, all these little thugs running around making us look bad … I’ve lived here my entire life, I’ve never had any problems, and now I feel I have to buy a gun to protect myself … I’m not going to lose my home to these people.”

Just before 7 p.m. the protesters took to the street in front of the Torched QuikTime gas station, chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot!” It’s the popular slogan referencing the belief that Brown was surrendering when he was gunned down. And for the second night in a row, the police tactic of cutting off the main protest area from the rest of the community initially backfired, drawing residents who learned of the cops in riot gear and the redirecting of traffic through word of mouth and rapidly spreading social media posts.

Unlike Monday night, when chaos didn’t rear its head until dusk, a police chopper and the heavy law enforcement presence that preceded it was hovering before the sun went down. But it didn’t last, with only small group staying in the area until just after 10 when they were joined by a marching band of mostly young black men, chanting “Hands up.

{The New York Times}<hyperlink=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?smid=tw-bna&_r=0> reported that the autopsy by Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, found that one of the bullets entered the top of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/news/michael-brown/>‘s skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when he suffered a fatal injury.

Baden said it was likely the last of bullets to hit Brown, 18, whose death has spurred a week of {rancorous protests in Ferguson}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/news/ferguson/>, in suburban St. Louis.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

Baden told the Times that Brown was also shot four times in the right arm and that all the bullets were fired into his front. The newspaper said the bullets did not appear to have come from very close range because there was no gunpowder on his body.

That determination could change if there were residue on Brown’s clothing, which Baden did not examine, the newspaper said.

Some of the bullets entered and exited Brown several times, the newspaper said, including one that caused at least five wounds. It said one shattered his right eye, went through his face, left through his jaw and re-entered his collarbone. The last two shots in the head would have stopped him in his tracks and were likely the last fired, the Times said.

Baden told the newspaper Brown would not have survived even if he had been taken to a hospital immediately.

Baden did not return a message left by The Associated Press earlier Sunday.

Earlier Sunday, Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on Brown, citing the “extraordinary circumstances” surrounding his death and a request by Brown’s family.

Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager fatally shot by police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, last Saturday was shot at least six times in the confrontation, including twice in the head, the  reported, citing a preliminary private autopsy performed Sunday.

UPDATE: Baden noted that Brown’s wounds did not conclusively indicate what the teenager was doing when he was shot.

“This one here looks like his head was bent downward,” Baden told the Times, indicating the wound at the top of Brown’s head. “It can be because he’s giving up, or because he’s charging forward at the officer.”",471,4500,NA,NA

From the AP:

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said during a news conference that police are still seeking the person who shot the critically wounded victim and defended his department’s strong strategic response that came after a midnight to 5 a.m. curfew took hold in Ferguson, Missouri. Johnson said the strong police response was precipitated by two events.

Johnson said concerns about people who’d broken into a barbecue restaurant and taken position on the roof overlooking approaching police was one strategic concern. He said another involved a man who flashed a handgun and appeared in the middle of the street as armored vehicles approached the crowd of protesters.

Johnson said someone also fired at a patrol car, but no officers were injured.

The first night of Gov. Nixon’s curfew, which lasted from midnight until 5 a.m. Sunday, was triggered by the ongoing protests in Ferguson over the police shooting of an unarmed young black man, {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/11/surreal-video-images-out-of-ferguson-as-unrest-resumes-following-shooting-of-unarmed-teenager-i-cant-believe-this-is-happening/>.

When police deployed tear gas to break up the crowd early Sunday, it wasn’t the first time they’d done it in the small town of about 21,000 people over the past week.

Earlier on Saturday evening, the {AP reported}<hyperlink=http://www.mariettatimes.com/?actionAlert=error_content> that some protestors were encouraging others to obey the curfew.

Malik Shabazz, president of the Black Lawyers for Justice and former national chairman of the New Black Panther Party, roamed the streets with other New Black Panthers using bullhorns to tell protestors to head home before midnight.

Shabazz also argued against the curfew, and tried to convince authorities to delay the curfew by an hour, the AP noted.

While some protestors heeded the Black Panthers’ calls, others stayed in the streets until the police cracked down.

As chaos swept the town, some store owners and protestors took it upon themselves to defend stores from looting.

“There are no police,” one store owner told KTVI-TV, saying that local law enforcement was giving store owners a run around, forcing him to take up arms to defend his store.

Peaceful demonstrations turned violent in Ferguson Friday as protestors descended on the town to decry the recent shooting of an unarmed young black man by a police officer.

As {KMOV-TV reported}<hyperlink=http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Another-night-of-protests-violence-in-Ferguson-271489771.html>:

Multiple police agencies were called to Ferguson early Saturday morning following reports of violence.

About 200 protesters clashed with police at the height of the disturbance at the Ferguson Market, where they began looting.  Police said they tried to set the store on fire.

The Ferguson Market is believed to be the same store where {Michael Brown may have been caught on surveillance video stealing cigarillos}<hyperlink=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/michael-brown-strong-arm-robbery-657032> shortly before he was shot.

{CNN reported}<hyperlink=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/16/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1> that the looting followed a police response to a Domino’s Pizza store, where protestors had allegedly thrown molotov cocktails onto the roof.

Other looted stores included a liquor store, an electronics store, and a beauty supply store, police told KMOV.

While some have taken advantage of the chaos to loot and wreak havoc, others, including pastor Robert White, are calling upon the people of Ferguson to reject the violence.

Parishioners at Middle Collegiate Church in New York City came together in prayer to remember Brown, actor Robin Williams and the scores of individuals around the world who are being threatened by extremism. But rather than fold their hands as they invoked God’s name, the faithful joined the Rev. Adriene Thorne in an “ancient prayer position.”

“This gesture is a centuries-old gesture of prayer. Before it ever became in our 21st century context a ‘please don’t shoot’ gesture this is the way ancient people of faith prayed,” Thorne told congregants. “They prayed with their arms up to stay alert. It also was a gesture of surrender … to God.”

After explaining that raising one’s arms in a surrender stance is a traditional form of prayer, the preacher added that this same position is the one that some witnesses say Brown was in when police officer Darren Wilson shot him. Thorne also noted that Howard University students took {the same stance}<hyperlink=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/08/lowell_grad_behind_howard_univ.html} in a recent protest photo that went viral.

The pastor went on to pray as the congregation held their hands in the air.

“We surrender, but we do not give up joy, which informs our vision of your preferred reality. We surrender, but we do not give up faith in a God who is able to transform situations and guide people on a path of justice and righteousness,” Thorne said. “We stand with the family of Michael Brown, we stand with the family of Robin Williams and at the same time, God, we are thankful for the young black and brown male teens in this community who are alive … we pray for their safety.”

The ancient stance Thorne spoke about is known as the “orans position,” which, {according to EWTN}<hyperlink=https://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/orans_posture.htm>, a Catholic TV network, was once common among people of faith and is still used today.

“The ancient monuments of Christianity, such as the tombs in the catecombs, often show someone in the Orans position supplicating God, to show that the prayers of the Church accompany the person in death,” EWTN reported.

Jackson said the officer, previously {identified as 28-year-old Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/15/police-reveal-name-of-officer-who-shot-ferguson-teenager/>, initially stopped Brown and a friend ”because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.”

Police earlier Friday released security footage they said showed Brown grabbing a box of cigars from a convenience store and then shoving the clerk away to leave.

Daryl Parks, an attorney for the Brown family, confirmed that the {security footage}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/15/see-the-security-footage-police-say-shows-michael-brown-robbing-a-store-before-he-was-shot/> “appears to look like” the teenager, but accused the police chief of “strategically” releasing the video to “assassinate the character of Michael Brown.”

Brown’s cousin, Eric Davis, called the video “smoke and mirrors” to obscure what had happened to the 18-year-old. Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson, said he and Brown were ordered down on the sidewalk and that the officer attempted to pull Brown into his car before Brown tried to flee and was shot.

The police have said Brown was shot amid a struggle with the officer in and around the officer’s squad car.

After the police chief’s revelation, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan speculated that the decision to release the security footage — while seemingly unrelated to the officer’s decision to stop Brown — was because “Michael Brown knew about the robbery,” even if the officer didn’t.

“The officer didn’t know about the robbery in the store when he stopped Michael Brown, but Michael Brown knew about the robbery, and Michael Brown … thought that he was being apprehended for robbery, and therefore when the officer tried to put him in the car for not being cooperative or whatever his reasoning was, Brown immediately started to struggle because he thought he was going down on a robbery in the second-degree,” Callan said.

On Fox News, legal analyst Annemarie McAvoy made the same point: “The victim knew, if it was in fact him, that he’d just committed a robbery, may have assumed that he was going to be arrested and essentially tried to resist before he gets arrested.”",257,543,NA,NA

According to the messages, Wilson is living in fear for his life under 24-hour guard.

“The support is really keeping me going during this stressful time. Just stay safe. I appreciate all you have done,” Wilson wrote in one message, before adding, “I can’t go out.”

Wilson also thanked Shepard for his Friday appearance on CNN to defend Wilson’s reputation.

Shepard told the Daily Mail that he’s known Wilson for 14 years and that the cop always had “pure intentions.”

“It’s sad for Mike Brown and his family,” Shepard said, wondering if the shooting needed to have happened. “Darren [Wilson] could have just Tasered him and Mike would have spent six months in jail or something and maybe got his act together after that. Darren could have gone on with his life too but now both of their lives are over. It sucks.”

Shepard noted that Wilson faces a unique struggle.

“I’m sure Mike’s family is having a hard time but at least they have the support of the whole nation behind them, openly,” he said. “Darren doesn’t get that.”

The shooting will be a permanent stain on Wilson, Shepard said, whether or not he’s found to have been justified in his actions.

“People are very suspicious of law enforcement as it is and something like this happens you will always be remembered as the cop who murdered Mike Brown, regardless of what happens at trial or if he’s ever charged or fired,” he added.

His friend’s job and reputation will likely never be restored.

“Obviously he’s not going to be able to be a cop over there [in Ferguson] any more,” Shepard said. “He’s going to have to resign but there’s always going to be a negative connotation to his name, and it sucks. He doesn’t deserve that.”

According to Shepard, Wilson is living under guard in an undisclosed location, likely in the St. Louis area.

The friend’s conversation with the Daily Mail came on the heels of several other key developments that, taken together, have lended some credibility to Wilson’s case.

On Monday, a St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter said that police have heard from {more than a dozen witnesses who corroborated Wilson’s account}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/18/report-more-than-a-dozen-witnesses-have-corroborated-officer-darren-wilsons-version-of-ferguson-shooting/> of the shooting.

“This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,” Fallon said in a statement. “Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.”

The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation of the shooting. Officials said a day earlier that 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson, Missouri, neighborhood where an unarmed Brown was shot to death in the middle of the street on Aug. 9.

David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami’s U.S. Attorney’s office, said a federally conducted autopsy “more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises” might help that investigation, and that the move is “not that unusual.”

He also said federal authorities want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case.

In addition to the federal and state autopsies, Brown’s family has requested a third autopsy, {CNN}<hyperlink=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/17/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1> reported.

It will be conducted by high-profile pathologist Michael Baden, according to Anthony Gray, a lawyer for the Brown family, CNN noted.

The shooting death of Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, at the hands of a white police officer has set off a national firestorm.

Brown’s hometown of Ferguson, Missouri, has been rocked by a week of protests, and the local police have handed over the investigation of the shooting — and {control of the town}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/14/missouri-governor-calls-up-state-highway-patrol-to-restore-calm-in-ferguson/> — to the state highway patrol and the FBI.

The details of the shooting remain unclear, with witnesses telling conflicting stories about whether Brown attacked the officer, or whether he was walking away with his hands in the air, before being fatally shot.

A video posted to YouTube Thursday purports to show the scene of the Aug. 9 shooting, but as the {Conservative Treehouse}<hyperlink=http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2014/08/15/exceptional-catch-the-jj-witness-video-eye-witness-audio-of-mike-brown-shooting-sharing-brown-doubled-back-toward-police/> noted Friday, a conversation heard in the background of the video (starting at around the 6:30 mark) offers some damning allegations: Brown may have rushed the officer who shot him.

The transcript, from the Conservative Treehouse:

#1 How’d he get from there to there?

#2 Because he ran, the police was still in the truck – cause he was like over the truck

{crosstalk}

#2 But him and the police was both in the truck, then he ran – the police got out and ran after him

{crosstalk}

#2 Then the next thing I know he doubled back toward him cus - the police had his gun drawn already on him –

#1. Oh, the police got his gun

#2 The police kept dumpin on him, and I’m thinking the police kept missing – he like – be like – but he kept coming toward him

{crosstalk}

#2 Police fired shots – the next thing I know – the police was missing

#1 The Police?

#2 The Police shot him

#1 Police?

#2 The next thing I know … I’m thinking … the dude started running … (garbled something about “he took it from him”)

The account offered by the alleged eyewitness seems to echo an account given by an alleged friend of the officer, Darren Wilson, who shot Brown.

The {alleged friend called into Dana Loesch’s radio program Friday}<hyperlink=http://danaloeschradio.com/alleged-friend-of-officer-darren-wilson-offers-his-side/> and claimed that Wilson had been attacked multiple times by Brown before finally shooting the teenager.

“[Brown] just started bum rushing [Wilson],” the caller said. “He just started coming at him full speed. And, so [Wilson] just started shooting.”

The alleged friend’s identity has not been verified, and the video that allegedly captured an honest, immediate eyewitness testimony has also not been firmly verified.

But together, the two stories seem to offer powerful evidence that the shooting of Michael Brown was a complicated affair — and the police officer who gunned him down may not be a villain.",691,1600,NA,NA

The caller, identified only as Jim, said he has first-hand experience as both a former police officer and someone who has been shot.

“I was robbed in an armed robbery, and I’m an old police officer,” he began. “A driver and two gunmen — in front of us, back of us — [pulled] their guns on my children, my wife. He did not know what a Pennsylvania dad does when you threaten his kids.”

Jim said he reacted “like a grizzly bear on this crackhead,” and didn’t even realize the man shot him.

“I just knew I had to protect my family,” Jim remarked. “As I was fighting him, I’m like, ‘why are my shoes all wet?’ I didn’t realize I was bleeding profusely. And then I just punched him as many times as I could.”

Jim said the county sheriff, “a good guy with a gun,” saved him and his family.

Brown’s death has set the city of Ferguson, Missouri, on fire with protests, looting, and charges of racism, and some are citing the autopsy as proof that the officer, who is white, acted recklessly.

But until the public knows why, exactly, the officer shot Brown, Jim said one possibility is that Brown was a threat to the officer, and one shot did not stop him.

“Hollywood has really screwed with our image of how these occur,” Beck’s co-host Stu Burguiere, who filled in for Beck on Monday, said. “You go to Chuck Norris movies or Rambo — you shoot once, they go back 25 feet, explode in midair. Not exactly science. … Especially a bigger guy, you hit a guy in the arm a few times, he’s going to keep coming until you take him down.”

Brown was shot four times in his right arm, and twice in the head, according to the preliminary autopsy report. The two shots in the head were likely the last fired, the report adds.

“That has happened to tons of police officers,” Burguiere said. “Guys in the military can tell you this, as well.”",175,2600,NA,NA

At one point, police appear to have become frustrated with the media on the scene. One officer, apparently bothered by the bright light from a camera covering the event live on the internet, screamed and allegedly threatened a man operating the camera – {reported to be Mustafa Hussein}<hyperlink=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/argus-radio-ferguson-protests_n_5679149.html> of {KARG – Argus Radio}<hyperlink=http://www.argusnewsnow.com/#!/page_PROGRAMS> .

As the camera pans to the left and focuses on a section of a highway overpass, a loud voice (believed to be a police officer) is heard yelling directions, apparently angry at the use of a light.

As one voice can be heard yelling something to the effect of, “Turn that sh** off!” another voice is heard saying something that sounded like an order to, “Get back!”

There is an unintelligible statement from another voice (possibly, “It’s off”), followed by the angry voice yelling, “Get the f**k out of here! You keep that light off or you’re getting shot with this!”

Following in the incident, a police representative (later on the video identified as Captain Todd) spoke with the camera operator. The man who was threatened was asking for the name of the officer who threatened to shoot him.

Mr. Hussein, audibly upset, told Capt. Todd, “Your officer just pointed a gun directly at my face and told me he was going to shoot me with it. That is a violation of my First Amendment rights!”

Capt. Todd assured the press rep, “I’m gonna address it,” while also reiterating to keep the light off.

The {Washington Post reported}<hyperlink=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/08/18/officer-appears-to-threaten-cameraman-covering-chaos-ferguson/> that Mr. Hussein did receive the captain’s business card and would be following up on his request for the name of the officer who threatened him.

Hussein was not the only media member who experienced a tense encounter with the police in Ferguson.

On Sunday night, before the midnight curfew took effect, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes was reporting live via telephone from the streets of Ferguson and was threatened by the police.

On the video posted by {Crooks and Liars}<hyperlink=http://crooksandliars.com/2014/08/police-threaten-use-mace-against-media>, you can clearly hear police in the background loudly ordering Hayes, “Get behind us. Do not pass us!”

In a very calm voice, Hayes reports, “We’re getting barked at by the cops not to pass them.”

The next statement by the police is garbled, but Hayes reports that he was told, “Media do not pass us. You’re getting maced next time you pass us”:

TheBlaze,blaze55,http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2014/08/15/dem-bill-no-high-caliber-weapons-armored-cars-stun-grenades-for-police/,"Dem bill: No high-caliber weapons, armored cars, stun grenades for police",Pete Kasperowicz,08/15/2014,11/12/2015,"Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) said Thursday he would soon introduce legislation that would ban the Defense Department from transferring military items like high-caliber automatic weapons, armored cars and other military-grade weapons to police agencies.

The bill would also require Defense to tell Congress about the items it is about to transfer, before shipping any items to state and local agencies.

Johnson’s Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act is a response to the police crackdown on protestors and other civilians in Ferguson, Missouri earlier this week.

Those police actions drew heavy opposition from federal policy makers, including Attorney General Eric Holder, who {warned local police}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/14/holder-warns-missouri-police-on-use-of-military-equipment/> about using aggressive tactics and military gear to control crowds. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) also weighed in by saying the police {must be demilitarized}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2014/08/14/rand-paul-on-ferguson-police-forces-must-be-demilitarized/>.

Those calls were heeded by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) on Thursday — he put {state highway troopers}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/14/missouri-governor-calls-up-state-highway-patrol-to-restore-calm-in-ferguson/> in control of security in Ferguson, and scaled back some of the more aggressive tactics that led to criticism.

Still, it’s not clear House Republican leaders will allow Johnson’s bill, or any similar legislation, to be called up on the House floor. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) had no comment on whether any plans for debate and vote were in the works.

Johnson’s proposed legislation would amend current law, which allows the Defense Department to send surplus military gear to state and local agencies. The bill would draw a hard line on what can be transferred, and would ban automatic weapons “not generally recognized as particularly suitable for law enforcement purposes, including those that are .50 caliber or greater.”

Defense would be blocked from transferring tactical and armored vehicles, or mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles.

In addition, no armored drones, aircraft, stun grenades or silencers could be transferred.

While transfers of other items would still be allowed, Defense would have to file a report with Congress about items it’s proposing to transfer. And, agencies receiving these goods would have to certify that they have “the personnel and technical capacity, including training, to operate the property.”

Billions of dollars worth of military-grade equipment has been transferred since 1990, when the law first took effect. Under the law, Defense can move this equipment to local agencies for use in law enforcement activities, including counter-drug and counter-terrorism actions.

Johnson’s bill would remove that counter-drug rationale from the law. Read Johnson’s bill here:",2,31,NA,NA

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and his colleagues say they don’t think New York police can fairly investigate the death of 43-year old Eric Garner back in July. Garner was put into a choke hold by NYPD Office Dan Pantaleo that forced him to gasp “I can’t breathe!”

Garner died, and soon after, Pantaleo was {stripped of his gun and badge}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/07/19/nypd-officer-stripped-of-gun-badge-after-death-of-man-placed-in-apparent-chokehold-during-arrest/>.

But on Thursday in New York, Jeffries said justice has not been served to Pantaleo, which demands a formal federal investigation.

“Eric Garner is dead,” he said. “The person who videotaped the incident was arrested. And the officer who killed Mr. Garner in broad daylight remains free and on the N.Y.P.D.’s payroll. There’s something wrong with that picture.”

Others added that NYPD regulations prohibit choke holds.

“Everything seems to indicate that Mr. Garner was a victim of an unlawful practice that was banned two decades ago, and there are some worrying indications that this tragedy may not get a full and fair investigation absent federal intervention,” said Rep. Jose Serranno (D-N.Y.). “We need a forceful and unbiased entity like the Department of Justice to step in and ensure justice is done.”

Their letter to Holder said police tried to arrest Garner on the suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes, and instead placed him in a choke hold that caused his death.

“The entire incident was video-taped, including Mr. Garner’s desperate pleas for help,” the letter states. “His request for assistance was ignored by Officer Pantaleo and other NYPD officials who were on the scene.”

“[T]here is no indication that the local district attorney is prepared to aggressively prosecute this case,” they added. “Absent DOJ intervention, we may be marching toward a miscarriage of justice.”

The lawmakers say the event stems from the NYPD’s “broken windows” police policy that targets minorities for minor violations, and said there is evidence that similar crimes are “ignored by the NYPD in the majority-white neighborhoods of New York City.”

“We strongly urge the Department of Justice to open a formal investigation into the policy custody death of Eric Garner and the alleged constitutional and civil rights violations connected with the broken windows law enforcement strategy,” the letter concludes.

Their request came just days after members of the Congressional Black Caucus asked Holder to investigate the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, by a white police officer. Holder has said the Justice Department will run its own investigation of that event, parallel to the investigation being conducted in Missouri.

In that case, Holder has encouraged Ferguson police to have more minorities on staff, and has also warned them {against using military gear}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/14/holder-warns-missouri-police-on-use-of-military-equipment/> to suppress protesters.

“At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,” Holder said Thursday. “At my direction, department officials have conveyed these concerns to local authorities.”

“Also at my direction, the department is offering – through our COPS office and Office of Justice Programs – technical assistance to local authorities in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force,” Holder added. “The local authorities in Missouri have accepted this offer of assistance as of this afternoon.”

Holder’s statement was released shortly after President Barack Obama spoke in a televised address that he used to call for {peace and calm}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/14/obama-appeals-for-peace-and-calm-in-ferguson/> among both police and protestors in Missouri.

“There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,” Obama said Thursday. “There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Efforts to control protesters Wednesday night led to discussion Thursday about the aggressive actions of the police, including the arrest of two reporters who were later released. Various videos showed police firing tear gas into crowds and near reporters and camera crews, and reports circulated that police were firing rubber bullets.

Those events led Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to call for a broad effort to {demilitarize the police.}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2014/08/14/rand-paul-on-ferguson-police-forces-must-be-demilitarized/> Paul blamed Washington DC for providing anti-terrorism funding to local police departments, which he has has turned some police forces into small armies.

Holder said Justice Department officials are in Missouri to help work with law enforcement officials and others to help reduce tensions in the community, where many are reacting to the killing of an 18-year old black student by a yet-to-be named police officer. One of those steps, Holder said, is that the police should “consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities.”

In the meantime, Holder said Justice is continuing its parallel investigation of that shooting.

Like Obama, Holder said acts of violence by protestors cannot be condoned.

“Looting and willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers who are genuinely trying to protect the public do nothing to remember the young man who has died,” Holder said. “Such conduct is unacceptable and must be unequivocally condemned.”

But at the same time, he said law enforcement officers must do what they can to reduce tensions.

“Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times,” Holder said. “And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.”",163,613,NA,NA

“Why aren’t libertarians talking about Ferguson?” the American Prospect editor {asks in the Washington Post}<hyperlink=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/13/why-arent-libertarians-talking-about-ferguson/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter>, pointing to the fact that prominent politicians and pundits like Sen.

As a noted progressive, Waldman’s motivations in calling out libertarians is little more than partisan tribalism. After all, libertarian thinkers have a long history of opposing police militarization; as seen in the work of publications like {Reason Magazine}<hyperlink=https://reason.com/tags/police-brutality>, think tanks like the {Cato Institute}<hyperlink=http://www.cato.org/blog/police-militarization-ferguson-nationwide?utm_source=Cato+Institute+Emails&utm_campaign=de1a69e265-Cato_Today&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_395878584c-de1a69e265-142760201&mc_cid=de1a69e265&mc_eid=37b3027a09>, and journalists like {Radley Balko.}<hyperlink=http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Warrior-Cop-Militarization-Americas/dp/1610392116> Mediaite has aggregated a {thorough list}<hyperlink=http://www.mediaite.com/online/libertarians-have-not-been-silent-about-ferguson/> of libertarian commentary on the issue proving this point well.

However, Waldman is correct that it’s taken a few days for small-government congressional champions Paul and Amash to comment on this egregious example of the police state in action. Liberty-loving politicians should take note and jump ahead of partisan trolls like Waldman in the future to establish themselves as true defenders of freedom.

To their credit, both Paul and Amash have broken their silence on the matter since the article was published.

Amash {tweeted}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/499740253633388546> at 10:12 PM on Aug. 13, “Images & reports out of {#Ferguson}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ferguson?src=hash> are frightening. Is this a war zone or a US city? Gov’t escalates tensions w/military equipment & tactics.” Paul published in {op-ed in Time}<hyperlink=http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/> calling to demilitarize the police in wake of the tragedy.

While it is encouraging to watch both politicians disprove Waldman’s bunk criticism, the Ferguson situation presents a rare opportunity for them to lead the charge against police militarization.

To begin with, police militarization like what the American public is witnessing in Ferguson is the very embodiment of big government.

Since 2001, the Department of Homeland Security has spent {$34 billion}<hyperlink=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/12/20/local-cops-ready-for-war-with-homeland-security-funded-military-weapons.html> in federal grants for state and local police departments to purchase weapons of warlike tanks and assault rifles, fueling paramilitarylike operations in America’s cities and even small towns. In the early 1970s, there were only a few hundred SWAT raids across the country; by 2005, that number had skyrocketed to {50,000}<hyperlink=http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323848804578608040780519904>. Even worse, {hundreds of these raids}<hyperlink=http://www.cato.org/raidmap> have targeted innocent people – some even tragically leading to their deaths.

Politicians afraid of big government squandering their money and trampling on their freedom are witnessing it in action in Ferguson today, highlighting the urgency to get in front of the issue.

Paul should especially be on top of his game as the current Republican {frontrunner for the 2016 presidential election}<hyperlink=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/07/21/meet_the_press_rand_paul_is_republican_presidential_frontrunner.html>. The Kentucky politician has historically reached across the aisle to form alliances with Democrats on issues where the libertarian policy perspective aligns with progressives.

For example, he co-sponsored the {Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013}<hyperlink=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/20/justice-safety-valve-act-senate_n_2918823.html> with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), giving federal judges more flexibility in sentencing than what mandatory minimums would prescribe. By pushing for more transparency in DHS’s military-to-police pipeline, Paul could further promote his reputation as a no-nonsense, nonpartisan politician who consistently calls the government out when it tramples on Americans’ freedom.

Furthermore, doing so could greatly improve Paul’s reputation among potential African-American voters. The senator has admirably tried to reach out to this historically Democratic demographic by speaking at Howard University last fall, but the talk {did not go as smoothly as he imagined}<hyperlink=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/04/17/rand-paul-acknowledges-stumbles-at-howard-it-is-harder-for-me/>.

By positioning himself as a leader in Congress fighting police militarization, Paul could patch up this rocky relationship and establish himself as a statesman who cares about all Americans’ struggles.

However, Paul and Amash are by no means the only two politicians who can take advantage of the Ferguson situation. The Republican Party in general can work wonders in improving its reputation among the citizenry as defenders of liberty by getting in front of this issue.

However, some have noted that since the ban seemingly does not apply to commercial flights, its impact falls primarily on news media covering local protests.

NBC News investigative reporter Tom Winter reported that the FAA has restricted the airspace above Ferguson to “provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities.”

(TheBlaze/AP) — The mother of the 18-year-old black man fatally by a police officer said the officer should be fired, jailed and get “the death penalty.”

Speaking at the site of the Saturday killing, McSpadden added that police haven’t explained why her son was confronted by the officer.

FERGUSON, Mo. (TheBlaze/AP) — An 18-year-old black man {fatally shot by a suburban St. Louis police officer}<hyperlink=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/09/hundreds-yell-kill-the-police-after-officer-fatally-shoots-allegedly-unarmed-teenager/> was unarmed, police said Sunday during a news conference that occurred while hundreds of angry protesters gathered outside to demand answers.

Police have not disclosed the name of the man who was killed, but family members said it was Michael Brown, a 2014 high school graduate set to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday.

Brown’s grandmother, Desiree Harris, said Saturday she saw him minutes before she heard a commotion and went outside. She found Brown’s body less than two blocks away.

“My grandson never even got into a fight,” she said. “He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.”

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said that an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn’t known, but “it was more than just a couple.” He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer’s gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

The second person has not been arrested or charged and was expected to be interviewed later Sunday, Jackson said, adding that authorities aren’t sure if that person was unarmed.

A few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters about the time the news conference was to begin. At one point many of them marched into an adjacent police building, some chanting “Don’t shoot me” while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn’t use force; the crowd eventually left.

Protesters outside chanted slogans — “No justice, no peace” and “We want answers” — and some carried signs that read “Stop police terrorism” and “Disarm the police.”

Protests also flared up Saturday night, hours after the shooting:

St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation. But St. Louis County NAACP member John Gaskin said Saturday that the FBI should get involved “to protect the integrity of the investigation.” St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, who showed up at the protest Sunday to urge calm, said he also will request an FBI investigation.

The officer has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years, Belmar said, noting he wasn’t aware of other issues involving the officer. He has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is a common procedure after police shootings. Authorities have not disclosed the officer’s race.

Critics have contended that police in the St. Louis area too often target young black men. Statistics on police-involved shootings in the region were not immediately available.

Gaskin alluded to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges, as well as the New York City man who died from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes.

“With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers … this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,” Gaskin said.

Anthony Shahid, a community activist who led Sunday’s protest, urged demonstrators to post videos and photos on social media so Monday’s planned protests would draw thousands instead of hundreds.

“We’re not worried about what’s happening in Afghanistan,” Shahid said. “We’re worried about what’s happening in Ferguson … black youths being murdered.”",264,3000,NA,NA

Afterward, some people looted a convenience store.

The following YouTube clip reportedly depicts the looting and was tweeted by Robert Edwards, producer at KSDK-TV in St. Louis:

A voice is heard on camera saying that he and others are at the store “where the incident started and looting it, ransacking the QuikTrip.”

Another voice later in the clip is heard yelling, “Anything we want!” as looters empty the shelves.

Several other stores along a main road near the shooting scene were broken into and looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store.

People were seen carrying bags of food and toilet paper. TV footage showed streams of people walking out of a liquor store carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters were standing atop police cars or taunting officers who stood stoic, often in riot gear.

Other witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows. Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van.

“Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess,” Ferguson’s mayor, James Knowles, told St. Louis KTVI-TV. “Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. … We’re only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors. There’s nothing productive from this.”

As the investigation of Brown’s death progresses, “we understand people want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out,” Knowles added. “We’re going to obviously try to urge calm.”

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries but confirmed widespread property damage. “Right now I’m just worried about people, not property,” he said.

Earlier in the day, a few hundred protesters had gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters.

At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police building, some chanting “Don’t shoot me” while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn’t use force; the crowd eventually left.

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after an officer encountered two people — one of whom was Brown — on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn’t known, but “it was more than just a couple.” He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer’s gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged. Authorities aren’t sure if that person was unarmed, Jackson said.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV there’s no apparent video footage of the shooting from a nearby apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn’t yet put in use.

Jackson said blood samples have been taken from Brown and the officer who shot him, with those toxicology tests generally expected to take weeks to complete.

Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said he had graduated from high school and was about to enter a local college.

She said she doesn’t understand why police didn’t subdue her son with a club or Taser, and she said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

“I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,” she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

“We’re outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,” said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.

The Rev. Al Sharpton called the shooting “very disturbing” and said he planned to go to Ferguson to meet with the family.

St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, and Dooley said he will request an FBI investigation. The U.S. Justice Department said Attorney General Eric Holder had instructed staff to monitor developments.

The race of the officer involved in the shooting has not been disclosed. He has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years, Belmar said, and has been placed on paid administrative leave.",554,8900,NA,NA

{Mediaite’s Eddie Scarry}<hyperlink=http://www.mediaite.com/print/why-does-ap-refer-to-michael-brown-as-teen-despite-style-guide/> notes two recent AP headlines and an excerpt on the controversial shooting death of Brown:

And an excerpt from yet another AP story, emphasis added: “Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon lifted a curfew but ordered the National Guard to step in to help restore order. Holder over the weekend ordered a federal medical examiner to perform a third autopsy on the teenager, Michael Brown.”

The photo included above also describes Brown as a “teen.”

TheBlaze follows AP style in most cases and the matter related to Brown’s age was discussed internally early Monday morning, Front Page Editor Madeleine Morgenstern said. On Monday, it was specified that AP style is in fact to refer to someone as an adult once they turn 18, as Michael Brown was. Therefore, “Missouri teen” or similar descriptions are incorrect.

In a letter to Holder, CBC members said the shooting raises “potentially serious concerns, particularly because it may be part of a continuing pattern of the use of deadly force by police against unarmed African-Americans.”

“While we appreciate that the facts are still coming to light in this case and we do not pre-judge the incident, we believe that the seriousness of the incident requires intervention by federal law enforcement agencies and we are heartened to learn of the parallel federal investigation that you announced today,” they wrote.

The letter specifically asked Holder to expand the federal investigation and ensure Justice has “sufficient resources to investigate the legal and civil rights ramifications of the shooting and surrounding circumstances.” It also asked Holder to examine whether there are any patterns of police misconduct by the Ferguson Police Department.

On Monday, Holder announced that Justice would run an investigation into the matter that “will supplement, rather than supplant” the local investigation. But the CBC letter said that may not be good enough — it said local police “may not be the most objective or credible body to investigate civil rights matters” in light of past evidence of racial profiling.

According to press reports, Brown was shot after he assaulted a police officer, and police say there was a struggle to gain control of the officer’s weapon. But the CBC letter says “community members have expressed strong skepticism and outrage about this explanation.”

“According to one eyewitness account, several shots hit Mr. Brown as he attempted to flee with his hands in the air, suggesting discrepancies with the St. Louis County Policy account,” they wrote. “More broadly, press reports suggest that Mr. Brown’s shooting may be symptomatic of larger racial tensions in Ferguson.”

It argued that if a pattern of misconduct exists at the local level, “such misconduct would be a clear violation of federal law.” The letter was signed by Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), and William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.).

Seidl,08/11/2014,11/12/2015,"A local news crew captured a disturbing image scrawled in black spray paint outside a Ferguson, Missouri, business after protests turned into violence and looting over the shooting death of an unarmed teen in the city.

“The only good cop is a dead cop,” the message read, according to KTVI-TV. The anchor called it “very disturbing.”

KTVI {says}<hyperlink=http://fox2now.com/2014/08/11/beauty-town-among-several-business-damaged-during-overnight-looting-near-ferguson/> nearly 20 stores have been vandalized in the looting spree.

Early Monday afternoon KTVI removed a video it had previously posted about the vandalism.

Facebook user Jeanne Marie Hawkins posted video of what appears to be looting at a Shoe Carnival store in the area:

Police say 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot numerous times Saturday after an incident involving a police officer.

Over Multiple Crises",Dave Urbanski,08/18/2014,11/12/2015,"EDGARTOWN, Mass. (TheBlaze/AP) — In a rare move for him, President Barack Obama paused in the middle of his Martha’s Vineyard vacation to return to Washington on Sunday night.

Obama met with Vice President Joe Biden and other advisers in regard to the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and tensions between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.

The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions. He’s received multiple briefings on both issues while on vacation. The White House had also already announced Obama’s plans to return to Washington before the U.S. airstrikes in Iraq began and before the shooting of a teen in Ferguson that sparked protests.

Part of the decision to head back to Washington appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises.

Yet those crises turned the first week of Obama’s vacation into a working holiday. He made on-camera statements regarding Iraq and the clashes in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. He also called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas.

Obama is scheduled to return to Martha’s Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend.

Even though work has occupied much of Obama’s first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island.

He hit the golf course one more time Sunday ahead of his departure, joining two aides and former NBA player Alonzo Mourning for an afternoon round. He then joined wife Michelle for an evening jazz performance featuring singer Rachelle Ferrell. They left for Washington late Sunday night.

Obama’s vacation has also been infused with a dose of politics. He headlined a fundraiser on the island for Democratic Senate candidates and attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan’s wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

That get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama’s vacation. Just as Obama was arriving on Martha’s Vineyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest criticism of Obama’s foreign policy.

Clinton later promised she and Obama would “hug it out” when they saw each other at Jordan’s party. No reporters were allowed in, so it’s not clear whether there was any hugging, but the White House said the president danced to nearly every song.",101,4300,NA,NA

French’s detention triggered outrage on social media, with individuals demanding his immediate release, tweeting under the hashtag “#FreeAntonio.”

Others headed to the jailhouse where they gathered outside.

A spokesperson for the Ferguson County Jail was not immediately available for comment to TheBlaze. It was not clear at the time of publication what French was charged with.

The alderman has been tweeting Vine videos for past several nights documenting the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.
