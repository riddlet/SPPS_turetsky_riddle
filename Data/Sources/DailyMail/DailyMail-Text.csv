Greg,8/9/2014,11/30/2015,"A woman whose grandson was fatally shot by police says she found his body in the middle of the street minutes after he was expected to arrive at her home.

Desiree Harris says she was driving through her suburban St. Louis neighborhood Saturday afternoon when she saw her 18-year-old grandson, Michael Brown, walking a few blocks from her house. After she arrived home minutes later, she heard a commotion and ran outside to see Brown's body on the pavement nearby.

Hundreds of angry residents gathered for hours after the incident, shouting and cursing at police.

'He was spending the summer with me, and they did that to him with no reason.'

Harris said she was expecting her 18-year-old grandson, Michael Brown, to visit her that afternoon and discovered him dead after she heard the commotion outside the apartment complex.

'He was running this way,' she said. 'When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.'

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told an acquaintance the shooting was 'wrong and it was cold-hearted,' the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. According to the newspaper, Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, held a sign that read: 'Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!'

Eyewitnesses say the teenager was unarmed and had his hands in the air when he was shot dead by police.

The teenager had just graduated high school and hoped to begin college in the fall.

'My grandson never even got into a fight,' she said. 'He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.'

A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department confirmed a Ferguson police officer shot the man. The spokesman didn't give the reason for the shooting.

A large crowd of angry residents confronted police officers Saturday afternoon, yelling such things as 'kill the police' after an officer fatally shot a male in a St. Louis-area neighborhood.

Officer Brian Schellman, spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, said 'a couple hundred' people came out of apartment buildings after an officer with the Ferguson Police Department shot and killed the male. Schellman did not identify the person who was shot or say what prompted the shooting.

The St Louis County Police Department has taken over the investigation.

John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, called on the FBI's assistance was needed 'to protect the integrity of the investigation.'

'With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,' Gaskin said.

Gaskin said officials in the organization spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who told them the male was a teenager and had been shot twice.

A witness {Fox2Now}<hpyerlink=”http://fox2now.com/2014/08/09/man-shot-killed-in-ferguson-apartment-complex/”> that she saw Brown 'running for his life,' before he was shot. He turned around with his hands in the air, she said, but was shot twice more, resulting in his death.

Schellman declined to give any information about the male who was shot, including his age or race, because police were still trying to notify relatives.

After the shooting, some people yelled threats toward the police, and officers said they thought they heard gunshots, Schellman said. There were no reports of additional injuries, he said.

After the crowd gathered, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents located a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau from 2012, about two-thirds of the residents are black.

Schellman said the crowd was under control by about 5 p.m. and several of the additional officers had left the area.

Gaskin said the angry crowd was reacting to a 'trauma.'

'Anytime you have this type of event that's taken place, emotions are going to run high,' he said.

(AP) — The fatal shooting of a black teenager by police sent hundreds of angry residents out of their apartments Saturday in a St. Louis suburb, igniting shouts of ""kill the police"" during a confrontation that lasted several hours.

A St. Louis County chapter of the NAACP called for the FBI to look into the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, said she saw him running in her neighborhood Saturday afternoon when she passed him in her car. Just minutes later, after she returned home, she heard a commotion and went outside to check on it. Less than two blocks away, she found Brown's body.

""He was running this way,"" she said. ""When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.""

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported several distraught relatives were outside talking with neighbors, including Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and stepfather, Louis Head. Head held a sign that read: ""Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!""

A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting at the request of the local department, confirmed a Ferguson police officer shot the man. The spokesman didn't give the reason for the shooting. St. Louis County police said a large crowd confronted officers following the shooting, yelling such things as ""kill the police.""

John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, said the FBI should get involved ""to protect the integrity of the investigation."" He alluded to the 2012 racially-charged shooting of a 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, as well as the death of a New York man from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes on the street.

""With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,"" Gaskin said.

Gaskin said officials in the organization spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who told them teenager had been shot twice.

By early Saturday night, dozens of police cars remained parked near the shooting scene as mourners left votive candles, rose petals, a large stuffed animal and other remembrances at a makeshift memorial in the middle of the street. At the height of the post-shooting tensions, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents, about two-thirds of whom are black.

Harris said her grandson had recently graduated high school and was looking forward to the future, including possibly attending college.

""My grandson never even got into a fight,"" she said. ""He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.""

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told the Post-Dispatch that the officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave.

""We are hoping for calm and for people to give us a chance to conduct a thorough investigation,"" Jackson said.

Gaskin said the angry crowd was reacting to a ""trauma.""

St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar held a press conference Sunday morning about the incident, and while the victim has not yet been officially named, family identified him as 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Belmar said the victim was shot dead after he and another man got into an altercation with a police officer.

A struggle ensued when one of the men pushed the officer into his patrol car and one shot was fired.

The officer then got out of the vehicle and shot at 'a subject' multiple times.

Belmar wouldn't say how many shots were fired but said there were 'more than just a couple'.

Few details were released about the police officer involved in the incident, other than that he was with the force for six years.

He has since been placed on paid leave pending the investigation.

Brown was killed yesterday while walking to his grandmother's house in the predominately black neighborhood of Ferguson, located a few miles north of downtown St Louis.

His grandmother Desiree Harris says she was driving through her neighborhood that afternoon when she saw her grandson walking a few blocks away from her house.

After she arrived home minutes later, she heard a commotion and ran outside to see Brown's body on the pavement nearby.

Hundreds of angry residents gathered for hours after the incident, shouting and cursing at police, and continued to protest Brown's death on Sunday at the Ferguson police building.

About 200 people marched at the building, with some chanting 'we want answers' and 'no justice, no peace'.

Police have asked the community to remain calm while they carry out the investigation.

'He was a good kid. He didn't live around here, he came to visit me,' Mike Brown's grandmother told KMOV.

(AP) — People smashed car windows and carried away armloads of looted goods from stores Sunday night after thousands of people packed a suburban St. Louis area at a vigil for an unarmed black man who was shot and killed by a police officer.

The candlelight gathering was for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said had been shot multiple times Saturday after a scuffle involving the officer, Brown and another person in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb of the city.

Afterward, some people looted a convenience store. Several other stores along a main road near the shooting scene were broken into and looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store.

People were seen carrying bags of food and toilet paper. TV footage showed streams of people walking out of a liquor store carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters were standing atop police cars or taunting officers who stood stoic, often in riot gear.

Other witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows. Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van.

""Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess,"" Ferguson's mayor, James Knowles, told St. Louis KTVI-TV. ""Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors. There's nothing productive from this.""

As the investigation of Brown's death progresses, ""we understand people want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out,"" Knowles added. ""We're going to obviously try to urge calm.""

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries but confirmed widespread property damage. ""Right now I'm just worried about people, not property,"" he said.

Pat Washington, a spokeswoman for Dooley, said later that there was one instance she knew of in which tear gas was used. There were scattered media reports of gunfire but authorities did not immediately confirm any.

Earlier in the day, a few hundred protesters had gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police building, some chanting ""Don't shoot me"" while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn't use force; the crowd eventually left.

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after an officer encountered two people — one of whom was Brown — on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known, but ""it was more than just a couple."" He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged. Authorities aren't sure if that person was unarmed, Jackson said.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV there's no apparent video footage of the shooting from a nearby apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn't yet put in use.

Jackson said blood samples have been taken from Brown and the officer who shot him, with those toxicology tests generally expected to take weeks to complete.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said he had graduated from high school and was about to enter a local college. She said she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue her son with a club or Taser, and she said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,"" she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

""We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,"" said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.

The Rev. Al Sharpton called the shooting ""very disturbing"" and said he planned to go to Ferguson to meet with the family.

St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, and Dooley said he will request an FBI investigation. The U.S. Justice Department said Attorney General Eric Holder had instructed staff to monitor developments.

The race of the officer involved in the shooting has not been disclosed. He has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years, Belmar said, and has been placed on paid administrative leave.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Speaking to Fox News off camera, Brown's mother, Leslie McSpadden, said she was 'furious' by what has unfolded.

She told the TV station that the violence was 'disrespecting the memory of her son' and was not helping her cause, which is to seek justice for her son and peace for her family.

The devastated mother, who is still in shock after losing her son, added that she was even scared to go home last night because of the chaos in the streets.

People smashed car windows and looted armloads of goods from stores after the vigil for the unarmed black teen who was shot and killed by a police officer on Saturday.

The candlelight gathering was held in Ferguson, St Louis for Brown, who police said was shot multiple times after a scuffle involving an officer, Brown and another person in the predominantly black suburb of the city.

Michael Brown died after being shot multiple times by a police officer in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis after an altercation involving the officer, Mr Brown and another man on Saturday.

The killing has drawn criticism from some civil rights leaders, who have referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

Now it has emerged that Benjamin Crump, the attorney who represents the family of Trayvon Martin is now to represent Mr Brown's family.

According to his firm's Parks Crump website, Mr Crump specialises in personal injury, wrongful death, medical malpractice and civil rights matters.

It also details how he was the first African-American President of the Federal Bar Association for the Northern District of Florida, first African-American Chairman of the Florida State College of Law Board of Directors, and the first African-American Chair of the Tallahassee Utility Commission.

Michael Brown's death has drawn parallels to that of Martin's and how his family also hired Mr Crump after the 17-year-old was shot dead as he walked from a convenience store to his father's condo in Sanford, Florida.

Neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman was later arrested in connection with Martin's death and went to trial but was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in July of 2013.

Meanwhile, a vigil which was held for 18-year-old Brown in Ferguson on Sunday descended into chaos, with shop windows being smashed and goods being looted.

The vigil in honor of the teenager started off as a peaceful protest, as hundreds of people gathered outside Ferguson's police headquarters.

At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police building, some chanting 'Don't shoot me' while holding their hands in the air.

But some protestors then stood on top of police cars and taunted officers before looting a convenience store and a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store.

It comes as Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden spoke of her son, saying he had graduated from high school and was about to enter a local college.

And during an emotional television interview on Monday evening, Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said that the teen was 'executed in broad daylight wearing sandals and shorts on the way to his grandmother'

The shocking eyewitness accounts follow a promise by Ferguson police to name the officer involved in the 18-year-old's shooting by 2pm Tuesday.

This self-imposed deadline followed an earlier announcement by the FBI that they would open their own investigation into the college students death amidst a night of fiery looting and rioting across the St. Louis suburb.

That officer, who witnesses to the shooting claim is white, is currently on paid administrative leave following the death of the African American, who was shot up to eight times - including once in the face - during Saturday's incident while he was walking to his grandmothers.

Indeed, US Attorney General Eric Holder said that the FBI will examine the circumstances surrounding the 18-year-old's death, especially considering the version of events witnesses describe differs wildly from that of the officer who shot the student dead.

Many questions loomed over the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after an altercation with an officer in Ferguson.

It was unclear whether Brown or a man he was with was involved in the scuffle, and authorities were vague about what led an officer to open fire.

Dorian Johnson told WALB-TV that he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk.

Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of his car.

Johnson said the officer fired, and he and Brown were scared and ran away.

'He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down', Johnson said. 'But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.'

'We wasn't causing harm to nobody,' Johnson told the television station. 'We had no weapons on us at all.'

Another witness, Piaget Crenshaw, told ABC News that Brown was standing to attention, facing the officer with his hands raised when he was shot.

The officer claims there was a scuffle after Brown was stopped with a friend and that Brown pushed him into the squad car after he had left the vehicle to speak to Brown.

A third witness to the shooting also claimed he had his hands in the air when he was shot in the town.

Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.

Brown 'was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,' Walker told The Associated Press on Monday.

The officer 'had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times.' The officer then 'stood over him and shot him' after the victim fell wounded.

The race of the officer was not officially disclosed, but witnesses said he appeared white. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.

The St. Louis County Police Department refused to discuss Johnson's remarks, citing the ongoing investigation.

But Police Chief Jon Belmar previously said that an officer encountered Brown and another man outside a Ferguson apartment complex, and that one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled.

The FBI is looking into possible civil rights violations arising from the shooting, said Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI's St. Louis field office.

She said the FBI would be investigating regardless of the public attention surrounding the matter.

Nearly three dozen people were arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night after crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted officers who tried to block access to parts of the city.

Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used Brown's death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.

'Most came here for a peaceful protest, but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. ... I can understand the anger and unrest, but I can't understand the violence and looting,' Trout said.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said 32 people were arrested for various offenses, including assault, burglary and theft.

Two officers suffered minor injuries, and there were no reports of civilians hurt.

Several businesses were looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People also took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer and carted rims away from a tire store.

Some climbed atop police cars as the officers with riot shields and batons stood stoically nearby, trying to restrict access to the most endangered areas.

A spokeswoman for St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said tear gas had been used.

Mayor James Knowles said a small group of people was 'creating a huge mess.'

The unrest, he added, was 'only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.'

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV that there's no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but has not yet put to use.

The second person has not been arrested or charged, and it was not clear if he was armed, Jackson said.

Blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him for toxicology tests, which can take weeks to complete.

Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting 'Don't shoot me' while holding their hands in the air.

Officers stood at the top of a staircase until the crowd eventually left. A similar protest that attracted about 250 people was held Monday morning.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she did not understand why police did not subdue her son with a club or stun gun. She said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

'I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,' she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

Brown's family planned to speak later Monday at a news conference with their attorney, Benjamin Crump, who also represented Martin's family.

John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP, said the group was 'outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement.'

(AP) — Tensions were high Monday in parts of suburban St. Louis after the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man led to overnight looting, vandalism and dozens of arrests. A closer look at the community of Ferguson, where 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed:

HISTORY: Incorporated in 1894 by founder William B. Ferguson as a railroad depot, the town quickly grew into a hub for freight and passenger traffic and a bedroom community for city workers. It also attracted many freed slaves looking for a home after the Civil War.

Before school desegregation, Ferguson and other parts of north St. Louis County were predominantly white. The racial makeup changed as many white suburban families moved to outlying areas such as St. Charles County, parts of which are more than 40 miles from St. Louis. Today, Ferguson is nearly 70 percent black.

POPULATION AND POVERTY: By 2010, the census counted about 21,000 people in Ferguson, which is about 10 miles north of downtown St. Louis in the broader area known to locals as North County. Fewer than half of the approximately 9,100 homes are owner-occupied, and about a quarter of residents live below the federal poverty level.

COMMERCE: Ferguson is home of the global headquarters of Emerson Electric Co., a Fortune 500 company that employs more than 130,000 workers worldwide. Just outside the city limits is Express Scripts, the nation's largest company that manages pharmacy benefits. Earlier this year, the corporation announced a $56 million expansion that will add 1,500 jobs. Ferguson's former rail depot is home to a redevelopment effort aimed at promoting small businesses in a pedestrian-friendly corridor, with a weekly farmers market and outdoor concerts in the summer.

SCHOOLS: Several North County school districts — including the Normandy system from which Brown recently graduated — lost state accreditation because of declining test scores and other academic shortcomings. Some students from the failing districts were bused to better-performing schools in other districts.

RACIAL CONCERNS: Some Ferguson protesters say members of the city's predominantly white police force disproportionately target black motorists during traffic stops. A 2013 report by the Missouri attorney general's office found that Ferguson police stopped and arrested black drivers nearly twice as frequently as white motorists but were also less likely to find contraband among the black drivers.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Benjamin Crump joined the parents of 18-year-old Michael Brown during a news conference Monday. Crump says he and the family reject police accounts that Brown struggled with an officer before being shot Saturday in Ferguson.

The attorney says several witnesses reported seeing Brown hold up his hands before the officer repeatedly shot him.

Brown's parents joined Crump in pressing for calm in their son's honor, noting the looting and unrest that broke out Sunday night following a candlelight vigil.

Crump also represented the parents of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder charges.",NA,NA,NA,NA

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Robin Williams, the Academy Award winner and comic supernova whose explosions of pop culture riffs and impressions dazzled audiences for decades and made him a gleamy-eyed laureate for the Information Age, died Monday in an apparent suicide. He was 63.

Williams was pronounced dead at his San Francisco Bay Area home Monday, according to the sheriff's office in Marin County, north of San Francisco. The sheriff's office said the preliminary investigation shows the cause of death to be a suicide due to asphyxia.

The Marin County coroner's office said Williams was last been seen alive at home at about 10 p.m. Sunday. An emergency call from his house in Tiburon was placed to the Sheriff's Department shortly before noon Monday.

""This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken,"" said Williams' wife, Susan Schneider. ""On behalf of Robin's family, we are asking for privacy during our time of profound grief. As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.""

Williams had been battling severe depression recently, said Mara Buxbaum, his press representative. Just last month, he announced he was returning to a 12-step treatment program he said he needed after 18 months of nonstop work. He had sought treatment in 2006 after a relapse following 20 years of sobriety.

Power struggle deepens in Iraq as US increases its role in fighting Sunni militants

BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq's president snubbed incumbent Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and picked another politician Monday to form the next government, setting up a fierce political power struggle even as the country battles extremists in the north and west.

The showdown came as the United States increased its role in fighting back Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group that is threatening the autonomous Kurdish region in the north. Senior American officials said U.S. intelligence agencies are directly arming the Kurds who are battling the militants in what would be a shift in Washington's policy of only working through the central government in Baghdad.

U.S. warplanes carried out new strikes Sunday, hitting a convoy of Sunni militants moving to attack Kurdish forces defending the autonomous zone's capital, Irbil. The recent American airstrikes have helped the Kurds achieve one of their first victories after weeks of retreat as peshmerga fighters over the weekend recaptured two towns near Irbil. The Pentagon's director of operations said the effort will do little to slow Islamic State militants overall.

Haider al-Ibadi, the deputy speaker of parliament from al-Maliki's Shiite Dawa party, was selected by President Fouad Massoum to be the new prime minister and was given 30 days to present a new government to lawmakers for approval.

U.S. President Barack Obama called al-Ibadi's nomination a ""promising step forward"" and he urged ""all Iraqi political leaders to work peacefully through the political process.""

Iraq's Yazidis search for missing loved ones after chaotic escape from militants

SEMALKA, Syria (AP) — Trucks and jeeps trundled slowly across the pontoon bridge, packed with refugees, with children poking their dusty heads out of the windows and truck beds. Nearby, a distraught father frantically scanned them as they passed, hoping to catch sight of his missing son.

Beside him, a young man searched for his sister, who he fears was snatched by extremists.

Unknown numbers, perhaps hundreds, of men, women and children went missing in the chaos as tens of thousands of Iraqis from the Yazidi religious minority fled in a panic from marauding militants, then spent a week hidden in a barren mountain range before finally making their way into neighboring Syria. The loss of loved ones adds even more suffering to people who spent days stranded in the Sinjar mountains under a blazing son with barely any food or water.

Some of the missing may have been gunned down by militants during the escape. Others were lost as families scattered in panic under gunfire from extremists chasing them into the mountains. Dizzy from thirst, some adults lost track of children in the crowds in the mountains. Some women may have been abducted by militants, and Iraqi and U.S. officials say they believe hundreds of women are being held captive by the radical Islamic State group.

""There are many missing, many,"" said Naji Khano, who lost his 17-year-old son Sherwan as he fled gunmen.

Cease-fire takes hold in Gaza as Israeli, Palestinian negotiators begin talks in Cairo

CAIRO (AP) — As a new temporary truce took hold, negotiators from Israel and the Hamas militant group resumed indirect talks Monday to reach a long-term cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.

The two sides huddled in an Egyptian government building for nine consecutive hours, a Palestinian official said Monday, in what are expected to be marathon negotiations in the coming days.

The Palestinian delegations were more optimistic Monday, the Palestinian official told The Associated Press, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the negotiations with the media. He said progress was made on several issues.

The 72-hour truce, brokered by Egypt, took effect just after midnight, in the second attempt to halt a month of heavy fighting between the sides.

A similar three-day truce collapsed on Friday when militants resumed rocket fire on Israel after the sides were unable to make any headway in Egyptian-brokered negotiations for a more lasting deal. Hamas is seeking an end to an Israeli-Egyptian border blockade, while Israel wants Hamas to disarm.

7-year-old border blockade, imposed to isolate Hamas, has hurt Gaza's 1.8 million people

DEIR EL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Mohammed al-Telbani lost his life's work when Israeli shells repeatedly slammed into his four-story snack and cookie factory during the Gaza war, finally sparking a fire that engulfed vats of margarine and sacks of cocoa powder.

As he contemplated starting over, sitting near the smoldering ruins of one of Gaza's largest factories, he looked to Cairo for answers. There, negotiators from Israel and Hamas launched another attempt Monday to negotiate an end to the 34-day-old war — and, perhaps even more crucial for Gaza's 1.8 million people, reach a new border deal for the coastal territory.

Gazans haven't been able to trade or travel freely since Israel and Egypt imposed stringent border restrictions in response to the violent Hamas takeover of the territory in 2007. The closure also deepened Gaza's separation from the West Bank and east Jerusalem, areas on the opposite side of Israel that, along with Gaza, are envisioned as part of a future Palestinian state.

The blockade was meant to isolate the Islamic militant Hamas and perhaps loosen its grip on power. Seven years later, Hamas remains rooted in Gaza, albeit weakened by a financial crisis brought on by the closure as well as thousands of Israel airstrikes over the past month.

Gaza's civilians have borne the brunt of the blockade.

Witnesses: Black teen had hands raised when he was fatally shot by suburban St. Louis officer

FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — A black teenager who was fatally shot by a police officer had his hands raised when the officer approached with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly, according to two men who said they witnessed the shooting that sparked a night of unrest in suburban St. Louis.

The FBI opened an investigation Monday into the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after being confronted by an officer in Ferguson, a suburb of 21,000 that's nearly 70 percent black.

Authorities were vague about exactly what led the officer to open fire, except to say that the shooting was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man. It was unclear whether Brown or the man he was with was involved in the altercation.

Investigators have refused to publicly disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave. But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.

Brown ""was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,"" Walker told The Associated Press on Monday. The officer ""had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times."" The officer then ""stood over him and shot him"" after the victim fell wounded.

Ukraine: Red Cross will lead humanitarian aid mission into rebel-held territory

DONETSK, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian forces on Monday zeroed in on rebel strongholds as the government welcomed an international humanitarian relief mission into the rebellious east involving Russia, the United States and the European Union.

The mission will be conducted under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The organization said in a statement it is ready to facilitate the operation with the involvement of all sides concerned following a Russian initiative to provide humanitarian assistance to people in eastern Ukraine.

It wasn't clear when the deliveries would start.

""The practical details of this operation need to be clarified before this initiative can move forward,"" said Laurent Corbaz, the ICRC's head of operations for Europe and Central Asia.

Moscow had long urged Kiev to allow the aid delivery, but Ukraine and the West previously had opposed the move, fearing that it could serve as a pretext for sending Russian troops into rebel-held territory. Ukraine and the West have accused Moscow of arming and supporting the rebels fighting government troops in the east, a charge that the Kremlin has denied.

Liberia says its doctors will get experimental Ebola drug thus far only given to Westerners

MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — The Liberian government says it will receive doses of an experimental Ebola drug to treat doctors in the West African country.

The U.S. government confirmed that it had put Liberian officials in touch with the maker of ZMapp, and referred additional questions to Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc.

It was unclear how much of the treatment would be sent but government officials cautioned that the company had only a limited supply of the drug. The company said in a statement Monday that its supply had been exhausted.

Thus far, two Americans and a Spaniard have received the drug.

An outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has killed around 960 people so far.

Driver struck by Stewart's car dies of massive blunt trauma; had reputation as a wheelman

PORT LEYDEN, N.Y. (AP) — Kevin Ward Jr. was crafting a reputation as a wheelman, the kind of driver who could race vehicles on any track without fear.

He'd sit up on his seat, floor it, and zip his way through a maze of cars straight toward the front of the pack.

For points. For fun. Often for little money.

""He would go to tracks that a lot of other drivers wouldn't go to,"" Chuck Miller, the race director and president for the Empire Super Sprints circuit, said Monday. ""If we had co-sanctioned races with other organizations where we really weren't giving points or anything, but it was a deal where you wanted to see how you stacked up against the other competition, the Wards were willing to go and do that and see where they were at.""

Ward began racing go-karts in 1998 at age 4. In 2010, he moved on to sprint cars and was Empire Super Sprint racing rookie of the year in 2012. The 20-year-old raced mostly on dirt tracks a few hours from his home in Port Leyden, a village of 700 in northern New York.

In a kerfuffle about the Facebook messaging app? Here are 5 things you should know

NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook's recent effort to force people to adopt its standalone mobile messaging app has privacy-concerned users up in arms. Many of them believe the app is especially invasive.

One blog from the Huffington Post published in December has gone viral, making the rounds on the social network recently because it claims the app gives Facebook ""direct control over your mobile device"" and allows Facebook to call phone numbers without a users' intervention and send text messages without confirmation, but none of that is accurate.

In truth, Facebook Messenger isn't any more invasive than Facebook's main app —or other similar applications.

The fear and confusion stem from a message that greets owners of Android devices when they install the app. It explains that the app requires permission access to the device's camera, microphone, list of contacts and other information.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said during a press conference on Tuesday that the force had decided against releasing the cop's name after death threats were made against him on social media.

Brown, 18, was shot dead in the street on Saturday night by a police officer in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri.

Chief Jackson had planned to issue the name of the police officer at 1pm on Tuesday but said that he expected to now release it when the situation had calmed down.

The wrong cop - Officer Michael White - had been named on social media as the shooter which was false, said the police chief.

He told {ABC}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/US/police-releasing-cop-missouri-teen-shooting/story?id=24941866”>: 'We've been getting death threats as a result to that officer. Officer safety is why we are not releasing the name (of the officer who shot Brown.)

'It's too volatile and dangerous. We think that the value of releasing his name is far outweighed by the safety at this point.'

He said that the tragic events of Saturday started as a 'routine stop' and turned into a 'physical altercation'.

Chief Jackson said that the officer involved was undergoing psychological evaluations while on paid administrative leave.

The chief told reporters that the officer 'felt terrible about the whole thing' and was very hurt and sad.

The quiet suburb has erupted into violent clashes between officers and protesters as the community expresses its outrage over the student's death.

Police in riot gear fired tear gas on Monday night to try to disperse an agitated crowd. Hundreds gathered throughout Monday at the site of a burned-out convenience store in Ferguson, according to Chief Jackson.

Demonstrators turned rowdy at nightfall, throwing rocks at police before they were dispersed by volleys of bean-bag rounds and rubber bullets. Police said up to 15 people were arrested.

President Obama released a statement on Tuesday where he addressed the teen's shooting

He said: 'The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time. As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed.

'I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.

'We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.'

Between two nights of unrest, a community forum hosted by the local NAACP chapter on Monday drew hundreds to a sweltering church in the suburb where 18-year-old was shot multiple times and killed.

Witnesses have said that Brown had his hands raised when the unnamed officer approached with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly.

'People are tired. They have reached the end of their rope,' said Ruth Latchison Nichols after the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People forum, where many more were left waiting outside once the pews reached capacity.

'Enough is enough. This is a state of emergency.'

National NAACP President Cornell William Brooks implored residents to 'turn your anger into action' while condemning a violent response to Brown's death.

'To sneak around under the cover of darkness, to steal, to loot, to burn down your neighborhood - this does not require courage,' he said. 'Courage is when you strive for justice.'

'Martin Luther King did not live and die so that we may steal and lie in the middle of the night,' he added.

Brown's family has hired Benjamin Crump, the attorney who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager who was shot to death by a community watch volunteer George Zimmerman in 2012.

Louis Head, the dead teen's father, said on Monday: 'We need justice for our son.'

He was accompanied at a podium by his devastated wife Lesley McSpadden who was barely able to hold herself up.

The parents were joined by attorney Mr Crump. He said: 'I don't want to sugarcoat it, their baby was executed in broad daylight. That's why people are frustrated.'

Mr Crump told {CBS}<hyperlink=”http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-angry-protests-continue-in-ferguson-missouri/”> that Brown's parents have called for calm as the investigation into the shooting proceeds.

'Respect how they raised him in the fact that he was a nonviolent kid,' he said.

He also called for any witnesses who had pictures or video from around the time that the 18-year-old was shot to give them to the local NAACP or family attorneys if they did not want to deal with local police.

'We want you in the public to know if you were a witness to what happened, don't feel intimidated come forward,' the attorney added.

Police in riot gear fired tear gas to disperse a crowd estimated in the hundreds gathered near a building that burned during Sunday night's rioting, he said.

Fire trucks, ambulances and more officers converged on the area in a chaotic scene.

One officer in riot gear stood behind a squad car in a standoff with a group of young demonstrators.

Emergency services said they had responded to reports of a stabbing and a shooting, but had not confirmed such incidents and emergency workers were told later to pull back from the area.

A witness in the case told local media Brown had raised his arms to police to show he was unarmed before being killed.

'He just graduated and was on his way to college,' said Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, speaking through tears at a news conference. She said her first-born son was due to start at technical college on Monday.

'We can't even celebrate,' she said.

The FBI has opened an investigation into Brown's death, looking into possible civil rights violations.

It was not immediately clear from police why Brown was in the police car.

At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.

The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, police said.

Investigators have refused to publicly disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave.

But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.

The teenager 'was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,' Walker told The Associated Press.

The officer 'had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times'.

The officer then 'stood over him and shot him' after the victim fell wounded.

The teen's friend Dorian Johnson told television station KMOV that he and Brown had been walking when an officer confronted them, drew a weapon and shot.

Johnson said that Brown put his hands in the air and started to get down, but the officer kept shooting.

'We wasn't causing harm to nobody,' Johnson said. 'We had no weapons on us at all.'

The lawyer for Mr Johnson told {MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/michael-brown-shooting-witness_n_5671156.html?1407848585”> that police have not interviewed his client over Saturday's tragic events.

Attorney Freeman Bosley is representing the 22-year-old who was with Michael Brown when he was fatally shot on Saturday.

Mr Bosley told MSNBC: 'They didn’t even want to talk to him. They don’t want the facts. What they want is to justify what happened … what they are trying to do now is justify what happened instead of trying to point out the wrong. Something is wrong here and that’s what it is.'

Chief Jackson said there was plenty of physical evidence and witness testimony.

'I really believe we can get to the truth of what happened here,' he said.

Demonstrations to call for justice for Brown turned violent on Sunday night. Crowds broke the windows of cars and stores, set a building on fire and looted shops.

At least two dozen businesses were damaged, 32 people were arrested, and two officers injured.

'I think it is crazy. It's nonsense. What does it bring back? It's not going to bring the man back,' said Adrian Brewer, 30, an African-American from a city near Ferguson.

Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered earlier on Monday at the town's police station to demand that the officer responsible for Brown's death face murder charges. Police arrested up to 15 people during that mostly peaceful demonstration.

On Monday night, demonstrators driven out by tear gas gathered at the station, chanting 'hands up, don't shoot.'

Brown's mother said her son had been planning to study heating and air conditioning repair at a technical college.

Michael Brown Sr, the teen's father, told reporters his son was 'silly' and 'could make you laugh'.

Three of the Ferguson Police Department's 53 members are black, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said.

Jackson said there's no video footage of the shooting from any surrounding surveillance cameras or any police dash-cams.

The police department recently bought cameras for officers to wear on their uniforms but they have not been put into use yet.

About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures.

Ferguson's median household income is $37,517, less than the Missouri average of $47,333.

Most of the communities around Ferguson have gone from white to mostly black in the last 40 years, said Terry Jones, political science professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis.

'There's a long history of racial injustice,' said Jones. 'Slowly and not so surely, the St. Louis metropolitan area has been trying to figure out a way forward. As the Michael Brown shooting indicates, there are often setbacks.'",9,NA,NA,NA

African Americans use Twitter to protest the photo of Michael Brown that media uses of the dead teen,James Rush,8/12/2014,12/4/2015,"The media portrayal of African Americans has come under heavy scrutiny in the wake of the police killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown as many outlets used a photo of the teen throwing what could be perceived as a gang sign instead of a clearer, more thoughtful photo.

The 18-year-old died after he was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, sparking looting and riots across the city.

Now African Americans across the country have started posting contrasting images of themselves to Twitter along with the hashtag #iftheygunnedmedown, in protest to the way the media portrays black people.

Lawyer CJ Lawrence was the first to use the hashtag when he posted it along with a picture of him speaking at his university graduation, alongside former president Bill Clinton, as well as a picture of him dressed as a rapper at a Halloween party.

The question poses which picture the media would choose to use if he was shot and became the subject of a news report.

According to {BBC Trending}<hyperlink=”http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-28742301?ocid=socialflow_twitter”>, Mr Lawrence described how while the question was a rhetorical one, 'in reality it's something we ask ourselves every day as African Americans.'

Mr Lawrence said he decided to raise the issue after becoming frustrated by the pictures used by the media of Mr Brown in news reports of his killing.

Mr Lawrence said while a graduation picture was widely used initially, an image of Mr Brown wearing a sports top and appearing to make a hand gesture, which could have been interpreted by some as a gang-sign, became more popular in subsequent reports.

The hashtag has now been used by dozens of Twitter users posting two pictures of themselves in different situations.

In one picture, the poster is usually in what could be seen as a 'positive' role, while in the other image the Twitter user is in what could be regarded as a 'negative' role.

The posts pose the question, which image would be used in their portrayal in the media if they were shot in a similar incident which led to the death of Mr Brown.

The FBI has opened an investigation into Mr Brown's death, looking into possible civil rights violations. Witnesses have said that Mr Brown had his hands raised when the unidentified officer approached with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly.

Mr Brown's parents have been among those calling for calm. His family members, who had planned to drop him off at a technical college on Monday to begin his studies, have asked people to share any information and videos they might have related to the shooting.

Authorities have so far been vague about exactly what led the officer to open fire, except to say that the shooting - which is being investigated by the St. Louis County police at the smaller city's request - was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man in which the officer's weapon discharged one time inside a patrol car.

Investigators have refused to publicly disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave. But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Mr Brown on the street.

Mr Brown 'was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,' Mr Walker told The Associated Press. The officer 'had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times.' The officer then 'stood over him and shot him' after the victim fell wounded.

Dorian Johnson offered a similar account, telling KMOV-TV that he and Mr Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Mr Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of the vehicle.

Mr Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Mr Brown got scared and ran away.

'He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,' Mr Johnson said. 'But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.'

'We wasn't causing harm to nobody,' Mr Johnson said. 'We had no weapons on us at all.'

Mr Walker said that he did not see a scuffle or the circumstances that preceded the first gunshot.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said there's no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex or from any police dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but has not yet put to use.

Some civil rights leaders have drawn comparisons between Mr Brown's death and that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch volunteer who was later acquitted of murder charges.

'Instead of celebrating his future, they are having to plan his funeral,' said Benjamin Crump, a family attorney who also represented Mr Martin's relatives after he was slain in 2012 in Florida.

'I don't want to sugarcoat it,' Mr Crump added. Mr Brown 'was executed in broad daylight.'

Police in riot gear last night fired tear gas into a crowd of protesters in Ferguson as tension rose even amid calls for collective calm.

Between two nights of unrest, a community forum hosted by the local chapter of the NAACP civil rights group Monday night drew hundreds to a sweltering church in Ferguson, a St. Louis County suburb of 21,000 that's nearly 70 per cent black.

Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, said a large crowd that gathered throughout the day yesterday at the site of a burned-out convenience store turned rowdy at nightfall, throwing rocks at police. Officers used tear gas and shot 'beanbag rounds' meant to stun them, he said.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said there were at least five arrests and no reports of looting. Nearly three dozen people had been arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night when crowds burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers.

'People are tired. They have reached the end of their rope,' said Ruth Latchison Nichols after the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People forum, where many more were left waiting outside once the pews reached capacity. 'Enough is enough. This is a state of emergency.'

National NAACP President Cornell William Brooks implored residents to 'turn your anger into action' while condemning a violent response to Mr Brown's death.

'To sneak around under the cover of darkness, to steal, to loot, to burn down your neighborhood - this does not require courage,' he said. 'Courage is when you strive for justice.'

'Martin Luther King did not live and die so that we may steal and lie in the middle of the night,' he added.",25,NA,NA,NA

Friend recounts Michael Brown's last words and actions before police shot the unarmed teen dead",Louise Boyle,8/12/2014,12/4/2015,"A friend of Michael Brown, who was with the teen when he was shot dead by police on Saturday, said he watched as the 18-year-old held up his empty hands to a cop and begged him not to shoot because he was unarmed.

Dorian Johnson, 22, was walking with his friend 'Big Mike' on Saturday evening, when he said the pair were stopped by an officer in a squad car in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri.Mr Johnson said that he and Brown were walking home from a store when the cop told them to get out of the street and 'get the f***' on to the sidewalk'.

Johnson said they kept walking after explaining to the officer they were almost home. The officer then pulled his truck in front of them and blocked the road, Johnson said.

The friend said the officer threw open the door which slammed closed again after bouncing off Brown. It was then that the officer grabbed his friend by the neck.

He told {MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”> today: 'The time frame was 60 seconds or less, it got out of hand really quickly.'

Johnson said that the officer had drawn his gun by this time and threatened to shoot Michael.

'I seen the fire come out of the barrel,' he told the network. 'I could see so vividly what was going on because I was so close.'

Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away but he could already see that the teenager had blood coming down his shirt where he had been shot.

The 22-year-old ducked behind a car but Brown kept running.

'He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,' Johnson said.

The 22-year-old said: '[Brown] stopped, turned with his hands up and said ''I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!''

'But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.'

The eye-witness said despite the teenager's protests, the officer shot again, hitting Brown and leaving him on the ground.

Mr Johnson told the TV station on Tuesday that he ran in terror to his apartment and vomited, before checking he had not been shot.

He came out from his apartment to see his friend lying dead in the middle of the street.

'We wasn’t causing harm to nobody,' Johnson added. 'We had no weapons on us at all.'

The 22-year-old spoke to MSNBC on Tuesday alongside his attorney, and former St Louis' mayor, Freeman Bosley Jr.

The lawyer said that he has offered police the opportunity to interview his client about Saturday's tragic events but they have declined to take it.

Mr Bosley said: 'They didn't even want to talk to him. They don’t want the facts. What they want is to justify what happened … what they are trying to do now is justify what happened instead of trying to point out the wrong. Something is wrong here and that’s what it is.'

Police have offered a different version of events of the altercation which led to the fatal shooting on Saturday.

Authorities said that while the officer was exiting his car, he was physically assaulted by Brown and there was a struggle over the cop's weapon.

Police do not dispute that the officer shot the subject multiple times and that the deceased was not armed.

Ferguson police said on Tuesday that they would not be releasing the name of the officer involved in the shooting because of death threats on social media.

Brown's shooting has sparked riots in the streets of suburban Ferguson, Missouri, where 70 per cent of the population is African-American but in a 53-strong police force there are only three black officers.

Riot police deployed tear gas and bean-bag rounds on Monday night to disperse an agitated crowd.

Mr Johnson said that he was still in shock over his friend's death and how quickly the situation escalated.

He described the 18-year-old, who was due to start technical college on Monday, as 'a quiet, kind and gentle' person.",62,NA,NA,NA

Michael Brown wrote in a Facebook message: 'If I leave this earth today, at least you'll know I care about others more than I cared about my damn self.'

Friends told MailOnline that the message was 'typical' of Michael and that he was selfless and always willing to help others.

He was a 'gentle giant' - timid and quiet yet 6ft 4 tall and 300lbs - raising the possibility that the cop who killed him may have been intimidated by his size.

But to those around him, there was nothing in his nature that was violent.

Monday would have been Michael's first day at college in the first step towards his dream of one day opening his own business.

But all those hopes were dashed in one confrontation on a street in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri on Saturday with a white policeman.

The killing was the spark that ignited long-running tensions with the police department and set off three nights of rioting, looting and the protests of an entire community demanding justice.

Family and friends have complained that amid the rage, tear gas and street battles, their son is being forgotten.

Michael’s mother Lesley McSpadden and father, Michael Sr, are divorced but in their grief their love for their son has reunited them.

The case has now drawn the attention of President Obama who said in a statement that it was 'heartbreaking'. After being shown the message Lesley nodded her head approvingly.

Standing outside of her mother’s home, where Michael was walking to when he was shot dead, Lesley told MailOnline: 'We are going to make a lot of noise about this. This isn’t going away'.

Her determination is all too apparent: on the back window of her car she has written: 'Justice for my son' in white paint.

Pastor Charles Ewing, who helped raise Michael and was his uncle, told MailOnline that the teenager had wanted to be a heating and cooling engineer because it would be a 'good job with a good wage'.

He said: 'People said to him that because he was so big he should play football in college but he was too timid.

'He received Jesus into his life about two weeks ago. It was something that his grandmother had been talking to him about for some time. It was with her church. I was so elated - at least he has that now'.

Pastor Ewing said that on the night that Michael was killed he was wearing flip flops, a t-shirt, shorts and a hat.

He said: 'There was no chance he was going to be able to run off'.

Eric Davis, Michael’s cousin, described him as a 'big gentle soul'.He said: 'Michael used to come round my house all the time when he was a boy and play with my son.

'They used to sit there for hours playing computer games like NBA2K. He didn’t want to go outside and play with his friends.

'We used to ask them if they needed anything and they would just say: ""Can you get us some food?""

'Michael was meek and quiet but he loved Thanksgiving when about 30 grandkids and eight siblings who would go to his grandmother’s house.'

Michael split his time between his mother’s house and his grandmother’s place in Ferguson, a working class community of 21,000 people where nearly a quarter of people live below the poverty line.

It is overwhelmingly African-American, but all save three of the 53 police officers in the town's force are white, including the chief.

To become a success from such humble roots would have required an admirable determination on Michael's part - but it seems he was up to the task.

He attended Normandy High School where a former classmate told MailOnline that he was quiet and did not talk much but stayed out of trouble.

He also had a great sense of humour and was always going to make something of his life, friends said.

Hershel Johnson, who knew Michael since middle school, told the {St Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/michael-brown-remembered-as-a-gentle-giant/article_cbafa12e-7305-5fd7-8e0e-3139f472d130.html”>: 'We were at graduation, me and him, and we were talking. He said he wasn’t going to end up like some people on the streets. He was going to get an education. He was going to make his life a whole a lot better.'

As a freshman Michael was in Junior ROTC and whilst he was a sophomore he played football.

He switched to McCluer High School in nearby Ferguson-Florissant and then returned to Normandy for his senior year.

There he put in the hours in a credit recovery programme which meant he could graduate in May instead of going to summer school or repeating a year.

Relatives said he did it for his mother out of respect and love for her.

Friend Gerard Fuller told the St Louis Post-Dispatch that Michael was not like his other friends and that he did not want to become a basketball or football player.

The two bonded over their love of rap and Gerard recalled how Michael used to listen to Tupac on his headphones - recently he had tried some rapping of his own under the name 'Big Mike' and his videos posted on Facebook had been a hit among friends.

Michael's graduation day was on May 22 and a picture taken then shows him smiling in his green gown after being given his diploma.

It would have been one of the proudest days of his life, and that of his parents.

Friend Raquan Smith said: 'After that was done and people were leaving, I remember seeing him off to the side. He kind of just came up to me and said: ""We made it"".

'""Yeah man, we made it"", I told him. It was a breath of fresh air to know someone else shared the struggle in school. And now we were starting a whole new life.'

Other family members have described Michael as a 'sharer' and a 'giver' who would give away candy in middle school that he was selling.

While Michael should have been starting at Vatterott College, a local trade school, and his friends are leaving for colleges elsewhere his family are planning his funeral.

Pictures posted on Michael’s Facebook page show he adored his family and a number of photos show him holding a baby girl, thought to be his niece.

Michael’s aunt Elizabeth Spivey has said: 'He wasn't a violent person. He was peaceful. He was a gentle giant. He looked like he could really do something but he wouldn't.'

The most heartbreaking interviews however come from Lesley and Michael Sr.

She has described her son as a 'big teddy bear' and said that Michael was 'the type of person that everybody flocked to'.

Lesley, 34, told {USA Today}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/11/michael-brown-police-shot-teen/13895981/”>: 'He wanted to be really good in visual arts and heating and cooling. He was really good with his hands and taking things apart and putting them back together. He was almost like a healer.

'He fixed things. He didn't create problems. He fixed things. My son was sweet. He didn't mean any harm to anybody.'

Michael Sr has broken down in tears and has called for calm, adding that his son would not have wanted violence after his death.

He has said: 'He wouldn’t have wanted none of that. We're going to do it the right way. But we need justice for our son'.",26,NA,NA,NA

(AP) — After an unarmed black teenager was shot by a police officer, a St. Louis suburb endured two nights of violence sparked by racial tensions. Here's a look at the key elements of the shooting and the unrest that followed:

THE SHOOTING: Authorities have been vague about what led the officer to open fire, saying only that Saturday's shooting was preceded by some kind of scuffle between the officer and a man. At some point during that altercation, the officer's weapon discharged inside a patrol car. Two witnesses who said they saw the shooting reported that 18-year-old Michael Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.

Ferguson police confirmed that Brown was shot multiple times. They say there's no video footage of the shooting from any nearby buildings or any police dashboard cameras.

The officer who fired on Brown has not been publicly identified. One of the witnesses said he was white.

THE UNREST: On two consecutive nights, crowds have gathered to protest Brown's death, sometimes looting stores, setting fire to buildings and vandalizing property. They also taunted police and assaulted journalists. More than three dozen people have been arrested. Brown's family and civil-rights groups have pleaded for the community to stay calm.

THE INVESTIGATION: Brown's death is being investigated by St. Louis County police at the request of the smaller police department in Ferguson. The FBI has also opened an investigation, looking into possible civil rights violations. Attorney General Eric Holder said such inquiries are ""critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.""

THE PUBLIC DISCUSSION: Some civil rights leaders have drawn comparisons between Brown's death and that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder charges. The St. Louis case provoked a broad discussion on social media sites about the death of young black men in racially tinged shootings. On Twitter, a campaign using the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown prompted many black users to post photos of themselves and ask how they might be portrayed in news reports if they became shooting victims.",NA,NA,NA,NA
DailyMail,daily18,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2722598/Missouri-shooting-victim-called-quiet-respectful.html,"Missouri shooting victim called quiet, respectful",Associated Press,8/12/2014,12/4/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Michael Brown Sr. stood alone in the center of the narrow street where the blood of his namesake son still stained the gray pavement, two days after the 18-year-old was shot dead by a police officer. He straightened a waist-high wooden cross and re-lit the candles erected as part of a makeshift memorial.

""Big Mike,"" as some of his friends called Michael Brown Jr., wasn't the type to fight, family and neighbors said, though he lived in a restless neighborhood where police were on frequent patrol. His parents and neighbors described him as a good-hearted kid with an easy smile who certainly wouldn't have condoned the violence and looting that spread though his north St. Louis suburb following his death.

""He was funny, silly, he would make you laugh,"" his father said, and when there was ""any problem going on, any situation, there wasn't nothing that he couldn't solve. He could bring people back together.""

Brown, who was unarmed, was shot Saturday by a Ferguson police officer while walking with a friend down the center of the street. Police have said a scuffle broke out after the officer asked the boys to move to the side. Witnesses say Brown's arms were in the air — in a sign of surrender — as a white policeman repeatedly shot the black youth.

After a vigil Sunday night, an angry crowd looted stores, and a night later police in Ferguson fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse protesters. The U.S. Justice Department has announced that its civil rights division is investigating, and Brown's family retained the same lawyer who represented relatives of Trayvon Martin — the Florida teen killed in a racially charged 2012 shooting. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton joined the family Tuesday to urge protesters to refrain from violence.

Brown was among a small group of students who had graduated Aug. 1 from Normandy High School, needing the summer to finish their required credits. He was to have started college his week for a career in heating and air conditioning engineering.

""We can't even celebrate; we've got to plan a funeral,"" said his tearful mother, Lesley McSpadden.

Brown had been staying at his grandmother's apartment when the shooting occurred, and family and neighbors said he had long shied away from confrontation.

Because he was big, he gave football a try his sophomore year of high school. But he quit before the first game, said cousin Eric Davis.

""Him being a gentle spirit, he was like,'I don't like to hit people,'"" Davis said Tuesday. ""'He would be like, I might hurt him. I don't want to hurt him.'""

A couple of weeks before his death, Brown had confessed Jesus as his savior, said a great-uncle, pastor Charles Ewing. Shortly thereafter, Brown had a dream in which he saw a body laying covered by a sheet, Ewing said.

""He didn't know whose body it was,"" Ewing said, his voice cracking. ""He said, 'One day, the whole world is going to know my name' ... not knowing this is what was going to happen.""

Neighbor Sharon Johnson, 58, said Brown frequently stopped to chat with her, including about his faith.

""He had a more mature mind than a little boy's mind,"" she said.

On Monday, Johnson was standing at the side of the street where Brown was shot as a woman who had driven in from a nearby community preached loudly to anyone willing to listen about the importance of peaceful protests and parental discipline for teenagers.

A passing car stopped, letting out a man wearing a newly made black T-shirt bearing Brown's baby picture and the words ""NO JUSTICE NO PEACE.""

""I'm his father,"" he said somberly, eliciting hugs.

The older Brown picked up a piece of cardboard that had been lying on the ground. ""End police brutality,"" it read. He placed it on a pile of toy animals stacked by a streetlight pole, then set about straightening up his son's mid-street memorial.

He had just returned to the grass when a gunshot rang out. Then another. And another. It was time to go.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The president, who is currently vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, offered his 'deepest condolences' to the family of the 18-year-old who was shot up to eight times by a police officer, who witnesses claim then fired on Brown as he lay wounded on the street.

The message from the president was followed by one from Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, who was asked if she had a message to the policeman who shot her son.

She said: 'If he did something wrong, you know you did something wrong. You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.'

The days since the incident, which unfolded in broad daylight on Saturday, have been marked by riots and looting by Brown's incensed supporters who have clashed with heavily-armed police on the streets of suburban St. Louis.

'The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time,' said the president in his statement on the teens controversial death.

'I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,' the President said in the statement.

'We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.'

Seeking to diffuse tensions in the community, the president said that in addition to the FBI, Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice have begun investigations into Brown's death.

The president's statement on the tragic shooting follows Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson backtracking on his promise to name the officer who shot Brown - claiming he would be putting the man's life in danger if he did.

According to witnesses, the officer is apparently white and opened fire on Brown while his hands were raised.

The decision by Jackson to renege on his vow to name the officer by 2pm on Tuesday was met with heavy criticism by Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr.

'This person's got to pay for this,' said Brown Sr.

'If the name of the victim is released, how is the name of the perpetrator not released? We cannot in good conscience ask for toxicology tests of Mr. Brown without asking for it of the officer,' said Jamal Bryant, a pastor who appeared at a press conference with the Browns, their attorney Benjamin Crump, and the Reverend Al Sharpton today according to {ABC News}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/US/president-obama-calls-shooting-missouri-teen-heartbreaking/story?id=24941866&page=2”>.

Jackson said he decided not to name the officer after another of his staff was falsely named as the shooter.

'We've been getting death threats as a result to that officer. Officer safety is why we are not releasing the name (of the officer who shot Brown.)

'It's too volatile and dangerous. We think that the value of releasing his name is far outweighed by the safety at this point.'

However, as Ferguson, St. Louis, faces another tense night, Michael Brown's parents urged the community and and civil rights leaders to appeal for calm and to cease rioting.

'I just want justice for my son. I really do. I need justice for my son,' said Michael Brown, Sr. to {ABC News}<hyperlink=”http://abcnews.go.com/US/president-obama-calls-shooting-missouri-teen-heartbreaking/story?id=24941866&page=2”>.

'I understand everybody has their own pains because they have losses too, but I need everyone to come together and do this the right way so we can get something done about this. No violence, man.'.

The town of Ferguson has been on edge since Michael Brown, 18, and another teenager were confronted by an officer Saturday near Brown's apartment.

Police say one of the teens shoved the officer back into his car and a struggle ensued. Brown was struck by several bullets after emerging from the car.

Eyewitnesses have said Brown was raising his hands in surrender and that the officer kept firing. Authorities had said they would release the officer's name Tuesday but later decided not to, citing death threats against the officer.

(AP) — Racial tensions have run high for decades in this former railroad town that was once a mostly white St. Louis suburb until school busing and urban decay sent many families packing for more distant communities.

Today, Ferguson is nearly 70 percent black, but the law here is still enforced by a police department that is more than 90 percent white, a fact that helps engender widespread distrust of officers — never more so than last weekend, when a white officer shot and killed an unarmed young black man who was about to start college.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said 50 of the city's 53 police officers are white. He said he made recruiting and promoting black officers a priority when he took over four years ago after a three-decade police career in St. Louis and St. Louis County.

Jackson said he promoted two black officers to sergeant in his first year in Ferguson, though one of those officers has since left for a better-paying job.

""I'm constantly trying to recruit African-Americans and other minorities,"" he said. ""But it's an uphill battle. The minority makeup of this police department is not where I want it to be.""

The suburb of 21,000 has been on edge since Michael Brown, 18, and another teenager were confronted by an officer Saturday near Brown's apartment. Police say one of the teens shoved the officer back into his car and a struggle ensued. Brown was struck by several bullets after emerging from the car.

On Monday night, police used tear gas and fired ""bean bag"" rounds after a crowd turned rowdy, throwing rocks and bottles at officers. No serious injuries were reported.

Ferguson was once a middle-class suburban town known for its sprawling parks and tidy brick homes. For many years, it was largely white.

Over the past few decades, the demographics changed. As St. Louis city schools deteriorated, a voluntary busing program started in the 1980s that allowed parents to send their children to suburban districts. Some black families decided to leave the city, and the crime, behind and moved to nearby suburbs such as Ferguson.

As more black residents moved in, whites in Ferguson began to move to outer suburbs.

The elected leadership of Ferguson — the mayor and five of the six city council members — are also white.

Mayor James Knowles III said he's having a hard time with the image of Ferguson as a racially divided, riot-torn place.

""We're all broken-hearted, regardless of our race,"" Knowles said. ""This is not representative of our community.""

Some of the town's young blacks feel unfairly targeted by police.

Jarrett Snider, 19, said he was stopped while walking in his neighborhood. He showed his identification, but the officer still called for several backup units.

""You get harassed,"" said Snider, who lives in the apartment complex near where Brown was shot and described himself as a good friend of Brown. ""It's too much. ... Mike's situation is not the first time.""

Stephen Bussey, 29, said he was recently stopped by an officer while walking to a convenience store before his pre-dawn shift at a fast-food restaurant.

""The cop told me I looked like a guy who robbed a bank nearby,"" Bussey said. ""I didn't make a big deal about it. But since when is walking a crime?""

The mayor acknowledged the resentment.

""The African-American community — youth in the African-American community in particular — has something against law enforcement in many ways,"" Knowles said. ""They don't like law enforcement, and they don't think law enforcement likes them.""

Knowles said that suspicion is part of the reason the city has so few black officers.

""We don't get nearly as many African-American applicants as we would like,"" he said.

University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist David Klinger said there are no reliable statistics on police-involved shootings in the St. Louis region, but he said police in the U.S. kill at least a few hundred suspects every year.

Klinger, who has led two federally funded studies on police shootings and interviewed about 300 officers involved in those incidents, said police often show tremendous restraint, refraining from shooting suspects who come at them with knives or guns. Sometimes, he said, they simply have no choice but to fire.

In other instances, mistakes are made.

""Officers really aren't out there to shoot people,"" Klinger said. ""That doesn't mean there aren't knucklehead cops out there. But the vast majority of officers have held their fire far more often than they've pulled the trigger.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

'You take your punishment,' Lesley McSpadden told reporters. 'If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.'

Her plea comes as Ferguson police remained mum on the name of the officer in question, whose decision to shoot Brown on Saturday has triggered widespread unrest in the African American communities in Missouri and nationwide.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said during a press conference on Tuesday that the force had decided against releasing the cop's name after death threats were made against him on social media.

Brown, 18, was shot dead in the street on Saturday night by the police officer in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri.

Chief Jackson had planned to issue the name of the police officer at 1pm on Tuesday but said that he expected to now release it when the situation had calmed down.

The wrong cop - Officer Michael White - had been named on social media as the shooter which was false, said the police chief.

He told {ABC}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/police-releasing-cop-missouri-teen-shooting/story?id=24941866"">: 'We've been getting death threats as a result to that officer. Officer safety is why we are not releasing the name (of the officer who shot Brown.)

'It's too volatile and dangerous. We think that the value of releasing his name is far outweighed by the safety at this point.'

He said that the tragic events of Saturday started as a 'routine stop' and turned into a 'physical altercation'.

Chief Jackson said that the officer involved was undergoing psychological evaluations while on paid administrative leave.

The chief told reporters that the officer 'felt terrible about the whole thing' and was very hurt and sad.

The quiet suburb has erupted into violent clashes between officers and protesters as the community expresses its outrage over the student's death.

Police in riot gear fired tear gas on Monday night to try to disperse an agitated crowd. Hundreds gathered throughout Monday at the site of a burned-out convenience store in Ferguson, according to Chief Jackson.

Demonstrators turned rowdy at nightfall, throwing rocks at police before they were dispersed by volleys of bean-bag rounds and rubber bullets. Police said up to 15 people were arrested.

President Obama released a statement on Tuesday where he addressed the teen's shooting

He said: 'The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time. As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed.

'I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.

'We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.'

Between two nights of unrest, a community forum hosted by the local NAACP chapter on Monday drew hundreds to a sweltering church in the suburb where 18-year-old was shot multiple times and killed.

Witnesses have said that Brown had his hands raised when the unnamed officer approached with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly.

'People are tired. They have reached the end of their rope,' said Ruth Latchison Nichols after the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People forum, where many more were left waiting outside once the pews reached capacity.

'Enough is enough. This is a state of emergency.'

National NAACP President Cornell William Brooks implored residents to 'turn your anger into action' while condemning a violent response to Brown's death.

'To sneak around under the cover of darkness, to steal, to loot, to burn down your neighborhood - this does not require courage,' he said. 'Courage is when you strive for justice.'

'Martin Luther King did not live and die so that we may steal and lie in the middle of the night,' he added.

Brown's family has hired Benjamin Crump, the attorney who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager who was shot to death by a community watch volunteer George Zimmerman in 2012.

Louis Head, the dead teen's father, said on Monday: 'We need justice for our son.'

He was accompanied at a podium by his devastated wife Lesley McSpadden who was barely able to hold herself up.

The parents were joined by attorney Mr Crump. He said: 'I don't want to sugarcoat it, their baby was executed in broad daylight. That's why people are frustrated.'

Mr Crump told {CBS}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-angry-protests-continue-in-ferguson-missouri/""> that Brown's parents have called for calm as the investigation into the shooting proceeds.

'Respect how they raised him in the fact that he was a nonviolent kid,' he said.

He also called for any witnesses who had pictures or video from around the time that the 18-year-old was shot to give them to the local NAACP or family attorneys if they did not want to deal with local police.

'We want you in the public to know if you were a witness to what happened, don't feel intimidated come forward,' the attorney added.

Police in riot gear fired tear gas to disperse a crowd estimated in the hundreds gathered near a building that burned during Sunday night's rioting, he said.

Fire trucks, ambulances and more officers converged on the area in a chaotic scene.

One officer in riot gear stood behind a squad car in a standoff with a group of young demonstrators.

Emergency services said they had responded to reports of a stabbing and a shooting, but had not confirmed such incidents and emergency workers were told later to pull back from the area.

A witness in the case told local media Brown had raised his arms to police to show he was unarmed before being killed.

'He just graduated and was on his way to college,' said Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, speaking through tears at a news conference. She said her first-born son was due to start at technical college on Monday.

'We can't even celebrate,' she said.

The FBI has opened an investigation into Brown's death, looking into possible civil rights violations.

It was not immediately clear from police why Brown was in the police car.

At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.

The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, police said.

Investigators have refused to publicly disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave.

But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.

The teenager 'was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,' Walker told The Associated Press.

The officer 'had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times'.

The officer then 'stood over him and shot him' after the victim fell wounded.

The teen's friend Dorian Johnson told television station KMOV that he and Brown had been walking when an officer confronted them, drew a weapon and shot.

Johnson said that Brown put his hands in the air and started to get down, but the officer kept shooting.

'We wasn't causing harm to nobody,' Johnson said. 'We had no weapons on us at all.'

The lawyer for Mr Johnson told {MSNBC}<hyperlink-""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/michael-brown-shooting-witness_n_5671156.html?1407848585""> that police have not interviewed his client over Saturday's tragic events.

Attorney Freeman Bosley is representing the 22-year-old who was with Michael Brown when he was fatally shot on Saturday.

Mr Bosley told MSNBC: 'They didn’t even want to talk to him. They don’t want the facts. What they want is to justify what happened … what they are trying to do now is justify what happened instead of trying to point out the wrong. Something is wrong here and that’s what it is.'

Chief Jackson said there was plenty of physical evidence and witness testimony.

'I really believe we can get to the truth of what happened here,' he said.

Demonstrations to call for justice for Brown turned violent on Sunday night. Crowds broke the windows of cars and stores, set a building on fire and looted shops.

At least two dozen businesses were damaged, 32 people were arrested, and two officers injured.

'I think it is crazy. It's nonsense. What does it bring back? It's not going to bring the man back,' said Adrian Brewer, 30, an African-American from a city near Ferguson.

Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered earlier on Monday at the town's police station to demand that the officer responsible for Brown's death face murder charges. Police arrested up to 15 people during that mostly peaceful demonstration.

On Monday night, demonstrators driven out by tear gas gathered at the station, chanting 'hands up, don't shoot.'

Brown's mother said her son had been planning to study heating and air conditioning repair at a technical college.

Michael Brown Sr, the teen's father, told reporters his son was 'silly' and 'could make you laugh'.

Three of the Ferguson Police Department's 53 members are black, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said.

Jackson said there's no video footage of the shooting from any surrounding surveillance cameras or any police dash-cams.

The police department recently bought cameras for officers to wear on their uniforms but they have not been put into use yet.

About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures.

Ferguson's median household income is $37,517, less than the Missouri average of $47,333.

Most of the communities around Ferguson have gone from white to mostly black in the last 40 years, said Terry Jones, political science professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis.

'There's a long history of racial injustice,' said Jones. 'Slowly and not so surely, the St. Louis metropolitan area has been trying to figure out a way forward. As the Michael Brown shooting indicates, there are often setbacks.'",71,NA,NA,NA

BAGHDAD (AP) — His days in power in Iraq appear increasingly numbered. World leaders, including his biggest ally, Iran, hail the nomination of the man who would be his successor.

There's seemingly little left for Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to cling to, beyond the support of party stalwarts and high-ranking loyalists in the military.

Al-Maliki looked even more isolated Tuesday, a day after Iraq's president appointed Haider al-Abadi as prime minister-designate to form a caretaker government — a move seen as a major step toward breaking the political deadlock that has paralyzed the country since April elections. It also comes after Islamic extremists have swept across northern Iraq, prompting the U.S. to launch airstrikes and directly arm Kurds who are battling the militants.

Despite the backing he enjoys among the top military brass, al-Maliki told the Iraqi army Tuesday to keep out of politics and focus on protecting the nation.

Al-Maliki, who has been in power for eight years, insists he should keep his post as prime minister of the Shiite-led government for a third term because his bloc won the most seats in the assembly, even though he has lost some support with the main coalition of Shiite parties.

Actress Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart partner, dead at 89 in New York

NEW YORK (AP) — Lauren Bacall was a movie star from almost her first moment on the silver screen.

A fashion model and bit-part New York actress before moving to Hollywood at 19, Bacall achieved immediate fame in 1944 with one scene in her first film, ""To Have and Have Not."" Leaving Humphrey Bogart's hotel room, Bacall — a lanky figure with flowing blond hair and a stunning face — murmured:

""You don't have to say anything, and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.""

With that cool, sultry come-on, not only was a star born, but the beginning of a legend, her title burnished over the years with pivotal roles, signature New York wit, and a marriage to Bogart that accounted for one of the most famous Hollywood couples of all time.

Bacall died Monday at the age of 89 in New York, according to the managing partner of the Humphrey Bogart Estate, Robbert J.F. de Klerk. Bacall's son Stephen Bogart confirmed his mother's death to de Klerk. She was pronounced dead at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center at 5:21 p.m. Tuesday, according to Kathleen Robinson, the hospital's media relations director.

With cease-fire deadline looming, Egypt proposes plan aimed at ending war in Gaza.

CAIRO (AP) — Egypt presented a proposed cease-fire to Israel and Hamas aimed at ending the monthlong war, Palestinian officials said early Wednesday after negotiators huddled for a second day of Egyptian-mediated talks meant to resolve the crisis and bring relief to the embattled Gaza Strip.

Palestinian officials told The Associated Press early Wednesday morning that Egypt's proposal calls for easing parts of the Israeli blockade of Gaza, bringing some relief to the territory. But it leaves the key areas of disagreement, including the Islamic militant group Hamas' demand for a full lifting of the blockade and Israeli calls for Hamas to disarm, to later negotiations.

If the sides accept the proposal it would have a significant impact on Palestinians in Gaza as it would improve the movement of individuals and merchandise to the West Bank, the officials said. Gaza exports and other businesses have been hit hard by restrictions imposed on the territory by Israel and Egypt after Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007.

One of the Palestinian officials who spoke to AP said that according to the Egyptian proposal the blockade would be gradually eased.

He said it would stipulate that Israel would end airstrikes on militants, and a 500-meter (547-yard) buffer zone next to the Gaza and Israel frontier would be reduced over time, he said.

Sharpton urges peaceful protests, says police must identify officer who shot Missouri teen

FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — The Rev. Al Sharpton pressed police Tuesday to release the name of the officer who fatally shot an unarmed teenager in suburban St. Louis, and he pleaded for calm after two nights of violent protests over the young man's death.

Police said death threats prompted them to withhold the name of the officer, who was placed on administrative leave after fatally shooting 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, where the incident has stoked racial tension, rallies and a night of looting.

Investigators have released few details, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Brown and another teen to get out of the street. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, police said.

""The local authorities have put themselves in a position — hiding names and not being transparent — where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,"" Sharpton said during a news conference in St. Louis where he was joined by Brown's parents.

He also echoed pleas for peaceful protests by the NAACP and Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., who told the crowd: ""I need all of us to come together and do this right. ... No violence.""

Family and neighbors describe Missouri teenager fatally shot by police as quiet, respectful

FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Michael Brown Sr. stood alone in the center of the narrow street where the blood of his namesake son still stained the gray pavement, two days after the 18-year-old was shot dead by a police officer. He straightened a waist-high wooden cross and re-lit the candles erected as part of a makeshift memorial.

""Big Mike,"" as some of his friends called Michael Brown Jr., wasn't the type to fight, family and neighbors said, though he lived in a restless neighborhood where police were on frequent patrol. His parents and neighbors described him as a good-hearted kid with an easy smile who certainly wouldn't have condoned the violence and looting that spread though his north St. Louis suburb following his death.

""He was funny, silly, he would make you laugh,"" his father said, and when there was ""any problem going on, any situation, there wasn't nothing that he couldn't solve. He could bring people back together.""

Brown, who was unarmed, was shot Saturday by a Ferguson police officer while walking with a friend down the center of the street. Police have said a scuffle broke out after the officer asked the boys to move to the side. Witnesses say Brown's arms were in the air — in a sign of surrender — as a white policeman repeatedly shot the black youth.

After a vigil Sunday night, an angry crowd looted stores, and a night later police in Ferguson fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse protesters. The U.S. Justice Department has announced that its civil rights division is investigating, and Brown's family retained the same lawyer who represented relatives of Trayvon Martin — the Florida teen killed in a racially charged 2012 shooting. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton joined the family Tuesday to urge protesters to refrain from violence.

Authorities say Robin Williams hanged himself, found by personal assistant

SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) — Robin Williams' personal assistant found the actor who was struggling with depression dead in a bedroom of his San Francisco Bay Area home, officials said Tuesday.

Williams' wife likely was home at the time he killed himself but was unaware, Marin County Sheriff's Lt. Keith Boyd said.

Williams was last seen alive by his wife Sunday night when she went to bed, Boyd said. She woke up the next morning and left, thinking he was still asleep elsewhere in the house.

Shortly after that, Williams' personal assistant came to the Tiburon home and became concerned when Williams failed to respond to knocks at a door. The assistant found the 63-year-old actor clothed and dead in a bedroom.

Boyd said all evidence indicates Williams, star of ""Good Will Hunting,"" ''Mrs. Doubtfire,"" ''Good Morning, Vietnam"" and dozens of other films, committed suicide by hanging himself with a belt. But he said a final ruling will be made once toxicology reports and interviews with witnesses are complete.

Ukraine insists aid must be delivered by Red Cross as Russian help convoy leaves Moscow

MOSCOW (AP) — With a theatrical flourish, Russia on Tuesday dispatched hundreds of trucks covered in white tarps and sprinkled with holy water on a mission to deliver aid to a desperate rebel-held zone in eastern Ukraine.

The televised sight of the miles-long convoy sparked a show of indignation from the government in Kiev, which insisted any aid must be delivered by the international Red Cross. Ukraine and the West have openly expressed its concern that Moscow intends to use the cover of a humanitarian operation to embark on a military incursion in support of pro-Russian separatists.

Amid those anxieties, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday was set to travel to Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Russia annexed in March, where he was to preside over a meeting involving the entire Russian Cabinet and most members of the lower house of parliament.

Putin so far has resisted calls from both pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine and nationalists at home to send Russian troops to back the mutiny, a move that would be certain to trigger devastating Western sanctions. But dispatching the convoy sent a powerful visual symbol helping the Kremlin counter criticism from the nationalists who accuse Putin of betrayal.

The convoy provoked controversy as soon as it started moving early Tuesday from the outskirts of Moscow on its long voyage toward the Ukrainian border.

UN says it's ethical to try untested Ebola drugs, but supply of 1 experimental drug is gone

MADRID (AP) — The World Health Organization declared it's ethical to use untested drugs and vaccines in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa, although the tiny supply of one experimental treatment has been depleted and it could be many months until more is available.

The last of the drug is on its way to Liberia for two stricken doctors, according to a U.K.-based public relations firm representing Liberia. The U.S. company that makes it said the supply is now ""exhausted."" Later Tuesday, Canada said it would provide some of its experimental Ebola vaccine for use in West Africa.

A Spanish missionary priest who died Tuesday in Madrid was the third person to receive the experimental treatment called ZMapp. Two U.S. aid workers who received it in recent weeks are said to be improving.

The outbreak, the biggest in history, has killed more than 1,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.

There is no proven treatment or vaccine for Ebola; several are in early stages of development. ZMapp, made by Mapp Pharmaceuticals, is so new that it has never been tested in humans, although an early version worked in some monkeys infected with Ebola. It's aimed at boosting the immune system's efforts to fight off Ebola.

Robin Williams remembered fondly by military for USO shows

President Barack Obama also urged calm, saying people must comfort each other ""in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.""

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told a standing-room only crowd at a community forum Tuesday night that the shooting feels ""like an old wound torn fresh"" in a nation still struggling with race relations.

The forum, held at a church, was organized as an alternative response to two nights of unrest in which more crowds have burned stores, vandalized vehicles assaulted reporters and taunted officers. Ferguson's mayor and police chief also attended the meeting and were welcomed with applause.

Earlier in the day, Police Chief Tom Jackson said he had decided against releasing the officer's name Tuesday after death threats were called into police and City Hall and posted on social media. Jackson said it could be weeks before he releases the name.

""If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,"" Jackson said. ""We're taking the threats seriously.""

The officer has been with the force for about six years and was on a routine patrol when he encountered the two young men, Jackson said.

Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. Brown was black.

The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. Jackson said the city has had trouble recruiting and retaining black officers.

The fullest account of Brown's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home from a convenience store with Brown when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who, using expletives, ordered them to move to the sidewalk.

In the hours after the shooting, Johnson told news crews that he and Brown had kept walking and explained to the officer they were near their destination. The officer then reversed his car ""to where it almost hit us.""

The officer, Johnson said, tried to open his door, but he was so close to the men that it ""ricocheted"" back. Johnson said the officer then reached through the window, ""grabbed my friend around the neck"" and tried to pull him into the car. The officer then reportedly pulled out his weapon and said, ""'I'll shoot you,' or 'I'm going to shoot,'"" Johnson said.

When the officer opened fire, Brown was hit and started to bleed, Johnson said. Johnson ran to hide behind a car.

Brown ""kept running, and he told me to keep running because he feared for me, too,"" Johnson said.

Johnson said the officer pursued Brown with his weapon drawn and fired again.

When Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. But the officer kept firing, Johnson said.

""And my friend died. He didn't say anything to him. He just stood over and he's shooting.""

Authorities have not commented directly on Johnson's account.

Another witness, Phillip Walker, told the AP he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he saw a white officer with Brown, who was ""giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued."" Walker said the officer then ""stood over him and shot him.""

Police have said there is no security or police video of the confrontation.

The warning comes after the group earlier threatened to launch an online attack on police departments over alleged brutality in the handling of protests following the killing of Michael Brown.

Police have cracked down hard on demonstrators in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, who took to the streets after the 18-year-old was shot dead by a police officer on Saturday night.

Despite calls for calm, officers fired teargas and shot at least one person in a third night of rioting in the area last night. Police claimed the man shot had pulled a handgun on an officer.

As police tried to put the area on lockdown, messages posted on a newly established Twitter account called Operation Ferguson, which appears to be linked to Anonymous, announced: 'We have a deep source, and we have a name we BELIEVE to be the shooter [of Michael Brown]. It does NOT match any of the names being floated.

'We have our best operatives working as hard as they can to verify the leak on the shooter we were passed. PLEASE be patient.

'When we release the name of Mike Brown's killer, it will be in an unequivocal statement released through this Twitter account. No games.'

A little later another message suggested that the operation was proving more difficult than anticipated.

'To my fellow Anons, everyone remain chill,' it read. 'I realize this is an intense Op, and we are all trying our best. Let's fight cops not each other.'

There has been anger from Mr Brown's parents and their supporters after the Ferguson Police Department decided not to publish the name of the officer who shot their son.

Speaking out through the media last night, Lesley McSpadden, Mr Brown's mother, told the policeman who fired the shots: 'You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.'

Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures.

In a video posted on Sunday night, a self-declared spokesman for Anonymous warned Missouri police 'we are watching you very closely'.

'If you abuse, harass or harm in any way the protesters in Ferguson we will take every web-based asset of your departments and governments offline,' said a disguised voice, speaking over news footage of protests.

'That's not a threat, it is a promise.'

In the video and a press release posted to the Pastebin website, the video says Anonymous will 'attack ever server and computer' belonging to the police departments involved, as well as 'release the personal information on every single member of the Ferguson Police Department, as well as any other jurisdiction that participates in the abuse.'

'We will seize all your databases and E-Mail spools and dump them on the Internet,' it said. 'This is your only warning.'

There was no immediate way to verify the video was genuine or that any attacks or hacks have been effective. The websites for Ferguson City Police and Missouri State Highway Patrol were still online when MailOnline checked this morning.

Investigators have released few details about what they believe happened when Mr Brown was shot, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Michael and another teen to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon.

At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, according to the St. Louis County Police Department, which is handling the investigation at the smaller city's request.

The fullest account of Michael's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home with Michael when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who ordered them to move to the sidewalk.

(AP) — After an unarmed black teenager was shot by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer, authorities have resisted calls to release the name of the officer while imploring protesters to keep their demonstrations calm and avoid new trouble in the city north of downtown St. Louis. Here's a look at the key elements of the shooting and the unrest that followed:

THE SHOOTING: Police have said the shooting happened after an officer encountered 18-year-old Michael Brown and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it ""ricocheted"" back, apparently upsetting the officer. Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the offi
cer fired at him repeatedly.

THE UNREST: Ferguson city leaders on Wednesday asked angry residents to keep their protests peaceful and to end them before nightfall in an effort minimize trouble. Early Wednesday, a St. Louis County police officer shot and wounded a man who authorities said pulled a handgun on the officer. On previous nights, crowds have gathered to protest Brown's death, and residents were seen looting stores, damaging buildings and vandalizing property. On Monday night, police used tear gas and fired ""bean bag"" rounds after a crowd turned rowdy, throwing rocks and bottles at officers. More than three dozen people have been arrested. Brown's family and civil-rights groups have pleaded for the community to stay calm.

THE INVESTIGATION: Brown's death is being investigated by St. Louis County police at the request of the smaller police department in Ferguson. The FBI has also opened an investigation into possible civil rights violations. Authorities are refusing to release any details about their investigation or identify the police officer who shot Brown. Ferguson police say releasing the officer's name will lead to retribution, while protesters and attorneys for Brown's family say knowing who pulled the trigger will help the community heal and determine if the officer may have been involved in previous incidents. The Justice Department has sent community relations experts to help Ferguson officers address their community's mistrust of the police.

THE PUBLIC DISCUSSION: Some civil rights leaders have drawn comparisons between Brown's death and that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder charges. The St. Louis case provoked a broad discussion on social media sites about the death of young black men in racially tinged shootings. On Twitter, a campaign using the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown has prompted many black users to post photos of themselves and ask how they might be portrayed in news reports if they became shooting victims.",NA,NA,NA,NA

ST. LOUIS (AP) — The police chief in the St. Louis suburb where an officer fatally shot an unarmed teenager said Wednesday that cyber-attacks on his city's website won't sway him into releasing the officer's name.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said someone burrowed into the website and shut it down for much of Monday, two days after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed. The death has stoked racial tension, protests and a night of looting, along with calls for police to release the officer's name so his background can be reviewed.

The Internet hacking group Anonymous had pledged to create mischief with Ferguson's city computers if the name wasn't released, and representatives of the group have taken credit for the incident. But Jackson said releasing the information could endanger the officer, who has received numerous death threats.

Jackson said he was unaware whether the hackers obtained any personal information about police officers from the website. Ferguson, a predominantly black city of roughly 21,000 residents, is about 10 miles northwest of St. Louis.

Investigators have released few details, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Brown and another man to get out of the street, and that the officer's weapon fired at some point inside a patrol car. Witnesses say Brown had his hands raised when the officer repeatedly shot him.",NA,NA,NA,NA

An estimated 500 people, who had been protesting 18-year-old Michael Brown's death on Saturday, ignored the night curfew imposed by police and instead faced-off against officers chanting 'Hands Up! Don't Shoot!'

After repeatedly asking them to disperse, the riot police then fired tear gas into the crowd to break it up, causing scenes that resembled a war zone as another night of clashes was sparked between authorities and furious protestors.

The protestors that remained entered into pitched street battles with police and lobbed Molotov cocktails at the camouflage-clad officers who responded with more tears gas and smoke bombs although there were no immediate reports of injuries but at least 18 arrests.

There were no immediate reports of injuries from the violence but later on Thursday, an image was posted to an Instagram account by 'tef_poe' showing a middle-aged lady, identified as a Pastor of America, who had been praying when she was hit with a rubber bullet.

The rubber bullet left a bloody wound ringed with dark bruising on the woman's abdomen.

A caption next to the image read: 'For all those who think this is a joke or think we are being irrational, this lady is a pastor she was praying when they shot her.'

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon cancelled all appearances on Wednesday night and visited Ferguson on Thursday.

This comes as St. Louis Alderman, Antonio French, was arrested by police during the unrest on Wednesday night in Ferguson after he didn't listen to police, according to his wife.

Senka French took to Twitter to confirm that the popular politician was ordered out of his car and taken into custody by police and it is not clear what he has been charged with yet.

Earlier in the evening, two journalists were detained and arrested without charge or explanation inside a McDonald's after heavily armed SWAT officers stormed the fast food restaurant amid rising tensions following the death of the unarmed teen in broad daylight on Saturday.

Huffington Post justice reporter Ryan J. Reilly and Washington Post staffer Wesley Lowery both were taken into custody after describing the increasing militarization of Ferguson by the suburbs predominantly white police force as they faced off against outraged members of the suburb's African American community.

The standoff between protestors and the police followed the release of police radio chatter and 911 transcripts in the moments after Brown's controversial death and posted by the hacker collective Anonymous.

Lowery and Reilly were taken into custody by officers just before 8pm ET after armed and camouflaged police swarmed into McDonalds and demanded that patrons leave.

The sequence of events was described by the two men via Twitter after their release and incredulous colleagues posted pictures of their arrest to social media as they occurred.

According to Lowery and Reilly police told them they were closing down the McDonalds, which has become a make-shift base for reporters assigned to Ferguson since Brown was fatally shot up to eight times by an officer on Saturday.

Asked why they had to leave, the two men were told that it was for their safety because after dark the police would not be taking 911 calls to the area.

The police then requested identification from Lowery and Reilly and then eventually arrested them after they lost patience with the reporters while they packed their bags and attempted to leave the McDonalds.

Washington Post reporter Lowery also took to Twitter to claim that he was assaulted by officers. 'Officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking me to walk out of,' he wrote on Twitter.

Martin D. Baron, the Post's executive editor, issued a statement saying 'here was absolutely no justification' for Lowery's arrest and said the organization was appalled by the officers' conduct.

In a statement, the Huffington Post said that their reporter 'was arrested Wednesday while covering the protests in Ferguson, Missouri surrounding the death of unarmed African American teenager Michael Brown, who was shot to death by a police officer last week.

'Reilly tweeted at around 8:00 P.M. EDT that SWAT officers invaded the McDonald's at which he was working, requesting his identification after he took a photo of them,' the statement said.

'The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery was also working at the fast food restaurant.'

In an interview with MSNBC following his release, Reilly called the police officers' mentality 'extremely disturbing.'

'It was madness,' Reilly said. 'Originally the swat officers walked through, and I took a couple photos at that time. They talked to the manager... As they decided to leave, they reversed course and decided they were going to shut down the McDonalds and asked everyone to leave, asked us to begin packing up our stuff.

'Evidently I was not moving quickly enough for their liking, at which point I was given a countdown, I was told I had 45 seconds, 30 seconds, pack up all my stuff and leave, at which point the officer in question… held me back, grabbed my things and shoved them into my bag, and basically he then arrested me. He handcuffed me... he used his finger to put a pressure point on my neck.'

'He would not tell me what I was under arrest for…he was in complete SWAT gear,' Reilly continued.

'The most frustrating thing…I repeatedly asked over a dozen times for his name or ID number was never given it... The worst part was he slammed my head against the glass purposely on the way out of the McDonalds then sarcastically apologized for it.'

'It was just a terrible experience,' he continued. 'I recognize I’m in sort of a place of privilege here both as a journalist and as a white person frankly, in that evidently the police chief made the decision to not hold us. ... The mentality of the officers was extremely disturbing. They essentially acted as a military force.'

Lowery took to Twitter to write, 'Apparently, in America, in 2014, police can manhandle you, take you into custody, put you in cell & then open the door like it didn't happen.'

The two men were eventually released without charge and all attempts at asking the names of their arresting officers were rebuffed.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who has been the public face of the city torn by Saturday's death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, told reporters the St. Louis County investigation of the shooting could take weeks to complete.

In the meantime, he said, his department welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.

'Unfortunately, an undertow (of racial unrest) has bubbled to the surface,' said Jackson. 'Race relations is the top priority right now.'

The mystery of the officer's identity has fanned the discord, with Jackson arguing that revealing that detail could bring retribution to the officer whose life since Saturday has been threatened.

But civil rights activists and the attorney for Brown's family, all pressing for calm amid nights of unrest since Brown's death, counter that knowing the officer's name may help the area to heal, allowing the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and others to dig into the officer's background for any prior brutality.

'We don't want anyone's life threatened. If someone like this officer is killed, then there is no justice,' said John Gaskin III of St. Louis County's NAACP chapter.

Police have said the shooting happened after an officer encountered 18-year-old Michael Brown and another man on the street.

They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon.

At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it 'ricocheted' back, apparently upsetting the officer.

Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing.

He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.

Robert McCulloch, the county's prosecutor, said that investigators were interviewing Johnson on Wednesday.

Jackson said that the officer sustained swelling facial injuries during the confrontation that preceeded the shooting.

Brown's body remained on the street for hours - a span Jackson deemed ""uncomfortable"" but justified, given that 'you only get one chance at that crime scene' to process it correctly.

Jackson said authorities also were concerned about gunfire they could hear from a nearby building.

In the shooting's aftermath, the notorious hacking collective Anonymous has taken credit for hacking into the city website and shutting it down for much of Monday.

The group also released what it said were audio experts from St. Louis County dispatch on the day Brown was killed. Police declined to comment on the recordings.

On Tuesday, hackers posted pictures of St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar's home and family online, as well as his home address and telephone number in hopes of pressuring him to release the officer's name.

'Realistically, what positive could come from that information coming out?' Jackson said. 'Right now, people want it so they can destroy that person's life. That's the only reason that group's asking for it.'

But community members said they want to know who the officer is.

'We have the right to know, and the family has the right to know who murdered their son,' said Sahari Gutierrez, a 27-year-old Ferguson legal assistant.",892,NA,NA,NA

The situation became more tense after nightfall, with police ordering people to go home and then using smoke bombs and later tear gas after some people threw Molotov cocktails and other things at them.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said he had no immediate information about the situation.

The Washington Post reported that Lowery said he was slammed against a soda machine and plastic cuffs were put on his wrists. Reilly told MSNBC that an officer slammed his head against the glass ""purposefully"" on the way out of the restaurant ""and then sarcastically apologized for it."" The reporters were subsequently released without any charges.

Martin D. Baron, The Washington Post's executive editor, issued a statement saying ""there was absolutely no justification"" for Lowery's arrest and said the organization was appalled by the officers' conduct.

Ryan Grim, Washington, D.C., bureau chief for The Huffington Post, said in a statement that ""compared to some others who have come into contact with the police department, they came out relatively unscathed, but that in no way excuses the false arrest or the militant aggression toward these journalists.""

Indeed, in this town of 21,000 people, of which two-thirds are African American, their now beleaguered police force of 53 can only claim to have three officers who are black.

Worse still, an annual report last year from Missouri's attorney general found that in Ferguson, if you were African American, you were twice as likely to be arrested during a traffic stop than a white person.

Residents in Ferguson have become so used to this that they have dubbed it DWB, or driving while black.

According to Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, while blacks make up 67 percent of the population in Ferguson, they account for 86 percent of the traffic stops made last year.

And according to {The Washington Post}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html”>, 92 percent of those stops end with an arrest for the black driver.

Last year, the NAACP filed a federal complaint against the St. Louis County police department, who are currently working with Ferguson's force to quell the nightly riots, over huge disparities in arrests.

{The Washington Post}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html”> also claims that a former lieutenant with the county police was fired in 2013 after an internal investigation found he had told officers to specifically target black people across the county.

After this troubling discovery, St. Louis County Executive asked for all recent arrest statistics to discover the depth of racial profiling.

The problems apparent in the violent clashes between heavily armed white SWAT officers and angry African American protestors began roughly a decade ago in Ferguson.

In 2000, blacks counted slightly over half of Ferguson's population, while white people accounted for 44 percent.

Now, white people make up only 30 percent of the population, but nearly 100 percent of the police force.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged the structural problems in his department.

'Apparently, there has been this undertow that has bubbled to the surface,' Jackson said on Wednesday.

'It’s our priority to address it and to fix what’s been going wrong.'

'I’ve been trying to increase the diversity of the department ever since I got here,' Jackson said on Wednesday to {The Washington Post}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html”>.

'Race relations is a top priority right now.'

But while Jackson is claiming he wants to listen now, other residents of Ferguson are saying it is too late.

'People here are angry, frustrated,' said Corey Crawford, 36 to {The Washington Post}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-before-teen-michael-browns-slaying-in-mo-racial-questions-have-hung-over-police/2014/08/13/78b3c5c6-2307-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html”>.

'There needs to be justice. If you can find a single person in this community who trusts the police, that is like finding a four-leafed clover.'

Across the country there is though an understanding that something must be done.

St. Louis County asked researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles to help improve their perceived racial profiling and to work on their procedures.

However, distrust is still strong.

Take Jackson's refusal to confirm how many times Brown was shot for example.

He has categorically refused to do so and more importantly, name the officer who fired up to eight times at the 18-year-old.

Police claim their was a physical confrontation after Brown refused to obey the police officers, other eyewitnesses claim that Brown was essentially executed while he had his hands in the air.

While Jackson said he wanted to mend fences with the community, protesters were on the streets of Ferguson again Wednesday, facing heavily armed police who at time trained weapons on them from an armored truck.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the unidentified officer was treated for swelling on the side of his face after the incident on Saturday.

But Jackson added that he could not reveal any more information about the shooting, which police say followed a struggle between the officer and Brown.

The lack of information from police has fueled escalating tensions between protestors and officers, with witnesses insisting their was no contact between Brown and the officer before he was shot.

One witness who was walking with Brown at the time has said that the deceased put his hands in the air and did not struggle with or provoke the officer.

He said the officer then fired multiple bullets into Brown's head and chest.

The armed officer's name has not been released for his own safety and has been placed on administrative leave, the police say,

Another officer wrongly accused on social media of taking part in the shooting has been evacuated from the city along with his family.

Police also confirmed that hackers had tried to access their internal website in the hope of finding the officer's name, but were unsuccessful.

Four nights of tense standoffs between protesters and heavily armed police followed the shooting, but they have bubbled over into rioting and looting.

Ferguson police has drafted in armed officers from neighboring forces to try to quell the growing violence.

Jackson urged protesters to rally only in daylight hours, but more than 500 people broke the curfew last night, chanting: 'Hands up! Don't shoot!'

After repeatedly asking them to disperse last night, the riot police fired tear gas into the crowd to break it up, causing scenes that resembled a war zone as another night of clashes was sparked between authorities and furious protestors.

The protestors that stayed out entered into pitched street battles with police and lobbed Molotov cocktails at the camouflage-clad officers who responded with more tear gas and smoke bombs.

FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Police used tear gas and smoke bombs to repel crowds who threw Molotov cocktails during another violent night on the streets of a St. Louis suburb in the wake of the shooting of the unarmed 18-year old Michael Brown.

Hours earlier, the police chief had said race relations were the top priority in the town, where a white police officer fatally shot the black teen. Authorities have vowed to reach across the racial, economic and generational divide in a community in search of answers.

In the streets of Ferguson, though, the polite dialogue heard at community forums and news conferences is nowhere to be found.

Instead, officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, ""Hands up, don't shoot."" Wednesday saw more tense confrontations and further volleys of tear gas from police — this time paired with smoke bombs in response to flaming projectiles and other objects lobbed from the crowd. Protesters faced heavily armed police who at times trained weapons on them from armored trucks.

Two reporters said they were detained by police for not clearing out quickly enough from a McDonald's where they were working, near the protests but away from the more volatile areas. The two, who work for The Washington Post and The Huffington Post, were released without any charges. Both say they were assaulted but not seriously hurt.

Iraqi army, militants clash west of Baghdad as UN declares Iraq's crisis at highest level

BAGHDAD (AP) — Clashes between Iraqi troops and Sunni militants west of Baghdad killed at least four children on Thursday as the United Nations announced its highest level of emergency for the Arab country's humanitarian crisis in the wake of the onslaught by the extremist Islamic State group.

Since their blitz offensive in June, the al-Qaida-breakaway group has overrun much of Iraq's north and west and driven out hundreds of thousands from their homes. The push has displaced members of the minority Christian and Yazidi religious communities and threatened Iraqi Kurds in the Kurdish autonomous region in the north.

The U.N. on Wednesday declared the situation in Iraq a ""Level 3 Emergency"" — a development that will trigger additional goods, funds and assets to respond to the needs of the displaced, said U.N. special representative Nickolay Mladenov, pointing to the ""scale and complexity of the current humanitarian catastrophe.""

The Security Council also said it was backing a newly nominated premier-designate in the hope that he can swiftly form an ""inclusive government"" that could counter the insurgent threat, which has plunged Iraq into its worst crisis since the U.S. troop withdrawal in 2011.

Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled the Islamic State group's advance to take refuge in the remote desert Sinjar mountain range.

Amid increasing concerns about Islamic State threat, administration mulls wider campaign

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration is grappling with how to bridge the gap between its increasingly dire assessment of the threat posed by the Islamic State group and the limited, defensive air campaign it has so far undertaken, which military officials acknowledge will not blunt the group's momentum.

For months, administration officials have been divided about the threat posed by the Islamic State as it seized parts of Syria and advanced on towns in Iraq. Now, amid new intelligence about its growing strength, a consensus is forming that the group presents an unacceptable terrorism risk to the United States and its allies.

At issue is whether President Barack Obama, elected on a platform of ending the Iraq war, will heed calls for a campaign to contain or destroy the Islamic State, an undertaking that could dominate U.S. foreign policy for the remainder of his term.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the group poses ""a threat to the civilized world,"" while Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called the Islamic State a ""terrorist army"" that must be defeated. But Obama has not used similar language. He has authorized a limited campaign of targeted airstrikes designed to protect refugees and American personnel in the Kurdish region — but not take out the group's leadership or logistical hubs.

A strategy to destroy the Islamic State would not require large numbers of American ground troops, but it would amount to a significant escalation from the recent air operations, analysts say. It might also require military action in western Syria, where the group has its headquarters in the city of Ar-Raqqah.

Pope urges Koreans to seek peace, avoid 'fruitless' shows of force, as North fires projectiles

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Pope Francis called Thursday for renewed efforts to forge peace on the war-divided Korean Peninsula and for both sides to avoid ""fruitless"" criticisms and shows of force, opening a five-day visit to South Korea with a message of reconciliation as Seoul's rival, North Korea, fired five projectiles into the sea.

North Korea has a long history of making sure it is not forgotten during high-profile events in the South, and Thursday's apparent test firing off its eastern coast made its presence felt.

In the first speech of his first trip to Asia, Francis told South Korean President Park Geun-hye and government officials that peace required forgiveness, cooperation and mutual respect. He said diplomacy must be encouraged so that listening and dialogue replace ""mutual recriminations, fruitless criticisms and displays of force.""

The Argentine pope spoke in English, the first English speech of his pontificate. Usually he speaks in Italian or his native Spanish, but the Vatican said he would deliver at least four speeches in English on the trip to accommodate his Asian audiences.

North Korea's apparent test firing was conducted from Wonsan on its east coast and the initial three short-range projectiles flew about 220 kilometers (135 miles), according to a South Korean Defense Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing office rules. It wasn't immediately clear what the projectiles were. After an initial three firings an hour before Francis arrived, North Korea followed up with two others a short time after he landed.

Extension of truce in Gaza fans hope of progress in Israel-Hamas talks in Cairo

CAIRO (AP) — A five-day extension of a Gaza truce appeared to be holding despite a rocky start on Thursday, fanning cautious optimism of progress in the negotiations underway in Cairo between Israel and major Palestinian factions, including Hamas.

It's the longest cease-fire yet since the war broke out last month in the Gaza Strip. The fighting has so far killed more than 1,900 Palestinians, the majority of them civilians, according to Palestinian and U.N. officials. Israel has lost 67 people, all but three of them soldiers.

Violence briefly spiked as the extension of a previous, 72-hour truce was announced shortly before midnight on Wednesday. The extension is to last until midnight on Monday.

Israel's military said eight Hamas rockets were launched at Israel but that the firing stopped in the early hours of Thursday morning. Israel retaliated with airstrikes on rockets and rocket-launching sites in Gaza, the military said.

Gaza police said it recorded 17 Israeli strikes but that no casualties were reported.

Couple together for 48 years at center of fight over North Carolina ban on same-sex marriage

HIGH POINT, N.C. (AP) — On the summer night Ellen Gerber and Pearl Berlin committed to spending their lives together, the No. 1 song was ""When A Man Loves A Woman.""

Lyndon B. Johnson was president. NASA had just landed the first unmanned probe on the moon.

""We're still in love, after 48 years,"" Gerber, better known as Lennie, said recently. ""We still can't begin the day without a good cuddle.""

June 2, 1966, is engraved in Roman numerals on the identical gold bands the women exchanged during a religious wedding at their Greensboro synagogue last year on the anniversary of that long-ago night. They followed three months later with a civil ceremony in Maine.

But under North Carolina law, they might as well be strangers.

Russian aid convoy resumes travel toward Ukraine, taking road leading south to rebel-held area

VORONEZH, Russia (AP) — A large Russian aid convoy resumed its journey toward Ukraine Thursday, taking a road leading directly toward a border crossing controlled by pro-Russian rebels in the Luhansk region.

The convoy of more than 200 vehicles had been parked at a military depot in the southern Russian city of Voronezh since late Tuesday amid disagreement over how and where the aid could be delivered to Ukraine, where government troops are battling pro-Russia separatists.

On Thursday the white trucks, some flying the red flag of Moscow city and accompanied by green military vehicles, traveled down a winding highway through sunflower fields and rolling green hills. They turned off that road near the city of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, driving west toward the Ukraine border crossing of Izvaryne, which is currently under rebel control.

By taking such a route, Russian appeared to be intent on not abiding by a tentative agreement to deliver aid to a government-controlled border checkpoint in the Kharkiv region, where it could more easily be inspected by Ukraine and the Red Cross. Moscow has insisted it coordinated the dispatch of the goods, which it says range from baby food and canned meat to portable generators and sleeping bags, with the international Red Cross.

ICRC spokeswoman Anastasia Isyuk stressed Thursday that talks between the organization, Ukraine and Russia were continuing, but that she could not confirm where the Russian convoy was headed.

It's a jungle out there: Parrot, chick, hogs and dogs have spots in political ads

WASHINGTON (AP) — It's a jungle out there in political television advertising, what with parrots, chicks, dogs and pigs taking turns in commercials that bite and scratch in a way no nonpartisan pet ever would.

""You can keep it,"" squawked a parrot in a Club for Growth Action ad that ran earlier in the year in Arkansas. It was meant to ridicule President Barack Obama and Sen. Mark Pryor's now-abandoned claims that state residents could keep their health insurance if they liked it.

In Georgia, Democratic Rep. John Barrow unleashed a golden retriever in the first television ad of his campaign for a new term. ""Somebody once said if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,"" he says.

""Well, I wouldn't wish Washington on a dog,"" Barrow adds, throwing a tennis ball to be fetched. By the time he has finished touting his own record and criticizing other lawmakers, the dog and ball are back. ""She works harder than most of them do,"" he says, comparing the pet favorably to the men and women he has known in Congress for a decade.

Whether peddling candidates or commercial products, the goal of commercials is to gain as wide and attentive a viewership as possible. Anything that gets a longer look is prized.

Gunmen kill patients, demand medical miracles as street crime spills into Venezuelan hospitals

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — At first, the operating room doctors thought the quiet man in jeans was a distressed family member. One shouted at him to leave as another fought to save the gunshot patient unconscious on the table.

The anesthesiologist was the first to see the man's gun. He dove to the ground, and then listened as dozens of shots rang out, thinking, ""So this is how I die.""

For years, hospitals were one of the few safe havens in this mind-bogglingly violent Latin American country.

No longer. The emergency room murder of a 27-year-old patient by the very gang member who allegedly put him there in the first place is one of a string of recent attacks and ugly confrontations that have shattered physicians' sense of security.

""It's a scandal, to kill someone inside a hospital. It's complete social deterioration,"" said Jose Manuel Olivares, an oncology resident at the University Hospital of Caracas, where Edinson Balsa was slain in June along with his brother, who was waiting in the hallway. ""It was never perfect, but they used to respect some boundaries.""

Funeral services set for Kevin Ward, New York driver hit by Tony Stewart's car in upstate race

TURIN, N.Y. (AP) — Kevin Ward Jr.'s father and fellow racers want him remembered as a talented and aggressive driver who had a bright future in the sport rather than as a victim in an accident involving NASCSAR champion Tony Stewart that sparked controversy among racing fans and recriminations from Ward's family.

Funeral services for the 20-year-old were set for 11 a.m. Thursday at South Lewis Senior High School in Turin, 55 miles northeast of Syracuse. Ward, a 2012 graduate of the school, lived in nearby Port Leyden.

Ward was killed Saturday night 140 miles away at a dirt track in Canandaigua, where NASCAR champion Stewart was racing while he was in the area for a Sprint Cup event at Watkins Glen the next day. After a bump from Stewart sent Ward's winged car spinning into the wall, the young driver climbed out and stalked onto the track in his black firesuit, gesturing angrily. Stewart's No. 14 car seemed to fishtail, and Ward was thrown through the air as fans watched in horror.

The accident touched off angry debates as video of the crash circulated online, with fans questioning whether Stewart, known for his hot temper, tried to send his own message by buzzing Ward, or whether Ward recklessly took his life into his hands by stepping onto a dark track clad in black.

Kevin Ward Sr., who was at the track with his wife Pamela when their son was killed, told The Syracuse Post-Standard this week that Stewart was the best driver on the track that night, and there was no reason for him to hit the young driver after other cars avoided him.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Two reporters were arrested and TV crews came under fire from tear gas and rubber bullets while covering protests over the shooting of Michael Brown, 18, leading to the Twitter hashtag #mediablackout to start trending.

Washington Post staffer Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post justice reporter Ryan J. Reilly were both arrested inside a McDonald's in the city after a SWAT team stormed the fast food restaurant.

Both Mr Lowery and Mr Reilly took to Twitter and Facebook, saying they were 'slammed' into a fountain and 'banged' against a window when they did not pack up their equipment quickly enough when heavily armed officers shut down the McDonald's.

Mr Reilly wrote on Facebook: 'Tonight, along with a reporter from The Washington Post, I was arrested while reporting on the protests in Ferguson.

'Our apparent crime? Not packing up our gear quickly enough after a heavily armed SWAT team shut down the McDonald's where we were working.

'A Saint Louis County police officer in full riot gear, who refuse to identify himself despite my repeated requests, purposefully banged my head against the window on the way out and sarcastically apologized.

'I'm fine. But if this is the way these officers treat a white reporter working on a laptop who moved a little too slowly for their liking, I can't imagine how they treat others.'

Tweeting live from their arrest, Mr Lowery said he was 'slammed' against a soda machine because he did not know which exit the police wanted him to take.

He had earlier been stopped from filming the officers in the fast food restaurant.

After hours in custody with no explanation given and no charges brought, the reporters were released and picked up by locals who saw their tweets.

Martin Baron, executive editor of the Washington Post, said: 'Wesley has briefed us on what occurred, and there was absolutely no justification for his arrest.

'He was illegally instructed to stop taking video of officers. Then he followed officers' instructions to leave a McDonald's — and after contradictory instructions on how to exit, he was slammed against a soda machine and then handcuffed.

'That behavior was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news. The physical risk to Wesley himself is obvious and outrageous.

'After being placed in a holding cell, he was released with no charges and no explanation. He was denied information about the names and badge numbers of those who arrested him.

'We are relieved that Wesley is going to be OK. We are appalled by the conduct of police officers involved.'

An Al Jazeera news team were tear gassed by officers and a local TV crew were fired on with 'bean bag' rounds - a painful projectile used to apprehend offenders otherwise known as baton rounds.

It is not clear whether the tear gas and rounds were fired at the journalists on purpose.

Twitter users and celebrities sent tweets with the hastag #mediablackout to vent their anger at the journalists' arrest.

Singer John Legend tweeted: 'I believe these cops are intentionally trying to inflame the situation. They want an excuse.'

DeMarko Gage said: 'Dear @BarackObama, The police are arresting reporters so the truth won't be told. PLEASE DO SOMETHING. We Need your HELP! #mediablackout'

Ivan Molina tweeted: 'Where is our freedom of speech at? Police are desmantling [sic] the first amendment #mediablackout #Ferguson'

Riots in Ferguson continued for a fourth night following the shooting of Michael Brown on Saturday.

The 18-year-old unarmed black man was shot dead by an unidentified police officer.

Police chief Thomas Jackson said earlier today that the officer, who has not been named for his own safety, was injured in the incident, suggesting there was a struggle.

(AP) — Civil rights activist Al Sharpton is calling on the Department of Justice to monitor how police are responding to protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.

The fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white Ferguson police officer on Saturday has sparked protests in the St. Louis suburb. Some have turned violent.

On Wednesday night, police in riot gear again used tear gas to disperse protesters after some threw explosive devices and rocks at officers.

Tiffany Mitchell, who watched the shooting unfold, told {CNN}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html”> on Wednesday that the police's version of events - that Brown assaulted the officer and tried to grab his gun - was not true.

Brown did not enter the police vehicle, as authorities have claimed, but there appeared to be a struggle at the window, Ms Mitchell said.

'It looked as if Michael was pushing off and the cop was trying to pull him in,' she told CNN.

'The cop shot a fire through the window. Michael breaks away and starts running away but the officer continued shooting.'

Ms Mitchell had gone to the Ferguson, Missouri neighborhood on Saturday to pick up an employee, Piaget Crenshaw, for work.

Ms Crenshaw, who lives in an apartment with a balcony overlooking the street, also witnessed the incident.

Before the shooting, it appeared that the 18-year-old and police officer were 'arm-wrestling', she told CNN.

Both women said that a shot was fired and that Brown started running away from the officer and the patrol vehicle.

They said that the officer chased the teen roughly 20 feet down the street and fired shots at him in the St Louis suburb.

The 18-year-old turned and raised his hands in the air, the witnesses said, but the shots kept coming.

In the chaotic aftermath of the attack, news of the shooting spread quickly.

On cellphone footage shot by Ms Mitchell, a man believed to be Michael Brown's uncle approached the body to see if it is his nephew.A police officer rushed up to the man and pushed him back.

Ms Mitchell and Ms Crenshaw have given statements to St Louis County police who are handling the investigation.

The reports from the two women appeared to confirm an earlier eye-witness account from Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, who was walking with the teenager when police approached them.

Mr Johnson, 22, said that he and Brown were walking home from a store when the cop told them to get out of the street and 'get the f***' on to the sidewalk'.

Johnson said they kept walking after explaining to the officer they were almost home. The officer then pulled his truck in front of them and blocked the road, Johnson said.

The officer threw open the door which slammed closed again after bouncing off Brown, the friend said. It was then that the officer grabbed his friend by the neck.

Mr Johnson told {MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”> on Tuesday: 'The time frame was 60 seconds or less, it got out of hand really quickly.'

He said that the officer had drawn his gun by this time and threatened to shoot Michael.

'I seen the fire come out of the barrel,' he told the network. 'I could see so vividly what was going on because I was so close.'

Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away but he could already see that the teenager had blood coming down his shirt where he had been shot.

The 22-year-old ducked behind a car but Brown kept running.

'He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,' Johnson said.

The 22-year-old said: '[Brown] stopped, turned with his hands up and said ''I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!''

'But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.'

The eye-witness said despite the teenager's protests, the officer shot again, hitting Brown and leaving him on the ground.

Mr Johnson told the TV station that he ran in terror to his apartment and vomited, before checking he had not been shot. He came out from his apartment to see his friend lying dead in the middle of the street.

'We wasn’t causing harm to nobody,' Johnson added. 'We had no weapons on us at all.'

The 22-year-old spoke to MSNBC on Tuesday alongside his attorney and former St Louis' mayor, Freeman Bosley Jr.

The lawyer said on Tuesday that he had offered police the opportunity to interview his client about Saturday's tragic events but they initially declined. Mr Johnson was finally interviewed by the police on Wednesday.

Police have offered a different version of events of the altercation which led to the fatal shooting on Saturday.

Authorities said that while the officer was exiting his car, he was physically assaulted by Brown and there was a struggle over the cop's weapon.

Police do not dispute that the officer shot the subject multiple times and that the deceased was not armed.

Ferguson police said on Tuesday that they would not be releasing the name of the officer involved in the shooting because of death threats on social media.

Brown's shooting has sparked riots in the streets of suburban Ferguson, Missouri, where 70 per cent of the population is African-American but in a 53-strong police force there are only three black officers.

Riot police deployed tear gas and bean-bag rounds on Monday night to disperse an agitated crowd.

Mr Johnson said that he was still in shock over his friend's death and how quickly the situation escalated.

He described the 18-year-old, who was due to start technical college on Monday, as 'a quiet, kind and gentle' person.",108,NA,NA,NA

Obama vows MORE airstrikes and increasing military aid to Iraqis after 'almost flawless' operation to end siege of thousands on mountain,David Martosko; Francesca Chambers,8/14/2014,12/19/2015,"President Barack Obama declared a mission-accomplished moment on Thursday while promising that the U.S. would continue to deliver airstrikes against the ISIS terror group whenever it threatens American interests.

He announced during a brief pre-golf speech that a U.S. military operation had 'almost flawlessly' helped tens of thousands of stranded Iraqi refugees reach safety following a harrowing week trapped on a remote mountainside.

But 'we will continue airstrikes,' he vowed, threatening ISIS as it continues its rape-and-pillage approach to regime change.

'We broke the [ISIS] seige of Mt. Sinjar,' he said, referring to the self-declared Islamic State group's reign of terror against the Yadizi religious minority group in Iraqi Kurdistan.

'We helped vulnerable people reach safety, and we helped save thousands of lives,' Obama told reporters.

There will be no more missions to help the Yazidis, he said, and 'the majority of the military personnel who conducted the assessment will be leaving Iraq in the coming days.'

He terms the mission an 'assessment' because the role of military Special Forces was limited to little more than an aerial head-count.

Within hours of the deployment on Wednesday, a flyover mission confirmed that only around 5,000 Iraqi refugees remained, out of an estimated 45,000 who had sought safety on Mt. Sinjar.

The Department of Defense confirmed Wednesday evening that most of the Yazidi refugees had already taken themselves out of harm's way, in part because Kurdish Peshmerga fighters had cleared a path for them to leave safely.

The Pentagon also credited its own military attacks on ISIS targets, and humanitarian aid that helped sustain the people who were in harms' way.

Obama has been on vacation for the last six days, but the commander-in-chief looked more gray and haggard than ever as he delivered his update on Iraq and a statement about violence in Ferguson, Missouri.

He partied late into the evening yesterday at a birthday celebration for a longtime family friend, and danced to nearly every song, according to a White House pool report.

Tired as he may be, the president was back out on links immediately after his public address to play his fourth round of golf since he arrived in Martha's Vineyard on Saturday.

He said in his remarks Thursday that the U.S. had 'conducted humanitarian airdrops every night' since Friday, 'delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons of fresh water.'

The military assessment on Wednesday, he confirmed, 'found that food and water had been reaching those in need, and that thousands ... had evacuated each and every night.

Rear Admiral John Kirby, a DOD spokesman, said Wednesday that 'there are far fewer Yazidis on Mt. Sinjar than previously feared, in part because of humanitarian air drops [and] air strikes on [ISIS] targets.'

The situation on the ground elsewhere in Iraq, however, 'remains dire,' said Obama.

He predicted that the U.S. would continue to provide humanitarian aid in other regions of the beseiged country, 'without committing troops on the ground.'

That pledge has raised eyebrows since Special Forces did in fact land on Mt. Sinjar. The White House has repeatedly framed 'boots on the ground' scenarios as only those that include armed battles with the Islamic State's militants.

Obama announced six days ago that he would authorize military airstrikes in northern Iraq against the terror group's forces who were threatening as many as 45,000 Yazidis, a religious minority group whose people fled to the remote Mt. Sinjar – and were left without food or water.

Following targeted airstrikes that launched just hours later, and after several days of humanitarian aid airlifts, Obama deployed 130 special forces personnel to the region on Wednesday with an eye toward organizing an evacuation.

SAS forces from the UK also participated in the deployment, which began less than a day after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told a group of more than 200 Marines at Camp Pendleton that 'there will be no boots on the ground in Iraq.'",116,NA,NA,NA

Pig': Ferguson police chief hit with abuse from crowd after refusing to name officer who shot Michael Brown as Highway Patrol are called in over fears of ANOTHER night of violence,Louise Boyle; Daniel Bates,8/14/2014,12/19/2015,"The embattled chief of Ferguson police was heckled while patrolling an angry crowd protesting the death of black teenager Michael Brown with chants of: 'What's his name? What's his name?'

Jon Belmar was screamed at by the crowd who wanted to know the identify of the officer who shot the unarmed 18-year-old - Belmar is currently refusing to make it public.

Angry youths shouted: 'Pig' and 'f*** the police' at him while they hugged or thanked Ron Johnson, the African American Missouri Highway Patrol captain who is now in charge of policing the protests.

Belmar, who is white, stopped once to answer a furious black woman who demanded to know why officers had used tear gas the previous night.

A young black man repeatedly asked why he had promised to release the officer's name but Belmar did not answer him.

While {CNN}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1""> reports that police in Ferguson intend to release the officer's name sometime Friday, it came as little consolation to demonstrators who've spent the last five days up against what many have called an overly brutal, militarized police force.

At all times Belmar looked tense as he pushed his way through to a waiting police SUV.

In general the crowd had remained peaceful and the atmosphere was like a block party rather than the violence of previous nights.

The sounds of horns rang out constantly as drivers showed their support as St Louis vented it's anger and frustration that had built up since Saturday.

Cars drove past with music turned up loud with protestors hanging out of the windows with their hands up.

Those standing by the road held up candles and prayed for Michael.

The only other flare up was around 8pm when two police cars drove through the crowd to rescue a black teenage girl who was sick.

As two officers pulled her into their car the crowd applauded but a bottle of water was thrown and it hit the vehicle. Nobody was hurt.

Meanwhile Captain Johnson walked easily among the crowd as he began the 'shift' away from military style policing.

He said: 'I'm not afraid to be in this crowd today' as he marched with 1,000 people in the suburb of Ferguson.

'The gas masks are off,' Johnson told the crowd. 'Won't come back.'

The Missouri Highway Patrol chief said he wanted a 'new day' and an end to the violence.

Protests are planned for a fifth night in Ferguson, the once quiet suburb of St Louis, where Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said today that State Highway Patrol will take over supervision of security.

Officials hoped that the change in law enforcement would end the days of violence between protesters and officers following Saturday's fatal shooting of Brown.

Asked how he thought about the death of Michael Brown, who was gunned down by a white cop, Johnson said: 'If that was my son, if that was my friend, how would I feel?'

As night fell however it remained to be seen if the goodwill would endure.

Most of the violence over the past four days in this Missouri city has come after dark.

Johnson was asked to take over from St Louis County Police after their heavy handed tactics - involving tear gas and riot police - were condemned and commented on by President Obama.

The new approach involved Johnson coming down to the crowd himself around 5.30pm

He was hugged by a reverend and did numerous interviews to the media - until now the commanding officer was nowhere to be seen.

Black officers walked among the protestors and listened to them and white officers made hand signals to each other to stay calm.

Earlier a crowd of 1,000 had peacefully marched from the gas station that was torched during the riots and stopped outside the spot where Michael was shot dead.

He said that he would work to restore peace to his community which he said had been turned into a 'war zone.'

A chain of protests has spread across the U.S. and appeared to have been started by the Twitter hashtag #NMOS14, which called for a national moment of silence for 18-year-old Brown.

On Thursday starting 7pm (EST), hundreds of groups began to peacefully protest in locations from New York City to Detroit, DC, Chicago, Boston and Hawaii against police brutality.

Amnesty International tweeted: 'Tonight we're joining National Moment of Silence for victims of police brutality.'

Teach For America added: 'We are joining tonight's #NMOS14 at 7pm ET.'

Governor Nixon championed people's right to publicly protest on Thursday but said that Ferguson would not tolerate violence.

'Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,' Nixon said at a news conference earlier on Thursday.

'What's gone on here over the last few days is not what Missouri is about, it is not what Ferguson is about. This is a place where people work, go to school, raise their families and go to church, a diverse community, a Missouri community,' he added.

His strong words followed a phone call from Obama earlier in the day, where the President expressed concern over how the protests were being handled.

Heavily-militarized units of officers have been patrolling the streets of Ferguson, a St Louis suburb, deploying canisters of tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs.

St Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said officers on Wednesday night, the fourth night of violence, tossed tear gas to disperse a large crowd of protesters after some threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers. More than 10 people were arrested in Ferguson.

'In talking to these guys, it is scary,' Schellman said of officers on the front lines of the protest. 'They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.'

Obama said today there was no place in America for police brutality but appealed for 'peace and calm' on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri following the cop shooting of Michael Brown.

The President has ordered the FBI and Department of Justice to conduct an 'open and transparent' investigation into the death of the unarmed 18-year-old student on Saturday. Obama said Brown's death occurred 'in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances'.

Despite speaking up for the public's right to demonstrate, the President went on to say there was 'no excuse' for violence against police or the looting which were done under the guise of protests.

He said: 'There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting.

'There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protesters, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.'

Obama also referred to the arrest of two journalists on Wednesday night, saying that it was not acceptable for police to arrest reporters who were just doing their job by sharing with the public what they saw on the ground.

The President held a press conference from his vacation spot in Martha's Vineyard on Thursday afternoon to address the escalating situation in Missouri.

Obama spoke with Attorney General Eric Holder today who was closely following the situation in Ferguson.

The Department of Justice will conduct an independent investigation into Brown's death.

'I made clear to the Attorney General that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done,' he said.

Obama called the images of clashes between police and protesters as 'deeply disturbing' but said that he had faith in Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to restore peace and ensure that justice is done.

Obama said he had spoken with Governor Nixon, calling him a 'good man' and a 'fine governor'. adding that he had faith in him to take control of the situation.

The President said that although 'emotions are raw in Ferguson', it must be remembered that behind the widespread unrest was the death of a young man.

He said: 'We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old, and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again.'

Obama closed his remarks by saying: 'Let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.'

Governor Nixon traveled to Ferguson on Thursday where he announced there would be an 'operational shift' in policing in the town.

Nixon has faced criticism for not doing more to control the violence in the St Louis suburb.

At the community meeting, Sierra Smith, who lives in the neighborhood where Brown was shot, told the governor 'the police have no respect at all for the community'.

Nixon responded that the Bill of Rights gives the people 'the right speak truth to power' and 'we will work to live out those rights'.

{NewsChannel 5}<hyperlink=""""> reported that the FBI will now take the reins in Ferguson, overseeing a large part of the investigation into the shooting. The FBI will also be in charge of operations and protests in the suburb.

The local police, including St Louis County, will be under the charge of the FBI. The Department of Justice are also sending special prosecutors to assist with the investigation.

During a fourth night of protests over the teen's death in Ferguson on Thursday, heavily-armed SWAT police trained their guns on the public and fired tear gas to disperse crowds.

An estimated 500 people ignored the night curfew imposed by police and instead faced-off against officers chanting: 'Hands Up! Don't Shoot!'

After repeatedly asking them to disperse, the riot police then fired tear gas into the crowd to break it up.

The protesters that remained began pitched street battles with police and lobbed Molotov cocktails at the camouflage-clad officers who responded with more tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs.

There were no immediate reports of injuries from the violence but later on Thursday, an image was posted to an Instagram account by 'tef_poe' showing a middle-aged lady, identified as a Pastor of America, who had been praying when she was hit with a rubber bullet.

The rubber bullet left a bloody wound ringed with dark bruising on the woman's abdomen. A caption next to the image read: 'For all those who think this is a joke or think we are being irrational, this lady is a pastor she was praying when they shot her.'

There were at least ten arrests. Among them were two journalists, working for the Huffington Post and Washington Post, who were arrested while working in a McDonald's. Ryan J.

Dotson told The Associated Press on Thursday that a 24-officer tactical unit and the city's lone armored vehicle were sent to the St. Louis suburb on Sunday and Monday.

Protests, including a night of looting, erupted after a Ferguson police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown on Saturday. Brown was unarmed.

Dotson says he was concerned by how protesters were treated, and for his officers' safety. He decided Tuesday to no longer send officers to the protest area.

Obama has been involved in other high-profile cases with racial overtones: the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watchman and the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates.

MICHAEL BROWN

In the wake of the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, police from multiple departments in riot gear and with military equipment have clashed with protesters nightly. In his first public comments on the case, Obama said there is ""never an excuse"" for violence against police and similarly ""no excuse"" for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to jail protesters for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.

TRAYVON MARTIN

After the unarmed teenager was shot on a rainy night in February 2012 in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, Obama said ""this could have been my son."" A jury acquitted neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman of all charges in the shooting of 17-year-old. Obama said after the verdict that ""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago."" The case led Obama to deliver an extensive reflection on race that was all the more notable because it came from a president who largely has avoided tackling the issue, even as he is dogged by it.

HENRY LOUIS GATES

In July 2009 Obama said police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had ""acted stupidly"" by arresting the black Harvard professor in his own home after investigating a reported burglary. Amid criticism from police officers and others, Obama said he should have used different words. He then brought Gates and the arresting officer, Sgt.

Police told {NBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/anonymous-twitter-feed-suspended-during-ferguson-protests-n180716”> that the person who Anonymous had named online is a dispatcher and was not involved in the Ferguson shooting on Saturday.

In a comment today to MailOnline, a Twitter spokesperson said: 'We do not comment on individual accounts, for privacy an security reasons.'

Twitter rules state: 'You may not publish or post other people's private and confidential information, such as credit card numbers, street address or Social Security/National Identity numbers, without their express authorization and permission.'

Anonymous was now tweeting about Ferguson under a secondary account, @TheAnonMessage2.

On Wednesday, the hackers apparently released St Louis police dispatch tapes which reveal further details surrounding the cop shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

The computer hackers' collective posted two hours of the 911 calls online.

On the tape, time-stamped between 12.05pm-12.35pm, a person, believed to be a dispatcher can be heard referring to an incident in Ferguson, Missouri. Additional squad cars were being requested from Ferguson Police Department for crowd control.

With details unclear, the dispatcher revealed she has heard 'on the news' that actually it appears to be an 'officer involved shooting'.

The dispatcher added that when she called Ferguson Police Department 'they don't know a thing about it'.

About ten minutes into the two-hour recording, the dispatcher allegedly said: 'Ferguson is asking for assistance with crowd control... asking for [unclear] officer respond, can I send one?'

She then added: 'They just told me they needed assistance on crowd control on Canfield and Coppercreek.'

Around a minute later, the St Louis dispatcher said: 'She just said that they have a large group gathering there, she didn't know anything further.'

Seconds later, the dispatcher said: 'We just got another call saying there was an officer involved shooting at Canfield and Coppercreek. I don't know who called it in but it was called into my desk.'

A dispatcher then added: 'Be advised, this information came from the news.'

The dispatcher then orders another St Louis squad car to the scene.

A dispatcher then says: 'We just got the information from the news and we called Ferguson back again but they don't know anything about it.'

A number of squad car numbers are then read out. The dispatcher appears to address one car: '2121 let me know what they have there, as soon as you get there.'

Around a minute later, a dispatcher asked: 'You arrived on something, what were you arriving at?

A few minutes pass with calls to other emergencies but the St Louis dispatchers continue to check in with their responding officers.

One dispatcher said: 'If you need me to [unclear] at any point, I don't know if Ferguson is going to do that.'

The intersection referred to on the tapes is close to the spot where Brown, 18, was shot dead by a Ferguson police office on Saturday.

The release of the dispatch tapes comes after Anonymous earlier threatened to launch an online attack on police departments over alleged brutality in the killing of the teenager.

Police have cracked down hard on demonstrators in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, who took to the streets after the 18-year-old was shot dead.

Despite calls for calm, officers fired tear gas and shot at least one person in a third night of rioting in the area on Tuesday. Police claimed the man shot had pulled a handgun on an officer.

As police tried to put the area on lock-down, messages posted on a newly-established Twitter account called Operation Ferguson, which appeared to be linked to Anonymous, announced: 'We have a deep source, and we have a name we BELIEVE to be the shooter [of Michael Brown]. It does NOT match any of the names being floated.

'We have our best operatives working as hard as they can to verify the leak on the shooter we were passed. PLEASE be patient.

'When we release the name of Mike Brown's killer, it will be in an unequivocal statement released through this Twitter account. No games.'

A little later another message suggested that the operation was proving more difficult than anticipated.

'To my fellow Anons, everyone remain chill,' it read. 'I realize this is an intense Op, and we are all trying our best. Let's fight cops not each other.'

There has been anger from the teenager's parents and their supporters after the Ferguson Police Department decided not to publish the name of the officer who shot their son.

At a rally in Ferguson on Tuesday, his mother, Lesley McSpadden, told the policeman who fired the shots: 'You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.'

Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white.

The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures.

In a video posted on Sunday night, a self-declared spokesman for Anonymous warned Missouri police 'we are watching you very closely'.

'If you abuse, harass or harm in any way the protesters in Ferguson we will take every web-based asset of your departments and governments offline,' said a disguised voice, speaking over news footage of protests.

'That's not a threat, it is a promise.'

In the video and a press release posted to the Pastebin website, the video says Anonymous will 'attack ever server and computer' belonging to the police departments involved, as well as 'release the personal information on every single member of the Ferguson Police Department, as well as any other jurisdiction that participates in the abuse.'

'We will seize all your databases and E-Mail spools and dump them on the Internet,' it said. 'This is your only warning.'

There was no immediate way to verify the video was genuine or that any attacks or hacks have been effective.

However an officer in the records department at Ferguson Police Department told MailOnline today that emails could not be sent because their system had been taken down. This remark could not be confirmed by the police department spokesman on Wednesday.

Investigators have released few details about what they believe happened when Mr Brown was shot, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Michael and another teen to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon.

At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, according to the St Louis County Police Department, which is handling the investigation at the smaller city's request.

The fullest account of Michael's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home with Michael when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who ordered them to move to the sidewalk.

Mr Johnson told news crews that he and Brown kept walking and the officer then reversed his car 'to where it almost hit us.'

The officer, Mr Johnson said, tried to open his door, but it 'ricocheted' back.

Mr Johnson said the officer reached through the window, 'grabbed my friend around the neck' and tried to pull him into the car.

The officer then pulled out his gun and said, '""I'll shoot you' or ""I'm going to shoot"",' Mr Johnson said.

When the officer opened fire, Mr Brown was hit, said Mr Johnson, who hid behind a car.

Mr Brown began running, Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson said the officer pursued Mr Brown and fired again.

When Mr Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. The officer kept firing, Mr Johnson said.

Mr Brown had just graduated from high school and was set to begin at technical college on Monday.",25,NA,NA,NA
DailyMail,daily46,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2724845/For-Obama-pitfalls-power-addressing-race.html,"For Obama, pitfalls and power in addressing race",Associated Press,8/14/2014,12/19/2015,"EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) — For President Barack Obama, the intersection of race and the law has revealed both the pitfalls and the power of wading into these delicate matters as the nation's first black president.

Just months after being sworn in, Obama rapped police in Massachusetts for acting ""stupidly"" by arresting a black Harvard professor at his own home. After more details of the case were revealed, Obama was forced to clarify his statements and tried to make amends by hosting an awkward ""beer summit"" at the White House with the professor and police officer.

Four years later, unburdened by re-election, Obama spoke out passionately about the 2013 acquittal of the man who fatally shot Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teen gunned down near his family's home in Florida. In unusually personal terms, Obama declared that Martin ""could have been me 35 years ago"" and gave voice to the pain felt by the African-American community.

Now the president is again wading into a racially charged matter that has riveted the nation, this time in Ferguson, Missouri, the St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teen was shot and killed by a white police officer. The death of 18-year-old Michael Brown Saturday has been followed by violent clashes between police and protesters.

In his first in-person statement on the situation, Obama appealed Thursday for ""peace and calm"" in Ferguson and called for restraint by all involved.

""There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" Obama said, speaking from the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard where he is in the midst of a two-week vacation. ""There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.""

The president decided to speak on the matter after receiving a late-night briefing Wednesday from Attorney General Eric Holder on the violence that had escalated while Obama mingled with former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others at a birthday party. Until then, Obama had held off to give local law enforcement a chance to quiet the situation, but by Wednesday night it was clear that wasn't happening, according to a White House official who insisted on anonymity in order to describe the president's thinking.

There are conflicting reports about what led to Brown's death. Police say that an officer encountered Brown and another man on the street, and one of the men assaulted the officer and struggled with him over his weapon. During the struggle, which spilled onto the street, Brown was shot multiple times, according to police.

But a man who says he was with Brown during the shooting has told a much different account. Dorian Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.

Obama's carefully worded statement reflected the lack of clarity about what happened. He urged police to be ""open and transparent"" as the investigation unfolds, but made no judgments about what led to Brown's death.

Obama avoided mentioning race in his statement, and he called on people to ""remember that we're all part of one American family.""

The president's approach stood in contrast to his initial handling of the 2009 arrest of his friend Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates. Obama declared during a White House news conference that a white police officer had acted ""stupidly"" in arresting Gates outside his home. Obama conceded days later that his own remarks had inflamed the situation and that Gates had probably overreacted in the moment, contributing to his arrest.

The incident was a searing one for a new president and his team, trying to navigate a black president's role in sensitive racial matters. Throughout the remainder of his first term, Obama largely steered clear of controversial discussions of race, at times irking African-American leaders who wanted to see him take a more active role in racial issues.

But the president's reserve did memorably give way when discussing the death of Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old killed near his family's Florida home by a neighborhood watch volunteer.

Obama addressed the matter in unusually personal terms, declaring that if he had a son, ""he would look like Trayvon."" A year later, when the man who shot Martin was acquitted, the president again used deeply personal language to try to explain the outrage of many in the African-American community.

""The African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,"" Obama said, recalling instances where he had been followed in a department store or heard car locks clicking on doors as he walked down the street.

Obama made no such statements Thursday when discussing Brown, saying only that the teen died in ""heartbreaking and tragic circumstances.""

NAACP president Cornell William Brooks said Obama was right to tread carefully in his remarks given that emotions remain raw and the city of Ferguson remains on edge.

""The president as the chief executive has to be careful and thoughtful in his choice of words, particularly at a moment when there's unrest — unrest in the streets, but also unrest in the American conscience,"" Brooks said.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The protests come as the Missouri State Highway Patrol is taking over supervising security in the St. Louis suburb amid criticisms of the police response.

Early Thursday evening, St. Louis County police and state troopers were walking alongside demonstrators. Several marchers stopped to shake hands with officers. One woman hugged Capt. Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol, who is overseeing security.

(AP) — The images were reminiscent of a war zone: Helmeted officers pointing weapons from armored trucks, flash grenades lighting the night sky and tear gas exploding in crowded streets.

The ugly clashes between police and protesters in this St. Louis suburb fueled a torrent of criticism and raised questions about whether the officers' tactics were inflaming the same violence they aimed to suppress after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager.

The repeated scenes of police officers wearing military-style camouflage and gas masks and training their rifles on unarmed civilians — some holding their hands up — looked to critics more like an Army trying to quell a revolution than a police department trying to keep the peace in a small suburb.

""It's clear what is going on in Ferguson is a complete, hyper-exaggerated, hysterical response on the part of law enforcement,"" said Thomas Nolan, a former Boston police officer and criminal justice professor at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh. ""It's clear that there is no one in charge and no one to corral the officers ... and restrain them from engaging in an unprecedented show of brutal force against civilians. It's horrifying and shameful and a disgrace.""

On Thursday, Gov. Jay Nixon announced that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would take over supervising security in Ferguson. He said the change was intended to ensure ""that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit.""

Nixon's move, along with comments from a wide range of political figures calling for calm, came after protests escalated late Wednesday into smoky chaos. Police lobbed tear gas to repel a crowd of about 150 protesters, some of whom had thrown Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers.

It was the fourth straight day of street confrontations spurred by Saturday's fatal shooting of the 18-year-old by a white police officer. Police have declined to identify the officer, saying he has been the focus of death threats. More than 60 people have been arrested since Sunday.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Thursday that police were trying to balance the public's right to protest with public safety, including the need to keep streets open. But he added, ""If firebombs are being thrown, property gets destroyed, shots get fired ... we have to respond to deadly force.""

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman defended the actions of the officers. ""In talking to these guys, it is scary,"" he said. ""They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from."" He also said coins, bricks and rocks also have been thrown at police. Two officers have been injured. One had an ankle broken by a thrown brick, according to authorities.

St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson told The Associated Press he was so concerned about the way Ferguson officers handled the unrest that he pulled his employees out. The city sent a 24-officer tactical squad to help control protesters Sunday and Monday night.

""I was concerned about the tactics,"" Dotson said. ""I was concerned about the safety of my officers.""

The police chief said he was not being critical because he was not there, but the actions taken in Ferguson were not ""tactics I would use in the city of St. Louis.""

President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder aired their own doubts.

Obama, taking a break from his vacation, said while ""emotions are raw now,"" there needs to be a ""respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.""

Holder said he was concerned that the use of military equipment by Ferguson police sent a ""conflicting message.""

Missouri officials have accepted an offer from the Justice Department to help with crowd control and public safety ""without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force,"" he said.

During a visit to Ferguson, Sen. Claire McCaskill said ""the militarization of the response became more of a problem than the solution."" It escalated the situation. ... These people need to be allowed to exercise their rights, with safety and respect.""

Mike McCollum, a resident of nearby Florissant, told McCaskill the police have created ""a bullying environment.""

""We are not intimidated,"" he said. ""We are not scared to be shot. If a person can be killed unarmed, with their hands up, then I might as well fight,"" he said. ""That's my mentality.""

The events in Ferguson were seen as part of a growing trend among police departments around the country.

In June, the American Civil Liberties Union released a report stating that police were overwhelmingly relying on SWAT raids — involving the use of assault rifles, battering rams and flash-bang grenades — for routine work such as searching for small amounts of drugs and serving warrants. These raids, the ACLU said, disproportionately affected minorities.

In several cases, the paramilitary-style approach led to tragedy, such as a 19-month-old baby critically injured when a flash-bang grenade landed in his crib.

Nolan said Ferguson authorities need to get rid of the advanced weapons and the armored trucks and appeal to Brown's parents, community and religious leaders to stand with them and assure protesters there will be a thorough, impartial investigation into the teen's death.

""The brute force — it's not working,"" Nolan added. ""It hasn't been working for four days. It's time to reassess and time for someone to get in there with a calm head and say ... 'we need to try something different.'""",NA,NA,NA,NA
DailyMail,daily50,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2725438/A-look-whos-charge-Ferguson-security.html,A look at who's in charge of Ferguson security,Associated Press,8/14/2014,12/19/2015,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — Racial unrest has gripped the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson since Saturday, when 18-year-old Michael Brown — black and unarmed — was shot to death by a white police officer in the city where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black and all but three officers on the police force are white. Police response to protests since then has drawn strong criticism, and Missouri's governor on Thursday announced the state would take over overseeing the security. Here is a look at some of the key players in the investigation and the security in the city:

POLICE RESPONSE: Heavily equipped tactical police from four regional agencies — St. Louis County, St. Louis city, St. Charles County and the Missouri State Highway Patrol — had been the staple of controlling demonstrators and warding off potential rioters and looters. Often in riot gear while carrying batons and shields and backed up by armored vehicles, each unit had a commander who would assess the situation and decide whether it merits use of force, including volleys of tear gas, smoke bombs or rubber bullets, according to St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar has said he believes his officers have responded with ""an incredible amount of restraint"" while being pelted with rocks and bottles and shot at.

THE FIRESTORM: Police have been called into question by President Barack Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder and others for using militaristic tactics. Police have insisted they were responding to disperse protesters after some threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers, on one night leaving a St. Louis County officer with a broken ankle from a thrown brick, Schellman said.

WHAT'S CHANGING: The State Highway Patrol has taken over Ferguson's security supervision, with Capt. Ron Johnson — a black Ferguson native — in charge. Local police will still be involved in providing security, but under state supervision. Johnson says he's taking a different approach to the task and was on the street Thursday evening talking to protesters. Nixon, who has faced criticism for not stepping in earlier, said he believes a ""softer front"" could help diffuse the situation.

FERGUSON'S POLICE CHIEF: Chief Thomas Jackson has been the public face of the city's administration and law enforcement since Brown's death. He has pressed for calm amid the unrest. He's heard from angry critics and protesters who have confronted him at rallies, marches and news conferences. He has faced criticism for not releasing the name of the officer who shot Brown and for not discussing circumstances surrounding the teen's death. Jackson has refused to release the officer's name, citing safety concerns. And he says it's up to St. Louis County police to sort out the shooting.

THE INVESTIGATION: Jackson ceded the investigation of Brown's death to the St. Louis County police force headed by Belmar. Named the county's police chief late last year, the 50-year-old Belmar is a certified bomb technician who has been with the department for nearly three decades. Jackson has said he believes it may take two weeks to complete that investigation because of the number of witnesses who have come forward. St. Louis County's prosecutor, Bob McCulloch, said he's not bound by any timeline in presenting the case to a grand jury for a determination of whether charges are warranted.

THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: The FBI is undertaking an investigation parallel to the criminal one by St. Louis County police, sorting out whether anything about Brown's death constitutes a violation of his civil rights. Also, Missouri officials have accepted an offer from the Justice Department to help with crowd control and public safety, according to Holder.

BROWN'S FAMILY: Brown's parents have urged for calm in the wake of their son's death and asked that the public share any information and videos they might have related to the shooting.

Holder's promise came in a telephone call with the family of 18-year-old Michael Brown. A law enforcement official told The Associated Press that Holder spoke to the Brown family while they visited the U.S. attorney's office in Missouri. The official was not authorized to be identified by name and requested anonymity to discuss Holder's call.

Brown was shot by a police officer on Saturday in Ferguson, Missouri. The St. Louis suburb is 70 percent black but is patrolled by a nearly all-white police force. Protests have followed the incident, some of them violent and involving clashes between demonstrators and police in riot gear.

In his call to the Brown family, Holder expressed his personal condolences for the teenager's death and said that the Justice Department was investigating.

Earlier Thursday, Holder said in a statement that says he's concerned that the use of military equipment by police in Ferguson was sending a ""conflicting message"" and that the response by law enforcement to protests ""must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them.""

Ferguson law enforcement authorities accepted the Justice Department's offer of crowd-control help as it continued to investigate the shooting, Holder said. Representatives from the Justice Department's Community Relations Service, which works to mediate race disputes, has been sent to Missouri.

The FBI and Justice Department were conducting a civil rights investigation into the shooting. Holder said eyewitnesses had already been interviewed.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Deputies on Tuesday used a stun gun on Dante Parker during an altercation to take him into custody. Officers suspected Parker of breaking into a home in Victorville.

According to law enforcement officials, deputies found Parker riding a bicycle away from the residence and tried to stop him, but the hulking man appeared to be under the influence of unknown substances and was belligerent.

Deputies say Parker fought with a female deputy and left bruises on her arms. They add that the deputy used a Taser on Parker ‘multiple times’ during a struggle in a bid to subdue him,.

Mr Parker was employed as a pressman at the {Victorville Daily Press}<hyperlink=”http://www.vvdailypress.com/article/20140813/NEWS/140819920/13059/LIFESTYLE”>, where his co-workers reacted with shock to allegations that the man tried to break into someone’s home.

‘Dante was a good man, a family man who just wanted to provide the best he could for his wife and kids,’ his supervisor, Harry Pontius, stated to {NBC Los Angeles}<hyperlink=”http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Man-Dies-in-Deputies-Custody-After-Being-Hit-With-Taser-271144901.html”>.

Parker’s grieving relatives have described the father of five as a gentle giant, telling local media outlets that he did not deserve to die the way he did.

One of his co-workers revealed that the 36-year-old recently quit drinking in an effort to improve his health after being told by a doctor that he was at risk for a heart attack or a stroke.

According to a statement released by the San Bernardino Sheriff’s office, at around 4.47pm Tuesday deputies from the Victorville Police Department responded to the report of someone trying to break into a house in the 13000 block of Bucknell Court in Victorville.

The responding officer saw the suspected would-be burglar, later identified as Parker, riding a bicycle away from the crime scene.

The deputy observed that the 36-year-old man appeared to be ‘under the influence of an unknown substance.’

As he was being detained, Parker allegedly turned combative, prompting the deputy to use a Taser on him multiple times. But the large man continued struggling until backup arrived.

Parker was eventually handcuffed and placed in the backseat of a patrol car, where officers observed that he was sweating profusely and having trouble breathing.

Dante Parker was rushed to the Victor Valley Global Hospital, where he remained conscious but incoherent while receiving treatment. A short time later, he was pronounced dead. He would have turned 37 today.

The Riverside County Coroner's Office will conduct the autopsy to determine the cause of Parker's death.

The pressman leaves behind a wife, four daughters between the ages of 8 and 19, and a 5-year-old son.

‘That whole story is totally wrong; that’s just not Dante,’ Richard Loredo, a former Daily Press employee said. ‘Dante’s not a burglar ... You can see how well his kids were raised; he was a good dad.

Parker’s cousin Ge’shun Harris sounded a similar note, telling the paper that the victim was able to rise above his difficult upbringing.

‘My cousin was a good man, and that’s hard to do when you’re born into the streets of L.A. County,’ Harris said. ‘[He[ worked hard and took care of his kids and his wife.’

Born in crime-ridden Compton, California, to a large family, Parker did not have any run-ins with the law in San Bernardino County, but he had a DUI conviction in Los Angeles.

Parker's death following a confrontation with law enforcement comes as violent riots continue in Ferguson, Missouri, in response to the killing of unarmed teen Michael Brown, who was shot by a police officer Saturday.",69,NA,NA,NA

Tensions flared as some protestors attempted to shove their way through a police barricade set up in their path toward the beating heart of the city.

Police held their own and tempers soon calmed, but as night gripped New York, the already congested Times Square ground to a halt as over 1000 marchers flowed into the streets to demand an end to police brutality and militarization and justice for 18-year-old Brown.

The group chanted 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' in their march toward midtown that tied up traffic in the hours after the evening rush.

According to {WABC}<hyperlink=”http://abc7ny.com/society/police-shooting-protests-held-in-times-square-union-square/261386/”>, police for the most part allowed the protest to move forward unhampered before forcing them into a corral at 42nd Street and 9th Avenue.

Authorities, not nearly as heavily armed or intimidating as the now widely criticized Ferguson police were in previous nights of protest, kept the group confined with orange netting and only allowed people to disperse in small groups.

Some arrests were made, though an exact number remained unclear.

New York's was one of a slew of protests and vigils held nationally--from Miami to Houston to Chicago and Los Angeles--as part of the National Day of Silence in Remembrance of Michael Brown.

Meanwhile, in Missouri, a black police chief who is now in charge of policing the protests in St Louis over the death of a black teenager walked among the crowd as he began the 'shift' away from military style policing.

Captain Ron Johnson said: 'I'm not afraid to be in this crowd today' as he marched with 1,000 people in the suburb of Ferguson.

The Missouri Highway Patrol chief said he wanted a 'new day' and an end to the violence.

Protests are planned for a fifth night in Ferguson, the once quiet suburb of St Louis, where Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said today that State Highway Patrol will take over supervision of security.

Officials hoped that the change in law enforcement would end the days of violence between protesters and officers following Saturday's fatal shooting of Brown. Governor Nixon said security will be overseen by Captain Johnson who is black, said he grew up in the community.

Asked how he thought about the death of Michael Brown, who was gunned down by a white cop, he said: 'If that was my son, if that was my friend, how would I feel?'

As night fell however it remained to be seen if the goodwill would endure.

Most of the violence over the past four days in this Missouri city has come after dark.

Johnson was asked to take over from St Louis County Police after their heavy handed tactics - involving tear gas and riot police - were condemned and commented on by President Obama.

The new approach involved Johnson coming down to the crowd himself around 5.30pm

He was hugged by a reverend and did numerous interviews to the media - until now the commanding officer was nowhere to be seen.

Black officers walked among the protestors and listened to them and white officers made hand signals to each other to stay calm.

Captain Ronnie Johnson, of St Louis Police, said: 'The community asked for nourishment and we're going to give it to them'.

Earlier a crowd of 1,000 had peacefully marched from the gas station that was torched during the riots and stopped outside the spot where Michael was shot dead.

He said that he would work to restore peace to his community which he said had been turned into a 'war zone.'

A chain of protests has spread across the U.S. and appeared to have been started by the Twitter hashtag #NMOS14, which called for a national moment of silence for 18-year-old Brown.

On Thursday starting 7pm (EST), hundreds of groups began to peacefully protest in locations from New York City to Detroit, DC, Chicago, Boston and Hawaii against police brutality.

Amnesty International tweeted: 'Tonight we're joining National Moment of Silence for victims of police brutality.'

Teach For America added: 'We are joining tonight's #NMOS14 at 7pm ET.'

Governor Nixon championed people's right to publicly protest on Thursday but said that Ferguson would not tolerate violence.

'Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,' Nixon said at a news conference earlier on Thursday.

'What's gone on here over the last few days is not what Missouri is about, it is not what Ferguson is about. This is a place where people work, go to school, raise their families and go to church, a diverse community, a Missouri community,' he added.

His strong words followed a phone call from Obama earlier in the day, where the President expressed concern over how the protests were being handled.

Heavily-militarized units of officers have been patrolling the streets of Ferguson, a St Louis suburb, deploying canisters of tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs.

St Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said officers on Wednesday night, the fourth night of violence, tossed tear gas to disperse a large crowd of protesters after some threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers. More than 10 people were arrested in Ferguson.

'In talking to these guys, it is scary,' Schellman said of officers on the front lines of the protest. 'They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.'

Obama said today there was no place in America for police brutality but appealed for 'peace and calm' on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri following the cop shooting of Michael Brown.

The President has ordered the FBI and Department of Justice to conduct an 'open and transparent' investigation into the death of the unarmed 18-year-old student on Saturday. Obama said Brown's death occurred 'in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances'.

Despite speaking up for the public's right to demonstrate, the President went on to say there was 'no excuse' for violence against police or the looting which were done under the guise of protests.

He said: 'There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting.

'There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protesters, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.'

Obama also referred to the arrest of two journalists on Wednesday night, saying that it was not acceptable for police to arrest reporters who were just doing their job by sharing with the public what they saw on the ground.

The President held a press conference from his vacation spot in Martha's Vineyard on Thursday afternoon to address the escalating situation in Missouri.

Obama spoke with Attorney General Eric Holder today who was closely following the situation in Ferguson.

The Department of Justice will conduct an independent investigation into Brown's death.

'I made clear to the Attorney General that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done,' he said.

Obama called the images of clashes between police and protesters as 'deeply disturbing' but said that he had faith in Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to restore peace and ensure that justice is done.

Obama said he had spoken with Governor Nixon, calling him a 'good man' and a 'fine governor'. adding that he had faith in him to take control of the situation.

The President said that although 'emotions are raw in Ferguson', it must be remembered that behind the widespread unrest was the death of a young man.

He said: 'We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old, and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again.'

Obama closed his remarks by saying: 'Let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.'

Governor Nixon traveled to Ferguson on Thursday where he announced there would be an 'operational shift' in policing in the town.

Nixon has faced criticism for not doing more to control the violence in the St Louis suburb.

At the community meeting, Sierra Smith, who lives in the neighborhood where Brown was shot, told the governor 'the police have no respect at all for the community'.

Nixon responded that the Bill of Rights gives the people 'the right speak truth to power' and 'we will work to live out those rights'.

{NewsChannel 5}<hyperlink=””> reported that the FBI will now take the reins in Ferguson, overseeing a large part of the investigation into the shooting. The FBI will also be in charge of operations and protests in the suburb.

The local police, including St Louis County, will be under the charge of the FBI. The Department of Justice are also sending special prosecutors to assist with the investigation.

During a fourth night of protests over the teen's death in Ferguson on Thursday, heavily-armed SWAT police trained their guns on the public and fired tear gas to disperse crowds.

An estimated 500 people ignored the night curfew imposed by police and instead faced-off against officers chanting: 'Hands Up! Don't Shoot!'

After repeatedly asking them to disperse, the riot police then fired tear gas into the crowd to break it up.

The protesters that remained began pitched street battles with police and lobbed Molotov cocktails at the camouflage-clad officers who responded with more tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs.

There were no immediate reports of injuries from the violence but later on Thursday, an image was posted to an Instagram account by 'tef_poe' showing a middle-aged lady, identified as a Pastor of America, who had been praying when she was hit with a rubber bullet.

The rubber bullet left a bloody wound ringed with dark bruising on the woman's abdomen. A caption next to the image read: 'For all those who think this is a joke or think we are being irrational, this lady is a pastor she was praying when they shot her.'

There were at least ten arrests. Among them were two journalists, working for the Huffington Post and Washington Post, who were arrested while working in a McDonald's. Ryan J.

DailyMail,daily55,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2724599/Missouri-Highway-Patrol-seizes-control-Ferguson.html,Missouri Highway Patrol seizes control of Ferguson,Associated Press,8/14/2014,12/21/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — The Missouri Highway Patrol seized control of a St. Louis suburb Thursday, stripping local police of their law-enforcement authority after four days of clashes between officers in riot gear and furious crowds protesting the death of an unarmed black teen shot by an officer.

The intervention, ordered by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, came as President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting of Michael Brown and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town that is nearly 70 percent black patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

Obama said there was ""no excuse"" for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.

Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening in the neighborhood where looters smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and police repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

But the latest protests were a world apart from the earlier demonstrations, with a light, even festive atmosphere and no hint of violence. The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter.

Protester Cleo Willis said the change was palpable.

""You can feel it. You can see it,"" he said. ""Now it's up to us to ride that feeling.""

After a particularly violent Wednesday night, Nixon said local police would no longer be in charge of the area, although they would still be present. He said Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, would be in command.

The change was meant to ensure ""that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately,"" Nixon said.

""Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,"" the governor said at a news conference in the nearby community of Normandy.

The governor was joined at a news conference by the white mayor of St. Louis and the region's four state representatives and the county executive, all of whom are black.

Johnson said he grew up in the area and ""it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence."" He said he planned to keep heavily armored vehicles away from the scene and told his officers not to bring their gas masks.

By late afternoon, Johnson was walking down the street with a large group of protesters as they chanted ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" a reference to witness accounts that described Brown as having his hands in the air when the officer kept firing. He planned to talk to the demonstrators throughout the night.

""We're going to have some conversations with them and get an understanding of what's going on.""

At one point, Johnson spoke to several young men wearing red bandanas around their necks and faces. After the discussion, one of the men reached out and embraced him.

At the burned-out QuikTrip near the shooting scene, children drew on the ground with chalk and people left messages about Brown.

Earlier Thursday, Obama appealed for ""peace and calm"" on the streets.

""I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,"" Obama said, speaking from the Massachusetts island where he's on a two-week vacation. ""But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.""

Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control — a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police took over, leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the request of the smaller city.

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said his officers have responded with ""an incredible amount of restraint"" as they've had rocks and bottles thrown at them, been shot at and had two dozen patrol vehicles destroyed.

The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others.

The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said later that the name was incorrect.

Like last year's Trayvon Martin shooting, social media brought international attention to a tragedy that might otherwise have been known only to the immediate community. Ferguson spawned a proliferation of hashtags and was the dominant subject Thursday on Twitter, Facebook and other sites. Journalists and protesters offered real-time pictures, videos and text reports, and the world responded, often in outrage.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

The officer involved was injured, with one side of his face swollen, Jackson said.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told reporters that the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Attorney General Eric Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed eyewitnesses to the shooting. A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said federal authorities have interviewed Johnson.

Holder spoke by telephone Thursday with Brown's family to offer condolences and to tell them that the Justice Department was committed to a full and independent investigation.",NA,NA,NA,NA

African Methodist Episcopal church pastor Renita Lamkin was left with a massive wound, while a Howard university alumna posted a photo of herself with a bloodied head in an ambulance to tell her followers she'd been 'shot'in the head on Wednesday.

Evidence of what protestors call the excessive, albeit 'non-lethal' force being used in Ferguson--rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper 'shots' and even wooden projectiles--began showing up on social media Thursday as the fifth day of demonstrations in support of gunned down unarmed teen Michael Brown rolled on.

'[I was] standing in the middle of the street, with people behind me, and the police were in front of me,' African Methodist Episcopal church pastor Lamkin told the {Huffington Post}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-pastor-shot-police-rubber-bullet_n_5678973.html”>. 'And then there was a pop!'

Lamkin was reportedly standing before police and chanting 'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus' as she demanded the release of arrested St. Louis politician Antonio French when she was hit by a 60 caliber rubber bullet.

Before long, though, Lamkin was back in action trying her best to protect demonstrators and keep the peace. She even paused for her huge wound to be photographed.

While Lamkin was quickly back in the fighting spirit, fellow protester Mya Aaten-White was down for the count Wednesday after she was 'shot' in the head in Ferguson.

The Howard University grad posted to Instagram a photo of herself in what appears to be an ambulance with a wrapped and bloodied head.

Hours later, reports {NBC Washington}<hyperlink=”http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Howard-University-Grad-Mya-White-Shot-in-Ferguson-Missouri-271285081.html”>, Aaten-White posted that she'd been 'shot in the head,' and taken into custody.

It was unclear if she'd been shot with actual bullets, rubber bullets or with one of the other 'non-lethal' but controversial weapons that have been employed by Ferguson police.

In addition to the dime-sized rubber bullets police showered on the crowd along with clouds of tear gas, some protestors reported being bombarded with thick wooden disks and balls filled with pepper powder designed to burst on impact.

While soft and non-explosive, rubber bullets can cause extremely painful and potentially long-lasting injuries.

The buckshot-like black balls can hit targets in the sensitive eye area, causing temporary or even permanent blindness, among other possible injuries.

'This type of inaccurate ammunition … makes it difficult or impossible to avoid severe injuries to vulnerable body regions such as the head, neck, and upper torso, leading to substantial mortality, morbidity, and disability,' concludes a 2000 Israeli study published in Lancet.

The vigils, observed in more than 90 cities as part of a National Moment of Silence, came days after the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown and the death of a New York man caused by a police officer's chokehold.

In downtown St. Louis, in a tiny park near the Gateway Arch, several hundred people, seemingly an equal number whites and blacks, gathered in Brown's memory.

The site is a short drive from suburban Ferguson, where Brown was killed, stoking racial unrest. In Ferguson, two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black and all but three of the 53 police officers are white.

The St. Louis gathering was peaceful in contrast with a night of looting and clashes between demonstrators and police in Ferguson earlier in the week.

The attendees included Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, who didn't address the crowd but waved, drawing applause as she wiped away tears.

The observance was among many staged nationwide, each with a minute of silence for Brown and others who died at the hands of police.

Bishop Elliott Coleman, of St. Louis' El Bethel Temple Church, said in opening the observance there that people were coming together ""for this reason of healing.""

""Realize there are tears in every city, tears in homes, tears in the eyes of young people, tears in the eyes of old people,"" Coleman said. ""The tears need to be wiped away, and the hearts need to be healed.""

In New York, thousands of people peacefully gathered in Manhattan's Times Square and Union Square, invoking the rallying cries ""hands up, don't shoot"" and ""I can't breathe,"" alluding to the death of 43-year-old Eric Garner, who was arrested on Staten Island on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes and was placed in an officer's chokehold.

Garner, who had asthma, can be heard on tape shouting ""I can't breathe!"" and died a short time later.

The police commissioner in New York has said officers will be retrained on the use of force. Police in Ferguson have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street and one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and physically assaulted him.

Antonia Moe, who attended the Union Square vigil with her 12-year-old son, said incidents like Brown's death have changed the way she talks to her son about being black.

""When things like this happen you kind of have to remember to remind him that some of the rules that apply to others don't necessary apply to you,"" she said.

In Orlando, Florida, about 15 miles outside the Sanford suburb where unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin was shot and killed by neighborhood watch leader George Zimmerman in 2012, a multicultural crowd of about 100 people gathered in front of a park amphitheater.

One woman carried a sign that read: ""No Justice, No Peace. We Stand With Ferguson."" Another man's sign said: ""Hands up. Don't Shoot! RIP Mike Brown.""

In Chicago, hundreds of people gathered downtown at Daley Plaza, where chants of ""No justice! No peace! No racist police!"" were heard.

In Nevada, about 40 people gathered outside the federal courthouse in Reno, and dozens gathered in Seattle, holding up signs that read ""Unite Against Racism"" and ""Solidarity With Ferguson.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Among those who’ve condemned the program is U.S. Senator Rand Paul, who writes in a Thursday {Time}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> op-ed that such militarization ‘allows the police to become judge and jury’ making it ‘almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them.’

Paul’s outcries—as well as those of Democratic Georgia Congressman Hank Johnson—come amidst revelations that St. Louis County has in fact received tactical weapons from the Pentagon and that Ferguson is part of the federal program that routinely gifts even small suburban police forces with everything from pistols to war tanks.

‘Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them,’ Paul writes.

Ferguson, along with many other U.S. communities, has taken part in the Pentagon's Excess Property Program, known as 1033, which distributes surplus military equipment to police.

The program began in the early 1990s to assist anti-drug efforts and grew after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

A report released in June by the American Civil Liberties Union, titled ‘War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing,’ documents the flow of armored robots, military-style rifles and tactical vehicles to local police departments.

The program has proved popular with police forces across the country, with local officials saying it saves them money and offers valuable equipment that helps protect police officers.

Through the program, Arizona's Maricopa County has amassed a stockpile of 120 assault rifles, five armored vehicles and 10 helicopters, the ACLU report found. The city of North Little Rock, Arkansas, obtained 34 automatic and semiautomatic rifles, two robots designed for Afghanistan and ground troop helmets.

Rep. Hank Johnson also chimed in Thursday to say that Brown's case highlights the need for the legislation that would curb the 24-year-old defense department program and has been in the works for months.

Johnson said city streets should be a place for businesses and families, 'not tanks and M16s.' He said a Pentagon program that transfers surplus military equipment to state and local law enforcement has led to police agencies resembling paramilitary forces.

'Militarizing America's main streets won't make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent,' Johnson said Thursday.

He said his bill would limit the type of military equipment that can be transferred to law enforcement, and require states to certify they can account for all equipment received.

An Associated Press investigation last year of the Defense Department program found that a large share of the $4.2 billion in surplus military gear distributed since 1990 went to police and sheriff's departments in rural areas with few officers and little crime.

The hundreds of people who have gathered each night since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by an unnamed police officer last Saturday have been met with police clad in body armor and using tear gas, smoke bombs and stun grenades.

On Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said it was clear the scenes playing out in the St. Louis suburb ‘cannot continue.’ And while he condemned acts of violence and looting by some protesters, he said it was the role of law enforcement to reduce tensions in the city, rather than exacerbate them.

‘At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,’ Holder said.",119,NA,NA,NA

The dramatic shift came after Missouri Governor Jay Nixon assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol, stripping local police from the St. Louis County Police Department of their authority after four days of clashes with furious crowds protesting the weekend death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

'All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,' said Pedro Smith, 41, who has participated in the nightly protests. 'This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect.'

The more tolerant response came as President Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting - and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

Obama said there was 'no excuse' for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.

Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again on Thursday evening in the neighborhood where looters had smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and where police had repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

But the latest protests had a light, almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd, more akin to a parade or block party.

The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell —the point at which previous protests have grown tense — no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.

'You can feel it. You can see it,' protester Cleo Willis said of the change. 'Now it's up to us to ride that feeling.'

Nixon appointed Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, to lead the police effort. Johnson, who grew up near Ferguson and commands a region that includes St. Louis County, marched alongside protesters Thursday, joined by other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol as well as the county department. The marchers also had a police escort.

'We're here to serve and protect,' Johnson said. 'We're not here to instill fear.'

Several people stopped to shake hands and even hug Johnson and other officers, thanking them by name. At one point, Johnson spoke to several young men wearing red bandanas around their necks and faces. After the discussion, one of the men reached out and embraced him.

At the QuikTrip, children drew on the ground with chalk and people left messages about Brown.

Obama had appealed for 'peace and calm' on the streets.

'I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,' Obama said. 'But let's remember that we're all part of one American family.'

Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control — a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police had taken over the investigation of Brown's shooting and security at the request of the smaller city.

Nixon vowed that 'Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it.' The governor was joined at a news conference by the white mayor of St. Louis and the region's four state representatives and the county executive, all of whom are black.

The city and county remain under criticism, though, for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others. The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said the name was incorrect.

Like the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, social media brought international attention to the tragedy. Ferguson spawned a proliferation of hashtags and has been a dominant subject on Twitter, Facebook and other sites. Journalists and protesters offered real-time pictures, videos and updates, and the world responded.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown, has told a much different story. He has said the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Attorney General Eric Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed witnesses to the shooting. A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said federal authorities have interviewed Johnson. Holder spoke by telephone Thursday with Brown's family.

In St. Louis, Brown's mother appeared briefly Thursday night at an anti-brutality gathering near the city's Gateway Arch, urging through a relative for peace to prevail. The observance was among many staged nationwide, each with a minute of silence for Brown and others affected by alleged police brutality.",51,NA,NA,NA

After releasing the tape on Friday, police admitted that Officer Darren Wilson didn't know Michael Brown was a suspect in a robbery when he stopped the teen and subsequently shot him dead in Ferguson last Saturday.

Attorney Anthony Gray, a lawyer for the family, said that the release of the tape was a 'strategic side show' aimed at 'denigrating their son'.

Mr Gray said that the teenager's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr, 'never described him as the perfect kid' and fully admitted that they had done their best to keep Michael on the right path for his future.

The lawyer added: 'No one out there is proud of everything they have done when they were a teenager.'

Daryl Parks, another attorney for the Brown family, also told gathered media that it 'appears to be Michael' in the store CCTV.

Mr Gray described the release of the video - which the police chief said at a follow-up news conference on Friday was simply done because of 'media requests' - was a great distraction from the main issue.

'That Michael had bullets pumped into his body while his hands were in the air,' he added.

Michael Brown, who was unarmed, was shot up to eight times in the middle of the street in Ferguson, a St Louis suburb, around midday on Saturday.

POLICE OFFICER WHO SHOT MICHAEL BROWN WON DEPARTMENT AWARD

The officer who shot Michael Brown won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February, it was revealed today.

Darren Wilson, 28, was nowhere to be seen at his white middle class home in the suburb of Crestwood where he moved just a year ago. It was claimed he'd left the single-story brick home 'days ago'. No one answered the door when MailOnline knocked on the door and there were two or three police cars parked outside.

Neighbors told USA Today that he was 'tall and slim' and was often seen walking his dog.

Another neighbor, Ron Gorski, told {USA Today}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/”>: 'He's a young guy,' Gorski said of Wilson. 'Things happen and it's a complicated situation. I feel for the family and the entire country.'

Wilson, who is on paid administrative leave, won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February, according to {NBC}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/Tom_Winter/status/500290160836100096”>'s Tom Winter.

He has spent four years in Ferguson and two previous years in the Jennings district, said Winter.

Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said the shooting had been 'devastating, absolutely devastating' to Wilson, adding: 'We had no complaints about the officer. He was a gentleman. A quiet officer. He has been an effective officer.'

According to public records, his mother died in 2002. Wilson has a sister and a half-brother.

Mr Gray added: 'The family feels at this time where there is calm is in the community, he [Jackson] is inciting the community all over again.

'We were finally getting to a point where we were galvanizing questions and now we are focusing on the sideshow. Do not take the bait.'

On Friday morning, police had revealed the name of the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson.

Simultaneously, they handed out video stills and a police report referring to a 'strong-armed' robbery at a convenience store close to the shooting where Brown was the 'primary suspect'.

At a secondary police conference on Friday, Chief Jackson said Officer Wilson was only in the area when the robbery took place because he was responding to a separate 911 call.

Wilson only stopped Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson on Saturday around noon because they were walking down the middle of the road and blocking traffic, the chief said.

When asked about the police's timing of releasing the robbery video along with the name of Officer Wilson today, the police chief said he did so because 'you asked for it' - referring to Freedom of Information requests from the media regarding the shooting. He added that he had 'sat on the video for as long as he could'.

Eric Davis spoke to the media, on behalf of his cousin, Michael's mother, Lesley McSpadden. Mr Davis said the release of the store robbery video tape was 'smoke and mirrors'.

He added: 'Whatever took place in the grocery store does not reflect what happened on Canfield [the street where Brown was shot dead].'

He asked for support from the community but once again reiterated the family's wish that there be no violence.

Brown's grieving family reacted with fury after police announced the dead teen was the 'primary suspect' in a convenience store robbery.

Along with naming Officer Wilson, which came after mounting public pressure to identify the shooter, the Ferguson police chief took the opportunity to disperse video stills and an incident report from a 'strong-armed' robbery that took place moments before the shooting on Saturday.

The teenager's family expressed their outrage at the police's decision to 'assassinate' their son's character and divert attention from the cop killing.

The statement read: 'Michael Brown’s family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piecemeal information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.

'There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.

'The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.

'It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.

'The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.'

Michael's aunt Sheryl Davis told MailOnline: 'It's appalling. I think that the police will try anything to smear Michael.

'Nothing surprises me with the way that this police force have treated this whole thing.'

She added that the family would be asking for the full surveillance footage to see if it was indeed the teenager in the clip.

The family had described their son, who had no prior criminal record, as a 'gentle giant' who was looking forward to starting college this week before his death.

Police also used today's news conference to name Darren Wilson as the white police officer who fatally shot Brown.

In a shocking twist to the killing which sparked riots in St Louis, Missouri over the last few days, the officer investigating the convenience store robbery also attended the scene of the shooting and said the suspect and Brown were the same person.

According to the police report, video shows Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson having an altercation with store staff and allegedly stealing a box of Swisher Sweets cigars on Saturday, shortly before midday.

In the grainy images, a large black man wearing a light-colored shirt, distinctive shoes, a red baseball hat and khaki shorts is seen stealing cigars the cigars and then assaulting a clerk who intervenes.

A photograph of Michael Brown’s lifeless body, taken minutes later in the street, shows that he was wearing a light grey shirt, the same shoes and khaki cargo shorts. There was also a red baseball cap by the body.

The report, released by police on Friday, said the victim ‘had just come out of the restroom when Brown said he wanted several boxes of cigars.

As the attendant was ‘placing the boxes on the counter, Brown grabbed a box of Swisher Sweet cigars and handed them to Johnson who was standing behind Brown’.

Brown was told by the unidentified person that he had to pay for cigars, which cost $48.99.

The report then reads: ‘That is when Brown reached across the counter and grabbed numerous packs of Swisher Sweets and turned to leave the store.’

The attendant then called 911 as someone else came out from ‘behind the counter and attempts to stop Brown from leaving’.

Someone tried to stop Brown from leaving and locked the door until ‘Brown returned the merchandise to him’.

‘That is when Brown grabbed X by the shirt and forcefully pushed him back into the display rack.

'X backed away and Brown and Johnson exited the store with the cigars’, said the report.

The robbery report described Brown as 6ft 4inches and weighing 292lbs.

The police report also gave a detailed description of the suspect's clothing. It said the store robbery suspect was wearing tan khaki long shorts, a white T-shirt, yellow socks and flip-flop style shoes.

The officer writing the robbery report said he attended the scene of Brown’s shooting and that after reviewing the surveillance footage: ‘I was able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect in this incident.

'A second person, also at that scene, identified himself as being with Brown. That person was later identified as Dorian Johnson.

A MATTER OF MINUTES: TIMELINE OF THE MICHAEL BROWN SHOOTING

11.48am - Officer Darren Wilson and an ambulance crew were at an unrelated call about a sick person

11.51am - A 911 call comes in about a 'strong- armed' robbery at a nearby convenience store

11.52am - Police radio dispatch gives a description of two robbery suspects who assaulted a clerk and stole Swisher Sweet cigars. The clerk says the suspects were walking toward the QuickTrip gas station

12.01pm – Officer Wilson encounters Michael Brown walking in the middle of the street in the 2900 block of Canfield Drive. The officer shoots Brown dead following an altercation

12.04pm – A second officer arrives on scene and the ambulance from the sick call arrives to give Brown medical attention. He is declared dead at the scene

12.05pm – A supervisor arrives at the scene of the shooting

'After observing Johnson and reviewing the video, I confirmed he is the second suspect in this incident.’

Dorian Johnson’s account of the shooting will now come under intense scrutiny with the revelation that he was identified as a robbery suspect too.

The 22-year-old, who was with Michael when he was shot dead, has said in numerous interviews that the incident began when the officer drove past and told them to 'get the f*** on the sidewalk' as they were on the road.

He mentioned nothing about the alleged convenience store robbery.

The information that was handed out by Ferguson police on Friday only held details about the alleged robbery and included no report from Officer Wilson about the shooting.

Despite the link to the robbery, there will still be an investigation into whether unnecessary force was used by Wilson in the killing of the 18-year-old, who was unarmed.

Officer Darren Wilson is a six-year veteran of the Ferguson Police Department and has no history of disciplinary action.

The cop, from the St Louis area, was treated for injuries after the shooting, according to polic

Chief Jackson said that the officer is 'torn up' over the shooting of Michael Brown.

Today, staff at the convenience store which Brown allegedly robbed have boarded it up because they fear rioters will kill them.

Two police cars were parked outside on Friday to watch the property, which is a short distance away from where Michael was shot dead.

Employees at the store appeared nervous and tense as they were asked about the incident. One staff member, a man in his 40s, told MailOnline: 'He didn't deserve to die. I feel bad about what happened.'

Another man in his 30s said: 'People are going to come and kill us. We are worried. Are you going to protect us?'

The men also revealed that the clerk who was working that day is doing okay but scared as well.

In a brief press conference shortly before 9am (CT) on Friday, Chief Jackson gave a timeline of the minutes leading up to Officer Wilson’s shooting of Brown on August 9.

At 11.48am, Officer Wilson was attending an unrelated ‘sick call’ with an ambulance present.

At 11.51am, a 911 call came in reporting a 'strong-armed' robbery at a convenience store, which included a description of two suspects.

At 11.52am, dispatch gave a description of a robbery suspect over the radio.

A further description, with more details, was given over the radio and stated the suspect was walking towards another convenience store, QuickTrip.

'CHARACTER ASSASSINATION': MICHAEL BROWN'S FAMILY AND PROTESTERS REACT

Reaction to Ferguson police's announcement today that Michael Brown was primary suspect in a store robbery, has drawn outrage from his grieving family.

Brown's family slammed the devious police for 'assassinating Michael's character'.

They told AP that the police were playing 'the old game of smoke and mirrors'.

His aunt Sheryl Davis told MailOnline: 'It's appalling. I think that the police will try anything to smear Michael.'

Social media reacted to the information with a mixed response.

The Reverend Al Sharpton tweeted on Friday: '@smokey: ""You can't jump over a murder & talk to me about some cigars…"" @thereval @newsone #Ferguson'''

The feelings of many were summed up by one user Jay @_TribeCalledJ, who tweeted:'Mike Brown being a robbery suspect doesn't justify the 7 or 8 shots that were fired into his body.

Lisa Bloom, an NBC legal analyst and practising attorney, tweeted: 'How today's robbery report changes the #Ferguson cop's defense: watch for him to argue he had right to shoot #MikeBrown as ""fleeing felon.

Journalist Piers Morgan tweeted: 'Alleged theft of cigars is not a reason to shoot dead an unarmed teenager. #MichaelBrown #Ferguson'

At 12.01pm, Officer Wilson made contact with Michael Brown who was walking with a friend on Canfield Drive.

A second officer arrived on scene immediately after the shooting.

At 12.05pm, a supervisor dispatched to the scene and was joined by other officers.

Chief Jackson said the ambulance that had been on the sick call responded to the shooting and provided medical assistance to Mr Brown - who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police have said 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead after Officer Wilson encountered him and another man on the street.

Police claim one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon.

At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

Witnesses have said the officer fired on Brown as he tried to run away.

Ferguson police were heckled on Thursday night while patrolling an angry crowd protesting the death of black teenager Michael Brown.

Demonstrators had chanted: 'What's his name? What's his name?' at Officer Jon Belmar.

The president, First Lady Michelle Obama and their daughter Malia were seen cycling together down the Manuel F. Correllus State Forest bike path outside West Tisbury, Massachusetts, this afternoon.

It was not immediately clear where Sasha Obama, the younger Obama daughter, was during the family outing.

Sasha did not accompany her family to Martha's Vineyard when they left Washington, D.C. last Saturday.

The White House has said she'll be joining her family for part of their two-week summer vacation, but she has yet to be seen.

Reporters traveling with first family on vacation said the president spent just under half an hour biking with his wife and daughter before breaking away to hit the links.

Obama is playing his fifth game of golf today since arriving on the island. He was joined today by 32 Advisors Founder and CEO Robert Wolf.

Wolf is a hedge fund and money manager who served on Obama's now-defunct Jobs Council.

Today is the first time the Obama family, sans Sasha, have been seen hanging out together since the start of their 15 day vacation.

The president's two-week holiday has been half work, half play, as crises domestically and abroad demanded his attention.

Obama refused to cancel his summer vacation as a the fighting in Iraq raged on, but took time to make an on-camera statement on the situation from the lawn of his vacation home on Monday.

He again briefed Americans on Thursday afternoon, speaking both on Iraq and on the civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police officer shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old, African-American resident of the town.

When Obama hasn't been working on the trip, he's been on the golf course with a rotating group of friends, including Cyrus Walker, the cousin of White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, and former U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk.

The president has played golf every day of his trip except Monday and Wednesday.

On Monday the White House says the Obamas went to the beach. No photos of that family outing have emerged, however.

The president and first lady were spotted, however, out at dinner on Tuesday night at the Sweet Life Cafe in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, with Obama administration officials Susan Rice and Eric Holder and their spouses. Kirk and his spouse also went on the outing.

The following evening the White House says the Obamas danced the night away at the birthday party of a friend.

An attendee of the dinner, held at the Farm Neck Golf Club, posted a photo of the president cutting a rug on the dance floor at the celebration, but it has since been deleted.

The Obamas are scheduled to stay in Martha's Vineyard through Sunday, August 24, however the president will take a two-day trip back to Washington this Sunday.

It's unknown why Obama is heading back to the White House in the middle of his trip, as his spokesperson is staying on Martha's Vineyard and Vice President Biden is scheduled to be away until Tuesday - the day Obama plans to return to his vacation spot.

The White House has stated that the president has 'meetings' he needs to attend in Washington and has declined to go in detail on Obama's mid-vacation agenda.",217,NA,NA,NA

Critics say Ferguson protest response shows giving US military gear to police has gone too far

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Missouri police department at the center of an uproar over the shooting death of an unarmed black teen-ager acquired two armored Humvees and other military gear for free through a Pentagon program that critics blame for ""militarizing America's Main Streets"" and aggravating clashes between police and protesters.

The Ferguson Police Department received the two Humvees as well as a generator and a flatbed trailer under the surplus equipment program run by the Defense Logistics Agency, which is in charge of getting supplies of all types for the military.

News footage and photos of police outfitted in paramilitary gear clashing with protesters in Ferguson — a largely black suburb of St. Louis with a mostly white police force — have provided new impetus to efforts to rein in the Pentagon program. It provides assault weapons and other surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies across the country.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his committee will review the program to determine if the Defense Department surplus is being used as intended.

The program began in 1990 as a way to help states and local agencies fight drug-related crime. It was expanded in the mid-1990s.

Timeline of fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri

Russia denies its military vehicles crossed into Ukraine or were destroyed on Ukrainian soil

KAMENSK-SHAKHTINSKY, Russia (AP) — NATO on Friday said a Russian military column ventured overnight into Ukraine, and the Ukrainian president said his forces destroyed most of it. Russia denied all of this, but the reports spooked global markets and overshadowed optimism driven by agreement over a Russian aid convoy bound for eastern Ukraine.

The Russian aid convoy of more than 250 trucks has been a source of tensions since it set off from Moscow on Tuesday. Kiev and the West were suspicious that the mission could be a pretext for a Russian military incursion into eastern Ukraine, where government forces are battling pro-Russia separatists and clawing back rebel-held territory.

Throughout the eastern crisis that erupted in April, there have been consistent allegations that Russia is fomenting or directing the rebellion. Moscow rejects the allegations and the high-profile aid convoy could be aimed, in part, at portraying Russia as interested in cooling the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to cultivate that perception in a Thursday speech in which he said Russia hopes for peace in Ukraine.

It was not clear what Russia could hope to gain by sending in a military column while world attention was trained on its efforts to get the aid convoy into eastern Ukraine.

But some foreign journalists reported that Russian armored personnel carriers were seen crossing into Ukraine on Thursday night. On Friday, a statement on Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's website said ""the given information was trustworthy and confirmed because the majority of the vehicles were destroyed by Ukrainian artillery at night.""

Pope faces tough sell as he urges young in land of 'Gangnam Style' to reject materialism

DAEJEON, South Korea (AP) — Pope Francis called Friday for Catholics to combat the allure of materialism, an appeal that might be a hard sell in South Korea, a newly rich and hyper-competitive country.

Far from being considered an evil, the trappings of wealth are often linked here to the hard work, sacrifice and gritty persistence of generations who hustled their nation out of war, dictatorship and poverty into an Asian powerhouse.

""I don't want to knock successful people off their pedestal just because they have a lot of money,"" said Kim Eui-kyun, a 61-year-old from Seoul who described himself as a lapsed Catholic. ""If someone has made a fortune for himself, fair and square, and has a lot of money, I don't think that's something to be condemned. I look up to them, actually, and I wonder, 'What did I do wrong?'""

Francis made the call during his first public Mass in Asia. He received a boisterous welcome from tens of thousands of young Asians gathered for a Catholic festival in the central city of Daejeon. During his homily, Francis urged the faithful to reject ""inhuman"" economic policies that disenfranchise the poor and ""the spirit of unbridled competition which generates selfishness and strife.""
It's a theme he has raised frequently during his pontificate, railing against the ""idolatry of money"" and the excesses of capitalism that leave the poorest even further on the margins of society. While his message has been met with skepticism among some conservatives in the U.S. who have branded him a Marxist, it has been welcomed in much of the developing world and even some South Koreans said Friday he had a point.

Iraqi prime minister was stern, unflinching, but many were put off by his heavy-handed style

When a rocket struck in Baghdad's Green Zone in 2007 during a news conference by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the world's top diplomat ducked and looked unsettled. Al-Maliki, however, never flinched, and dismissed the attack as ""nothing.""

A year later, al-Maliki again stayed calm when an Iraqi journalist angrily threw his shoes at President George W. Bush at another news conference. As Bush deftly ducked out of the way, al-Maliki stood by his guest and even raised a hand to try to block one of the shoes.

As he leaves office, al-Maliki will be remembered for dominating Iraqi politics with a steely demeanor for much of the tumultuous decade that followed the 2003 ouster of Saddam Hussein.

The 64-year-old al-Maliki led the country through the height of Shiite-Sunni bloodshed. But his heavy-handed rule also helped plunge it back into chaos.

He was unafraid to move against perceived foes — whether they were militants or political rivals — and he projected an image of unflinching determination as the most influential prime minister since the U.S. invasion.

Iraqis welcome al-Maliki's decision to step down, but immense challenges loom for successor

BAGHDAD (AP) — Nouri al-Maliki's decision to step down as Iraq's prime minister raised hopes Friday for a new government that can roll back an increasingly powerful Sunni insurgency and prevent the country from splitting apart.

But to do that his successor has to unify Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish factions that deeply distrust each other and have conflicting demands, all while dealing with a humanitarian crisis and the extremists' continuing rampage in the north.

The man tapped to become the next prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, a veteran Shiite lawmaker, faces the immense challenge of trying to unite Iraqi politicians as he cobbles together a Cabinet in just over three weeks.

Al-Abadi said Friday his government will be based on ""efficiency and integrity, to salvage the country from security, political and economic problems"" — but that is easier said than done in a country where forming a government often falls victim to roadblocks and infighting.

Sunni politicians are pressing for greater political influence, saying their disenfranchisement under al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government fueled support among the Sunni minority for the insurgency, led by the extremist Islamic State group. At the same time, the military needs significant bolstering after falling apart in the face of the militants' advance and proving incapable of taking back lost territory.

Mourners pack medieval cathedral in Tuscan town to remember AP video journalist killed in Gaza

PITIGLIANO, Italy (AP) — Several hundred mourners packed the ornate cathedral of this hilltop Tuscan town on Friday to remember Associated Press video journalist Simone Camilli as a committed storyteller who had found personal and professional contentment in the Middle East.

An image of Camilli, leaning pensively over the balcony of the AP office in Gaza with smoke billowing behind him, stood near the simple unfinished wooden casket that accompanied his body back to Italy, and which his family chose to retain in deference to his preference for simplicity.

""You might think he was a thrill-seeker. Simone wasn't one of those,"" said friend and AP colleague Chris Slaney. ""His best work was filmed far from the front lines. He was proud of items which were simple, human stories well-told.""

Camilli was killed Wednesday in the Gaza Strip when leftover ordnance believed to have been dropped in an Israeli airstrike blew up. Also killed was freelance Palestinian translator Ali Shehda Abu Afash, who was buried Wednesday. Four police engineers also died in the explosion and AP photographer Hatem Moussa was among three people badly wounded.

Video images made by Camilli were projected in the cathedral complex in Pitigliano, and mourners streaming to the funeral Mass were visibly moved as they paused to watch.

UN: Ebola may leave 1 million in need of food help as fear, price-hiking slow supplies

CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) — The deadly Ebola virus that has killed more than 1,000 in West Africa is disrupting the flow of goods, forcing the United Nations to plan food convoys for up to a million people as hunger threatens the largely impoverished area.

Amid roadblocks manned by troops and pervasive fear among the population of the dreaded disease, the worst-ever outbreak of Ebola is increasingly impacting the food supply in three countries.

The impacts are evident in Guinea's capital of Conakry, where fruit and vegetables no longer arrive from the country's breadbasket. In Sierra Leone and Liberia, several markets have been shut down. The price of rice and other staples is soaring in areas under Ebola quarantine.

Hunters of bushmeat, which can carry the Ebola virus, have lost their livelihoods, and farmers in some areas have been cut off from their fields. Price-gouging hurts people who struggle to feed themselves in the best of times, observers say.

While none of the regulations restricts the movement of basic necessities, fear and inconvenience are disrupting supplies. Some 1 million people in isolated areas might need food assistance in the coming months, according to the U.N. World Food Program, which is preparing a regional emergency operation to bring food by convoy to the needy. The three-month operation can be extended.

Europe pledges aid, arms to Iraq as Maliki resignation paves way for political renewal

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Friday forged a unified response to the rapid advance of Islamic militants in Iraq and the resulting refugee crisis, allowing direct arms deliveries to Kurdish fighters battling the Sunni insurgents. Several EU nations pledged more humanitarian aid.

The emergency meeting of the bloc's 28 foreign ministers in Brussels marked a shift toward greater involvement in Iraq, following weeks during which the Europeans mainly considered the situation an American problem because of the 2003 U.S.-led Iraq invasion.

EU ministers pledged to step up efforts to help those fleeing advancing Islamic State militants, with several nations announcing they will fly dozens of tons of aid to northern Iraq over the coming days.

""First of all, we need to make sure that we alleviate humanitarian suffering,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans told reporters. ""Secondly, I believe we need to make sure that (Islamic State) is not in a position to overrun the Kurds or to take a stronger hold on Iraq.""

France has pledged to ship weapons to the Kurds and Britain is delivering ammunition and military supplies obtained from eastern European nations and is considering sending more weaponry. Germany, the Netherlands and others said they would also consider requests to arm the Kurds.",NA,NA,NA,NA

DailyMail,daily68,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2726139/Critics-Police-equipped-like-armies-going-far.html,Critics: Police equipped like armies going too far,Associated Press,8/15/2014,12/21/2015,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Missouri police department at the center of an uproar over the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager acquired two armored Humvees and other military gear for free through a Pentagon program that critics blame for ""militarizing America's Main Streets"" and aggravating clashes between police and protesters.

The Ferguson Police Department received the two Humvees as well as a generator and a flatbed trailer under the surplus equipment program run by the Defense Logistics Agency, which is in charge of getting supplies of all types for the military.

News footage and photos of police outfitted in paramilitary gear clashing with protesters in Ferguson — a largely black suburb of St. Louis with a mostly white police force — have provided new impetus to efforts to rein in the Pentagon program. It provides assault weapons and other surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies across the country.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his committee will review the program to determine if the Defense Department surplus is being used as intended.

The program began in 1990 as a way to help states and local agencies fight drug-related crime. It was expanded in the mid-1990s.

""Congress established this program out of real concern that local law enforcement agencies were literally outgunned by drug criminals,"" Levin said in a statement Friday. ""We intended this equipment to keep police officers and their communities safe from heavily armed drug gangs and terrorist incidents.""

Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., plans to introduce legislation when Congress returns in September to curb what he describes as an increasing militarization of police across the country. Police responding to protesters angry about the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown wore riot gear and deployed tear gas, dogs and armored vehicles, sometimes pointing assault rifles at protesters.

""Our Main Streets should be a place for business, families and relaxation, not tanks and M16s,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""Militarizing America's Main Streets won't make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent.""

A spokeswoman for the logistics agency said its Law Enforcement Support Office distributed nearly $450 million worth of equipment last year ranging from blankets and computers to armored vehicles, boats and assault weapons. About 8,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide participate in the program, known as 1033 for its section in the National Defense Authorization Act, said spokeswoman Michelle McCaskill.

Weapons account for just 5 percent of the equipment distributed, McCaskill said.

St. Louis County, which includes Ferguson, has received a dozen 5.56mm rifles, half a dozen .45-caliber pistols, night-vision goggles and a bomb-disposing robot in recent years, the defense agency said.

The 1033 program is just one of several federal programs that provide military-style equipment to local police. The Homeland Security Department offers grants for armored vehicles and other equipment, while the Justice Department provides grants for rubber bullets, tear gas and other equipment used to control crowds.

Homeland Security grant money paid for the $360,000 Bearcat armored truck on patrol in Ferguson, said Nick Gragnani, executive director of St. Louis Area Regional Response System, which administers such grants for the St. Louis area.

Since 2003, the group has spent $9.4 million on equipment for police in St. Louis County. Most of the body armor worn by officers responding to the Ferguson protests was paid for with federal money, Gragnani said.

""We are given 15 different scenarios we are supposed to be prepared for, and one of those is terrorist attacks or civil unrest,"" Gragnani said Friday. ""Those are the response capabilities we are building up for in the St. Louis area.""

Kara Dansky, senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the police response in Ferguson is just the latest example of what she called the excessive militarization of policing. Heavily armed Special Weapons and Tactics groups, or SWAT teams, are forcing their way into people's homes across the country, often with little justification, she said.

""Neighborhoods are not war zones, and our police officers should not be treating us like wartime enemies,"" said Dansky, the lead author of a June report on the issue.

Militarization encourages officers to adopt a ""warrior"" mentality and think of the people they are supposed to serve as enemies, Dansky said. The ACLU report outlined a number of examples of equipment transfers that it said were cause for concern. For example, police in North Little Rock, Arkansas, obtained at least 34 automatic and semi-automatic rifles, two robots capable of being armed and a tactical vehicle. Many of those weapons could not be accounted for later.

Attorney General Eric Holder said he was concerned that use of military equipment by police in Ferguson was sending a ""conflicting message.""

The response by law enforcement to protests ""must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them,"" Holder said. The Justice Department and FBI are investigating Brown's death.

Johnson said his bill would limit the kinds of military equipment that can be transferred to local police and require states to certify that they can account for all equipment received.

He said he is disturbed by reports that some weapons and other equipment distributed to police have gone missing. He also expressed concern that the militarization trend has moved beyond local police departments and sheriff's offices, saying Ohio State University recently acquired a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle, or MRAP.

""Apparently, college kids are getting too rowdy,"" Johnson said.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a possible GOP presidential contender in 2016, blamed the trend on the federal government.

""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies — where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement,"" Paul wrote in an opinion column in Time magazine.

""There should be a difference between a police response and a military response"" Paul said.",NA,NA,NA,NA
DailyMail,daily69,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2726349/Officers-begins-lift-weeklong-mystery.html,Ferguson cop left town days before he was  named Michael Brown's shooter as a woman comes forward to claim he told her to 'shut the f*** up' after stopping her in another incident,Snejana Farberov,8/15/2014,12/21/2015,"A woman in Ferguson, Missouri, spoke out Friday saying that a month before the Michael Brown shooting, she had a run-in with officer Darren Wilson in which the cop allegedly hurled obscenities at her and made threats to arrest her.

Wilson was identified earlier today by Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson as the officer who stopped Brown, 18, last Saturday for blocking traffic and ultimately shot him eight times.

During a live interview with CNN presenter Don Lemon, a young woman who did not give her name said that Officer Wilson once told her to 'shut the f*** up’ and ‘sit the f*** down' as she was trying to wash mace out of her eyes.

The woman said that she went inside the QuickTrip grocery store in Ferguson about a month ago to get help after being pepper-sprayed in the face under unknown circumstances.

Employees at the store let the woman use their sink to clean her eyes and suggested that she use milk.

As she was pouring the dairy product in her eyes, the woman said police officers walked into the convenience store and ordered her to get out.

‘I came outside and I was trying to pour milk in my eyes and Wilson told me if I poured milk in my eyes, I was going to be arrested,’ she said on CNN.

‘And I was trying to tell him that my eyes were burning because I was maced, but he told me to “shut the F up.”’

The officer then allegedly made the woman sit on concrete as he took down her information.

When she renewed her efforts to treat her eyes with milk, she said Wilson again told her to 'shut the f*** up and sit the f*** down.'

‘I was looking at his name tag and I was telling myself that I would never forget who he was and what he did to me,’ said the woman. ‘And I prayed on it and I asked God to get revenge on him.’

For nearly a week, the police officer who shot and killed the unarmed black teenager has been a shadowy figure — nameless, faceless and seemingly shielded from the fury that has filled the streets of the town he was sworn to protect.

On Friday, the community finally learned his name — Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white officer who has spent the last six years patrolling the St. Louis suburbs, drawing praise from his boss.

Ferguson Police Chief Jackson provided the name and said Wilson had not been the focus of any public complaints. He declined to offer many details about Wilson's life or career but commended his police record and his demeanor.

'He was a gentle, quiet man,' Jackson said. 'He was a distinguished officer. He is, has been, an excellent officer for the police department.'

Wilson has been on administrative leave since the August 9 shooting.

According to a report by {USA Today}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/”>, no one answered the door Friday at Wilson's home in Crestwood - a town 18 miles from Ferguson - and a police officer guarding the property said that the family had left the area days earlier.

A neighbor told the paper that Wilson, described as 'tall and slim,' was often seen walking his dog.

Public records obtained by {The Washington Post}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/at-darren-wilsons-house-neighbors-say-he-and-his-family-took-off/”> indicate that as a teenager, Wilson was an honor roll student at Charles High School. He lost his mother at age 16.

Neighbor Martha Arnoldy, the wife of the Crestwood police chief, told The Post that Wilson and his family are in a 'safe place.'

The officer reportedly packed up and left his house so quickly that laundry was left hanging in the backyard.

Wilson's friend Jake Shepard told {CNN}<hyperlink=”http://www.cnn.com/videos/”> he could not imagine the officer killing somebody.

'I can say without speaking to Darren, without even having heard his statements that, at that moment in time, he was scared for his life,' Shepard said.

'He's just the last person on Earth that you would think to do something like that. It's just shocking.'

The friend described the 28-year-old man as a quiet yet caring person with a 'huge heart' who would give the shirt off his back to anyone in need.

Police said Wilson stopped 18-year-old Michael Brown and another young man because they were walking down the middle of the street. He ordered them onto the sidewalk.

Authorities say one of the men pushed Wilson into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with him over the officer's weapon.

At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Wilson shot Brown multiple times, according to police.

Chief Jackson said early Friday that Officer Wilson did not know Brown was a robbery suspect when he stopped him for blocking traffic - but he later offered a different story.

The Ferguson police department has released CCTV stills of the convenience store robbery, which took place minutes before the shooting, showing a suspect whose clothing and stature matched Michael Brown.

Speaking later in the day, the police chief claimed that Officer Wilson 'made the connection' between the store hold-up and Brown when he saw a box of cigars in his hands that had been reported stolen.

Wilson is 'devastated' by last weekend's events, the police chief said. 'He never intended for any of this to happen.'

The killing touched off day after day of violent protests, which were met by an aggressive police response that included officers in riot gear pointing assault rifles, firing rubber bullets and unleashing tear gas.

On Thursday, the governor ordered Missouri State Police to take over security in Ferguson. Within hours, the tension in the streets began to ease.

But during a protest Friday night, chaos once again reigned on the streets of Ferguson as angry demonstrators threw bottles and blocked traffic, prompting police to hurl smoke bombs and issue an order to disperse.

Wilson spent the first two years of his career with the police department in nearby Jennings, Missouri, before moving on to Ferguson for the past four years. Ferguson's police force is nearly all-white. The town's population is about 70 percent black.

Jackson had originally planned to release the name earlier in the week but delayed the announcement, citing safety concerns and death threats against the officer.

St. Louis County police and the FBI are conducting separate investigations.

The St. Louis County prosecutor said it will probably be weeks before a decision is made on whether to charge Wilson with a crime.

POLICE OFFICER WHO SHOT MICHAEL BROWN WON DEPARTMENT AWARD

The officer who shot Michael Brown won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February, it was revealed today.

Darren Wilson, 28, was nowhere to be seen at his white middle class home in the suburb of Crestwood where he moved just a year ago. It was claimed he'd left the single-story brick home 'days ago'. No one answered the door when MailOnline knocked on the door and there were two or three police cars parked outside.

A hip hop artist from Ferguson was home at noon last Saturday when he looked out the window and saw a police officer shoot a young man to death.

The rapper, who goes by the stage pseudonym Thee Pharoah, took to social media and proceeded to live-tweet the shooting and its tragic aftermath.

Michael Brown, 19, was unarmed when he was shot eight times in the middle of a street in Ferguson, a mainly black suburb of St Louis, at the hands of officer Darren Wilson.

The world has been left shocked by the shooting, which was followed by an instant crackdown on dissent around the streets of Ferguson as police anticipated significant protests.

They guessed right, and the town has been rocked by protests almost every day this week - often turning violent after dark as heavily armed police fired gas and baton rounds to clear the streets.

With police remaining tight-lipped about how their investigation is progressing, the emergence of Thee Pharaoh's witness account of the killing will likely do little to calm tensions.

Last night about 200 protesters clashed with officers in the St Louis suburb after another tense day that began with authorities identifying the officer who killed Brown.

But at the same time as revealing the killer's identity, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released documents alleging the 18-year-old had stolen a $50 box of cigars from the convenience store and strong-armed a man on his way out.

After Saturday's shooting, the investigation into Brown's death was immediately handed over to Missouri State Police, but yesterday it emerged that the FBI has also interviewed witnesses as part of a civil rights investigation.

In the days ahead, the agents planned to canvass the neighborhood for more information, a statement from the U.S. Justice Department statement said.

Meanwhile, Mr Brown's mother and father, supported by national civil rights leaders Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, have become the unwitting faces of a new campaign against police treatment of African-Americans.

Ferguson is a town of 21,000 people, two-thirds of whom are black. Of the local police department's 53 officers, just three are black.

Brown's death had previously ignited seveal nights of clashes with furious protesters, but tensions eased on Thursday after Missouri Governor Jay Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol.

Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by a new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But last night marked a resurgence of the unrest.

Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly.

According to a timeline of the shooting, the first bullets struck the 18-year-old just after 12pm Saturday.

About an hour later, rapper Thee Pharoah sent out his first tweet about the tragedy playing out outside his window: 'I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE OMFG,' he wrote in all caps.

In response to a question about the incident posed to him by a friend, Pharoah clarified that 'the police just shot someone dead' in front of his home.

The 27-year-old singer-songwriter then shared a disturbing photo taken from his backyard showing Brown's body lying in the middle of the street with a uniformed police officer standing over him.

There is no indication that the officer seen in the frame was the shooter.

The rapper confided in his followers that he was very upset by what happened, describing a harrowing scene with 'blood all over the street' and crime scene tape surrounding his apartment building.

When asked by a user why the officer shot the man, later identified as Michael Brown, Thee Pharoah replied that there was 'no reason,' and that the youth described by him as an 18- or 19-year-old was just 'running.'

‘Dude was running and the cops just shot.him. i saw him die,' the singer wrote.

During a press conference Friday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that Officer Wilson stopped Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson at 12.01pm because they were walking down the middle of the road and blocking traffic.

About two hours after the deadly confrontation, Thee Pharoah tweeted in response to a query from a follower that he heard seven shots and saw Brown getting hit by two of the rounds from behind.

He added that the remaining five bullets came as a 'barrage' after Michael Brown turned around to face the officer.

Thee Pharoah then uploaded another picture of the crime scene, now with a red screen concealing Brown's body from view, and an officer walking with a rifle in his hand. It is believed that the pictured Ferguson cop was not involved in the incident.

At around 3.30pm, some three hours after the shooting, Pharoah tweeted that Brown was still lying dead on the ground.

On Sunday, Thee Pharoah declared that he will no longer be tweeting about the shooting. Since then, his friends have advised him to hire a lawyer and 'lay low.'

Over the past week, Thee Pharoah has been regularly writing about protests raging in Ferguson and around the country, and re-tweeting news items about the case.

On Thursday, he appealed on Twitter to reporters to stop asking him questions about what he witnessed.

'I will tell you I know nothing,' he concluded.

Thee Pharoah's posts about Brown’s killing were first discovered by reporter Tim Dickinson and later picked up by the site {Mashable}<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/15/live-tweet-michael-brown-killing-ferguson/#PVPA7_LNDiqt”>.

As night descended on Ferguson Friday, hundreds of people came up to take part in a march led by Rev Jesse Jackson to the site of Brown's killing.

Jackson bent over in front of a memorial cross and candle and sighed deeply. He urged people to ‘turn pain into power’ and to ‘fight back, but not self-destruct’ through violence.'

Many of the participants came out carrying signs and bullhorns to demand justice. Young men and women posed with their hands in the air, holding posters that read: 'Don't shoot.'

However, as night fell on the city the clashes grew more ominous. Several reports cited tear gas and smoke bombs being fired by officers as groups of youths refused to clear the streets.

Some reports were also made of looters raiding local shops around 3am ET.

Meanwhile, the Brown family spoke out today accusing police of 'inciting violence all over again' by releasing images of a convenience store robbery which they acknowledged 'appeared to be' Michael Brown.

After releasing the tape on Friday, police admitted that Officer Darren Wilson didn't know Michael Brown was a suspect in a robbery when he stopped the teen and subsequently shot him dead in Ferguson last Saturday.

But speaking to CNN and NBC later in the day Friday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson offered a different version of events, saying that officer Darren Wilson became suspicious of Brown after spotting a box of cigars in his hands that had been reported stolen.

Ferguson’s top cop explained that initially Wilson stopped Brown for walking in the middle of the street, but as he drove away, the officer 'made the connection' between the teen and the grocery store robbery, reported {USA Today}>hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/”>.

Attorney Anthony Gray, a lawyer for the family, said that the release of the CCTV tape was a 'strategic side show' aimed at 'denigrating their son'.

Mr Gray said that the teenager's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr, 'never described him as the perfect kid' and fully admitted that they had done their best to keep Michael on the right path for his future.

The lawyer added: 'No one out there is proud of everything they have done when they were a teenager.'

Daryl Parks, another attorney for the Brown family, also told gathered media that it 'appears to be Michael' in the store CCTV.

Mr Gray described the release of the video - which the police chief said at a follow-up news conference on Friday was simply done because of 'media requests' - was a great distraction from the main issue.

'That Michael had bullets pumped into his body while his hands were in the air,' he added.

Michael Brown, who was unarmed, was shot up to eight times in the middle of the street in Ferguson, a St Louis suburb, around midday on Saturday.

POLICE OFFICER WHO SHOT MICHAEL BROWN WON DEPARTMENT AWARD

The officer who shot Michael Brown won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February, it was revealed today.

Darren Wilson, 28, was nowhere to be seen at his white middle class home in the suburb of Crestwood where he moved just a year ago. It was claimed he'd left the single-story brick home 'days ago'. No one answered the door when MailOnline knocked on the door and there were two or three police cars parked outside.

Neighbors told {USA Today}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/”> that he was 'tall and slim' and was often seen walking his dog.

Another neighbor, Ron Gorski, told USA Today: 'He's a young guy,' Gorski said of Wilson. 'Things happen and it's a complicated situation. I feel for the family and the entire country.'

Wilson, who is on paid administrative leave, won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February, according to {NBC}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/Tom_Winter/status/500290160836100096”>'s Tom Winter.

He has spent four years in Ferguson and two previous years in the Jennings district, said Winter.

Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said the shooting had been 'devastating, absolutely devastating' to Wilson, adding: 'We had no complaints about the officer. He was a gentleman. A quiet officer. He has been an effective officer.'

According to public records, his mother died in 2002. Wilson has a sister and a half-brother.

Mr Gray added: 'The family feels at this time where there is calm is in the community, he [Jackson] is inciting the community all over again.

'We were finally getting to a point where we were galvanizing questions and now we are focusing on the sideshow. Do not take the bait.'

On Friday morning, police had revealed the name of the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson.

Simultaneously, they handed out video stills and a police report referring to a 'strong-armed' robbery at a convenience store close to the shooting where Brown was the 'primary suspect'.

At a secondary police conference on Friday, Chief Jackson said Officer Wilson was only in the area when the robbery took place because he was responding to a separate 911 call.

Wilson only stopped Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson on Saturday around noon because they were walking down the middle of the road and blocking traffic, the chief said.

When asked about the police's timing of releasing the robbery video along with the name of Officer Wilson today, the police chief said he did so because 'you asked for it' - referring to Freedom of Information requests from the media regarding the shooting. He added that he had 'sat on the video for as long as he could'.

Eric Davis spoke to the media, on behalf of his cousin, Michael's mother, Lesley McSpadden. Mr Davis said the release of the store robbery video tape was 'smoke and mirrors'.

He added: 'Whatever took place in the grocery store does not reflect what happened on Canfield [the street where Brown was shot dead].'

He asked for support from the community but once again reiterated the family's wish that there be no violence.

Brown's grieving family reacted with fury after police announced the dead teen was the 'primary suspect' in a convenience store robbery.

Along with naming Officer Wilson, which came after mounting public pressure to identify the shooter, the Ferguson police chief took the opportunity to disperse video stills and an incident report from a 'strong-armed' robbery that took place moments before the shooting on Saturday.

The teenager's family expressed their outrage at the police's decision to 'assassinate' their son's character and divert attention from the cop killing.

The statement read: 'Michael Brown’s family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piecemeal information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.

'There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.

'The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.

'It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.

'The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.'

Michael's aunt Sheryl Davis told MailOnline: 'It's appalling. I think that the police will try anything to smear Michael.

'Nothing surprises me with the way that this police force have treated this whole thing.'

She added that the family would be asking for the full surveillance footage to see if it was indeed the teenager in the clip.

The family had described their son, who had no prior criminal record, as a 'gentle giant' who was looking forward to starting college this week before his death.

Police also used today's news conference to name Darren Wilson as the white police officer who fatally shot Brown.

In a shocking twist to the killing which sparked riots in St Louis, Missouri over the last few days, the officer investigating the convenience store robbery also attended the scene of the shooting and said the suspect and Brown were the same person.

According to the police report, video shows Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson having an altercation with store staff and allegedly stealing a box of Swisher Sweets cigars on Saturday, shortly before midday.

In the grainy images, a large black man wearing a light-colored shirt, distinctive shoes, a red baseball hat and khaki shorts is seen stealing cigars the cigars and then assaulting a clerk who intervenes.

A photograph of Michael Brown’s lifeless body, taken minutes later in the street, shows that he was wearing a light grey shirt, the same shoes and khaki cargo shorts. There was also a red baseball cap by the body.

The report, released by police on Friday, said the victim ‘had just come out of the restroom when Brown said he wanted several boxes of cigars.

As the attendant was ‘placing the boxes on the counter, Brown grabbed a box of Swisher Sweet cigars and handed them to Johnson who was standing behind Brown’.

Brown was told by the unidentified person that he had to pay for cigars, which cost $48.99.

The report then reads: ‘That is when Brown reached across the counter and grabbed numerous packs of Swisher Sweets and turned to leave the store.’

The attendant then called 911 as someone else came out from ‘behind the counter and attempts to stop Brown from leaving’.

A MATTER OF MINUTES: TIMELINE OF THE MICHAEL BROWN SHOOTING

11.48am - Officer Darren Wilson and an ambulance crew were at an unrelated call about a sick person

11.51am - A 911 call comes in about a 'strong- armed' robbery at a nearby convenience store

11.52am - Police radio dispatch gives a description of two robbery suspects who assaulted a clerk and stole Swisher Sweet cigars. The clerk says the suspects were walking toward the QuickTrip gas station

12.01pm – Officer Wilson encounters Michael Brown walking in the middle of the street in the 2900 block of Canfield Drive. The officer shoots Brown dead following an altercation

12.04pm – A second officer arrives on scene and the ambulance from the sick call arrives to give Brown medical attention. He is declared dead at the scene

12.05pm – A supervisor arrives at the scene of the shooting

Someone tried to stop Brown from leaving and locked the door until ‘Brown returned the merchandise to him’.

‘That is when Brown grabbed X by the shirt and forcefully pushed him back into the display rack.

'X backed away and Brown and Johnson exited the store with the cigars’, said the report.

The robbery report described Brown as 6ft 4inches and weighing 292lbs.

The police report also gave a detailed description of the suspect's clothing. It said the store robbery suspect was wearing tan khaki long shorts, a white T-shirt, yellow socks and flip-flop style shoes.

The officer writing the robbery report said he attended the scene of Brown’s shooting and that after reviewing the surveillance footage: ‘I was able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect in this incident.

'A second person, also at that scene, identified himself as being with Brown. That person was later identified as Dorian Johnson.

'After observing Johnson and reviewing the video, I confirmed he is the second suspect in this incident.’

Dorian Johnson’s account of the shooting will now come under intense scrutiny with the revelation that he was identified as a robbery suspect too.

The 22-year-old, who was with Michael when he was shot dead, has said in numerous interviews that the incident began when the officer drove past and told them to 'get the f*** on the sidewalk' as they were on the road.

He mentioned nothing about the alleged convenience store robbery.

The information that was handed out by Ferguson police on Friday only held details about the alleged robbery and included no report from Officer Wilson about the shooting.

Despite the link to the robbery, there will still be an investigation into whether unnecessary force was used by Wilson in the killing of the 18-year-old, who was unarmed.

Officer Darren Wilson is a six-year veteran of the Ferguson Police Department and has no history of disciplinary action.

The cop, from the St Louis area, was treated for injuries after the shooting, according to police.

Chief Jackson said that the officer is 'torn up' over the shooting of Michael Brown.

Today, staff at the convenience store which Brown allegedly robbed have boarded it up because they fear rioters will kill them.

Two police cars were parked outside on Friday to watch the property, which is a short distance away from where Michael was shot dead.

Employees at the store appeared nervous and tense as they were asked about the incident. One staff member, a man in his 40s, told MailOnline: 'He didn't deserve to die. I feel bad about what happened.'

Another man in his 30s said: 'People are going to come and kill us. We are worried. Are you going to protect us?'

The men also revealed that the clerk who was working that day is doing okay but scared as well.

In a brief press conference shortly before 9am (CT) on Friday, Chief Jackson gave a timeline of the minutes leading up to Officer Wilson’s shooting of Brown on August 9.

At 11.48am, Officer Wilson was attending an unrelated ‘sick call’ with an ambulance present.

At 11.51am, a 911 call came in reporting a 'strong-armed' robbery at a convenience store, which included a description of two suspects.

At 11.52am, dispatch gave a description of a robbery suspect over the radio.

A further description, with more details, was given over the radio and stated the suspect was walking towards another convenience store, QuickTrip.

'CHARACTER ASSASSINATION': MICHAEL BROWN'S FAMILY AND PROTESTERS REACT

Reaction to Ferguson police's announcement today that Michael Brown was primary suspect in a store robbery, has drawn outrage from his grieving family.

Brown's family slammed the devious police for 'assassinating Michael's character'.

They told AP that the police were playing 'the old game of smoke and mirrors'.

His aunt Sheryl Davis told MailOnline: 'It's appalling. I think that the police will try anything to smear Michael.'

Social media reacted to the information with a mixed response.

The Reverend Al Sharpton tweeted on Friday: '@smokey: ""You can't jump over a murder & talk to me about some cigars…"" @thereval @newsone #Ferguson'''

The feelings of many were summed up by one user Jay @_TribeCalledJ, who tweeted:'Mike Brown being a robbery suspect doesn't justify the 7 or 8 shots that were fired into his body.

Lisa Bloom, an NBC legal analyst and practising attorney, tweeted: 'How today's robbery report changes the #Ferguson cop's defense: watch for him to argue he had right to shoot #MikeBrown as ""fleeing felon.

Journalist Piers Morgan tweeted: 'Alleged theft of cigars is not a reason to shoot dead an unarmed teenager. #MichaelBrown #Ferguson'

At 12.01pm, Officer Wilson made contact with Michael Brown who was walking with a friend on Canfield Drive.

A second officer arrived on scene immediately after the shooting.

At 12.05pm, a supervisor dispatched to the scene and was joined by other officers.

Chief Jackson said the ambulance that had been on the sick call responded to the shooting and provided medical assistance to Mr Brown - who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police have said 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead after Officer Wilson encountered him and another man on the street.

Police claim one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon.

At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

Witnesses have said the officer fired on Brown as he tried to run away.

Ferguson police were heckled on Thursday night while patrolling an angry crowd protesting the death of black teenager Michael Brown.

Demonstrators had chanted: 'What's his name? What's his name?' at Officer Jon Belmar.

Ferguson police had refused to name the officer who shot dead the teenage student, citing death threats against officers on social media.

There had been growing anger in the Ferguson community as to why the officer's name has not been released, almost a week after the fatal shooting.

Hacktivist collective Anonymous had released the alleged name of the officer - but authorities said that the person named was actually a dispatcher and was not involved in the Ferguson shooting or any other.",450,NA,NA,NA

Earlier reports on Twitter claimed that Ferguson police fired tear gas on demonstrators, but a reporter on the scene later posted an update saying it was likely a smoke bomb.

At around 1.45am, the situation escalated as participants of the demonstration reportedly blocked traffic on West Florissant Avenue with cars, drawing a robust police response.

Michael Calhoun, with KMOX, live-tweeted that officers showed up on the scene in bulletproof vests and with guns drawn, and ordered the angry protesters to disperse immediately.

Amid screams and pops of firecrackers, the crowd eventually scattered, but according to reports from the scene, some of the demonstrators proceeded to break into and loot nearby stores, including a beauty supply business and Ferguson Market and Liquor - the site of the Michael Brown robbery.

The sixth day of protests started peacefully enough with a march led by Rev. Jesse Jackson to the site of the police shooting.

On Friday night, the civil rights activist linked arms with protesters as they made their way to the site where Brown was killed.

Jackson bent over in front of a memorial cross and candle and sighed deeply. He urged people to ‘turn pain into power’ and to ‘fight back, but not self-destruct’ through violence.

The scene was eclectic Friday night as hundreds gathered for a sixth straight evening. A man on a bullhorn called for a revolution.

A young man waved a Bible while citing scripture. Some took selfies in front of a convenience store that had been burned by looters Sunday. Boys tossed a football, and horns and loud music blared.

To Vida Weekly, 51, it was still a somber occasion. She walked through the crowd holding high a sign that read: ‘The police killed Michael Brown and now they are trying to kill his character.’

U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, a Democrat from St. Louis, took a bullhorn and spoke to people gathered at the QuickTrip.

'They have attempted to taint the entire investigation,' Clay said to a cheering crowd. 'They are trying to influence a jury pool by the stunt they pulled today.

Also Friday, the Justice Department confirmed in a statement that FBI agents had conducted several interviews with witnesses as part of a civil-rights investigation into Brown's death.

In the days ahead, the agents planned to canvass the neighborhood where the shooting happened, seeking more information, the statement said.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol.

They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street.

DailyMail,daily73,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2725923/Police-protesters-clash-Ferguson.html,"Police, protesters clash again in Ferguson",Associated Press,8/16/2014,12/22/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Police and about 200 protesters clashed again in Ferguson, Missouri late Friday after another tense day in the St. Louis suburb that included authorities identifying the officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager and releasing documents alleging the young man had been suspected of stealing a $48.99 box of cigars from a convenience store in a ""strong-arm"" robbery shortly before he was killed.

Several hundred people congregated on a busy Ferguson street Friday night as protests continued nearly a week after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer. It was peaceful until about midnight, when a large crowd broke into the convenience mart that Brown allegedly robbed the day he was killed.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson said some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police. Police used tear gas to disburse the crowd but no arrests were made. One officer was hurt, but information on his injuries was not immediately available. No protesters were hurt.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson earlier Friday said the officer who shot Brown did not know the teen was a robbery suspect at the time of the shooting and stopped Brown and a companion ""because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.""

Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white officer, has patrolled suburban St. Louis for six years and had no previous complaints filed against him, Jackson said.

Brown's relatives said no robbery would justify shooting the teen after he put his hands up. Family attorneys said Brown's parents were blindsided by the allegations and the release of a surveillance video from the store.

""It appears to be him,"" attorney Daryl Parks said, referring to the footage, which he said was released without any advance notice from police.

The police chief described Wilson as ""a gentle, quiet man"" who had been ""an excellent officer."" He has been on the Ferguson force for four years and served prior to that in the neighboring community of Jennings.

Wilson, who was placed on administrative leave after the Aug. 9 shooting, ""never intended for any of this to happen,"" Jackson said.

According to police reports released Friday, authorities received a 911 call at 11:51 a.m. on the day of the shooting reporting a robbery at the Ferguson Market. An unidentified officer was dispatched to the store, arriving within three minutes. The officer interviewed an employee and customer, who gave a description of a man who stole the cigars and walked off with another man toward a QuikTrip store.

Descriptions of the suspect were broadcast over the police radio. The officer did not find the suspects either on the street or at the QuikTrip, the reports said.

The robber took a box of Swisher Sweets, a brand of small, inexpensive cigars. The suspects were identified as 18-year-old Michael Brown and 22-year-old Dorian Johnson, according to the reports.

Separately, Wilson had been responding to a nearby call involving a sick 2-month child from 11:48 am until noon, when he left that place. A minute later, he encountered Brown walking down Canfield Drive. The documents contained no description of what happened between Brown and Wilson.

Johnson has told reporters that the officer ordered the pair to move onto the sidewalk, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He said Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, noted that police did not release a photo of the officer but released images from the security video that they say show Brown grabbing a man inside the store. Crump said he had not seen the photos.

Police ""are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style"" killing, said Crump, who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.

The Aug. 9 video appears to show a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store's door. A police report alleges that Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and ""forcefully pushed him back"" into a display rack.

Police said they found evidence of the stolen merchandise on Brown's body. Authorities determined that Johnson was not involved in the robbery and will not seek charges against him, Jackson said.

Brown's uncle, Bernard Ewing, said the shooting was unnecessary, even if his nephew was a robbery suspect.

A robbery ""still doesn't justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,"" he added. ""You still don't shoot him in the face.""

Brown's death ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. The tension eased Thursday after the governor turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators.

On Friday night, the Rev. Jesse Jackson linked arms with protesters as they marched to the site where Brown was killed. Jackson bent over in front of a memorial cross and candle and sighed deeply. He urged people to ""turn pain into power"" and to ""fight back, but not self-destruct"" through violence.

The scene was eclectic Friday night as hundreds gathered for a sixth straight evening. A man on a bullhorn called for a revolution. A young man waved a Bible while citing scripture. Some took selfies in front of a convenience store that had been burned by looters Sunday. Boys tossed a football, and horns and loud music blared. At a nearby shopping center, about 100 police cars were on hand.

To Vida Weekly, 51, it was still a somber occasion. She walked through the crowd holding high a sign that read: ""The police killed Michael Brown and now they are trying to kill his character.""

U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, a Democrat from St. Louis, took a bullhorn and spoke to people gathered at the QuickTrip.

""They have attempted to taint the entire investigation,"" Clay said to a cheering crowd. ""They are trying to influence a jury pool by the stunt they pulled today.

Also Friday, the Justice Department confirmed in a statement that FBI agents had conducted several interviews with witnesses as part of a civil-rights investigation into Brown's death. In the days ahead, the agents planned to canvass the neighborhood where the shooting happened, seeking more information, the statement said.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street.",NA,NA,NA,NA
DailyMail,daily74,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2726504/Ferguson-police-chief-cedes-authority.html,Ferguson police chief cedes much of his authority,Associated Press,8/16/2014,12/22/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — In less than a week, the nation's most embattled police chief has ceded much of his authority — first to county police and then to state troopers.

Thomas Jackson, the snowy haired leader of the Ferguson Police Department, has been the public face of the agency at the center of the violent protests over a white police officer's killing of an unarmed black teenager.

Jackson's leadership has drawn wide criticism, both for the aggressive police response to the protesters and for his agency's erratic and infrequent releases of key information.

""It's clear the Ferguson chief is overwhelmed by the magnitude of this incident,"" said Daniel Isom II, a retired St. Louis police chief who now teaches at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""He has been releasing information as he sees appropriate, but maybe not taking into consideration the impact of releasing that information.""

On Friday, Jackson identified the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown and simultaneously released store security video that police say shows the young man stealing a box of cigars and shoving a clerk only a short time before his death.

Protesters and members of Brown's family accused authorities of trying to deflect attention from the officer while smearing the dead teen's name.

""They want to take the heat off"" Wilson, said Randolf Scott, 55, of Ferguson. ""They're trying to do everything and anything they can to make this sound justified.""

Jackson spent more than 30 years with the St. Louis County Police Department before taking over the 53-officer force in Ferguson, a mostly black city of 21,000, four years ago.

While working for St. Louis County, he led a drug task force and was also a SWAT team supervisor, airplane and helicopter instructor pilot, undercover detective and hostage negotiator.

He lives in nearby Hazelwood, one of a cluster of small cities just north of St. Louis known collectively as North County.

Since the Aug. 9 shooting, the Ferguson chief has continually spoken of a desire to work with community members. He's described efforts to bolster minority hiring in a department with just three black officers. But he's also struggled to manage a local crisis that has turned into an international news story, with 24-hour media coverage and a community filled with both grief and rage.

After the shooting, Jackson asked county police to take the lead in both the investigation of the shooting and in crowd control at the protests.

On Thursday, the governor put the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of Ferguson security after local and county police used riot gear, tear gas and heavy artillery — which only seemed to inflame crowds of angry protesters.

Highway patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson said that he was not told ahead of time that Jackson would release the Ferguson officer's name or the information about Brown as a robbery suspect.

""I would have like to have been consulted,"" Johnson said Friday. ""I really can't tell you about the timing. I saw it on the news like everybody else.""

Jackson had planned to release the name of the officer who shot Brown on Tuesday but said he reversed course in response to a stream of death threats against officers, including Wilson.

Both he and St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch had warned earlier in the week that it could be several weeks before the officer's name was made public, pending possible review of the case by a grand jury to assess criminal charges.

It was unclear what has since changed since then. Jackson took no questions about the information he had just released at a morning news conference, and then struggled to explain his decision-making at a later news conference. He never directly addressed why the timing had changed.

The apparent disconnect between local and county police and state troopers is both inefficient and unnecessary, Isom said.

""There are several agencies involved in this endeavor,"" he said. ""It seems that everyone is on their own page. And that's not good for us moving forward.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

They came as Missouri Governor Jay Nixon announced that he has signed an order declaring a state of emergency 'to keep the people safe' and implemented a midnight to 5am curfew in Ferguson on Saturday.

{Yahoo News}<hyperlink=”http://news.yahoo.com/photos-ferguson-officer-darren-wilson-received-police-award-earlier-this-year-021255893.html”> published the photograph of Darren Wilson on their homepage in a report detailing Brown's February commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty'.

The first photograph of the officer emerged on the same day a new photo of the scene immediately after Brown's shooting emerged.

With onlookers gathered behind police tape, officers are shown in the picture peering over Brown;s body.

Wilson is now on paid administrative leave following the shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting.

The 28-year-old officer won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' on February of this year.

'He never intended for any of this to happen,' Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson said. 'It’s devastating, absolutely devastating.'

He said Wilson encountered Brown and another man on the street during a routine patrol.

A confrontation ensued and Wilson fatally shot Brown, who was unarmed.

The governor of Missouri gave a press conference Saturday speaking about the situation in Ferguson.

He praised the people who have exercised their First Amendment right to protest peacefully and those who 'stood up against violent instigators.'

Calling Friday night's looting 'unacceptable,' Nixon said the town must not allow 'the ill-will of a few to undermine the goodwill of the many.'

Nixon also said the U.S. Department of Justice is beefing up its investigation of the shooting.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said there were 40 FBI agents going door-to-door talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting.

Nixon and Johnson spoke at a church in Ferguson, where they were interrupted repeatedly by people demanding justice and objecting to the curfew.

Johnson assured those in attendance that police would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to observe the curfew.

'You saw people sitting in the street and they had the chance to get up,' he said. ""And that's how it's going to continue.'

Wilson was finally named on Friday by police in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, in Missouri that has been torn apart by five nights of protests and rioting over the death of Michael Brown, 18.

Wilson accused by witnesses of shooting him even though he had his hands up.

Ferguson police only disclosed his name after coming under intense pressure and facing lawsuits by civil liberties groups.

Wilson currently lives in Crestwood, a suburb of St Louis which is 94 per cent white and 1.6 per cent black.

His house is a $180,000 bungalow with a pool and a basketball hoop in the drive on a sleepy street in a neighborhood that one resident described as 'solidly middle class'.

The property backs onto a church which reads: 'When our dream roads take strange turns'.

Wilson's mother Tonya died when he was just 16.

What effect that had on him at that age is unclear, but it appears that he bounced around the St Louis area at a number of addresses and met a girlfriend Ashley Brown.

Between 2000 and 2004 he attended St Charles West High School where former classmates remembered him as a good hockey player.

Jake Shepard wrote on Facebook: 'He is the nicest guy in the world!

'He has the biggest heart. He really does.

'Nobody is ever going to know what really happened, but I can say with certainty that the officers intentions were pure. He is one of those cops that make you appreciate law enforcement.'

At the age of 22, Wilson signed up to join the police.

At Wilson’s current home, neighbors are concerned that rioters would come and wreck the street if they found out where he lived.

A female school teacher told MailOnline: ‘Our neighborhood didn't do anything wrong. I'm worried people are going to come up here and start looting.

'They just moved in and seemed like nice people.

'Things are pretty quiet round here'.

Wilson, who has a license for hunting and for fishing, has a metal American flag in his front lawn and small couch sits on the porch suggesting that he likes to relax out the front of his house during the warm summer nights.

Nobody answered at the door when MailOnline visited.

A husband and wife in their 60s who had lived in the neighbourhood for many years said that it was full of respectable people.

The man said: 'Crime is not really an issue around here. The biggest thing we have to worry about is the occasional party from teenagers but we don't have any at the moment’

He spent four years with the Ferguson police department and two previous years in the Jennings district, NBC's Tom Winter reported.

Neighbors told USA Today that Wilson was 'tall and slim' and was often seen walking his dog.

Another neighbor, Ron Gorski, told USA Today: 'He's a young guy. 'Things happen and it's a complicated situation. I feel for the family and the entire country.'

Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said the shooting had been 'devastating, absolutely devastating' to Wilson, adding: 'We had no complaints about the officer. He was a gentleman. A quiet officer. He has been an effective officer.

According to public records Wilson got divorced last year and moved into his current home with Barb Spradling, who is also an officer with Ferguson police.

Anger spurred by Brown's death boiled over again Friday night when protesters stormed into a Missouri convenience store - the same store that Brown was accused of robbing - and several other local businesses.

Police and about 200 protesters clashed in Ferguson, Missouri, late Friday after another tense day in the St. Louis suburb, a day that included authorities identifying the officer who fatally shot Brown on August 9.

The police response to protesters has been criticized for using military tactics such as tear gas and rubber bullets, and early Saturday morning, St Louis County police were ordered to stand down around 1am by the Missouri Highway Patrol, who took over policing of the protests with Ron Johnson, who is black, at the helm.

City Alderman Antonio French who was on the scene trying to calm the crowd, tweeted that as police were driving away, they shot tear gas into the crowd, further inciting the protesters to anger.

The clashes divided protesters, with a small group apparently responsible for the looting and destruction, and a much larger crowd peacefully banding together to stop them.

Among the stores looted were a beauty supplies shop and a Domino's. The owners of the beauty store say they will not reopen.

Many witnesses at the scene described the protesters who were protecting the stores from the looters.

'Hundreds in the streets. Only a few dozen attempting to loot. Dozens more physically trying to prevent,' tweeted Wesley Lowery.

At the same news conference in which officer Darren Wilson was named, Chief Jackson released documents alleging that Brown stole a $48.99 box of cigars from a convenience store called Ferguson Market and Liquor, then strong-armed a man on his way out.

Just before midnight, some in what had been a large and rowdy but mostly well-behaved crowd broke into that same small store, and began looting it, according to Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson.

Some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Johnson said. One officer was hurt, but details on the injury were not immediately available. Johnson added that police backed off to try and ease the tension.

Brown's death had previously ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Gov.

Jay Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators.

But Friday night marked a resurgence of the unrest that had momentarily abated.

Michael Calhoun, with KMOX, live-tweeted that officers showed up on the scene in bulletproof vests and with guns drawn, and ordered the angry protesters to disperse immediately.

Amid screams and pops of firecrackers, the crowd eventually scattered, but according to reports from the scene, some of the demonstrators proceeded to break into and loot nearby stores, including a beauty supply business and Ferguson Market and Liquor - the site of the Michael Brown robbery.

The sixth day of protests started peacefully enough with a march led by Rev. Jesse Jackson to the site of the police shooting.

On Friday night, the civil rights activist linked arms with protesters as they made their way to the site where Brown was killed.

Jackson bent over in front of a memorial cross and candle and sighed deeply. He urged people to ‘turn pain into power’ and to ‘fight back, but not self-destruct’ through violence.

The scene was eclectic Friday night as hundreds gathered for a sixth straight evening. A man on a bullhorn called for a revolution.

A young man waved a Bible while citing scripture. Some took selfies in front of a convenience store that had been burned by looters Sunday. Boys tossed a football, and horns and loud music blared.

In the days ahead, the agents planned to canvass the neighborhood where the shooting happened, seeking more information, the statement said.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol.

The Brown family spoke out accusing police of 'inciting violence all over again' by releasing images of a convenience store robbery which they acknowledged 'appeared to be' Michael Brown.

After releasing the tape on Friday, police admitted that Officer Darren Wilson didn't know Michael Brown was a suspect in a robbery when he stopped the teen and subsequently shot him dead in Ferguson last Saturday.

But speaking to CNN and NBC later in the day Friday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson offered a different version of events, saying that officer Darren Wilson became suspicious of Brown after spotting a box of cigars in his hands that had been reported stolen.

Ferguson’s top cop explained that initially Wilson stopped Brown for walking in the middle of the street, but as he drove away, the officer 'made the connection' between the teen and the grocery store robbery, reported {USA Today}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/”>.

Attorney Anthony Gray, a lawyer for the family, said that the release of the tape was a 'strategic side show' aimed at 'denigrating their son'.

Mr Gray said that the teenager's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr, 'never described him as the perfect kid' and fully admitted that they had done their best to keep Michael on the right path for his future.

The lawyer added: 'No one out there is proud of everything they have done when they were a teenager.'

Michael Brown, who was unarmed, was shot up to eight times in the middle of the street in Ferguson, a St Louis suburb, around midday on Saturday.

POLICE OFFICER WHO SHOT MICHAEL BROWN WON DEPARTMENT AWARD

The officer who shot Michael Brown won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February, it was revealed today.

Darren Wilson, 28, was nowhere to be seen at his white middle class home in the suburb of Crestwood where he moved just a year ago. It was claimed he'd left the single-story brick home 'days ago'. No one answered the door when MailOnline knocked on the door and there were two or three police cars parked outside.

Neighbors told {USA Today}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/”> that he was 'tall and slim' and was often seen walking his dog.

Another neighbor, Ron Gorski, told USA Today: 'He's a young guy,' Gorski said of Wilson. 'Things happen and it's a complicated situation. I feel for the family and the entire country.'

Wilson, who is on paid administrative leave, won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February, according to {NBC}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/Tom_Winter/status/500290160836100096”>'s Tom Winter.

He has spent four years in Ferguson and two previous years in the Jennings district, said Winter.

Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said the shooting had been 'devastating, absolutely devastating' to Wilson, adding: 'We had no complaints about the officer. He was a gentleman. A quiet officer. He has been an effective officer.'

According to public records, his mother died in 2002. Wilson has a sister and a half-brother.

When asked about the police's timing of releasing the robbery video along with the name of Officer Wilson, the police chief said he did so because 'you asked for it' - referring to Freedom of Information requests from the media regarding the shooting. He added that he had 'sat on the video for as long as he could'.

Eric Davis spoke to the media, on behalf of his cousin, Michael's mother, Lesley McSpadden. Mr Davis said the release of the store robbery video tape was 'smoke and mirrors'.

He added: 'Whatever took place in the grocery store does not reflect what happened on Canfield [the street where Brown was shot dead].'

He asked for support from the community but once again reiterated the family's wish that there be no violence.

A family statement read: 'Michael Brown’s family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piecemeal information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.

'There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.

'The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.

'It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.

'The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.'

Michael's aunt Sheryl Davis told MailOnline: 'It's appalling. I think that the police will try anything to smear Michael.

'Nothing surprises me with the way that this police force have treated this whole thing.'

She added that the family would be asking for the full surveillance footage to see if it was indeed the teenager in the clip.

The family had described their son, who had no prior criminal record, as a 'gentle giant' who was looking forward to starting college this week before his death.",646,NA,NA,NA

Darren Wilson’s mother Tonya Durso won the trust of her neighbors then cheated them out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by stealing their identities and taking out vast loans and credit card debt.

At the time she committed the offenses she was on parole for similar crimes elsewhere the state and afterwards died at the age of 35 under mysterious circumstances.

Neighbors today revealed how they were stunned that Wilson became a police officer after his mother behaved so deviously towards them.

Wilson was finally named on Friday by police in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, in Missouri that has been torn apart by five nights of protests and rioting over the death of Michael Brown, 18.

Wilson accused by witnesses of shooting him even though he had his hands up.

Ferguson police only disclosed his name after coming under intense pressure and facing lawsuits by civil liberties groups.

Wilson is 28 and currently lives in Crestwood, a suburb of St Louis which is 94 per cent white and 1.6 per cent black.

His house is a $180,000 bungalow with a pool and a basketball hoop in the drive on a sleepy street in a neighborhood that one resident described as 'solidly middle class'.

But Wilson’s life has not always been so idyllic.

He grew up in St Peters, another majority white suburb of St Louis, where his family were popular and well thought of - until his mother’s deception was exposed.

She had three children by at least two different men and lived with her husband at the time in a large detached bungalow on the leafy street.

Mickelle Gordon, 39, a dental assistant, lived over the road from the family and said that Wilson's mother was ‘charismatic’ and ‘charming’ and first targeted her brother Jason, who lost tens of thousands including some of his pension.

Gordon said: ‘He used to work lots and saved all his money. She said that she was an investor and that she could help him.

‘She got his social security number and stole his identity. She used it to take out loans, credit cards and went through his savings. He never got it back’.

After that she fooled Gordon’s mother Sandy Finney, 67, an office manager, and stole her ID too.

Finney said: ‘My husband and I were naive. She cleaned us out for at least $100,000 and $30,000 in cash which we didn’t get back.’

She explained that his mother used to intercept her mail and sent of for pre-approved credit cards that she would use herself.

She got into do much debt that she had to take out one loan after another just to keep the scam afloat.

Finney claimed that Wilson's mother made a copy of the key they had left by the front door to let herself in when she wanted, using the cover story that she was letting the cat back in the house.

But really she was forwarding her calls from creditors to her own number so Finney had no idea how much debt she was in.

The charade came tumbling down in February 2001 when Finney was told by her own bank that she could not deposit any money and the authorities were 
alerted.

According to public records Wilson's mother pleaded guilty to six counts of forgery and one count of stealing at the 11th Judicial Court in St Louis.

In 1998 she had already admitted another six counts of stealing in an unrelated matter.

His mother's victims say however that she did not serve any time in jail and went into bankruptcy in October 2002

The following month she died.

Finney said: ‘They were not able to tell us if it was a suicide. As a victim you are not told anything’.

Only afterwards did she discover that his mother was on probation in Washington, Missouri, for doing something similar to somebody else.

Finney added: ‘I’m surprised Wilson passed the background checks to become a policeman. People can change but that was a bad home. His mother was a serial conwoman’.

Wilson's mother died when he would have been 16.

What effect that had on him at that age is unclear, but it appears that he bounced around the St Louis area at a number of addresses.

At the age of 22 for reasons only Wilson knows, he signed up to join the police and live a life on the other side of the law from that which his mother chose.

At Wilson’s current home, neighbors knew nothing of his dark family past and their biggest concern was that rioters would come and wreck the street if they found out where he lived.

A female school teacher told MailOnline: ‘Our neighborhood didn't do anything wrong. I'm worried people are going to come up here and start looting.

'They just moved in and seemed like nice people.

In the same day, Brown was also identified as a suspect in a robbery, thought it was added that Wilson was unaware of Brown's possible connection to that crime when the two met.

Henry Davis, 52, had missed his turn off for the Missouri city of St. Charles during heavy rain late at night on September 20, 2009, pulling over about 20 miles away in Ferguson.

While waiting for the rain to clear about 3am, a patrol officer ran Davis' plates and arrested him on an outstanding warrant - however it was the wrong Henry Davis.

The wanted man had a different middle name and Social Security number, but Davis, a welder, said the officer cuffed him and put him into a patrol car without explanation, {The Daily Beast}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html""> reported.

Davis had protested his innocence, and said the cops realized their mistake at Ferguson police station, recalling a booking officer saying: 'We have a problem.'

But Davis was placed in a one-man cell, which already had one man asleep on the only single bed.

Being early morning and cold, he asked for a sleeping mat from a nearby pile, but was refused.

Some time later, Davis said in a lawsuit file thereafter, the booking officer returned to the cell with three other officers.

He said he was slammed against the back wall by one of them and told to lay down with his hands behind his back.

Davis was straddled by a female officer, he said, and cuffed.

Two officers then entered the cell, he said.

'They started hitting me,' Davis later said in court, according to The Daily Beast.

'I was getting hit and I just covered up'

The two left and the female officer returned, holding up Davis' head.

The officer that initially slammed him against the wall returned and kicked him in the head.

'I almost passed out at that point ... Paramedics came,' Davis said.

'They said it was too much blood, I had to go to the hospital.'

Davis was taken to hospital in a police vehicle, however he refused treatment, demanding a witness and photo proof of what had happened.

Afterwards, still under arrest, he was taken back to the police station and held in a cell for several days.

Davis was eventually charged with four counts of property damage - having allegedly bled on the uniforms of four officers - and released on $1,500 bail.

Davis subsequently filed a civil suit, and at least two of the officers involved said in court they did not get blood on their uniforms.

There was no video of the alleged police attack to support Davis' claims of brutality, because the security cameras were VHS at the time and had been recorded at 32 times the normal speed.

A federal magistrate ruled that if the officers had committed perjury about the bloody uniforms, the charges were too minor to press ahead with.

The magistrate also concluded that Davis' injuries were too minor to constitute excessive force.

However a CAT scan taken after the incident confirmed he had suffered a concussion.

The property charges were dropped and the lawsuit was closed.

Davis' lawyer, James Schottel, is currently preparing an appeal, he told The Daily Beast.

Schottel claims that perjury is perjury however minor, and that a concussion is now considered a serious injury.

Schottel also believes that Davis' chances of appealing have now gone up on the back of the Michael Brown outrage and the increasing scrutiny of the police in Ferguson.

Davis' case surfaced as as Missouri state senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal, a Democrat representing parts of St. Louis County in the state Senate, attacked Governor Jay Nixon, as well as other Democrats, for their lack of involvement in the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting.

'There hasn't been a single white Democrat down here,' Chappelle-Nadal said Wednesday, according to {The Washington Post}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/08/15/a-missouri-state-senator-has-been-going-off-on-twitter-over-fellow-democrats-

Robert McCulloch is not objective enough for the 'racially charged climate' in Ferguson. 

'This racially charged climate demands an independent investigation, and to be perfectly blunt, the African-American community has no confidence that your office can carry out an impartial investigation and prosecution,' state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed said. 

But McCulloch, who's been a prosecutor in the racially divided St. Louis County for some 23 years, is not stranger to controversy — and he's not one to give up easily.

As a teenager, McCulloch — whose mother, father, brother and two other relatives worked at the St. Louis PD — wanted desperately to be in law enforcement.

Even when he lost a leg to cancer, he continue to chase down his dream. 

'I couldn’t become a policeman, so being county prosecutor is the next best thing,' McCulloch told the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/st-louis-prosecutor-has-faced-controversy-for-decades/article_cdd4c104-6086-506e-9ee8-aa957a31fee5.html"">.

His first tryout in the national spotlight came a few months after he took office in 1991, when a Guns N' Roses concert turned into a riot that ended up injuring 40 people and 25 police officers.

Frontman Axl Rose was accused of hitting at least one security guard and three concertgoers, as well as thrashing a dressing room.

McCulloch charged Rose with misdemeanor assault and property damage, and pursued him across the country to enforce an arrest warrant.

'Where he goes, we'll be waiting for him,' a determined McCulloch said, according to the Post-Dispatch. 

'If he wants to cancel his whole schedule, fine,' he added. 'If he leaves the country, we’ll notify Customs to get him when he comes back.'

McCulloch finally caught Rose after a public uproar and the rock star signed a plea agreement.

But critics say that McCulloch is partial to police-involved violence, especially between white cops and black suspects, going back to the shooting of his own father in 1964.

His dad, 37-year-old canine officer Paul McCulloch, was killed in the line of duty while responding to a kidnapping at a public housing complex.

The shooter, Eddie Glenn, who was black, was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting.

Then years later, now a prosecutor in 2000, McCulloch was forced — not for the last time — to ascertain his objectivity when community leaders began questioning his leading an investigation into the shooting of two unarmed black men by two white police officers.

The officers were not indicted. 

But McCulloch said his decision had nothing to do with his history.

'My father was killed many, many years ago, and it’s certainly not something you forget, but it’s certainly not something that clouds my judgment in looking at a case,' 
McCulloch told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 'It certainly makes you more aware of the severity of it.'

Democratic Congressman William Lacy Clay, of St. Louis, this week accused the prosecuting attorney of trying to taint a potential jury pool when he released a video allegedly showing Brown robbing a convenience store — on the exact same day that police released the name of the white cop behind the shooting, Darren Wilson.

'I have no faith in him,' Clay said, according to the Post-Dispatch.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, who has also questioned McCulloch's objectivity, has asked the state attorney general's office to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case. 

If he chooses to continue handling the case, Nasheed said, Ferguson might go up in flames. 

'If you should decide to not indict this police officer, the rioting we witnessed this past week will seem like a picnic compared to the havoc that will likely occur, because the black community will never accept that there was an impartial investigation from your office,' added the democratic senator, of St. Louis.

'On the other hand, if you should indict, the black community will be suspicious of your office's sincerity in carrying forth he prosecution, as I can imagine serious questions about the lack of African-American prosecutors in the county.'

But, through a spokesman, McCulloch said his office isn't backing down.

'We are working with the county police,' the spokesman, Ed Magee, told the {Washington Post}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/objectivity-of-prosecutor-in-missouri-shooting-of-michael-brown-is-questioned/2014/08/15/1fe20690-24bc-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html"">.

(AP) — Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew Saturday in the St. Louis suburb where a black teenager was shot to death by a white police officer a week ago.

Nixon said that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow a handful of looters to endanger the community. The curfew will run from midnight to 5 a.m.

Tensions in Ferguson flared late Friday after police released the name of the officer who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown and documents alleging Brown robbed a store before he died.

Nixon also said the U.S. Department of Justice is beefing up its investigation of the shooting.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said there were 40 FBI agents going door-to-door talking to people who might have 
seen or have information about the shooting.

Nixon and Johnson spoke at a church in Ferguson, where they were interrupted repeatedly by people demanding justice and objecting to the curfew.

Johnson assured those in attendance that police would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to observe the curfew.

""You saw people sitting in the street and they had the chance to get up,"" he said. ""And that's how it's going to continue.""

Brown's death had already ignited several days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri 
Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But 
Friday night marked a resurgence of unrest.

Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed 
Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly.

The officer who killed Brown was identified as 28-year-old Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints filed against him.

The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson's whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley asked Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster on Friday to take over the case, saying he did not believe McCulloch could be objective. 
Koster said Missouri law does not allow it unless McCulloch opts out, and McCulloch spokesman Ed Magee said the prosecutor has no plans to surrender the case.",NA,NA,NA,NA
DailyMail,daily81,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2726786/Ferguson-area-native-tasked-keeping-peace.html,Ferguson-area native tasked with keeping peace,Associated Press,8/16/2014,1/1/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — In the days since Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson took charge of a volatile situation that threatened to turn ugly, tragic or both, his calm-yet-commanding presence has captured international attention. But when it comes to keeping the peace in the St. Louis suburb where a white police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teen, Johnson knows his neighbors' opinions are what matter most.

""The people of our community need to hear what I'm saying,"" Johnson, who is black, said at the start of one daily press briefing, urging local residents standing behind an enormous media contingent to come closer to the podium. ""They've got questions, and I invited them here.""

The 27-year patrol veteran, who oversees nearly 150 troopers patrolling 11 counties in eastern Missouri, grew up down the road from the neighborhood where 18-year-old Michael 
Brown was killed Aug. 9. He still lives nearby, in the neighboring town of Florissant. He was placed in charge of Ferguson security by Col. Ron Repogle, the Highway Patrol superintendent, after Gov. Jay Nixon revoked county police oversight Thursday.

Johnson's impact was immediate. After five nights of volatile and violent protests marked by looting, arson and the use of tear gas on demonstrators by county and local police, Johnson ordered his officers to abandon the body armor and gas masks and instead ensure the public's right to peaceably assemble.

Things escalated again Friday night, after Ferguson police released the name of the officer who shot Brown along with video they said showed the teen robbing a store shortly before he was killed. But as looters broke into several businesses, some throwing rocks and other objects at officers, police backed off, a move Johnson said was designed to ease tension. No arrests were made and no one was badly hurt.

From the start, Johnson, 50, walked alongside protesters, past the barbecue joint and neighborhood taverns he knew by name, stopping for hugs, handshakes and encouragement. He spoke sincerely and empathetically with young black men who described routine racial profiling based on their clothing, hairstyles and demeanor. Their complaints were familiar: His own son, in his 20s, is often judged because of his tattoos, Johnson said.

Most of all, he listened.

""He made himself accessible, from a place of peace and understanding,"" said Robin Moore-Chambers, a diversity trainer and counseling professor at Lindenwood University who lives in nearby Dellwood. ""He's listening to everybody. He will take you seriously. He's appealing to their humanity. He knows they need to be heard.""

Protesters and politicians credit him with almost entirely defusing the nightly violence, and giving the community a sense that it can recover.

On Saturday, Johnson was front and center at a volatile news conference with the governor, taking the lead in explaining how a curfew Nixon ordered would be carried out.

""What we're doing now is not who we are. It's not who we are. Yelling at each other is not going to solve it,"" Johnson calmly told one audience member. ""We're all talking about the same concerns and the same passion. The frustration that's in your home is in my home. It's in my home. And I've given you all the answers that I know, and I'm going to continue to give you that.""

Johnson said police would not use armored trucks and tear gas. He also credited community leaders who had voluntarily helped maintain order in the streets and discourage protesters from violence.

Complaints about the police response began almost immediately after Brown's shooting, when authorities decided to use dogs for crowd control — a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police had taken over at the request of the smaller city, leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace until the state stepped in.

Johnson joined the Highway Patrol in 1987, earning a promotion to corporal in 1995 and to sergeant two years later. He spent three years on the other side of the state after a promotion to lieutenant in 1999 before returning to the St. Louis region as commanding officer in 2002.

Law enforcement runs in the family. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Johnson's father-in-law was a deputy police chief for the city department.

While Johnson's role has been largely welcomed, not everyone is satisfied. Some residents asked if he was simply a figurehead, noting Johnson was not aware Ferguson's police chief would release the surveillance footage of Brown, part of what led to the renewed unrest Friday. Johnson assured them that ""we're all in this together.""

""We all want justice. We all want answers,"" he said. ""I've got a big dog in this fight. When the media is gone ... Ron Johnson is still going to be here.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

After violence in Midwest, US reconsiders programs to give excess military equipment to police

WASHINGTON (AP) — After a decade of sending military equipment to civilian police departments across the country, federal officials are reconsidering the idea in light of the violence in Ferguson, Missouri.

The public has absorbed images of heavily armed police, snipers trained on protesters and tear gas plumes. Against that backdrop, Attorney General Eric Holder said that when police and citizens need to restore calm, ""I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.""

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said police responses like that in Ferguson have ""become the problem instead of the solution."" Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., said he will introduce legislation to reverse police militarization.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his committee will review the program to determine if the Defense Department's surplus equipment is being used as intended.

One night after the violence that accompanied the presence of military-style equipment in Ferguson, tensions eased when a police captain, unprotected and shaking hands, walked through a crowd in a gesture of reconciliation. The contrast added to perception that the tanks and tear gas had done more harm than good.

Islamic extremists kill scores of Yazidi men in Iraq; airstrikes target nation's largest dam

IRBIL, Iraq (AP) — Islamic extremists shot scores of Yazidi men to death in Iraq, lining them up in small groups and opening fire with assault rifles before abducting their wives and children, according to an eyewitness, government officials and people who live in the area.

A Yazidi lawmaker on Saturday cited the mass killing in Kocho as evidence that his people are still at risk after a week of U.S. and Iraqi airstrikes on the militants.

Meanwhile, warplanes targeted insurgents around a large dam that was captured by the Islamic State extremist group earlier this month, nearby residents said.

In a statement, U.S. Central Command said the airstrikes Saturday were launched under the authority to support humanitarian efforts in Iraq, as well as to protect U.S. personnel and facilities.

Central Command says the nine airstrikes conducted so far had destroyed or damaged four armored personnel carriers, seven armed vehicles, two Humvees and an armored vehicle.

Pope holds up Korean martyrs as models for church in Asia as he stresses role of lay faithful

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Pope Francis beatified 124 Korean martyrs on Saturday, telling hundreds of thousands of people who turned out for his open-air Mass that their ancestors' willingness to die rather than renounce their faith two centuries ago was a model for Asian missionaries today.

The streets leading up to Seoul's iconic Gwanghwamun Gate were packed with Koreans honoring the lay Catholics who founded the church here in the 18th century. Korea's church is unique in that it was founded not by foreign missionary priests — as occurred in most of the world — but by members of Korea's own noble classes who learned of Christianity by reading books about it.

These early Catholics were killed in the 18th and 19th centuries by the Joseon Dynasty, which tried to shut the Korean Peninsula off from Western influence.

Police in Seoul declined to give an estimate of the crowd size, but the Vatican said about 800,000 people had turned out. The number was significant given that Catholics represent only about 10 percent of South Korea's 50 million people.

The Mass kicked off a busy day for Francis as he passed the halfway mark of his five-day South Korea visit. In the afternoon, he traveled to a religious community that cares for severely disabled Koreans and prayed briefly at a monument to aborted babies — a strong albeit silent gesture from a pope who prefers to stress other aspects of church teaching rather than emphasize hot-button ""culture war"" issues like abortion.

NY sheriff: Couple charged with kidnapping 2 Amish sisters may have planned other abductions

CANTON, N.Y. (AP) — A couple accused of kidnapping two young Amish sisters were prowling for easy targets and may have also planned to abduct other children, a sheriff said Saturday.

Stephen Howells Jr. and Nicole Vaisey, both of Hermon, were arrested Friday on charges they snatched the 7-year-old and 12-year-old girls from a roadside farm stand in front of their home near the Canadian border.

St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells said at a news conference Saturday that more charges may be filed and that investigators are looking into whether the pair had plotted or carried out other abductions.

""We felt that there was the definite potential that there was going to be other victims,"" Wells said.

The sisters were abducted Wednesday from their family's farm stand in Oswegatchie and were set free by their captors Thursday.

In Robin Williams' death, lessons of stigmas and stereotypes

NEW YORK (AP) — Jamie Masada, the owner of the fabled Los Angeles-based comedy club the Laugh Factory, vividly remembers a warm exchange with comic Richard Jeni of the two sharing words of encouragement and gentle ribbing.

""The next day I heard he put a gun in his mouth and blew his head off,"" recalled Masada of Jeni's 2007 suicide. ""At that point I said, 'God, could I do something to somehow prevent that?'""

A few years later, having watched his ""family"" continuously depleted, Masada did do something. He began having a psychologist at the club several nights a week, offering stand-ups the opportunity for free sessions.

Robin Williams, a frequent Laugh Factory performer who committed suicide Monday, marked only the latest comic genius to be plagued by demons of depression and addiction. But seldom has the gulf between the bright buoyancy of the performer and the inner pain of the man seemed greater or more unfathomable. How did someone who suffered such demons summon such starbursts of generosity and glee?

Like countless others this week, Conan O'Brien remembered Williams' great capacity for thoughtfulness and kindness. When O'Brien was feeling down during the ""Tonight Show"" debacle, a bike arrived out of the blue from Williams, outfitted for maximum ridiculousness. Said O'Brien: ""It's particularly courageous for someone to be that generous of spirit in the face of that kind of depression.""

Perry is third GOP White House hopeful with legal troubles, but his indictments may hurt most

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — As they form exploratory committees, consider the grueling prospect of a national campaign with their families and begin hiring staff in key presidential battleground states, three potential Republican White House candidates also face the distraction of legal troubles back at home.

The latest is Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who following his indictment on two felony charges, is staring at the most serious accusations of wrongdoing by a prominent Republican governor openly considering a run for president.

In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie is trying to move beyond the apparent effort of his staff to create traffic chaos on a bridge into Manhattan late last year, while state prosecutors in Wisconsin are examining whether Gov. Scott Walker coordinated too closely during a past campaign with outside conservative groups.

But prosecutors have taken no action against Christie and Walker, and may never do so. Only Perry has suffered the infamy of an actual indictment, handed up by a grand jury in 
Austin, Texas, that accused the longest-serving governor in the state's history of abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant.

The charges came after a special prosecutor spent months presenting evidence that Perry broke the law when he carried out a promise to nix funding for the public integrity unit run by the office of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg unless she resigned. A Democrat, Lehmberg had been convicted of drunken driving.

Liberia expands Ebola treatment center; 2 more airlines halt flights to affected countries

MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — Liberian authorities expanded Ebola treatment centers in the capital Saturday to cope with increasing numbers of patients, while two more airlines announced they were halting flights to the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone amid the deepening crisis.

Kenya Airways and regional carrier Gambia Bird join a number of other airlines in temporarily cancelling flights to avoid transmitting the disease beyond the four countries already affected in West Africa.

(AP) — An officer was briefly hospitalized after being assaulted during a mostly peaceful protest in Northern California over the fatal police shooting of an unarmed teen in Ferguson, Missouri, authorities said Saturday.

Officers demonstrated ""a high level of restraint"" during Friday's protest, said Sean Whent, chief of police in Oakland, a city that has grappled with numerous protests spanning from the fatal shooting of Oscar Grant by a transit police officer in 2009 to Occupy Oakland in 2011-12.

Another Ferguson-related protest was planned in Oakland Saturday evening.

On Friday, several protesters assaulted the officer while he attempted to make an arrest, said Officer Johnna Watson, an Oakland police spokeswoman. The injured officer was taken to a local hospital and later released.

At least two other officers were pepper-sprayed and treated at the scene, said Watson, who added that the march was mainly nonviolent.

""A majority of the crowd was peaceful, but there were some individuals and groups who participated in assaulting police, vandalizing businesses and committing graffiti along the march route,"" Watson said.

The protest began outside Oakland City Hall, the site of a peaceful gathering the previous day. Marchers encountered several Oakland police officers, some in riot helmets, blocking a freeway on-ramp to keep them from walking onto Interstate 880 — as some did to protest the fatal shooting of Florida teen Trayvon Martin in 2012.

As nightfall approached, a few protesters with covered faces pulled out paint cans and hammers and sprayed anti-police graffiti on buildings as the march continued along a main Oakland thoroughfare into the neighboring city of Berkeley.

Oakland police later arrested two men in their 40s, one for assaulting an officer and the other for obstructing and resisting police, Watson said.

The photo shows Wilson as a sophomore at St Charles West High School in St Charles, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, where he grew up.

Wilson is now at the centre of a story which has torn apart St Louis and sparked six nights of unrest and rioting.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has now imposed a curfew and declared a state of emergency as tensions remain high.

MailOnline spoke to Jay, 28, who checks for underground utility lines for a living, after tracking him down through a friend who also knew Wilson.

In the longest conversation so far with somebody who is close to the officer, Jay said that he met his friend playing hockey on the street in St Charles.

They became close and used to ‘do typical guy stuff’ together like sit around and watch football. They two friends also joined a bowling league team together.

Jay said: ‘He’s a really classy guy. He’s the last person you would expect to do something like this.

‘We met 12 years ago and we’ve become really good friends since then.

‘He’s got a lot of friends round here. He’s a quiet guy.

‘I know that if he was in danger he is not the type of guy to do something stupid.

‘I just can’t see it happening. I can’t see him doing it.’

Jay said that Wilson signed up to join the police when he thought about it and then backed out, but Wilson was interested and took his place.

Jay said: ‘He loved the job. He loved being a cop. He liked to help people so I think that’s why he signed up’.

Jay said that Wilson would ‘do anything for anybody’ and once co-signed for a car with him because he had bad credit.

He said: ‘I have never seen him in a bad situation. At all times he keeps himself out of bad situations. He always makes the right decisions.’

At the age of 22 Wilson signed up with the police in Jennings, a neighbourhood close to Ferguson. He appears to have transferred to Ferguson two years later.

In February he received a commendation for ‘extraordinary effort in the line of duty’. His father John posted a picture on Facebook and wrote next to it: ‘Very proud of my son’.

Asked if Wilson had ever appeared racist, Jay said: ‘Not at all. I know he told me many times that he liked working out in Ferguson and Jennings
.
‘People used to ask him why don’t you move to a safer area but he liked it out there. He didn’t mind being on the (housing) estate…

‘...he liked the people out there. He liked the people he worked with. As far as I know he never had any trouble’.

MailOnline has already established that Wilson came from a troubled home and neighbours claimed his mother Tonya Durso cheated them out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by stealing their identities.

She died at the age of 35 in 2002 when Wilson would have been just 16, the year his sophomore photo was taken.

Wilson now lives in Crestwood, a quiet middle class and almost entirely white suburb of St Louis in a ranch style house with a pool out the back.

According to public records he got divorced last year and moved into his current home with his new girlfriend.

Others coming to Wilson’s defence in recent days have been Jake Shepard, who went to school with him.

He wrote on Facebook: ‘He is the nicest guy in the world! He Has the biggest heart. He really does. Nobody is ever going to know what really happened, but I can say with certainty that the officers intentions were pure.

‘He is one of those cops that make you appreciate law enforcement.'",98,NA,NA,NA

Officers are seeking the person who shot the critically-wounded victim after the 12am-5am curfew took hold in Ferguson, Missouri - eight days after Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by police.

Police said their strong response came after people broke into a restaurant and took position on the roof overlooking officers, while another man flashed a handgun as armoured vehicles approached.

It came as a first photograph emerged showing Darren Wilson, the officer who gunned down Brown. 

Some 200 defiant protesters remained on the streets of Ferguson last night after the curfew took effect - and a first photograph emerged showing the officer who gunned down Brown.

As midnight arrived people remained on the corner of Canfield Drive and West Florissant Avenue in the St Louis suburb, shouting and screaming despite calls for then to go home.

A man walked past and pulled up his T-shirt so it showed off a gun stuffed into his shorts in a warning to get out. At 12.30am the lines of police on both sides pulled back and reinforcements arrived.

Dozens of heavily armed officers with batons, shields, helmets, assembled in grid formation. Swat vans came down the hill with cops on the top with assault rifles.

Over a loudspeaker they told the crowd they were in violation of the curfew and would be 'subject to arrest and or other actions'. The small army with around 100 Swat officers slowly advanced as a Molotov cocktail flared up in the crowd.

At 12.45am all the officers put on gas masks and the first of at least five volleys of tear gas, 18 shots in total, was sent into the crowd, causing them to scatter.

'There's no police, said one store owner guarding his business. 'We trusted the police to keep it peaceful; they didn't do their job.'

Police slowly advanced using search lights to check buildings on the side of the road - officers said they feared that the protesters had gone to the sides and that they might open fire.

At 1.30am around 18 shots could be heard going off to the east of West Florissant. Journalists were kept back well behind police lines so it was not possible to see what was going on on the front line. 

Chants of 'no justice, no curfew,' rang out taunting police. Officers spoke through a loudspeaker: 'You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately. Failure to comply, may result in arrest.

Some demonstrators stood with their hands up, the emblematic pose used by many protesters to characterise the position witnesses have said Brown had assumed when he was fatally shot.

By 2am the police had advanced to just to the north of the QuikTrip convenience store which burned down during the first day of rioting. 

The operation wrapped up at 2.20am, leaving the street empty and quiet. An officer at the scene said that there had been 'under a dozen' arrests and that one protestor had been shot.

Shouts could be heard from behind police lines but it wasn't clear how many protesters had been penned in. Chanting could be heard coming from the site of where Brown died to the East.

'You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately. Failure to comply, may result in arrest'

Police, speaking through loudspeaker

A heavily armed cop who was smiling as he walked back from the front line was asked how it was going. He said: 'Oh, it's going'.

The angry clashes and scenes straight out of a war-zone came after another day of dramatic developments in Ferguson over the shooting of Brown.

Missouri police officer Darren Wilson, who has been identified as the law enforcement official who shot the teen, was pictured for the first time in a report yesterday.

{Yahoo News}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/photos-ferguson-officer-darren-wilson-received-police-award-earlier-this-year-021255893.html""> published the photograph of 
Officer Wilson on their homepage in a report detailing his  February commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty'. 

Officer Wilson is now on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting. The photo of the 28-year-old was, according to the report, originally posted on Facebook by his father, John Wilson.

'Very proud of my son, Darren Wilson on his receiving a commendation from his Police Department,' Mr Wilson wrote on February 11. 'Congratulations, son.'

Amid violent protests raging over his son's killing of Brown, Mr Wilson took to Facebook asking his friends for support without mentioning the officer by name. 

'Dear FB [Facebook] friends, our family is in need for prayers to be sent up for a family member,' Mr Wilson wrote. 'Circumstances do not allow for us to say anything further.

'You saw people sitting in the street and they had the chance to get up. And that's how it's going to continue'

Captain Ron Johnson, Missouri State Highway Patrol

'Please pray with our family in mind. Put a covering of protection over our family member please.'

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said on Friday that Officer Wilson was devastated, and that he never meant for it to happen.

He said Officer Wilson encountered Brown and another man on the street during a routine patrol. A confrontation ensued and Officer Wilson fatally shot Brown.

Addressing the volatile situation in Ferguson yesterday, the Governor of Missouri declared a state of emergency and imposed a five-hour curfew. 

He praised the people who have exercised their First Amendment right to protest peacefully and those who 'stood up against violent instigators.'

Calling Friday night's looting 'unacceptable,' Jay Nixon said the town must not allow 'the ill-will of a few to undermine the goodwill of the many.'

Nixon also said the US Department of Justice is increasing the size of its investigation of the shooting.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said there were 40 FBI agents going door-to-door talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting.

Governor Nixon and Captain Johnson spoke at a church in Ferguson, where they were interrupted repeatedly by people demanding justice and objecting to the curfew.

Nixon was speaking at a chaotic and ill-tempered press conference during which he was repeatedly heckled, with members of the public demanding to know why Officer Wilson had not been indicted for the shooting of Michael Brown.

Captain Johnson assured those in attendance that police would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to observe the curfew.

'You saw people sitting in the street and they had the chance to get up,' he said. 'And that's how it's going to continue.'

'All of this is just building up - pent-up aggression by being mistreated on a daily basis'

Keyon Watkins, computer science worker

Despite heavy rainfall and lightning, hundreds of protesters gathered Saturday night at a busy thoroughfare that has been the site of previous clashes with police. Scores of officers, a much more visible presence than the night before, stood watch - including some with shields.

Members of various black community groups were urging people to abide by the curfew, which runs from midnight to 5am today. 

A woman from the New Black Panther Party walked the street telling the crowd: ‘Please, please be out of the area by 12 o'clock.’

Some responded to her pleas by cursing at police, while others acknowledged they planned to leave.

But Keyon Watkins, a 26-year-old computer science worker from St Louis, said that if many others stay in the street, he would join them.

‘All of this is just building up - pent-up aggression by being mistreated on a daily basis,’ Mr Watkins said.

Darrell Alexander, 57, a registered nurse from nearby Florissant, Missouri, worried last night that the curfew might spur anger and more violence.

‘I think it's an antagonistic decision to not allow people to express their freedom of speech. It's an overreaction,’ he said.

By 10pm with two hours until the curfew the atmosphere was tense with dozens of police wearing riot gear lining each side of West Florissant Avenue, where the protests had been taking place all day.

Protesters drove up and down and screamed abuse at the cops or eyeballed the officers as they walked past.

'They got a plan to gas us by midnight and we're gonna go home by midnight and go to church in the morning'

Malik Shabazz, Black Lawyers for Justice

Malik Shabazz, the head of Black Lawyers for Justice, who has spearheaded efforts to control the protesters among the community, walked up and down with a bullhorn imploring the crowd of 1,000 to go home.

He said: 'They got a plan to gas us by midnight and we're gonna go home by midnight and go to church in the morning'.

Governor Nixon's curfew announcement came after tensions again flared in Ferguson late Friday night, just hours after Officer Wilson was named as the shooter. 

The officer has been accused by witnesses of shooting the youth even though he had his hands up. 

Ferguson police only disclosed his name after coming under intense pressure and facing lawsuits by civil liberties groups.

Wilson currently lives in Crestwood, a suburb of St Louis which is 94 per cent white and 1.6 per cent black. 

His house is a $180,000 (£110,000) bungalow with a pool and a basketball hoop in the drive on a sleepy street in a neighbourhood that one resident described as 'solidly middle class'.

BILLIONAIRE CO-FOUNDER OF TWITTER JOINS PROTESTERS IN FERGUSON AND LIVE-TWEETS DEMONSTRATION AS CURGEW GOES INTO EFFECT

Twitter co-founder and St Louis native Jack Dorsey joined the protesters in Ferguson yesterday, live-tweeting the rain-soaked demonstration.

An hour before the curfew imposed Saturday by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon went into effect, the 37-year-old billionaire described in detail the situation on the ground in the 
St Louis suburb, which has been rocked by violent protests following the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown at the hands of a white police officer.

'Streets are emptying and questing,' Mr Dorsey wrote from his @Jack account to his 1.6million followers.

Over the course of the last 24 hours, Mr Dorsey, whose net worth hovers around 1.9billion, posted dozens of tweets and 6-second Vine videos showing scenes from the rallies and marches taking place in Ferguson. 

‘Feels good to be home. I'll be standing with everyone in Ferguson all weekend #HandsUpDontShoo,’ the California-based tech mogul tweeted late on Friday as protests in Ferguson turned violent. 

Mr Dorsey was also on hand for Friday’s march to the site of Brown's shooting organized by Reverend Jesse Jackson. 

‘We're here. My whole family! And @2000F,’ Dorsey posted, referring to the Twitter handle of Square co-founder Jim McKelvey.

Mr Dorsey's frequent updates and videos posted through the Twitter-owned video-sharing site Vine followed people in the crowd holding up signs, chanting, playing the drums and raising their hands in the air. 

He also documented a meeting between the protesters and Missouri State Highway Patrol Ron Captain Johnson - a man the Twitter co-founded called an 'amazing and disarming leader.'

The property backs onto a church which reads: 'When our dream roads take strange turns'.

Officer Wilson's mother Tonya died when he was just 16. 

What effect that had on him at that age is unclear, but it appears that he bounced around the St Louis area at a number of addresses and met a girlfriend called Ashley Brown.

Between 2000 and 2004 he attended St Charles West High School where former classmates remembered him as a good hockey player.

Jake Shepard wrote on Facebook: 'He is the nicest guy in the world! He has the biggest heart. He really does. 

'Nobody is ever going to know what really happened, but I can say with certainty that the officers intentions were pure. He is one of those cops that make you appreciate law enforcement.'

At the age of 22, Officer Wilson signed up to join the police. At Officer Wilson’s current home, neighbors are concerned that rioters would come and wreck the street if they found out where he lived. 

A female school teacher told MailOnline: ‘Our neighborhood didn't do anything wrong. I'm worried people are going to come up here and start looting. 

'They just moved in and seemed like nice people. Things are pretty quiet round here'.

Officer Wilson, who has a licence for hunting and for fishing, has a metal American flag in his front lawn and small couch sits on the porch, suggesting that he likes to relax out the front of his house during the warm summer nights.

Nobody answered at the door when MailOnline visited. A husband and wife in their 60s who had lived in the neighbourhood for many years said that it was full of respectable people.

The man said: 'Crime is not really an issue around here. The biggest thing we have to worry about is the occasional party from teenagers but we don't have any at the moment’

He spent four years with the Ferguson police department and two previous years in the Jennings district, NBC's Tom Winter reported.

Neighbors told USA Today that Officer Wilson was 'tall and slim' and was often seen walking his dog.

Another neighbor, Ron Gorski, told USA Today: 'He's a young guy. 'Things happen and it's a complicated situation. I feel for the family and the entire country.'

Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said the shooting had been 'devastating, absolutely devastating' to Officer Wilson, adding: 'We had no complaints about the officer. He was a gentleman. A quiet officer. He has been an effective officer.'

Anger spurred by Brown's death boiled over again Friday night when protesters stormed into a Missouri convenience store - the same store that Brown was accused of robbing - and several other local businesses.

The police response to protesters has been criticized for using military tactics such as tear gas and rubber bullets, and early yesterday morning, St Louis County police were ordered to stand down around 1am by the Missouri Highway Patrol, who took over policing of the protests with Captain Johnson, who is black, at the helm.

City Alderman Antonio French who was on the scene trying to calm the crowd, tweeted that as police were driving away, they shot tear gas into the crowd, further inciting the protesters to anger.

The clashes divided protesters, with a small group apparently responsible for the looting and destruction, and a much larger crowd peacefully banding together to stop them.

Among the stores looted were a beauty supplies shop and a Domino's Pizza. The owners of the beauty store say they will not reopen.

Many witnesses at the scene described the protesters who were protecting the stores from the looters.

'Hundreds in the streets. Only a few dozen attempting to loot. Dozens more physically trying to prevent,' tweeted Wesley Lowery.

At the same news conference in which Officer Wilson was named, Chief Jackson released documents alleging that Brown stole a $48.99 (£30) box of cigars from a convenience store called Ferguson Market and Liquor, then strong-armed a man on his way out.

Just before midnight, some in what had been a large and rowdy but mostly well-behaved crowd broke into that same small store, and began looting it, according to Captain Johnson.

Some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Captain Johnson said. One officer was hurt, but details on the injury were not immediately available. 

Captain Johnson added that police backed off to try and ease the tension. He believes looting may have spread to a couple of nearby stores. No arrests were made.

'We had to evaluate the security of the officers there and also the rioters,' Captain Johnson said. 'We just felt it was better to move back.'

Meanwhile, peaceful protesters yelled at the aggressors to stop what they were doing. About a dozen people eventually blocked off the front of the convenience store to help protect it. 

Andy Banker, a local news reporter, reported that the St. Louis police department only documented the looting five hours after the break-in, and that the store owners are 'furious' as a result.

Brown's death had previously ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. 

Tensions eased on Thursday after Governor Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. 

Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators.

POLICE OFFICER WHO SHOT MICHAEL BROWN WON DEPARTMENT AWARD

The officer who shot Michael Brown won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February, it has been revealed.

Darren Wilson, 28, was nowhere to be seen at his white middle class home in the suburb of Crestwood where he moved just a year ago. 

It was claimed he had left the single-story brick home 'days ago'. No one answered the door when MailOnline knocked on the door and there were two or three police cars parked outside. 

Neighbors told {USA Today}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/""> that he was 'tall and slim' and was often seen walking his dog.

DailyMail,daily86,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2726907/Police-deploy-tear-gas-impose-Ferguson-curfew.html,Police deploy tear gas to impose Ferguson curfew,Associated Press,8/17/2014,1/1/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — One person was shot and seven people were arrested early Sunday morning as police used smoke and tear gas to impose a curfew in a St. Louis suburb where a black teen walking down the street had been shot by a white police officer.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said during a news conference that police are still seeking the person who shot the critically wounded victim and defended his department's strong strategic response that came after a midnight to 5 a.m. curfew took hold in Ferguson, Missouri. Johnson said the strong police response was precipitated by two events.

Johnson said concerns about people who'd broken into a barbecue restaurant and taken position on the roof overlooking approaching police was one strategic concern. He said another involved a man who flashed a handgun and appeared in the middle of the street as armored vehicles approached the crowd of protesters.

Johnson said someone also fired at a patrol car, but no officers were injured.

Hundreds of other protesters left peacefully before the curfew took effect in Ferguson, where 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot on Aug. 9. The shooting has prompted protests, unrest and claims of civil rights violations.

But remaining protesters — chanting ""No justice! No curfew!"" — refused to leave the area. As five armored tactical vehicles approached the crowd, officers spoke through a loudspeaker: ""You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately. Failure to comply, may result in arrest.""

As officers put on gas masks, a chant from the distant crowd emerged: ""We have the right to assemble peacefully.""

A moment later, police began firing canisters into the crowd of protesters.

Highway Patrol Spokesman Lt. John Hotz initially said police only used smoke, but later told The Associated Press that they also fired tear gas canisters. He said of police efforts: ""Obviously, we're trying to give them every opportunity to comply with the curfew.""

Jayson Ross, who was leading the protesters toward police before the canisters were fired, said: ""They got guns. We got guns. We are ready.""

The unrest between police and protesters came after Gov. Jay Nixon on Saturday declared a state of emergency in Ferguson.

Nixon's curfew announcement came after tensions again flared in Ferguson late Friday night. Earlier that day, local police identified the officer who shot Brown as Darren 
Wilson and released documents and video footage alleging that Brown had robbed a convenience store just before he was shot. Police said Wilson was unaware Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

As the curfew approached late Saturday night, New Black Panther Party leader Malik Shabazz roamed the street with a bullhorn, encouraging people to leave for their own safety. Many appeared to follow his suggestion.

""C'mon you all, let's roll out,"" Shabazz said through his bullhorn. ""Let's roll out of here, get some rest and come back tomorrow.""

Crowds that were in the hundreds prior to the curfew had dwindled significantly in the final hour.

Keyon Watkins, a 26-year-old computer science worker from St. Louis, said on Saturday that if many others stayed in the street, he would join them.

""All of this is just building up — pent-up aggression by being mistreated on a daily basis,"" Watkins said.

In announcing the curfew, Nixon said that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow looters to endanger the community.

""I am committed to making sure the forces of peace and justice prevail,"" Nixon said during a press conference at a church that was interrupted repeatedly by people objecting to the curfew and demanding that the officer who shot Brown be charged with murder.

""We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching,"" Nixon said. ""We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.""

State statute gives the governor broad powers when he declares a state of emergency, but he hasn't indicated that he plans to do anything other than imposing the curfew and empowering the state highway patrol to enforce it.

Meanwhile, Nixon said the U.S. Department of Justice is beefing up its civil rights investigation of the shooting.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door in the neighborhood starting Saturday, talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting.

Johnson on Saturday said police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas but would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave. 
Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed 
Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly and several officers got trapped and injured.

Brown's death had already ignited several days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri 
Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But Friday night marked a resurgence of unrest.

On Saturday, some residents said it appeared the violent acts were being committed by people who came from other suburbs or states.

""Who would burn down their own backyard?"" asked Rebecca McCloud, a local who works with the Sonshine Baptist Church in St. Louis. ""These people aren't from here. They came to burn down our city and leave.""

Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, is a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, the local police chief has said.

The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson's whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said in a news release on Sunday that Holder asked for the additional autopsy because of the ""extraordinary circumstances involved in this case"" and at the request of Brown's family.

The 18-year-old Brown was shot and killed by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer on Aug. 9. Brown was black and unarmed. Officer Darren Wilson is white.

Fallon says the autopsy will take place as soon as possible.

He also said the Justice Department will still take the state's autopsy into account during the investigation.

Protests have been going on since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed Aug. 9 by a white Ferguson officer, Darren Wilson. 

The death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Missouri's governor to put the Highway Patrol in charge of security.

The Ferguson Police Department waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store before he was killed, though Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson did not know Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

The US Department of Justice also has deepened its civil rights investigation of the shooting, as Johnson said Saturday that 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door in the neighborhood gathering information.

Governor Jay Nixon, who declared a state of emergency in Ferguson on Saturday after protests turned violent the night before, said Sunday morning on ABC's 'This Week' that he was not aware the police were going to release the surveillance video.

'It's appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,' he said.

In announcing the curfew, Nixon said that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow looters to endanger the community.

'We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching,' Nixon said during a news conference that was interrupted repeatedly by people objecting to the curfew and demanding Wilson be charged with murder.

Johnson said earlier Saturday that police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas but would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave. 

Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.

But as the curfew deadline arrived early Sunday, remaining protesters refused to leave the area as officers spoke through a loudspeaker: 'You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately.'

Residents in Ferguson have been holding demonstrations every night since the 18-year-old was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson.  

Nixon blames local police for the flare-ups, saying their release of images showing Brown robbing a convenience store had an 'incendiary effect'.

'When you release pictures and you clearly are attempting to besmirch a victim of a shooting, shot down in his own street, a young man, and at the same time you're releasing information...to tarnish him, then properly, there was a lot of folks that were concerned about that, and I do think it flamed it back up and has caused us to have to deal with some of that,' Nixon said on Face the Nation.

This Week on Sunday, said the sight of police in riot gear with armored tanks led to his decision to replace the local police force with highway patrol.

The measure had a calming effect at first, but last night saw one man shot and seven arrested after resisting the curfew order. A picture has emerged of the young man lying wounded on the ground.

'All of us were thunderstruck by the pictures we saw,' Nixon said.

'I mean, the over-militarization... the guns pointed at kids in the street, all of that I think instead of ratcheting down, brought emotion up.'

'Policing is something where you are involved with the community if it’s succeeding. And in those situations where folks are rolling up heavily armored and they’re pointing guns at folks, that’s impossible to have a dialogue. There are times when force is necessary, but we really felt that that push at that time was a little aggressive, obviously, and those images were not what we were trying to get to,' he said.

Nixon also imposed a midnight to 5am curfew in a bid to curtail violent clashes and allow local residents to rest.

Police on Saturday night used smoke and tear gas on protestors who ignored the midnight curfew, the Associated Press reported. At least seven people were arrested, and another man was shot and critically wounded.

Officers are seeking the person who shot the critically-wounded victim after the 12am-5am curfew took hold - eight days after Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by police.

It's not clear who fired the shot, but Nixon has said no officer fired their guns during the protest.

A church service for Michael Brown will be held by his family and attended by speakers including Jesse Jackson this afternoon.

Police said their strong response came after people broke into a restaurant and took position on the roof overlooking officers, while another man flashed a handgun as armored vehicles approached.

Some 200 defiant protesters remained on the streets of Ferguson last night after the curfew took effect - and a first photograph emerged showing the officer who gunned down Brown.

As midnight arrived people remained on the corner of Canfield Drive and West Florissant Avenue in the St Louis suburb, shouting and screaming despite calls for then to go home.

A man walked past and pulled up his T-shirt so it showed off a gun stuffed into his shorts in a warning to get out. At 12.30am the lines of police on both sides pulled back and reinforcements arrived. 

Dozens of heavily armed officers with batons, shields, helmets, assembled in grid formation. SWAT vans came down the hill with cops on the top with assault rifles.

Over a loudspeaker they told the crowd they were in violation of the curfew and would be 'subject to arrest and or other actions'. The small army with around 100 Swat officers slowly advanced as a Molotov cocktail flared up in the crowd.

At 12.45am all the officers put on gas masks and the first of at least five volleys of tear gas, 18 shots in total, was sent into the crowd, causing them to scatter.

'There's no police, said one store owner guarding his business. 'We trusted the police to keep it peaceful; they didn't do their job.'

Police slowly advanced using search lights to check buildings on the side of the road - officers said they feared that the protesters had gone to the sides and that they might open fire.

At 1.30am around 18 shots could be heard going off to the east of West Florissant. Journalists were kept back well behind police lines so it was not possible to see what was going on on the front line. 

Chants of 'no justice, no curfew,' rang out taunting police. Officers spoke through a loudspeaker: 'You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately. Failure to comply, may result in arrest.

Some demonstrators stood with their hands up, the emblematic pose used by many protesters to characterise the position witnesses have said Brown had assumed when he was fatally shot.

By 2am the police had advanced to just to the north of the QuikTrip convenience store which burned down during the first day of rioting. 

The operation wrapped up at 2.20am, leaving the street empty and quiet. An officer at the scene said that there had been 'under a dozen' arrests and that one protestor had been shot.

Shouts could be heard from behind police lines but it wasn't clear how many protesters had been penned in. Chanting could be heard coming from the site of where Brown died to the East.

'You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately. Failure to comply, may result in arrest'

Police, speaking through loudspeaker

A heavily armed cop who was smiling as he walked back from the front line was asked how it was going. He said: 'Oh, it's going'.

The angry clashes and scenes straight out of a war-zone came after another day of dramatic developments in Ferguson over the shooting of Brown.

Missouri police officer Darren Wilson, who has been identified as the law enforcement official who shot the teen, was pictured for the first time in a report yesterday.

{Yahoo News}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/photos-ferguson-officer-darren-wilson-received-police-award-earlier-this-year-021255893.html""> published the photograph of 
Officer Wilson on their homepage in a report detailing his  February commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty'. 

Officer Wilson is now on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting. The photo of the 28-year-old was, according to the report, originally posted on Facebook by his father, John Wilson.

'Very proud of my son, Darren Wilson on his receiving a commendation from his Police Department,' Mr Wilson wrote on February 11. 'Congratulations, son.'

Amid violent protests raging over his son's killing of Brown, Mr Wilson took to Facebook asking his friends for support without mentioning the officer by name. 

'Dear FB [Facebook] friends, our family is in need for prayers to be sent up for a family member,' Mr Wilson wrote. 'Circumstances do not allow for us to say anything further.

'You saw people sitting in the street and they had the chance to get up. And that's how it's going to continue'

Captain Ron Johnson, Missouri State Highway Patrol

'Please pray with our family in mind. Put a covering of protection over our family member please.'

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said on Friday that Officer Wilson was devastated, and that he never meant for it to happen.

He said Officer Wilson encountered Brown and another man on the street during a routine patrol. A confrontation ensued and Officer Wilson fatally shot Brown.

Addressing the volatile situation in Ferguson yesterday, the Governor of Missouri declared a state of emergency and imposed a five-hour curfew. 

He praised the people who have exercised their First Amendment right to protest peacefully and those who 'stood up against violent instigators.'

Calling Friday night's looting 'unacceptable,' Jay Nixon said the town must not allow 'the ill-will of a few to undermine the goodwill of the many.'

Nixon also said the US Department of Justice is increasing the size of its investigation of the shooting.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said there were 40 FBI agents going door-to-door talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting.

Governor Nixon and Captain Johnson spoke at a church in Ferguson, where they were interrupted repeatedly by people demanding justice and objecting to the curfew.
Nixon was speaking at a chaotic and ill-tempered press conference during which he was repeatedly heckled, with members of the public demanding to know why Officer Wilson had not been indicted for the shooting of Michael Brown.

Captain Johnson assured those in attendance that police would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to observe the curfew.

'You saw people sitting in the street and they had the chance to get up,' he said. 'And that's how it's going to continue.'

'All of this is just building up - pent-up aggression by being mistreated on a daily basis'

Keyon Watkins, computer science worker

Despite heavy rainfall and lightning, hundreds of protesters gathered Saturday night at a busy thoroughfare that has been the site of previous clashes with police. Scores of officers, a much more visible presence than the night before, stood watch - including some with shields.

Members of various black community groups were urging people to abide by the curfew, which runs from midnight to 5am today. 

A woman from the New Black Panther Party walked the street telling the crowd: ‘Please, please be out of the area by 12 o'clock.’

Some responded to her pleas by cursing at police, while others acknowledged they planned to leave.

But Keyon Watkins, a 26-year-old computer science worker from St Louis, said that if many others stay in the street, he would join them.

‘All of this is just building up - pent-up aggression by being mistreated on a daily basis,’ Mr Watkins said.

Darrell Alexander, 57, a registered nurse from nearby Florissant, Missouri, worried last night that the curfew might spur anger and more violence.

‘I think it's an antagonistic decision to not allow people to express their freedom of speech. It's an overreaction,’ he said.

By 10pm with two hours until the curfew the atmosphere was tense with dozens of police wearing riot gear lining each side of West Florissant Avenue, where the protests had been taking place all day.

Protesters drove up and down and screamed abuse at the cops or eyeballed the officers as they walked past.

'They got a plan to gas us by midnight and we're gonna go home by midnight and go to church in the morning'

Malik Shabazz, Black Lawyers for Justice

Malik Shabazz, the head of Black Lawyers for Justice, who has spearheaded efforts to control the protesters among the community, walked up and down with a bullhorn imploring 
the crowd of 1,000 to go home.

He said: 'They got a plan to gas us by midnight and we're gonna go home by midnight and go to church in the morning'.

Governor Nixon's curfew announcement came after tensions again flared in Ferguson late Friday night, just hours after Officer Wilson was named as the shooter. 

The officer has been accused by witnesses of shooting the youth even though he had his hands up. 

Ferguson police only disclosed his name after coming under intense pressure and facing lawsuits by civil liberties groups.

Wilson currently lives in Crestwood, a suburb of St Louis which is 94 per cent white and 1.6 per cent black. 

His house is a $180,000 (£110,000) bungalow with a pool and a basketball hoop in the drive on a sleepy street in a neighbourhood that one resident described as 'solidly middle class'.

BILLIONAIRE CO-FOUNDER OF TWITTER JOINS PROTESTERS IN FERGUSON AND LIVE-TWEETS DEMONSTRATION AS CURGEW GOES INTO EFFECT

Twitter co-founder and St Louis native Jack Dorsey joined the protesters in Ferguson yesterday, live-tweeting the rain-soaked demonstration.

An hour before the curfew imposed Saturday by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon went into effect, the 37-year-old billionaire described in detail the situation on the ground in the 
St Louis suburb, which has been rocked by violent protests following the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown at the hands of a white police officer.

'Streets are emptying and questing,' Mr Dorsey wrote from his @Jack account to his 1.6million followers.

Over the course of the last 24 hours, Mr Dorsey, whose net worth hovers around 1.9billion, posted dozens of tweets and 6-second Vine videos showing scenes from the rallies and marches taking place in Ferguson. 

‘Feels good to be home. I'll be standing with everyone in Ferguson all weekend #HandsUpDontShoo,’ the California-based tech mogul tweeted late on Friday as protests in Ferguson turned violent. 

Mr Dorsey was also on hand for Friday’s march to the site of Brown's shooting organized by Reverend Jesse Jackson. 

‘We're here. My whole family! And @2000F,’ Dorsey posted, referring to the Twitter handle of Square co-founder Jim McKelvey.

Mr Dorsey's frequent updates and videos posted through the Twitter-owned video-sharing site Vine followed people in the crowd holding up signs, chanting, playing the drums and raising their hands in the air. 

He also documented a meeting between the protesters and Missouri State Highway Patrol Ron Captain Johnson - a man the Twitter co-founded called an 'amazing and disarming leader.'

The property backs onto a church which reads: 'When our dream roads take strange turns'.

Officer Wilson's mother Tonya died when he was just 16. 

What effect that had on him at that age is unclear, but it appears that he bounced around the St Louis area at a number of addresses and met a girlfriend called Ashley Brown.

Between 2000 and 2004 he attended St Charles West High School where former classmates remembered him as a good hockey player.

Jake Shepard wrote on Facebook: 'He is the nicest guy in the world! He has the biggest heart. He really does. 

'Nobody is ever going to know what really happened, but I can say with certainty that the officers intentions were pure. He is one of those cops that make you appreciate law enforcement.'

At the age of 22, Officer Wilson signed up to join the police. At Officer Wilson’s current home, neighbors are concerned that rioters would come and wreck the street if they found out where he lived. 

A female school teacher told MailOnline: ‘Our neighborhood didn't do anything wrong. I'm worried people are going to come up here and start looting. 

'They just moved in and seemed like nice people. Things are pretty quiet round here'.

Officer Wilson, who has a licence for hunting and for fishing, has a metal American flag in his front lawn and small couch sits on the porch, suggesting that he likes to relax out the front of his house during the warm summer nights.

Nobody answered at the door when MailOnline visited. A husband and wife in their 60s who had lived in the neighbourhood for many years said that it was full of respectable people.

The man said: 'Crime is not really an issue around here. The biggest thing we have to worry about is the occasional party from teenagers but we don't have any at the moment’

He spent four years with the Ferguson police department and two previous years in the Jennings district, NBC's Tom Winter reported.

Neighbors told USA Today that Officer Wilson was 'tall and slim' and was often seen walking his dog.

Another neighbor, Ron Gorski, told USA Today: 'He's a young guy. 'Things happen and it's a complicated situation. I feel for the family and the entire country.'

Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said the shooting had been 'devastating, absolutely devastating' to Officer Wilson, adding: 'We had no complaints about the officer. He was a gentleman. A quiet officer. He has been an effective officer.'

Anger spurred by Brown's death boiled over again Friday night when protesters stormed into a Missouri convenience store - the same store that Brown was accused of robbing - and several other local businesses.

The police response to protesters has been criticized for using military tactics such as tear gas and rubber bullets, and early yesterday morning, St Louis County police were ordered to stand down around 1am by the Missouri Highway Patrol, who took over policing of the protests with Captain Johnson, who is black, at the helm.

City Alderman Antonio French who was on the scene trying to calm the crowd, tweeted that as police were driving away, they shot tear gas into the crowd, further inciting the protesters to anger.

The clashes divided protesters, with a small group apparently responsible for the looting and destruction, and a much larger crowd peacefully banding together to stop them.

Among the stores looted were a beauty supplies shop and a Domino's Pizza. The owners of the beauty store say they will not reopen.

Many witnesses at the scene described the protesters who were protecting the stores from the looters.

'Hundreds in the streets. Only a few dozen attempting to loot. Dozens more physically trying to prevent,' tweeted Wesley Lowery.

At the same news conference in which Officer Wilson was named, Chief Jackson released documents alleging that Brown stole a $48.99 (£30) box of cigars from a convenience store called Ferguson Market and Liquor, then strong-armed a man on his way out.

Just before midnight, some in what had been a large and rowdy but mostly well-behaved crowd broke into that same small store, and began looting it, according to Captain Johnson.

Some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Captain Johnson said. One officer was hurt, but details on the injury were not immediately available. 

Captain Johnson added that police backed off to try and ease the tension. He believes looting may have spread to a couple of nearby stores. No arrests were made.

'We had to evaluate the security of the officers there and also the rioters,' Captain Johnson said. 'We just felt it was better to move back.'

Meanwhile, peaceful protesters yelled at the aggressors to stop what they were doing. About a dozen people eventually blocked off the front of the convenience store to help protect it. 

Andy Banker, a local news reporter, reported that the St. Louis police department only documented the looting five hours after the break-in, and that the store owners are 'furious' as a result.

Brown's death had previously ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. 

Tensions eased on Thursday after Governor Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. 

Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators.

POLICE OFFICER WHO SHOT MICHAEL BROWN WON DEPARTMENT AWARD

The officer who shot Michael Brown won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February, it has been revealed.

Darren Wilson, 28, was nowhere to be seen at his white middle class home in the suburb of Crestwood where he moved just a year ago. 

It was claimed he had left the single-story brick home 'days ago'. No one answered the door when MailOnline knocked on the door and there were two or three police cars parked outside. 

Neighbors told {USA Today}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/""> that he was 'tall and slim' and was often seen walking his dog.

Overheard while one man films the gruesome aftermath of Brown's daylight shooting, the barely discernible audio is of one unseen man recounting the alleged version of events that he saw to another man, off camera, while bystanders scream and shout at police to assist the stricken 18-year-old.

At around the six minute and 30 second mark in the 10 minute long video, one man is just heard over raucous shouting asking another how Brown ended up at least 30-feet away from the police squad car that presumably was being driven by Wilson.

The first man explains to the second man that Brown was there because he had previously been near the police car and run, which contradicts what the teens friend, Dorian 
Johnson, has told police and in interviews.

Johnson has said that Brown was never inside or near Officer Wilson's police car before the shooting.

Johnson alleges that Wilson exited his car and struck 6ft 4inch Brown as he was trying to open the door, setting off the calamitous series of events that ended with Brown running from a shooting Wilson, before turning with his hands raised in surrender before being gunned down.

The audio heard in the video gives a different version of events.

The alleged witness tells the man that Brown apparently had a confrontation with Wilson near to or in his vehicle and ran away.

'Then the next thing I know he doubled back towards him cus (sic) the police had his gun drawn already on him,' according to blog, {Conservative Tree House}<hyperlink=""http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2014/08/15/exceptional-catch-the-jj-witness-video-eye-witness-audio-of-mike-brown-shooting-sharing-brown-doubled-back-toward-police/"">.

The witness then contradicts the now crucial narrative of the how the tragic events unfolded last Saturday.  

Instead of Brown being fired on while his hands were raised in surrender, the witness claims that Brown was moving towards the officer when he was shot.

While this version of events does not match most of the eyewitness accounts, it does seem to tally up in a small part with the account of what occurred given by a friend of Wilson.

Eyewitness: 'Then the next thing I know he doubled back toward him cus - the police had his gun drawn already on him'

'He pulled up ahead of them. And then he got a call-in that there was a strong-arm robbery. And, they gave a description,' said the friend in an interview with {Josie on The Dana Show}<hyperlink=""http://danaloeschradio.com/alleged-friend-of-officer-darren-wilson-offers-his-side/"">. 

'And, he’s looking at them and they got something in their hands and it looks like it could be what, you know those cigars or whatever. So he goes in reverse back to them. 

'Tries to get out of his car. They slam his door shut violently. I think he said Michael did. And, then he opened the car again. He tried to get out. He stands up.

'And then Michael just bum-rushes him and shoves him back into his car. Punches him in the face and them Darren grabs for his gun. Michael grabbed for the gun. At one point he got the gun entirely turned against his hip. 

'And he shoves it away. And the gun goes off.

'Well, then Michael takes off and gets to be about 35 feet away. And, Darren’s first protocol is to pursue. So, he stands up and yells, 'Freeze!# Michael and his friend turn around. 

'And Michael taunts him… And then all the sudden he just started bumrushing him. He just started coming at him full speed. 

'And, so he just started shooting. And, he just kept coming. And, so he really thinks he was on something.'

This new development follows photographs from last Saturday that were taken in the minutes after Brown's death.

They came as Missouri Governor Jay Nixon announced that he has signed an order declaring a state of emergency 'to keep the people safe' and implemented a midnight to 5am curfew in Ferguson on Saturday.

Yahoo News published the photograph of Darren Wilson on their homepage in a report detailing Brown's February commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty'.  

The first photograph of the officer emerged on the same day a new photo of the scene immediately after Brown's shooting emerged. 
With onlookers gathered behind police tape, officers are shown in the picture peering over Brown;s body.

Wilson is now on paid administrative leave following the shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting.

The 28-year-old officer won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' on February of this year.

'He never intended for any of this to happen,' Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson said. 'It’s devastating, absolutely devastating.'

He said Wilson encountered Brown and another man on the street during a routine patrol.

(AP) — The Rev. Al Sharpton called the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in suburban St. Louis a ""defining moment for this country.""

Sharpton spoke Sunday at a rally in Ferguson, where days of protest have ended with almost nightly confrontations between police and protesters.

(AP) — Protesters who have for days lined a busy suburban St. Louis street not far from the place where a white police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager have walked from nearby apartments, driven from neighboring communities and flown in from states hundreds of miles away. Some are young parents carrying infants. 
Others, college students. Retirees. Professionals taking a break from their jobs.

They have chanted, marched, shouted, danced on vehicles and — though most have remained peaceful — also looted and vandalized stores during late-night clashes with armored police who have fired smoke canisters and tear gas into the crowds.

The demonstrators are demanding justice for 18-year-old Michael Brown, which they say can only be accomplished if Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson is charged and convicted for the shooting. Many also cite larger causes.

Some vent frustration about what they describe as a pattern of harassment and intimidation of black residents by police — not just in Ferguson, but in numerous other predominantly low-income minority communities. Others see an opportunity to participate in what they consider a modern civil rights movement.

""Being black in America is basically being born with a target,"" said Keyon Watkins, a 26-year-old college graduate with a computer science degree who joined in the protests on a late weekend night. ""All of this is just built-up, pent-up aggression by being mistreated on a daily basis.""

As Watkins stood on the curb of West Florissant Avenue, a parade of vehicles slowly passed by — some with teenagers dancing atop the hoods, some blaring music profaning police, many honking their horns in what has become a sounding call for the protest.

On another night, the rap musician Stackz drove up in a new white Corvette, parked it in the street and joined in the protest. Though he now lives in Atlanta, he grew up in the neighborhood.

""This happened right in my area. It was a must to be here,"" said Stackz, who said his real name was Demarco Williams.

Police say Brown had been walking with a friend down nearby Canfield Drive when Wilson stopped them because they were in the middle of the street. They say a scuffle ensued, 
Wilson was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as Wilson fired multiple rounds.

So the protesters chant ""Hands up! Don't shoot!"" while raising their own arms. They write the words on posters, and print them on T-shirts.

Some of the protesters said they previously had been shot by police, or know relatives and friends who had been. Michael Johnson, 42, lifted up his shirt to show the scars on his torso that he said he received when he was shot by a St. Louis police officer at age 18, during a confrontation that he said never resulted in charges against him or the officer. Because of the injuries, he said, he had to abandon his dream of joining the Marines.

""That one night cost me my whole future,"" said Johnson, standing in front of a looted and burnt-out convenience store. ""If I got to die tonight, I don't mind ... I'm dying for a cause.""

There have been no reports of protesters dying in their clashes with police.

After several tumultuous nights, police tried to change their tactics. State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson took command of security from local authorities and walked the 
streets side-by-side with the protesters. So did celebrity civil rights activists, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

The festive atmosphere lasted only one night, and protests again turned violent during the weekend, prompting Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to declare a state of emergency and impose a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew in Ferguson. Some who defied the curfew clashed again with police early Sunday, but Johnson again encouraged peaceful demonstrations for the nights to come.

LaVon Stennis-Williams flew in from Omaha, Nebraska, to join the protest with her daughter who is attending law school at Saint Louis University. Stennis-Williams, 52, wanted to experience the civil rights movement that she had heard about as a child in the 1960s.

""I felt like it was an obligation to come here and be a part of this,"" she said. ""Maybe this will be a catalyst of change in this country to get people to become more tolerant and more respectful of their civil rights.""",NA,NA,NA,NA
DailyMail,daily92,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2727183/Obama-heading-DC-rare-vacation-break.html,Obama races back to Washington in rare vacation break from Martha's Vineyard for mystery talks with advisors,Associated Press,8/17/2014,1/1/2016,"President Barack Obama is getting off the island.

In a rare move for him, the president planned a break in the middle of his Martha's Vineyard vacation to return to Washington on Sunday night for meetings with Vice President 

Joe Biden and other advisers on the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and tensions between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.

The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions. He's received multiple briefings on both issues while on vacation.

The White House had also already announced Obama's plans to return to Washington before the U.S. airstrikes in Iraq began and before the shooting of a teen in Ferguson that sparked protests.

Part of the decision to head back to Washington appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises.

Yet those crises turned the first week of Obama's vacation into a working holiday. He made on-camera statements Iraq and the clashes in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb.

He also called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas.

'I think it's fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that's why you've seen the president stay engaged,' White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.

Obama returned from his break along with his 16-year-old daughter Mailia, but is scheduled to return to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend.

In a first for Obama family summer vacations, neither teenager is spending the entire holiday with her father.

Obama left Washington Aug. 9 with his wife, Michelle, daughter Malia, and the family's two Portuguese water dogs. The White House said 13-year-old Sasha would join her parents at a later date for ""part of their stay"" on this quaint island of shingled homes. But Malia will not be around when her younger sister arrives.

The daughters essentially are trading places, and the vacation is boiling down to Obama getting about a week with each one.

Malia returned to Washington with her father and is not expected to go back to Martha's Vineyard. The White House said Sasha will join her parents this week, without saying when she will arrive or what kept her away last week, or why Malia left the island.

Obama often draws chuckles from sympathetic parents who understand his complaints about his girls' lack of interest in spending time with him.

'What I'm discovering is that each year, I get more excited about spending time with them. They get a little less excited,' Obama told CNN last year.

Even though work has occupied much of Obama's first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island.

He hit the golf course one more time Sunday ahead of his departure, joining two aides and former NBA player Alonzo Mourning for an afternoon round. He then joined wife 
Michelle for an evening jazz performance featuring singer Rachelle Ferrell.

Obama's vacation has also been infused with a dose of politics. He headlined a fundraiser on the island for Democratic Senate candidates and attended a birthday party for 
Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan's wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

That get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama's vacation.

Ty Pruitt said that the mental picture of Michael Brown surrendering was stuck in his relatives’ minds as it showed he was ‘killed like an animal’.

Pruitt spoke out at an emotional Sunday church service during which Brown’s mother Lesley McSpadden sobbed and wiped the tears away from her eyes with a tissue. 

His father Michael Brown Sr stood grim faced whilst wearing a T-shirt with his son’s picture on it and the slogan: ‘No Justice, No Peace’.

The service was the first time the family had attended church on a Sunday since the death of Brown, 18, who was killed on August 9th.

He was shot in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, by officer Darren Wilson, 28, even though witnesses claim he had his hands up and was giving up.

Brown's death has sparked seven nights of protests and rioting in Ferguson after it ignited long standing racial tensions between African American residents and the mostly white police force.

Protesters around the world have been putting their hands up and chanting: ‘Hands up, don’t shoot’ in what has become their trademark gesture.

The service at a the Greater Grace church just north of Ferguson was packed with 1,000 people and another 500 outside who were unable to get in.

Among the guests was Missouri State Highway Patrol captain Ron Johnson, who is in charge of policing the riots, and civil rights campaigner Rev Jesse Jackson.

McSpadden sat next to Brown Sr, her ex-husband, wearing sunglasses, a white shirt and dark trousers. On their right was the Rev Al Sharpton.

Addressing the crowd Pruitt, Brown's cousin, said: ‘What I want you all to remember is that Michael Brown was not just some young black boy. He was a human being, he was a younger cousin, he was a son, he was an uncle, a nephew, he was not a suspect, he was not an object, he was not an animal - but that’s how he was killed.’  

Holding his hands up, he said: ‘This was the last action that our family member made before he went to rest.

‘This will be stuck in my family’s memories for the rest of our lives’.

The family were also represented by their lawyer Benjamin Crump, who was the attorney for relatives of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot dead in Florida by a neighbourhood watch coordinator.

Crump told the crowd that there was ‘nothing that can justify the execution style murder in broad daylight’ of Brown.

He also accused the Ferguson police department of trying to ‘smear’ Brown by putting out a CCTV video that apparently showed him robbing cigars from a grocery store minutes before he was killed.

As Brown Sr cheered, Crump said: ‘They tried it with Trayvon, now they’re trying it with Michael.’  

The service came against a background of ongoing unrest in Ferguson.

On Saturday night Missouri governor Jay Nixon imposed a midnight curfew but a crowd of 200 defied the order and stayed on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson.

Heavily armed SWAT teams fired on them with tear gas and caused them to run into the nearby housing estate.

During his speech Johnson won three standing ovations and addressed Brown's family directly.

He said: 'My heart goes out to you. I wear this uniform and I should stand up here and say that I'm sorry'.

Thomas Jackson, the embattled Ferguson police chief, has so far refused to apologise.",315,NA,NA,NA

(AP) — A timeline of key events following the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri.

AUG. 9 — Brown and a companion are confronted by an officer as they walk back to Brown's home from a convenience store. Brown and the officer are involved in some kind of scuffle, followed by gunshots. Brown dies at the scene.

AUG. 10 — After a candlelight vigil, people protesting Brown's death smash car windows and carry away armloads of looted goods from stores. In the first of several nights of violence, looters are seen making off with bags of food, toilet paper and alcohol. Some protesters stand atop police cars and taunt officers.

AUG. 11 — The FBI opens an investigation into Brown's death, and two men who said they saw the shooting tell reporters that Brown had his hands raised when the officer approached with his weapon and fired repeatedly. That night, police in riot gear fire tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse a crowd.

AUG. 12 — Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson cancels plans to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing death threats against the police department and City Hall. 
The Rev. Al Sharpton and President Barack Obama both plead for calm after two nights of clashes between police and protesters.

AUG. 13 — Another night of violence wracks Ferguson, with some people lobbing Molotov cocktails and other objects at police, who respond with smoke bombs and tear gas. Two reporters are detained at a McDonald's. Images of the standoff, showing police using armored vehicles and pointing assault rifles at the crowds, are widely shared on social media.

AUG. 14 — The Missouri Highway Patrol takes control of security in Ferguson, relieving local police of their law-enforcement authority after four days of violence. Within hours, the mood among protesters becomes lighter, even festive. The streets are filled with music, free food and even laughter.

AUG. 15 — Police identify the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old man who had patrolled the St. Louis suburbs for six years. They also release a video purporting to show Brown robbing a convenience store of almost $50 worth of cigars shortly before he was killed. The video draws anger from protesters. After nightfall, officers and the crowds clash again. Some people in the crowd storm into the same convenience store that Brown was accused of robbing and loot it.

AUG. 16 — Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declares a state of emergency and imposes a curfew in Ferguson. The first night of the curfew ends with tear gas and seven arrests, after police in riot gear use armored vehicles to disperse defiant protesters who refused to leave.

FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on a black Missouri teenager whose fatal shooting by a white police officer has spurred a week of rancorous and sometimes-violent protests in suburban St. Louis.

The ""extraordinary circumstances"" surrounding the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown and a request by Brown's family members prompted the order, Department of Justice 
spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.

""This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,"" Fallon said. ""Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-
performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.""

As night fell Sunday in Ferguson, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated after marchers pushed toward one end of a street. Police attempted to push them back by firing 
tear gas, shouting over a bullhorn that the protest was no longer peaceful.

Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley.

Missouri police shooting draws protesters from near and far, highlights larger frustrations

FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Protesters who have for days lined a busy suburban St. Louis street not far from the place where a white police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager have walked from nearby apartments, driven from neighboring communities and flown in from states hundreds of miles away. Some are young parents carrying infants. 
Others, college students. Retirees. Professionals taking a break from their jobs.

They have chanted, marched, shouted, danced on vehicles and — though most have remained peaceful — also looted and vandalized stores during late-night clashes with armored police who have fired smoke canisters and tear gas into the crowds.

The demonstrators are demanding justice for 18-year-old Michael Brown, which they say can only be accomplished if Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson is charged and convicted for the shooting. Many also cite larger causes.

Some vent frustration about what they describe as a pattern of harassment and intimidation of black residents by police — not just in Ferguson, but in numerous other predominantly low-income minority communities. Others see an opportunity to participate in what they consider a modern civil rights movement.

""Being black in America is basically being born with a target,"" said Keyon Watkins, a 26-year-old college graduate with a computer science degree who joined in the protests on a late weekend night. ""All of this is just built-up, pent-up aggression by being mistreated on a daily basis.""

Helped by US and Iraqi airstrikes, Kurdish forces retake parts of dam from Islamic extremists

IRBIL, Iraq (AP) — Aided by U.S. and Iraqi airstrikes, Kurdish forces Sunday wrested back part of Iraq's largest dam from Islamic militants who had captured it less than two weeks ago, security officials said.

The U.S. began targeting fighters from the Islamic State with airstrikes Aug. 8, allowing Kurdish forces to fend off an advance on their regional capital of Irbil and to help tens of thousands of members of religious minorities escape the extremists' onslaught.

Recapturing the entire Mosul Dam and the territory surrounding its reservoir would be a significant victory against the Islamic State group, which has seized swaths of northern and western Iraq and northeastern Syria. The dam on the Tigris supplies electricity and water to a large part of the country.

The Kurdish forces, known as peshmerga, launched the operation early Sunday to retake the Mosul Dam, said Gen. Tawfik Desty, a Kurdish commander, after a day of U.S. and Iraqi airstrikes pushed back Islamic State fighters.

A spokesman for the peshmerga said the clashes were moving eastward.

As Gaza cease-fire talks wind down, divisions emerge among Palestinians

CAIRO (AP) — The Palestinians appeared divided Sunday as the clock was winding down on the latest Gaza cease-fire, with officials saying Hamas was still opposed to a compromise Egyptian proposal that would ease the closure of the territory, while other factions, including delegates representing President Mahmoud Abbas, were inclined to accept.

Hamas officials said they were holding out in hopes of getting more concessions in the Egyptian-mediated talks. With a temporary truce set to expire late Monday, a range of outcomes remained possible, including a return to fighting that has brought great devastation to Gaza, an unofficial understanding that falls short of a formal negotiated deal or yet another extension in negotiations.

The negotiations are aimed at ending the latest war between Israel and Hamas-led militants in Gaza. Nearly 2,000 Palestinians have been killed — mostly civilians — and more than 10,000 people have been wounded since the war began July 8, according to United Nations figures. In Israel, 67 people have been killed, all but three of them soldiers.

The indirect talks have been going on, through Egyptian mediators, since early last week. As Palestinian and Israeli negotiators returned to Cairo on Sunday following a weekend of consultations across the Middle East, the gaps remained wide.

The current five-day cease-fire is due to end Monday night at midnight (2100 GMT).

Ukraine says government troops have entered rebel-held city, captured police station

KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — Army troops have penetrated deep inside a rebel-controlled city in eastern Ukraine in what could prove a breakthrough development in the four-month-long conflict, the Ukrainian government said Sunday.

However, the military acknowledged that another one of its fighter planes was shot down by the separatists, who have been bullish about their ability to continue the battle and have bragged about receiving support from Russia. An Associated Press reporter spotted a column of several dozen heavy vehicles, including tanks and at least one rocket launcher, rolling through rebel-held territory on Sunday.

Talks in Berlin between the foreign ministers of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France aimed at finding a political solution to the conflict ended without any substantial result.

Ukraine's national security council said government forces captured a district police station in Luhansk on Saturday after bitter clashes in the Velika Vergunka neighborhood.
Weeks of fighting have taken their toll on Luhansk, which city authorities say has reached the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe. The siege mounted by government forces has ground delivery of basic provisions to a halt and cut off power and running water.

Elderly women sexually enslaved by Japan in WWII hope for solace, help from pope

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Lee Yong-soo hopes a meeting Monday with Pope Francis will provide some solace for the pain that still feels fresh more than seven decades after 
Japanese soldiers forced her into prostitution during World War II.

Lee, 86, and a group of other elderly former ""comfort women"" will sit in the front row during the last Mass of the pope's five-day trip to South Korea. Francis cannot solve a long-running grievance that has become a major hurdle to better ties between neighbors and U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, but the women are looking for greater global attention as they push Japan for a new apology and compensation. They also want a chance to share with the pope their feelings on the brutality they suffered as girls.

""If we do get a chance to speak with him, I want to cling to him in tears and ask him to help us resolve our pain,"" Lee, a devout Catholic who was 15 when forced into sexual slavery, said by telephone. ""I want to ask him to help us end this problem in a peaceful way.""

Time is running out. Only 55 of the 238 women registered as official victims of sexual slavery survive, according to Seoul's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family website. 
Their average age is 88. Two have died this year.

Lee and other victims regularly speak to the media about their grievances against Japan, and some of the women give public testimony in Japan and the United States and take part in protests. A weekly demonstration in their honor has been held in Seoul for more than 20 years.

Another Ebola problem: How to prevent new outbreaks without knowing the virus's natural source

A scary problem lurks beyond the frenzied efforts to keep people from spreading Ebola: No one knows exactly where the virus comes from or how to stop it from seeding new outbreaks.

Ebola has caused two dozen outbreaks in Africa since it first emerged in 1976. It is coming from somewhere — probably bats — but experts agree they need to pinpoint its origins in nature.

That has had to wait until they can tame the current outbreak, which has claimed more than 1,100 lives in four countries — the worst toll from Ebola in history.

""First and foremost get the outbreak under control. Once that piece is resolved, then go back and find what the source is,"" said Jonathan Towner, a scientist who helped find the bat source of another Ebola-like disease called Marburg. Towner works for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Others say finding Ebola's origins is more than a down-the-road scientific curiosity.

Underdogs in Alaska's GOP Senate primary counting on campaign touches unique to Last Frontier

EAGLE RIVER, Alaska (AP) — Wearing a fleece vest with his name and the logo of the northwestern city of Nome, Lt. Gov Mead Treadwell walked through this Anchorage suburb on a recent night, demonstrating how Alaska's unique political culture makes the outcome of Tuesday's GOP Senate primary anybody's guess.

In this remote and lightly-populated state, where residents refer to the Lower 48 as ""outside,"" personal connections and loyalty to Alaska matter. Treadwell and tea party favorite Joe Miller are counting on the personal, Alaska touch to level the playing field against front-runner Dan Sullivan. The former state attorney general, a relative newcomer in state politics, is backed by national GOP powerbrokers like Karl Rove and has raised $4.2 million, nearly four times as much as either rival.

As he reminds virtually every voter he's met, Treadwell has lived in Alaska for 40 years. Rather than just relying on voter-targeting data, he knocked on doors picked by a 21-year-old intern who had gone to the local high school and knew most of the families in the subdivision. Treadwell didn't even need to make his pitch when attorney Dan Collins opened his door.

""I guess you've got to work hard when you're fighting the outsiders,"" Collins, an attorney, told Treadwell, pledging his vote before the lieutenant governor headed on to the next house.

Sullivan is countering Treadwell and Miller's homespun approach with television ads that have run for months and a sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation that includes statewide field offices, a robust roster of paid staff with national political experience and his own cadre of local volunteers. The contrast in styles will be tested Tuesday in the state's primary, with the winner expected to face Democratic Sen. Mark Begich in November. Begich faces no serious primary challenger.

Obama administration pressed to enforce anti-discrimination provisions of health care law

WASHINGTON (AP) — Ending insurance discrimination against the sick was a central goal of the nation's health care overhaul, but leading patient groups say that promise is being undermined by new barriers from insurers.

The insurance industry responds that critics are confusing legitimate cost-control with bias. Some state regulators, however, say there's reason to be concerned about policies that shift costs to patients and narrow their choices of hospitals and doctors.

With open enrollment for 2015 three months away, the Obama administration is being pressed to enforce the Affordable Care Act's anti-discrimination provisions. Some regulations have been issued; others are pending after more than four years.

More than 300 patient advocacy groups recently wrote Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell to complain about some insurer tactics that ""are highly discriminatory against patients with chronic health conditions and may ... violate the (law's) nondiscrimination provisions.""

At the rally, attended by around 150 people, protesters walked around wearing specially printed T-shirts which were sold for $7 with a police shield on which was the words: ‘I stand by Darren Wilson’.

Instead of a badge number it read 8.9.14 - the day he killed 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Two Facebook pages in support of Wilson, 28, have also sprung up with a combined total of 35,000 likes.

Supporters have also set up a GoFundMe site for raising money for Wilson which raised $1,500 towards a goal of $5,000 to pay for his legal fees in just two hours.

Witnesses claim that Wilson, a six year veteran with the police in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, killed Brown even though he was unarmed and had his hands in the air.

The rally on Sunday afternoon was called on the steps on St Louis TV station KDSK because Wilson’s supporters were unhappy they had broadcast details about Wilson’s home.

A handful of Brown’s supporters stood on the other side of the road holding up signs which read: ‘Killer Cops: Don’t Shoot’ and ‘Ferguson Police are harboring a fugitive’.

The pro-Wilson side of the road was made up largely of people who work or have worked in law enforcement, or relatives of police officers.

John Newsham, 55, a retired St Louis County police detective, said: ‘The coverage so far has been biased and against the officer.

‘They can make it a black white thing, but it’s not. It should be about the rule of law’.

During the rally the protesters passed around a giant card on which they wrote messages like: ‘Stay Strong’ and ‘The Blue Line Forever’.

They also cheered every time somebody honked their horn as they drove past as a gesture of support.

The wife of a St Louis County policeman told MailOnline that she was angry because officers has been deployed to cope with the protests which put other units under strain.

This meant her husband had been working 12 hour days and an 100 hour week which left her with no support to look after their four children.

With school starting this week and their daughter going to college, it was hard to cope when her husband was exhausted.

Todd Brayfied, 34, a pipe repairer, said: ‘I think that he’s (Wilson) been tried and convicted of being a murderer.

‘I’ve seen 15 different eyewitnesses and they have 15 different accounts. Bits and pieces match up but they are not the same.’

Martin Baker, 44, a consultant, said: ‘I come here to support Darren and support both sides of the story.

‘I have respect for the police. Here in America we are a society of law and order. You must maintain law and order or you will become a community that is reckless and doesn’t care’.

The two Facebook pages are I Support Darren Wilson and Support Darren Wilson, which organized the protest.

The woman who had organized the protest said that she did it as a ‘show of support for Darren’. She declined to give her name.

The crowd quietly dispersed at 7pm.",86,NA,NA,NA

In a statement, Nixon said the National Guard would help 'in restoring peace and order' to the St. Louis suburb that has been filled almost nightly with angry, defiant crowds since 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed August 9.

'These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served and to feel safe in their own homes,' Nixon said.

The National Guard had been on standby in Ferguson on Sunday as the suburb erupted into yet another night of clashes between police and protesters angry at the shooting of an unarmed black teenager.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ordered paramilitary units into the St Louis suburb on Saturday to help 'in restoring peace and order' to Ferguson, where protests continued over the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer.

Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on Sunday night in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails. 

'These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory and to the people of this community,' Governor Nixon said in a statement. 

The National Guard is a reserve military force, and its deployment marks a serious escalation of the crackdown on dissent in Ferguson, a mainly black suburb of St Louis.

Last night brought another night of protests and violence in Ferguson, as tensions remained high over Brown's killing.

The violence began to flare again around 9pm local time - three hours before the beginning of the midnight curfew - as police in riot gear fired tear gas on hundreds of protestors including children for encroaching on their command post. 

Authorities also used rubber bullets with several protesters reported being hit and a total of eight people being arrested.

Later it was announced that all schools in the Ferguson-Florissant district are to remain closed on Monday.

Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol said a number of shooting incidents between the protesters themselves left at least three people injured.

AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL TAKES 'UNPRECEDENTED' STEP OF SENDING HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORS TO FERGUSON FOR FIRST TIME EVER IN THE US

Amnesty International has taken the 'unprecedented' step of deploying human rights observers in Ferguson in the midst of the heavy police crackdown on protests against the killing of Michael Brown.

A spokesman for Amnesty in the UK told MailOnline on Monday that colleagues in the U.S. had been on the scene in the St Louis suburb since Thursday 'and will be there indefinitely'.

It is understood to be the first time that the human rights group, which usually campaigns against abuses in third-world dictatorships, has deployed such a team in the U.S.

Amnesty International USA’s executive director, Steven Hawkins, on Saturday slammed the decision to impose a curfew on Ferguson after a week of protests and clashes with heavily armed police. 

'We criticise dictators for quelling dissent and silencing protestors with tactics like curfews, we’ll certainly speak out when it’s happening in our own backyard,' he was quoted as saying by BuzzFeed.

'The people of Ferguson have the right to protest peacefully the lack of accountability for Michael Brown’s shooting.'

Jasmine Heiss, a senior campaigner with Amnesty and part of the team in Ferguson, told BuzzFeed the 'cross functional' team included community trainers, researchers and human rights observers.

A dispatch from Ferguson posted on Amnesty USA's blog said the team's goal would be to 'observe police and protester activity, gather testimony, meet with officials, and offer support to the community.'

Rachel O’Leary, the group's acting deputy executive director for membership mobilisation, wrote: 'Amnesty International’s contribution is around standing with the community in 
Ferguson and lifting up the voices of the people who are working on human rights and social justice on the ground.

'Our human rights delegation, all 13 of us, are proud and honoured to stand with the community organizers, leaders, healers, and elders in Ferguson to demand justice and an end to the pervasive discrimination and violence that people of color face when interacting with police.'        

At around dusk on Sunday, hundreds of protesters including young children fled to safety after police wearing gas masks and body armour fired canisters of smoke to scatter them hours ahead of a planned midnight curfew.

A crowd of about 400 appeared to be marching peacefully, and included numerous families with children, when they were subjected to rounds of smoke canisters.

'The smoke bombs were completely unprovoked,' said Anthony Ellis, 45. 'It (the protest) was led by kids on bikes. Next you know, they're saying, ""Go home, Go home!""'

The Missouri Highway Patrol said 'aggressors"" were trying to infiltrate a law enforcement command post and that armoured vehicles were deployed to ensure public safety.

'We ordered them back. We ordered them back again. After several attempts, we utilized the smoke to disperse these individuals,' said Highway Patrol Corporal Justin Wheetley.

He later said that at least one Molotov cocktail had been thrown at police, although some witnesses said those were tear gas canisters being thrown back at police.

'Molotov cocktails were thrown, there were shootings, looting, vandalism, and other acts of violence that clearly appear not to have been spontaneous,' State Highway Patrol 
Captain Ron Johnson told a late night news briefing. 'I had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response.'                       

Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley of tear gas.

A McDonald's restaurant, which has been surrounded by protests in recent days, subsequently had its windows smashed in, and staff were forced to lock themselves in a store room for their own safety.

Protesters also set up a makeshift barricade using a line cinder blocks placed across the pavement near a QuikTrip convenience store that was burned down last week, following the August 9 killing of Michael Brown.

The barricade was an apparent attempt to block police vehicles, but the vehicles ploughed through with ease. Someone set a nearby rubbish bin on fire, and gunshots rang out several blocks away.

Martin McDonald, 38, a truck driver from the town of Florissant who joined the protests for the first time on Sunday, told the LA Times that he found the police response 'unbelievable'.

'This is something you would see on TV in a third-world country,' he said. 'Tear gas — I’ve never seen it escalate to that point.'

Nikki Chamberlain, 36, was angry that the police had responded so violently to protesters hours before the midnight curfew was due to come into force.

'They should have let people be. It’s not even 12 yet,' she told the LA Times. 'It’s like they didn’t give us a chance.'

The paper described her watching as a young man hurled a still-smoking canister back at advancing police. 'Good,' she said to the reporter. 'Give them a taste of their own medicine.'

Within two hours, most people had been cleared off West Florissant Avenue, one of the community's main thoroughfares, where officers said the majority of the disturbances had taken place - including multiple shooting incidents between the protesters themselves, which left at least three injured.

The streets remained empty as the curfew began. It was to remain in effect until 5 am.

Speaking last night at a press conference after protesters left the streets, Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol said: 'Today, a Sunday that started with prayers and messages of unity, peace and justice took a very different turn after dark'

'Molotov cocktails were thrown, there were shootings, looting, vandalism and other acts of violence that clearly appear not to have been spontaneous - but premeditated criminal acts designed to damage property, hurt people and provoke a response’,' he added.

'The catalyst was not civil disobedience but pre-planned aggression - coordinated in many cases...when we saw violent acts - including shootings, the throwing of Molotov cocktails and the destruction of businesses - we had to act to protect lives and property,' Captain Johnson went on.

Captain Johnson went on to detail the timeline of the disorder as follows:

8.25: A civilian is shot by protesters on West Florissant Avenue. Additional officers move into the area to move the victim to a safe place where he can recieve treatment.

8.26: Shots are fired to the north-east on Canfield Drive.

8.27: Reports come in of a subject down.

8.28: There was a report of eight people standing in the area brandishing guns. Tactical polcie teams were dispatched.

8.56: Hundreds of protesters marched south along West Florissant Avenue towards the Northland Shopping Center. As a crowd approached the shopping centre, multiple Molotov cocktails are thrown at police. Police respond by firing tear gas and calling in support from area police agencies.

9.15: A call comes in reporting a large crowd gathering at a McDonalds on West Florissant Avenue.

9.20: Reports come in to say the McDonalds restaurant has been overrun by looters and staff have been forced to lock themselves in the store room for their own safety. As police arrive, police are shot at and have multiple Molotov cocktails thrown at them. Protesters also set up a makeshift barricade.

Another night of clashes had continued despite Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declaring a state of emergency and imposing a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew on Saturday.

Residents in Ferguson have been holding demonstrations every night since 18-year-old Brown was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson. 

Earlier on Sunday, a church service for Michael Brown had been held by his family and attended by speakers including Jesse Jackson.

A preliminary private autopsy performed on Sunday found that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, reports the {New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?_r=1"">.

'This is bound to escalate tensions,' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said. 'This is a very provocative report.'

Police on Saturday night used smoke and tear gas on protestors who ignored the midnight curfew. At least seven people were arrested, and another man was shot and critically wounded.

Officers are seeking the person who shot the critically-wounded victim after the 12am-5am curfew took hold - eight days after Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by police.

DailyMail,daily99,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2727572/Teen-shot-6-times-including-twice-head.html,"Teen shot 6 times, including twice in head",Associated Press,8/17/2014,1/2/2016,"NEW YORK (AP) — An unarmed black teenager killed by a white officer in Missouri was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, a preliminary private autopsy has found.

The New York Times reported (http://nyti.ms/1mZThz0 ) that the autopsy by Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, found that one of the bullets entered the top of Michael Brown's skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when he suffered a fatal injury.

Baden said it was likely the last of bullets to hit Brown, 18, whose death has spurred a week of rancorous protests in Ferguson, in suburban St. Louis.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. 
Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

Baden told the Times that Brown was also shot four times in the right arm and that all the bullets were fired into his front. The newspaper said the bullets did not appear to have come from very close range because there was no gunpowder on his body.

That determination could change if there were residue on Brown's clothing, which Baden did not examine, the newspaper said.

Some of the bullets entered and exited Brown several times, the newspaper said, including one that caused at least five wounds. It said one shattered his right eye, went through his face, left through his jaw and re-entered his collarbone. The last two shots in the head would have stopped him in his tracks and were likely the last fired, the Times said.

Baden told the newspaper Brown would not have survived even if he had been taken to a hospital immediately.

Baden did not return a message left by The Associated Press earlier Sunday.

Earlier Sunday, Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on Brown, citing the ""extraordinary circumstances"" surrounding his death and a request by Brown's family.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Then county reveals he had pot in his system,Ashley Collman; Louise Boyle,8/17/2014,1/2/2016,"Michael Brown died from a 'kill shot' to the top of the head, a renowned medical examiner revealed today - but could have survived his five other bullet wounds.

Dr Michael Baden, who was asked by the family to perform an independent autopsy, told a press conference in Ferguson, Missouri on Monday he reassured the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, that her son had not suffered. 

The family's autopsy, which was released on Sunday, revealed the unarmed 18-year-old had been shot at least six times by police officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis suburb on August 9.

Family lawyer Benjamin Crump described the teen's death as an 'execution in broad daylight'. He said it was important for the family to have their own autopsy results as they did not trust the work of the local police.

Ms McSpadden had just one question for her lawyers and medical examiners: 'What else do we need to get them to arrest the killer of my child?'

Dr Baden said the number of shots Michael Brown had suffered could have been revealed on day one of the investigation as withholding the information causes the family more pain. 

The doctor, a former chief medical examiner for New York City, said: 'We can answer those questions on day one... telling the family on day one, can be helpful in a trying time.'

Attorney Daryl Parks said that the shot which killed Michael supported eye-witness reports that his head was in the downward position, trying to surrender to the officer.

Shawn Parcells, a forensic pathologist who assisted Dr Baden, used an anatomical diagram to explain each of the six shots they found.

The 18-year-old was shot twice in the head and four times on the arm. 

One bullet entered and exited Brown several times. That shot struck the teen above the right eyeball, went through his face, left through his jaw and re-entered his collarbone. 

It is believed that five of the shots hit Brown on the front of his body.

However Parcells said that the gunshot wound to Brown's forearm appeared to be consistent with someone walking away or putting their arms up in a surrender or defensive manner before adding, 'but we don't know'. 

Following the family's press conference on Monday, St Louis County medical examiner Mary Case said Brown had suffered between six and eight gunshot wounds and was shot from the front. 

The teenager also had marijuana in his system when he died, a source told {The Washington Post}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/county-investigation-michael-brown-was-shot-from-the-front-had-marijuana-in-his-system/?wpisrc=al_national_p"">.

Family attorney Benjamin Crump said during a TV interview on Monday morning that the family had ordered an independent autopsy because they did not trust local law enforcement. 

He said: 'They did not want to rely on the autopsy from St Louis law enforcement officials who they believe executed their son in broad daylight.

'Our clients understood that relying on the police autopsy was not a good thing.'

The Department of Justice is currently conducting a third autopsy on Michael Brown. 

Brown's mother wept today as she spoke out following the devastating autopsy results which were released on Sunday.

Lesley McSpadden appeared on {GMA}<hyperlink=""https://gma.yahoo.com/""> on Monday along with attorney Benjamin Crump who said the family were deeply troubled by the independent autopsy results.

Mr Crump said: 'The witnesses were telling the truth. Michael Brown Jr was shot multiple times and most troubling was the head shot.'

Ms McSpadden had asked that autopsy questions not be directed to her. 

She wept as she said: 'We want justice... being fair.'

When asked by GMA anchor Robin Roberts what would bring justice for the family, Ms McSpadden replied: 'Arresting this man and making him accountable for his actions.'   

The autopsy was conducted by Dr Michael M Baden, the former chief medical examiner for New York City. Baden has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

While Dr Baden did not comment on the heated debate surrounding Wilson's actions, he did say the sheer amount of gun shots was out of the ordinary.

'In my capacity as the forensic examiner for the New York State Police, I would say, ""You’re not supposed to shoot so many times,""' Dr Baden told the {New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&smid=tw-nytimes"">. 'Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.'

The newspaper said the bullets did not appear to have come from very close range because there was no gunpowder on his body.

St Louis County Police released preliminary results of their autopsy, {KSDK}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/12/michael-brown-preliminary-autopsy-results/13961385/""> reported. The report concluded that the teen died of gunshot wounds but would not specify how many bullets had hit the teenager. 

The autopsy, which was conducted the day after the teen died, is preliminary. No further details about Brown's death will be released by police until toxicology results become available in the next four weeks. 

The results of the post-mortem examination emerged as Missouri's governor ordered the state National Guard into Ferguson after it was convulsed by yet another night of clashes between police and protesters.

Governor Jay Nixon said the National Guard would help 'in restoring peace and order' to Ferguson, where protests continued last night.

Police said they fired tear gas and rubber bullets in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails. 

'These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served and to feel safe in their own homes,' Nixon said in a statement. 

The National Guard is a reserve military force, and its deployment marks a serious escalation of the crackdown on dissent in Ferguson, which has a majority African-American population.

Dr Baden's post-mortem examination found Brown was shot a total of six times, with four bullet wounds in his right arm and two in his head.

The final shot appears to have entered Brown's head at the top of the skull suggesting his head was bowed down at the time.

'This one here looks like his head was bent downward,' he said of the wound at the top of Brown's skull. 'It can be because he’s giving up, or because he’s charging forward at the officer.'

Dr Baden, 80, is one of only 400 board-certified forensic pathologists in the country and he has reviewed autopsies for both President John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. 

He has performed 20,000 autopsies and hosted the HBO show Autopsy.

He criticized authorities in St Louis county for keeping details of Brown's death concealed - which has only made the community more enraged.

'People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day One,' Dr. Baden said.

'They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.'

Considering the sensitivity around Brown's death, Dr Baden decided to waive his usual $10,000 fee.

The Brown family's attorney, Benjam L Crump, paid to fly Dr Baden out on Sunday to perform the autopsy at Austin A Layne Mortuary.

He says the autopsy results prove that Wilson's actions were unjustified.

'The sheer number of bullets and the way they were scattered all over his body showed this police officer had a brazen disregard for the very people he was supposed to protect in that community,' Mr. Crump said.

'We want to make sure people understand what this case is about: This case is about a police officer executing a young unarmed man in broad daylight.'

Following Brown's death, Ferguson has become a hot-bed of protest, and the Rev Jesse Jackson thinks the latest autopsy results will only lead to more outrage. 

'This is bound to escalate tensions,' Rev Jackson told CNN. 'This is a very provocative report.' 

Dr Baden consulted with the St Louis County Medical Examiner before performing his autopsy.

Brown's body is expected to undergo a total of three autopsies, with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder scheduling a rare extra examination by the Justice Department.

The Ferguson Police Department has not commented on the latest autopsy results.",555,NA,NA,NA
DailyMail,daily101,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2727570/Obama-heads-DC-rare-vacation-break.html,Obama heads back to DC in rare vacation break,Associated Press,8/18/2014,1/2/2016,"EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) — President Barack Obama is getting off the island.

In a rare move for him, the president took a break in the middle of his Martha's Vineyard vacation to return to Washington just after midnight Monday for meetings with Vice 
President Joe Biden and other advisers on the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and tensions between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.

The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions. He's received multiple briefings on both issues while on vacation. 
The White House had also already announced Obama's plans to return to Washington before the U.S. airstrikes in Iraq began and before the shooting of a teen in Ferguson that sparked protests.

Part of the decision to head back to Washington appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises.

Yet those crises turned the first week of Obama's vacation into a working holiday. He made on-camera statements Iraq and the clashes in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. He also called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas.

""I think it's fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that's why you've seen the president stay engaged,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.

Obama is scheduled to return to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend.

Even though work has occupied much of Obama's first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island.

He hit the golf course one more time Sunday ahead of his departure, joining two aides and former NBA player Alonzo Mourning for an afternoon round. He then joined wife 
Michelle for an evening jazz performance featuring singer Rachelle Ferrell. They left for Washington late Sunday night.

Obama's vacation has also been infused with a dose of politics. He headlined a fundraiser on the island for Democratic Senate candidates and attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan's wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

That get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama's vacation. Just as Obama was arriving on Martha's Vineyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest criticism of Obama's foreign policy.

Clinton later promised she and Obama would ""hug it out"" when they saw each other at Jordan's party. No reporters were allowed in, so it's not clear whether there was any hugging, but the White House said the president danced to nearly every song.",NA,NA,NA,NA
DailyMail,daily102,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2727055/Police-use-tear-gas-clear-streets-Ferguson.html,Police use tear gas to clear streets of Ferguson,Associated Press,8/18/2014,1/2/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Police used tear gas to clear protesters off the streets late Sunday, a week after demonstrations against the fatal police shooting of a black Missouri teenager first filled this St. Louis suburb with angry, defiant crowds.

The latest confrontation unfolded hours after Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on a black Missouri teenager who was fatally shot by a white police officer.

A preliminary private autopsy found that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

As night fell in Ferguson, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated after marchers pushed toward one end of a street. Police pushed them back by repeatedly firing tear gas, and the streets were empty well before the curfew took effect at midnight.

Authorities said they were responding to reports of gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails.

""Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of response,"" said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is command in Ferguson.

At least two people wounded in shootings, he said.

The ""extraordinary circumstances"" surrounding the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown and a request by Brown's family members prompted the Justice Department's decision to conduct a third autopsy, agency spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.

The examination was to take place as soon as possible, Fallon said.

The results of a state-performed autopsy would be taken into account along with the federal examination in the Justice Department investigation, Fallon said.

Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, told The New York Times that one of the bullets entered the top of Brown's skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when he suffered a fatal injury.

Brown was also shot four times in the right arm, and all the bullets were fired into his front, Baden said.

The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation into the shooting. A day earlier, officials said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson neighborhood where Brown, who was unarmed, was shot to death Aug. 9.

A federally conducted autopsy ""more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises"" might help that investigation, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami's U.S. attorney's office. The move is ""not that unusual,"" he added.

Federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case, Weinstein said.

Back in Ferguson, Sunday's clashes erupted three hours before the midnight curfew imposed by Gov. Jay Nixon.

Officers in riot gear ordered all the protesters to disperse. Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley of tear gas.

Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the street near the QuikTrip convenience store that was burned down last week. It was an apparent attempt to block police 
vehicles, but the vehicles easily plowed through. Someone set a nearby trash bin on fire, and the crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away.

Within two hours, most people had been cleared off West Florissant Avenue, one of the community's main thoroughfares. The streets remained quiet as the curfew began. It was to remain in effect until 5 a.m.

Earlier in the day, Johnson said he had met members of Brown's family and the experience ""brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart.""

""When this is over,"" he told the crowd, ""I'm going to go in my son's room. My black son, who wears his pants sagging, who wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, but that's my baby.""

Johnson added: ""We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael's going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.""

The protests have been going on since Brown's death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Missouri's governor to put the state highway patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before he was killed. Police Chief 
Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a robbery suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Nixon said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" that he was not aware the police were going to release surveillance video from the store where Brown is alleged to have stolen a $49 box of cigars.

""It's appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,"" Nixon said.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. 
Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

The officer who shot Brown has been identified as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting, and the department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Also Sunday, about 150 people gathered in St. Louis to show support for Wilson. The crowd protested outside a TV station because it had broadcast from in front of the officer's home.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the station, KSDK, later apologized. Other in the group, composed mostly of police and relatives of officers, carried signs urging people to wait for all the facts.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Trayvon Martin's father slams smears of black shooting victims as questions are raised about prosecutor in Michael Brown case,Damien Gayle; Associated Press,8/18/2014,1/2/2016,"The father of Trayvon Martin, the boy shot dead in Florida in 2012, last night spoke out against the stereotypes that stigmatise young blacks in America.

Speaking about the shooting of Michael Brown nine days ago at the hands of a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, Tracy Martin told MSNBC he recognised attempts to smear the dead teenager's name.

Trayvon was just 17 when he was killed by neighbourhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder after his lawyers painted Trayvon as a dope-smoking, school-skipping delinquent.

Speaking after police in Ferguson released footage of Brown allegedly robbing a liquor store, Mr Martin said: 'You ask yourself as a parent... is my son on trial or is his killer on trial?'

'I'm seeing the same elements in this case.' As he spoke, Mr Martin's face was etched with sadness despite insisting his family were 'doing well'.

Asked by MSNBC's Alex Witt how a solution can by found to the 'alienation' felt by many in the black community, he said: 'We have to understand that as an African-American community our young kids get stereotyped a lot and we have to break the stigma.

'We have to come together as human beings and say that African-American lives matter as much as any other ethnicity group matters.'

Mr Martin's comments were a sad reflection of the general opinion of many of the residents of Ferguson, a mainly black suburb of St Louis, who are increasingly asking questions about whether authorities leading the investigation into Brown's death can be trusted to make impartial findings.

After a week-long crackdown on protests in the town, which have turned violent as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators, the Associated Press reports that grand jurors have begun hearing evidence to help them decide whether Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson is charged with a state crime for the August 9 killing.

The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a separate civil rights investigation, which could mean there are two decisions about whether to charge Wilson, who is white. 

The state's case is being overseen by St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, who is white, and remains in charge despite mounting pressure to step aside.

There are some among local residents and black St. Louis area officials who believe Mr McCullogh, who has strong links to police, cannot be impartial.

In some other prominent cases — including the killing of Trayvon Martin — special state prosecutors have been appointed to determine whether to pursue charges.

That sometimes has occurred after the local authorities took no action.

But under Missouri law, it 'would be highly, highly, highly unusual' for a prosecutor to step aside merely because of racial tensions in a high-profile case, said Peter Joy, a 
Washington University law professor who directs the school's Criminal Justice Clinic. That's because in Missouri, 'the buck stops with the head prosecutor' in each county.

Missouri law allows two avenues for outside prosecutors. The local prosecutor can ask for help from the governor, who can appoint the state attorney general's office to the case, or a court can appoint a special prosecutor if the elected one has a conflict of interest.

Police shootings don't automatically qualify as conflicts of interest and often are handled by local prosecutors.

'Just because the case is really hot and really controversial would not be a reason why I would seek a special prosecutor,' said Eric Zahnd, a Kansas City-area prosecutor who is a past president of the Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys.

Police say Brown failed to move out of the centre of the street when Wilson asked him to, and a scuffle ensued before he was shot. Witnesses say Brown had his hands up as Wilson fired multiple rounds.

Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting and the department has refused to comment on his whereabouts.

Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

In the predominantly black suburb of Ferguson, where the shooting occurred, many residents say they have long been harassed and intimidated by the police department, which has just three black officers on its 53-member force.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police put the streets of Ferguson on lockdown, calling in reinforcements including armoured vehicles and stalking the streets toting shotguns and sniper rifles in military-style camouflage gear and body armour 

Residents have been left furious by the heavy-handed response, and they also have no confidence in Mr McCulloch, who has been prosecutor since 1991.

'He's not going to prosecute the police officers,' said Robert Fowler, a 48-year-old electrician. 'In the ghetto ... every police officer, he's letting go free. They call it justifiable homicide.'

Part of the scepticism stems from McCulloch's past. He comes from a family of police officers, and when McCulloch was a 12 years old, his father was fatally shot while responding to a call in 1964.

Others point to a 2001 case, where McCulloch brought no charges against two officers who fired 21 shots into a vehicle, killing two black men during an attempted drug arrest.

A spokesman for Mr McCullogh told The Associated Press the prosecutor has no plans to step aside from the Brown case.

'The people of this county have placed their trust in me,' Mr McCulloch told TV station KMOV. 'I've been as fair and impartial and done as thorough of a job as we could.'

U.S. Representative William Lacy Clay Jr., St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley and state Senators Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Jamilah Nasheed — all of whom are black — have called on Mr McCulloch to consent to a special prosecutor.

I have no comfort with local-authority prosecution, the judicial system or even police conducting a thorough and conclusive investigation

U.S. Representative William Lacy Clay

Ms Nasheed started an online petition and got more than 15,000 signatures within two days seeking a special prosecutor.

'In the past, justice has not been achieved in these types of police shootings,' said Mr Clay, who represents the area. 'So I have no comfort with local-authority prosecution, the judicial system or even police conducting a thorough and conclusive investigation that delivers justice to family of Michael Brown.'

'Simply put: he has a natural bias,' Ms Chappelle-Nadal, the local state senator, said of Mr McCulloch. 'My community doesn't trust him.'

Missouri does have a recent case in which a special prosecutor took over a highly publicised case, although it was not a racially charged scenario.

Last October, a prosecutor in rural northwest Missouri asked a judge to appoint a special prosecutor after public concerns that he didn't do enough before dropping felony charges against a teenage boy accused of sexually assaulting a younger girl.

A judge appointed a Kansas City area prosecutor to take a new look at the case, and Matthew Barnett pleaded guilty in January to misdemeanor child endangerment.",46,NA,NA,NA

violent protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the weekend stemming from the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, the timing couldn't have been any worse.

The Tennessee native soon took the tweet down, but many of his 33.9m followers have continued to show just how upset they are.

One tweeter wrote, 'I just ended my relationship w/Justin.' Another posted, 'Get Justin Timberlake the f--k out of here.'

One tweeter pointed out the bad timing of the message - on Monday the National Guard was brought into Ferguson to try to end a weeks worth of violence on the streets stemming from protest over Brown's shooting.

Full findings of the autopsy aren't expected for about two weeks.

Piaget Crenshaw lives in an apartment with a balcony overlooking the street in Ferguson, Missouri where the 18-year-old was killed on August 9.

She said today that she waited until now to release the video as she feared for her safety and the officer's name had not been released. 

On the cellphone footage, Ms Crenshaw can be heard saying: 'God bless his soul, police shot this boy outside my apartment.'

She told {CNN}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/videos/""> today that she had recorded the incident because she believed that something was wrong. 

'From it all initially happening, I knew this was not right,' Miss Crenshaw said.

'I knew the police shouldn't have been chasing this boy and firing at the same time. And the fact he got shot in his face, something clicked in me and I thought someone else should see this so I recorded.'

Ms Crenshaw said that police had her footage after confiscating her phone following the shooting. 

She questioned why they did not release this at the same time as the video of Michael Brown allegedly stealing cigars from a convenience store on Friday.

Ms Crenshaw said Officer Wilson paced back and forth along the street next to Michael Brown's body as if he was 'in disbelief' by what had just happened.

The woman was unclear what exactly happened between Brown and Wilson at the police cruiser but said that it appeared as if the officer was trying to pull the teenager into the car. 

She said Brown got away and she heard shots fired, none of which appeared to hit Brown although she believed one grazed him. 

It was then Brown 'turned around and was shot multiple times'. 

She added: 'He was running away and when he [Brown] turned around he was shot.' 

Officer Wilson is now on paid administrative leave following the shooting death of Michael Brown, pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting.

The 28-year-old officer won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' on February of this year.

'He never intended for any of this to happen,' Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson said last week. 'It's devastating, absolutely devastating.' 

A friend of Officer Wilson reportedly came to his defense on Wednesday saying that the cop shot and killed Michael Brown because the teen tried to grab his gun, punched him in the face and then charged at him.

A woman calling herself 'Josie' called a local St Louis radio station on Friday claiming to be a friend of the 28-year-old Ferguson police officer.

The woman, who said she was a friend of the cop's girlfriend, said friends and family were too afraid to speak out but she wanted the public to know that Brown, 18, had 'bum-rushed' Officer Wilson prior to the shooting.

'He pulled up ahead of them. And then he got a call-in that there was a strong-arm robbery. And, they gave a description,' the friend told {The Dana Show}<hyperlink=""http://danaloeschradio.com/alleged-friend-of-officer-darren-wilson-offers-his-side/"">.

'Tries to get out of his car. They slam his door shut violently. I think he said Michael did. And, then he opened the car again. He tried to get out. He stands up,' she continued.

'And then Michael just bum-rushes him and shoves him back into his car. Punches him in the face and them Darren grabs for his gun. Michael grabbed for the gun. At one point he got the gun entirely turned against his hip.

'And he shoves it away. And the gun goes off.

'Well, then Michael takes off and gets to be about 35 feet away. And, Darren's first protocol is to pursue.

'So, he stands up and yells, ''Freeze!'' Michael and his friend turn around.

'And Michael taunts him… And then all the sudden he just started bum-rushing him. He just started coming at him full speed.

So [Wilson] really thinks [Brown] was on something, because he just kept coming. It was unbelievable.

'And so he finally ended up, the final shot was in the forehead, and then he fell about two to three feet in front of the officer.'

The friend's report, which has not been verified, added to the growing number of different versions of events from the day of the fatal shooting.

An independent autopsy revealed on Monday that Michael Brown died from a 'kill shot' to the top of the head - but could have survived his five other bullet wounds.

Dr Michael Baden, who was asked by the family to perform post-mortem examination, told a press conference that he had reassured the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, that her son had not suffered. 

The family's autopsy, which was released on Sunday, revealed the unarmed 18-year-old had been shot at least six times by police officer Darren Wilson including twice in the head and four times in the right arm.

Eye-witnesses have also claimed that Brown had his hands up to signal that he was surrendering.

However assistant pathologist Shawn Parcells told CNN on Monday afternoon that it cannot be proved from the initial autopsy whether Brown was rushing the officer or simply standing at a distance. 

Family lawyer Benjamin Crump described the teen's death as an 'execution in broad daylight'. He said it was important for the family to have their own autopsy results as they did not trust the work of the local police. 

Later on Monday the St Louis County medical examiner also confirmed that Brown had been shot between six and eight times.  

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released the name of Officer Wilson last Friday after mounting public pressure. He had waited after saying that the officer received death threats on social media.  

The shooting of the unarmed black teenager has sparked eight days of protests in the once quiet Missouri suburb.

Protests over the teen's shooting on August 9 had seen looting and violence in the area. Following a brief calm, trouble returned at the end of last week, prompting Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to put a curfew in place from midnight to 5 a.m.

Nixon lifted the curfew on Monday while ordering the National Guard to help restore order.

He deployed the Guard on Monday following an overnight clash between armored police and what he called 'a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community'.
Nixon said the Guard will be under the direction of the state Highway Patrol.

Calling for understanding in the face of racially charged anger, President Barack Obama said on Monday that the vast majority of protesters in a St. Louis suburb were peaceful, but warned that a small minority was undermining justice.

During a brief pause in his summer vacation, Obama expressed sympathy for the 'passions and anger' sparked by the death of Brown but said giving in to that anger through looting and attacks on police only stirs tensions and leads to further chaos. 

He said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to 'listen and not just shout.'

'That's how we're going to move forward together, by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another,' Obama told reporters at the White House.

Obama also said that Eric Holder would travel to Ferguson this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death. 

After Obama spoke, the Attorney General announced that over 40 FBI agents are currently conducting an independent ‘civil rights investigation’ into Brown’s death.

‘The full resources of the Department of Justice are being committed to our federal civil rights investigation into the death of Michael Brown,’ he said.

“During the day today, more than 40 FBI agents continued their canvassing of the neighborhood where Michael Brown was shot. As a result of this investigative work, several new interviews have already been conducted.’ 

President Obama had earlier told Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon he wanted to ensure the use the National Guard in help calm tensions in Ferguson would be limited in scope. He said he would be monitoring that operation in the coming days to see whether the guard's involvement was helping or hurting.

Obama also weighed in for the first time publicly on the militarization of some local police departments, saying it probably would be useful to examine how federal grant dollars had been used to allow local police to purchase military-style equipment, an issue that's come to the forefront amid the violent protests in Ferguson.

Obama said the distinction between the military and domestic law enforcement was one of the great things about America.

The U.S. Defense Department has been contributing to the militarization of local police forces since at least 2007, handing over heavy armaments, battle helicopters and armored vehicles for use in urban policing scenarios.

'I think it's probably useful for us to review how the funding was done, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars,' Obama told reporters at the White House, 'to make sure that what they're purchasing is stuff that they actually need.'

'There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our tradition,' he said.

Last week's armed confrontations between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, where an officer shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old, have ignited a national debate about the militarization of law enforcement agencies.

Obama predicted that 'there will be some bipartisan interest in re-examining some of those programs,' even while he offered a justification for their existence.

'After 9/11,' he said, 'I think, understandably, a lot of folks saw local communities that were ill-equipped for a potential catastrophic terrorist attack.'

'And then people in Congress, and people of good will decided that we've got to make sure that they get proper equipment to deal with [it] ... And some of that's been useful.'

But data from the Law Enforcement Support Office of the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency show that the Pentagon transferred ownership of at least 239,000 items to civilian law enforcement agencies between 2007 and April of this year.

While some of the Pentagon's gifts are as mundane as rubber gloves and x-ray machines, others include a fleet of $18 million combat helicopters and 345 Mine Resistant Ambush 
Protected Vehicles (MRAPs) worth between $412,000 and $1.08 million apiece.

MRAPs were put into service in the U.S. military to protect personnel from roadside bobs and other improvised explosive devices.

The {Detroit Free Press}<hyperlink=""http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2014140726001""> first obtained the raw data from the Pentagon through a Freedom of 
Information Act request, and completed an analysis of equipment gifted to police forces in Michigan. 

In addition to 17 MRAPs, law enforcement there received 696 model M14 rifles, 32 12-gauge, 'riot-type shotguns' and nine grenade launchers since 2006, according to the paper.

But the larger picture shows hundreds of helicopters, including some sophisticated armored models, ending up in the control of local governments.

In 2011 the Pentagon gave Brevard County, Florida, a suburban coastal region that includes Cocoa Beach and Cape Canaveral, ownership of eight choppers valued at $18 million each.

Data released by the government don't identify the flying machines by name. But a defense analyst told MailOnline that the per-unit cost 'matches the basic profile of an attack helicopter.'

'There's really no civilian observation chopper on the market that costs that much,' he said.

Most of the helicopters described in the data from the Free Press are valued at less than $1 million each, and are identified as 'observation' craft.

The Brevard County Sheriff's Office operates a small fleet of just three choppers. There at 16 different incorporated towns and cities in the county, but the Pentagon hasn't provided information about which police forces operate those aircraft.

More than $45 million worth of rifles – some 89,000 in all, in three calibers – also left the federal government and landed in the trunks of police cruisers. 

In three U.S. counties, authorities received 13 M59A 'field range' sniper rifles, worth $3,263 each.

Police in Covington County, Alabama; Kern County, California and Lee County, Florida were the lucky recipients of those firearms. The latter two are home to the cities of 
Bakersfield and Fort Myers, respectively.

The Defense Department has also donated 9,900 handguns, including more than 400 '.38 special' revolvers.

A total of 98 armored vehicles are also on the list – classified as wheeled 'combat / assault / tactical' rides.

Perhaps the strangest item migrating from a military base to a police barracks would look more at home in 'Good Morning, Vietnam' than in 'Full Metal Jacket.'

Two South Carolina counties got $4 million mobile radio broadcast stations designed to flood enemy territory with propaganda messages.

The 'Special Operations Media System B' (SOMS-B) radio systems consist of radio and television broadcast stations and antennas mounted on humvees that tow their own generators. It's {21 tons}<hyperlink=""http://www.sddc.army.mil/sites/tea/Pages/default.aspx""> of gear in all, according to the Department of the Army.

In Afghanistan, according to congressional hearing transcripts, the Army used SOMS-B systems to broadcast 10,000 watts of propaganda messages into villages near Bagram Airfield, interspersed with recordings of Afghan music, sports reports and local news flashes.

The SOMS-B system can broadcast on any AM, FM, shortwave or television frequency, meaning that the U.S. military could interrupt or overwhelm any broadcast it chose to, replacing it with political messages designed to soften locals' objections and encourage the acceptance of political changes that favored the U.S. mission.

It's unclear what authorities in Darlington and Spartanburg Counties intend to use the gear for.

The {Chicago Tribune}<hyperlink=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-08-29/news/9708290271_1_military-terms-radio-stations-gulf-war""> reported in 1997, when the SOMS-B platform was first tested, that similar setups had instructed Iraqi soldiers on how to surrender to American troops.

In a live statement from the White House Obama said Americans need 'to use this moment to seek out our shared humanity that’s been laid bare by this moment.'

'So, to a community in Ferguson that is rightly hurting and looking for answers, let me call once again for us to seek some understanding rather than simply holler at each other,' Obama stated. 

'Let's seek to heal rather than to wound each other.'

'It’s clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting' and 'a small minority' are not,' the president said.

To the groups behaving violently, Obama said: 'While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos.'

'It undermines rather than advancing justice.' 

On the other hand, 'there's no excuse for excessive force by police,' Obama said, echoing remarks he made last week on the violence in Ferguson.

'In too many communities around the country a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,' he said.

'In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear.'

But fixing that requires 'that we build and not tear down. And that we listen and not just shout,' he said.


Touting his My Brother's Keeper mentor program, Obama said his administration was working to make sure that are treated young black men are treated equally under the law and that there's 'more trust in the criminal justice system' in communities of color.

At the same time, if a young black men 'commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted,' he said, 'because every community has an interst in public safety.'

'This is not an argument that there is not real crime out there and law enforcement does not have a difficult job,' he clarified, noting that police 'have to be honored and respected for the danger and difficulty' of their jobs.

'But what is also true is that given the history of this country, where we can make progress in building up more confidence, more trust, making sure that our criminal justice system is acutely aware of the possibilities of disparities in treatment,' he said, and that 'there are safeguards in place to avoid those disparities.'

In the short term, however, Obama said he was concerned with making sure the 'cause of justice and fair administration of the law is being brought to bear in Ferguson.'

That can't happen, though when people in Ferguson - some of whom are not even local residents - 'are using this tragic death as an excuse to engage in criminal behavior.' 

Those people are 'damaging the cause,' he said. 'They are not advancing it.'

Obama, who returned to the White House in the wee hours on Monday for a brief vacation from his vacation, appeared tieless throughout the day, even as he spoke on the military victories of forces in Iraq and the dramatic events taking place at home.

The president gave prepared remarks on both situations before taking several questions from the press.

Asked about the militarization of the law enforcement and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon's decision to deploy the state National Guard to Ferguson Obama said: 'One of the great things about the United States has been our ability to maintain a distinction between our military and domestic law enforcement.

'That helps preserve our civil liberties. That helps ensure that the military is accountable to civilian direction. And that that has to be preserved,' he said.

'We don't want those lines blurred,' Obama added, noting that it would run 'contrary to our traditions.'

Likewise, the president expressed skepticism over the Democratic governor's plan to bring in members of Missouri's military's reserve forces and said he told Nixon over the phone that they should be used in a 'limited and appropriate way' in Ferguson.

'I'll be watching over the next several days to access whether, in fact, it's helping instead of hindering progress in Ferguson,' Obama said.

A White House official said prior to Obama's statement that the president was unaware that Nixon was send the National Guard to the troubled town.

'Folks didn’t know,' the official told {BuzzFeed}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/white-house-did-not-know-national-guard-was-being-deployed-i?utm_term=2z1vndn#1pzsby2"">. 'The White House did not know they were sending it in.' 

Governors are not legally required to consult with the President of the United States before calling up their states' military reserves. 

Still, it is odd that Nixon did not reach out to Obama - who interrupted his vacation last Thursday to give an address on the situation in Ferguson - before escalating the state's response to the late-night violence taking place in the St. Louis suburb.

Ever since a white police officer shot and killed 18-year-old Ferguson resident Michael Brown, an African-American, on Saturday, August 9, protests of police have taken place in the Missouri city on a nightly basis.

Witnesses present at the shooting said Brown had his hands up in the air in surrender when he was gunned down by the law enforcement officer, who has now been identified as 28-year-old Darren Wilson. An autopsy of Brown released today shows he was shot six times, including twice in the head.

The description of Brown's killing has inflamed racial tensions in the predominately black town and clashes between police and local residents have grown increasingly violent.

Nixon said Thursday afternoon that he had spoken to President Obama on the phone about the local tragedy and his the president asked him tell the city's residents to refrain from unlawful behavior.

'Now's the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,' the president said in televised remarks less an hour later. 'Now's the time for an open and transparent process to make sure that justice is done.

After Obama's remarks, the situation in Ferguson briefly turned around before devolving back into chaos over the weekend.

Police say that Sunday night's civil unrest included the shooting of a civilian, Molotov cocktails being thrown at law enforcement by protesters, 'looting, vandalism and other acts of violence that clearly appear not to have been spontaneous - but premeditated criminal acts designed to damage property, hurt people and provoke a response.'

Nixon had already declared a state of emergency in the city on Saturday and instituted citywide curfews the last two nights. Schools in the area were also closed on Monday.

The Show Me State governor took the added precaution on Monday of issuing an executive order that authorized the a National Guard deployment.

In the legal declaration Nixon said he was sending in reinforcements because the ongoing violence had created 'conditions of distress and hazard to the safety, welfare and property of the citizens of the community beyond the capacities of local jurisdictions.'

The presence of the state's militia 'is necessary to ensure the safety and welfare of the citizens' of Ferguson, Nixon's order said.

In a statement on Monday he said the National Guard will 'help restore peace and order and to protect the citizens of Ferguson.'

Nixon also gave the Missouri State Highway Patrol permission to shut down streets and take other actions it believes are necessary to maintain order.

Obama is at the White House today for meetings and will return to family vacation spot on Martha's Vineyard tomorrow. He will remain on the Massachusetts island until Sunday.

This afternoon Obama met for roughly a half hour with Attorney General Eric Holder about the situation in Ferguson before calling a presser to announce that the Justice Department head would visit the Missouri town on Wednesday.

Holder will meet with FBI and DOJ officials conducting federal criminal investigations during his trip.

'He will also be meeting with other leaders in the community whose support is so critical to bringing about peace and calm in Ferguson,' Obama said.

The Obama administration official has expressed concern with the militarization of law enforcement in the small town and suggested last Thursday that local officials dial back the military garb.

'At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,' Holder said in a statement on Thursday.

The Attorney General said at the time that he had instructed his department to provide resources to Ferguson 'to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.'",252,NA,NA,NA

The results from a survey carried out by {Rasmussen}<hyperlink=""http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/august_2014/a_tale_of_two_cities_blacks_whites_sharply_disagree_about_ferguson""> reveal a stark difference in attitudes towards the death of the black teenager, which has sparked riots in the Missouri city and across the U.S.

Nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of the 1,000 American adults surveyed believe Wilson should be found guilty of murder, while another quarter (26 per cent) thought he was acting in self defense when he gunned down the unarmed teenager in broad daylight on August 9.

But 57 per cent of black adults think he should be convicted compared to only 17 per cent of white Americans and 24 per cent of other minority Americans.

Of those who are undecided about what should happened to Wilson, most - 56 per cent - are white.

The survey results also show that black Americans are more convinced that the violent riots since the killing are legitimate outrage rather than criminal activity.

Police have said they fired tear gas and rubber bullets in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails over the weekend.

Exactly a quarter of all those surveyed said they believed the protests have mostly been legitimate outrage, whereas 52 per cent think the riots have been carried out by criminals taking advantage of the situation.

Among these, 54 per cent of white Americans and 53 per cent of other minorities think the violence is mostly down to criminals, compared to 35 per cent of black people surveyed.

In addition, black Americans are more likely to think the protests are legitimate anger.

As tension grows in Ferguson, the Missouri State Police and the state National Guard have been called in to help deal with the violence.

Of those who took part in the survey, 27 per cent believe the police have responded well, while a similar percentage - 28 - call their response 'poor'.

The results also showed that black Americans were more than twice as likely as whites and other minority adults to rate the police response as poor. 

And while 68 per cent of Americans say they have been following the new reports very closely, black Americans are far more likely to be following it, the survey revealed.

The racial divide apparent in the survey results is reminiscent of the trial of George Zimmerman, who shot dead an unarmed African-American teenager in Florida in 2012. 
Zimmerman was found not guilty at a trial last year.

This latest survey shows that eight out of ten black voters believe the system is unfair to minorities.

Brown, 18, was shot dead on August 9 and sustained six bullet wounds, including the fatal shot to the top of his head. His killer was identified as Darren Wilson, who has 
since been placed on paid administrative leave.

(AP) — The Missouri prosecutor overseeing an investigation into the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown has deep family roots among police: his father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for St. Louis' police department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect.

The connections now are being cited by some local residents and black leaders who question whether St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch can remain impartial. 
Brown, who was black, was fatally shot in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on Aug. 9 by local police officer Darren Wilson, who is white.

Grand jurors may begin hearing the case Wednesday, though it could be weeks before they decide whether to indict Wilson on state criminal charges. The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a separate civil rights investigation, which could also result in charges.

McCulloch's spokesman, Ed Magee, said Monday that the prosecutor plans to remain in charge of the case, despite mounting pressure to step aside amid violent clashes between police and protesters demanding that Wilson be charged.

McCulloch, a Democrat who has been in office since 1991, referenced his father's death in his initial campaign. He survived a Democratic primary earlier this month and faces no Republican opposition in his re-election bid.

Protesters questioned his objectivity when grand jurors returned no charges against two officers who fired 21 bullets into a vehicle in June 2000, killing two black men during an attempted drug arrest.

But at the time, McCulloch said his father's 1964 shooting by a black man at a public housing complex was an ""incredibly irrelevant facet"" as he sought to ""make sure everybody gets a full and fair hearing."" McCulloch was 12 when his father was killed.

U.S. attorneys also reviewed the case and decided a year later not to bring any civil rights charges against the officers.

In Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb of St. Louis, many residents say they have long been harassed and intimidated by the police department, which has just three black officers on its 53-member force. They also have little confidence in McCulloch.

""He's not going to prosecute the police officers,"" said Robert Fowler, a 48-year-old electrician. ""In the ghetto ... every police officer, he's letting go free. They call it justifiable homicide.""

McCulloch has not responded to Associated Press requests for an interview. But he recently told television station KMOV: ""I've been as fair and impartial and done as thorough of a job as we could.""

Police allege that Brown failed to move out of the center of the street when Wilson asked him to, and a scuffle ensued before he was shot. Witnesses say Brown had his hands up as Wilson fired multiple rounds.

Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

In some other prominent cases — most notably, the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida — special state prosecutors have been appointed to determine whether to pursue charges. That at times occurred only after local authorities took no action.

But under Missouri law, it ""would be highly, highly, highly unusual"" for a prosecutor to step aside merely because of racial tensions in a high-profile case, said Peter Joy, a Washington University law professor who directs the school's Criminal Justice Clinic.

In Missouri, ""the buck stops with the head prosecutor"" in each county, Joy said.

Missouri law allows two avenues for outside prosecutors: The local prosecutor can ask for help from the governor, who can appoint the state attorney general's office to the case; or a court can appoint a special prosecutor if the elected one has a conflict of interest.

Police shootings don't automatically qualify as conflicts of interest and often are handled by local prosecutors.

""Just because the case is really hot and really controversial would not be a reason why I would seek a special prosecutor,"" said Eric Zahnd, a Kansas City-area prosecutor and past president of the Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys.

But some black leaders — including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley and state Sens. Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Jamilah Nasheed — have called on McCulloch to consent to a special prosecutor.

Nasheed started an online petition that has gotten about 25,000 signatures in four days seeking a special prosecutor.

""In the past, justice has not been achieved in these types of police shootings,"" said Clay, who represents the area. ""So I have no comfort with local-authority prosecution, the judicial system or even police conducting a thorough and conclusive investigation that delivers justice to the family of Michael Brown.""

""Simply put: he has a natural bias,"" added Chappelle-Nadal. ""My community doesn't trust him.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Minister Haider al-Abadi has established an 'inclusive government' that can appeal to his nation's warring religious and ethnic sects.

Asked if he worried about 'mission creep' growing out of an offensive that has seen 68 airstrikes to date, Obama replied that he refuses to be pinned down to a timetable.

'I don't think ... at this point, that I'm prepared to provide a blanket answer to that,' he told reporters at the White House. 'A lot of it depends on how effectively the 
Iraqi government comes together.'

'This is going to take time,' Obama added. 'There are going to be many challenges ahead. Meanwhile, there should be no doubt that the United States military is going to continue to carry out the limited missions I have authorized.'
{U.S. Central Command}<hyperlink=""http://www.centcom.mil/en/news/articles/aug.-18-u.s.-military-conducts-airstrikes-against-isil-near-the-mosul-dam""> said Monday that it 'has conducted a total of 68 airstrikes in Iraq' since August 8, when Obama first authorized them. A Pentagon official told MailOnline that the number would soon be elevated to a total of 72.

That figure is small by the standards the U.S. has established in previous Middle Eastern conflicts. At their peak in 2011, U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan reached {a total of 5,411}<hyperlink=""http://www.afcent.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-140113-009.pdf"">. 

Still it indicates that the commander-in-chief is willing to bring a strategic hammer down on ISIS, the terror group that claims it has established an Islamic 'state' across portions of sovereign Iraq and Syria.

CENTCOM said about half of its airstrikes to date came in the last few days as Iraqi military forces drove ISIS away from the Mosul Dam, a key piece of infrastructure that 
could have been used as a tool of terror if it were intentionally breached.

Fifteen strikes near the dam, the Pentagon said, were carried out by drones.

The sense of urgency Obama said he has communicated to al-Abadi is driven in part by a desire to remove American armed forces from the Iraqi theatre.

'I have been firm from the start that we are not reintroducing thousands of U.S. troops back on the ground to engage in combat,' he said Monday.

'Iraq is going to have to ultimately provide for its own security.'

Leaving American armed servicemen and women in place to protect ethnic and religious minorities from a rampaging ISIS is 'not sustainable,' Obama insisted. 'It's not lasting.'

ISIS, an acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, has grown 'from a band of 2,000 thugs to a 30,000+ terrorist army,' former Reagan administration Pentagon deputy KT MacFarland said Monday, 'equipped with state-of-the-art military equipment seized from Iraqi Army deserters.'

The terror group 'now controls large swaths of Syria and Iraq, has $2 billion in cash and assets, $3 million in daily revenue and controls oil fields and dams, which means it controls most of the water and electricity in Iraq,' she said.

And its army 'is butchering, raping and beheading anyone who stands in its way.'

Obama, however, remains focused on ensuring that Baghdad has an egalitarian government that caters equally to the complaints of Sunnis, Shias and Kurds.

'They’ve got to get this done,' he told reporters, 'because the wolf’s at the door. And in order for them to be credible with the Iraqi people, they’re going to have to put behind some of the old practices and actually create a credible, united government.'

'We've made significant progress on that front, but we're not there yet,' he conceded.

Al-Abadi, the president said, will help ensure America's national security by 'making sure a savage group that seems willing to slaughter people for no rhyme or reason other than they have not kowtowed to them, that a group like that is contained, because ultimately it can cause a threat to us.'

He seemed to be pinning his hope for a smooth exit from Iraq on the belief that Sunni Muslims, a minority group in Iraq, will embrace a strong al-Abadi government and stand up to the murderous ISIS hordes that have overrun parts of the country that they had long controlled.

With the success of a credible governing coalition, he said Monday, 'there's the prospect of Sunni tribes who are the primary residents of areas that ISIL now controls, saying, ""We've got a viable option"".'

'""And we would rather work with a central government that appears to understand our grievances and is prepared to meet them"",' he suggested they might conclude, '""rather than deal with individuals who don't seem to have any values beyond death and destruction"".'

DailyMail,daily121,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2727636/Obama-Time-review-local-police-militarization.html,Obama: Time to review local police militarization,Associated Press,8/18/2014,1/3/2016,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Calling for a sharp separation between the nation's armed forces and local police, President Barack Obama on Monday urged a re-examination of programs that have equipped civilian law enforcement departments with military gear from the Pentagon.

The transfers have come under public scrutiny after the forceful police response to racially charged unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.

Amid video images of well-armed police confronting protesters with combat weapons and other surplus military equipment, Obama said it would be useful to review how local law enforcement agencies have used federal grants that permit them to obtain heavier armaments.

""There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. ""That would be contrary to our traditions.""

Obama's remarks came as he called for understanding in the face of anger in Ferguson in the wake of a police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old black man. Obama said the vast majority of protesters in the St. Louis suburb were peaceful, but said that a small minority was undermining justice for the shooting victim, Michael Brown.

The initial police reaction to the protests drew attention to the militarization of local police departments, with critics arguing that the heavily-armed police presence only fueled the tensions. Attorney General Eric Holder and several lawmakers have suggested that the practice of supplying police with such military surplus be reconsidered. A report by the American Civil Liberties Union in June said police agencies had become ""excessively militarized,"" with officers using training and equipment designed for the battlefield on city streets.

Obama said he also spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon about Nixon's deployment of National Guard units to help secure Ferguson, urging the governor to ensure that the guard be used in a ""limited and appropriate way.""

""I'll be watching over the next several days, to assess whether, in fact, it's helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson,"" he said.

Pausing briefly in the middle of his summer vacation, Obama expressed sympathy for the ""passions and anger"" sparked by Brown's death. But he said giving in to that anger through looting and attacks on police only stirs tensions and leads to further chaos. He said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to ""listen and not just shout.""

""That's how we're going to move forward together, by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another,"" Obama told reporters at the White House.

Obama said Holder would travel to Ferguson this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death. Separately, 
Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., whose district includes Ferguson, told Democratic lawmakers Monday that he will meet with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to push for changes in the program that provides military equipment to local police departments.

Appearing in the White House briefing room in a dress shirt but no tie, Obama also spoke for the first time to the racial tensions and grievances perceived by African-Americans in Ferguson. In previous comments about the situation, Obama had avoided talking directly about race, wary of rushing to judgment or further inflaming the situation.

Weighing his words carefully, Obama said it was clear that disparities in how blacks and whites are treated and sentenced must be addressed, calling for more safeguards and training to prevent missteps. At the same time, he acknowledged the difficult situation that police officers sometimes face.

""There are young black men that commit crime. We can argue about why that happened — because the poverty they were born into or the school systems that failed them or what have you— but if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted,"" Obama said. ""Because every community has an interest in public safety.""

Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a police officer on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, a predominantly black community that long has been at odds with the mostly white police department. Results of an independent autopsy released Monday by Brown's family determined that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

Obama's remarks on the crisis were the first since the situation in Ferguson escalated over the weekend, with Nixon, the Missouri governor, ordering a midnight curfew for Ferguson and ordering the National Guard to help restore order. Nixon lifted that curfew on Monday, but tensions remained high the morning after police once again deployed tear gas in response to what they said were reports of gunfire, looting and vandalism by protesters.

Obama weighed in on the crisis during a brief break in his annual summer vacation at Martha's Vineyard, where the president was spending two weeks with his family while juggling multiple crises in the U.S. and overseas. Obama returned to the White House late Monday and planned to return to the Massachusetts island on Tuesday.

""That's my neighborhood.""

""It's a bad situation all the way around, there's no positive spin to it,"" Hamm said. ""When all the facts come out and hopefully all the light is shown on all sides of it, hopefully the justice will be carried out.""

On Monday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon mobilized the Guard to the town of Ferguson, where protests stemming from the shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old resident are now in their second week. The governor said he acted to protect the people and property from a ""violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community.""

Here are some questions about the Guard, its activities and its role in Ferguson:

Q: What is the National Guard?

A: The National Guard is a reserve military force that can be mobilized under state or federal authority. About 470,000 people are currently members of the Army or Air National Guard; most have civilian jobs and serve part time in the Guard. There are Guard units in every state as well as the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The Guard is in more than 3,200 communities. About 11,000 Guard members are in Missouri.

Q: Why is the Guard in Ferguson?

A: Nixon deployed the Guard early Monday to ""restore peace and order"" to the St. Louis suburb following another night of violent clashes between police and protesters that involved Molotov cocktails thrown at officers, looting, vandalism and gunfire. Police responded with tear gas. The demonstrations have been sparked by the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer. Brown was black.

The governor said in a statement that he deployed the Guard because of ""coordinated attacks last night both on civilians and law enforcement officers."" Nixon said the Guard's involvement will be a ""limited mission."" President Barack Obama said he told Nixon he'll be watching to determine if the Guard's presence is beneficial or harmful. Nixon on 
Monday lifted a midnight-5 a.m. curfew that he had imposed two days earlier.

Q: Who's in charge?

A: The Guard will be under the direction of Col. Ron Replogle of the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Missouri National Guard Brig. Gen. Gregory Mason will oversee Guard operations. It's the standard way of operating when the Guard is called to help quell civil disturbances. ""We're always in support, never in the lead domestically. We take orders from the lead law enforcement agency on the scene,"" said Rick Breitenfeldt, a spokesman at the Guard's national headquarters.

Q: Who can deploy the Guard?

A: Governors or the president can deploy the Guard. In at least 10 cases since World War II, the president has mobilized the Guard for wide-ranging missions, invoking the Insurrection Act. Among them: the 1957-58 desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas; the 1965 Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, civil rights march; the 1967 riots in Detroit; the 1968 riots in numerous cities following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.; the 1970 New York City postal strike; and the 1992 Los Angeles riots after four police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King. In that last case, the Guard was originally mobilized by the state. After two days, then-President George H.W. Bush called the Guard into federal service.

Q: What other activities has the Guard been involved in?

A: Guard members have been mobilized in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, peacekeeping duty in the Balkans and the Sinai and numerous natural disasters. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Guard dispatched more than 50,000 troops to help the Gulf states.

In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry recently announced the deployment of Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border, where there has been a surge in illegal immigration this summer — most notably unaccompanied children from gang-ravaged Central American nations. In coming weeks, up to 1,000 additional Guard troops are expected to arrive at the border to beef up the Texas Department of Public Safety's ""Operation Strong Safety."" The soldiers will largely serve as surveillance in what officials have called a ""deter and refer"" mission.

During fiscal year 2013, the Guard said, it responded to 28 wildfires, 14 floods, 10 winter storms, three hurricanes, a tornado and a tropical storm.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The total arrest number being reported was only for the St Louis County Jail with numbers unclear for other locations. 

A total of 18 people from outside Missouri were arrested during clashes between police and protesters, some from as far away as New York City and California.  

A St Louis County Jail official told MailOnline today that he was not authorized to comment on the number of arrests. 

Captain Johnson said that 'violent agitators' are using largely peaceful demonstrations as an excuse to commit crime. He said some of those arrested had traveled across the country, from as far afield as New York and California, to take advantage of the town's unsettled state.

'Not a single bullet was fired by officers despite coming under heavy attack,' he told a news conference today.

Riot police had confiscated two guns from protesters and what looked like a petrol bomb. Four officers had been injured.

Johnson separately told CNN that two people were shot within the crowd, but not by police, and were taken to hospital. There was no immediate word on their condition.

'This has to stop. I don't want anybody to get hurt. We have to find a way to stop this,' said Johnson, an African-American who grew up in the area and who took over security efforts last Thursday after the mostly white local force was accused of using excessive force against blacks.

He added: 'This nation is watching each and every one of us.

'I am not going to let the criminals that have come here from across this country, or live in this neighborhood, define this community. We do not want to lose another life.'

Michael Brown's parents told {Today}<hyperlink=""http://www.today.com/news/michael-browns-mom-justice-will-bring-peace-ferguson-1D80081288""> on Tuesday that bringing justice for their son, by prosecuting his shooter Officer Darren Wilson, is the way to bring peace to Ferguson. 

The National Guard, the U.S. state militia, has been deployed in the St. Louis suburb of 21,000 people to stop looting and burning that have punctuated the protests.

President Obama and civil rights leaders have appealed for calm while a federal investigation into the shooting gets underway.

'While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police, only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos,' Obama told a news conference on Monday.

'It undermines, rather than advancing, justice.'

Monday night's clashes between riot police and protesters followed hours of mostly peaceful demonstrations.

Police had closed a roadway to traffic to provide a path for marches but said a smaller group within the larger crowd hurled bottles, rocks and petrol bombs at officers standing near armored vehicles.

Officers responded by firing tear gas-filled canisters and a noise cannon to try to disperse the throng. Police also used stun grenades on protesters who hurled rocks, bottles and Molotov cocktails.

Police sat with guns pointed atop armored vehicles while authorities used LRAD (Long Range Acoustic Device) crowd control systems to send out a painful noise to try and disperse the crowd.

Some demonstrators, including a church minister using a blow horn, urged crowds to calm down.

CNN’s Don Lemon and Jack Tapper were presenting live from the middle of protests when teargas was thrown and they got caught up in the melee.

Lemon quickly put on his bullet proof vest and gas mask while continuing to present live TV. Tapper gave his gas mask to a photographer who had been on the receiving end of the tear gas attack.

The reporters were eventually moved on by police, who said it wasn't safe for them to remain because there had been a shooting in the area.

Earlier in the evening Tapper had liken the police presence in Ferguson and the weaponry on show to what he had seen while reporting from Afghanistan. 

‘These are armed police, with - not machine guns - semi-automatic rifles, with batons, with shields, many of them dressed for combat. Now why are they doing this? I don’t know. Because there is no threat going on here. None that merits this. There is none,' said Tapper.

'Absolutely there have been looters, absolutely over the last nine days there’s been violence, but there is nothing going on on this street right now that merits this scene out of Bagram. Nothing.

‘So if people wonder why the people of Ferguson, Missouri are so upset, this is part of the reason. What is this? This doesn't make any sense.’

Protesters had began throwing rocks at MSNBC's Chris Hayes during a live broadcast, demanding he ‘tell the true story'.

As police began trying to clear the streets of protesters, several took their frustrations out on Hayes.

'The gentleman behind me in the mask is telling me this is a civil rights movement, it's just not about Mike Brown, it's about all people,' Hayes explained. 'There's a lot of frustration.'

A photographer working for the Getty photography agency was arrested in Ferguson on Monday. Scott Olson was arrested because he wasn't in the required media area, said police.

There have been largely peaceful protests over Brown's killing elsewhere in the U.S. including in St Louis, New York, Seattle and Oakland. 

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency in Ferguson on Saturday and a curfew from midnight to 5am. The curfew was lifted last night. He also mobilized the National Guard to back up state police.

Obama said he told the governor the use of the National Guard should be limited and called for conciliation in communities hit by the unrest. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will visit Ferguson on Wednesday, Obama said.

Holder said more than 40 FBI agents were canvassing Ferguson neighborhoods in their investigation and an additional medical examination was being performed on Brown. Results of autopsies done by federal and St Louis County authorities were pending.

Brown was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, 28. The cope is now on paid leave pending the results of the investigation and has gone into hiding.

Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, and may have been lowering his head in surrender when the fatal shot struck, according to Brown family attorney Daryl Parks. 

There were no signs of struggle with the officer and no gunshot residue on the 18-year-old's body - although his clothing still has to be examined. 

Ferguson police quoted Wilson as saying he had asked Brown and a friend to move off the street where they were walking, and onto the sidewalk. Wilson reported that Brown reached into his patrol car and struggled for his gun.

St. Louis County prosecutors' spokesman Edward Magee said the case could be presented this week to an investigating grand jury which would decide whether Wilson will be indicted.

Ferguson has seen a stark demographic shift in recent decades, going from all white to mostly black. Out of a police force of 53, three officers are black.

Many Ferguson residents say Brown's killing was emblematic of police excesses against blacks, a charge authorities deny.

Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, 22, said Wilson had reached out of his car window to grab Brown and the teenager tried to get away. 

Johnson said Brown held up his hands to surrender but Wilson got out of his car and shot him several times.

One young man's life cut short - another's changed forever: Darren Wilson captured looking at Michael Brown's body 

A cellphone video released on Monday revealed Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson 'staring in disbelief' at the lifeless Michael Brown moments after he shot him dead in the street.

Eye-witness Piaget Crenshaw, lives in an apartment overlooking the street, where the 18-year-old was killed on August 9 released the recording on Monday of the cop pacing back and forth.

Ms Crenshaw said Officer Wilson paced back and forth along the street next to Michael Brown's body as if he was 'in disbelief' and 'bewildered' by what had just happened.

The woman was unclear what exactly happened between Brown and Wilson at the police cruiser but said that it appeared as if the officer was trying to pull the teenager into the car. 

She said Brown got away and she heard shots fired, none of which appeared to hit Brown although she believed one grazed him. 

It was then Brown 'turned around and was shot multiple times'. 

She added: 'He was running away and when he [Brown] turned around he was shot.' 

Officer Wilson is now on paid administrative leave following the shooting death of Michael Brown, pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting. The 28-year-old 
officer won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' on February of this year.

'He never intended for any of this to happen,' Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson said last week. 'It's devastating, absolutely devastating.'

Several other eye-witnesses have also claimed that Brown had his hands up to signal that he was surrendering.

However assistant pathologist Shawn Parcells told CNN on Monday afternoon that it cannot be proved from the initial autopsy whether Brown was rushing the officer or simply standing at a distance. 

Family lawyer Benjamin Crump described the teen's death as an 'execution in broad daylight'. He said it was important for the family to have their own autopsy results as they did not trust the work of the local police. 

Later on Monday the St Louis County medical examiner also confirmed that Brown had been shot between six and eight times.  

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released the name of Officer Wilson last Friday after mounting public pressure. He had waited several days to release the name after saying that the officer received death threats

The National Bar Association, containing the largest network of black attorneys and judges, filed a lawsuit on Monday against Ferguson and its police department, demanding it protect evidence of the shooting and arrests made during protests.

Looting has left a number of Ferguson stores in shambles. Two fires were set on Monday evening, one at a business and one at an unoccupied home, Johnson said.

The disturbances are the worst of their kind for more than a year. In July 2013, there were angry, albeit peaceful, protests in cities across the United States over the acquittal in a Florida second-degree murder and manslaughter trial of neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, who shot dead an unarmed black teenager, 
Trayvon Martin, in the street during a scuffle in February 2012.

Leaders of the Nation of Islam and other black activist groups working to calm tensions in Ferguson are asking protesters to clear the streets of the St. Louis suburb at sunset amid the National Guard's arrival. 

Organizers from the New Black Panther Party, Black Lawyers for Justice and other groups joined St. Louis-area community activists on Monday to again call for restraint on the part of protesters seething over the police shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. 

They also condemned Missouri Governor Jay Nixon's decision to summon the National Guard, which they fear could escalate the violence.

The call to clear the streets came as police accelerated their own crowd control efforts Monday, including the blocking of access to the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that has become the hub of demonstrations. 

Rapper and St. Louis native Nelly appeared in Ferguson, Missouri, on Monday night and appealed to local residents to remain calm following more than a week of protests.

Speaking before a large crowd, Nelly said violent protests weren't the right way for the community to come to terms with what had happened.

'We've got to understand that we have options and stop choosing the reaction option cause at the end of the day we gonna pay - our brother are gonna be the ones in jail,' he said.

The rapper, best known for his 2002 number one Hot In Heere, had been heavily criticized on social media in recent days for being of touch with what was happening in Ferguson after he called on local people to 'calm down.' 

'I understand the frustration, but we have to strategize before we overreact,' he told TMZ on Saturday. 'We don't get no do-over on s**t like this, so we have to do it right the first time.

'Ain't nothing happen no different that hasn't been happening... At the end of the day, we should have waited to strategize first and take all the right steps to organize.'",459,NA,NA,NA

(AP) — A look at the key figures in the case of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Aug. 9 — a death that has stoked days of violent unrest north of St. Louis.
___

MICHAEL BROWN

Michael Brown graduated from Normandy High School this spring and was preparing to attend Vatterott College, where he planned to study to become a heating and air conditioning technician. Friends say he eventually wanted to go into business for himself.

Relatives and friends described Brown, who grew up in a tough neighborhood, as a quiet, gentle giant who stood around 6-foot-3 and weighed nearly 300 pounds.

Police said Brown was a suspect in the ""strong-arm"" robbery of a convenience store moments before he was killed. A family attorney said Brown may have made mistakes, but didn't deserve to be shot. Others doubted Brown's involvement in the crime.

""He was just looking forward to getting on with his life,"" said his grandmother, Desuirea Harris. ""He was on his way.""
___

OFFICER DARREN WILSON

Some of the descriptions of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson are eerily similar to descriptions of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old Wilson shot to death on Aug. 9. Both men have been described as gentle and quiet. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had no previous complaints against him and a strong record in the career he began six years ago.

""He's devastated,"" the chief said after naming Wilson as the shooter on Friday. ""He never intended for this to happen. He is, and has been, an excellent police officer.""

Wilson began his career in nearby Jennings. He moved to the Ferguson job four years ago. Since the shooting, his whereabouts are unclear. Neighbors who live near his tidy brick home in another area of suburban St. Louis say they haven't seen him for several days.
___

FERGUSON POLICE CHIEF THOMAS JACKSON

Thomas Jackson was a police veteran long before he came to Ferguson. He spent more than 30 years with the St. Louis County Police Department, at one point serving as commander of the Drug Task Force. Before that he was a SWAT team supervisor, undercover detective and hostage negotiator.

He heads a department with 53 officers, only three of whom are black in a town where nearly 70 percent of the 21,000 residents are African-American.

""I'm constantly trying to recruit African-Americans and other minorities,"" he has said. ""But it's an uphill battle. The minority makeup of this police department is not where I want it to be.""

Some of Jackson's actions in the wake of the shooting have drawn criticism, including his decision to announce that Brown was a suspect in the convenience mart robbery, a move that stirred anger in the black community in Ferguson.
___

ST. LOUIS COUNTY PROSECUTOR BOB MCCULLOCH

Bob McCulloch was 12 years old when his father, 37-year-old police officer Paul McCulloch, was shot and killed by a black suspect in 1964.

Since his election in 1991, McCulloch has been the prosecuting attorney in St. Louis County, a Democrat who has earned a reputation for being tough on crime.

Some people, including St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, believe McCulloch cannot be objective in deciding whether charges should be filed against officer Darren Wilson for killing Michael Brown. They wonder if losing his father in such tragic circumstances creates a built-in bias. Dooley is among those who have urged that a special prosecutor be appointed and McCulloch removed. McCulloch has no plans to give up the case.

""We will be proceeding with our duties,"" McCulloch spokesman Ed Magee said last week.
___

MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL CAPT. RON JOHNSON

Capt. Ron Johnson climbed during his 27-year career from a patrolman to the chief of the 11-county Missouri State Highway Patrol division that includes the most populated region of the state — St. Louis and its suburbs. Now, he's something of a celebrity.

Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday appointed Johnson to take command of security in Ferguson. That decision came after complaints about heavy-handedness in police handling of looting and protesters earlier in the week, when St. Louis County police were in charge.

Johnson's calm but commanding presence has drawn high praise from many observers. When Johnson, who is black, walks down the streets of Ferguson with protesters, many shake his hand or pose for photos with him. He has carried himself with a disarming empathy, reminding locals of his Ferguson roots and suggesting that he, too, has lessons to learn from the case.

During an address on Sunday, Johnson said his son wears baggy pants and has tattoos.

""We all ought to be thanking the Browns for Michael, because Michael's going to make it better for our sons, so they can be better black men, so they can be better for our daughters, so they can be better black women, better for me, so I can be a better black father, and we know they're gonna make our mommas even better than they are today,"" Johnson said.

Johnson apologized to Brown's family.

""I wear this uniform, and I should stand up here and say that I'm sorry,"" he said.

But the verdict on Johnson's success is out. After a relatively peaceful first night, subsequent nights have seen police use tear gas and smoke to fight back against people throwing Molotov cocktails and aiming guns at officers.

MISSOURI GOV. JAY NIXON

Anyone who doubts Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon's stance against crime need look no further than Missouri's litany of executions. During his four terms as attorney general and two terms as governor, Missouri has executed 66 convicted killers, a total few states can match.

Nixon, 58, also is a Democrat who has been mentioned as a possible presidential or vice presidential candidate in 2016. How things play out in Ferguson could have a dramatic impact on his political future.

Nixon drew criticism in the days immediately following the shooting for keeping a low profile. Since Thursday, he has been at the forefront, first taking over security by putting Ron Johnson in charge. Early Monday, Nixon called in the National Guard to help quell violent protesters.

He acknowledged frustration for those waiting for justice in the Michael Brown case, but said the state ""must defend Ferguson from these violent interlopers so that the peaceful protests can operate in peace and the search for answers and justice can continue.""
___

ATTORNEY BENJAMIN CRUMP

Benjamin Crump became a national figure when he represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager fatally shot by a neighborhood watch organizer in 2012. He's back in the spotlight, representing Michael Brown's family in a case that is equally racially charged.

Crump, 44, was born in North Carolina, one of nine children. Now based in Tallahassee, Florida, he rose to prominence as a lawyer known for his thoughtful prose. At times he seems to fight back his own emotions as he talks about the loss suffered by Brown's parents. To him, the issue is simple.

""I don't want to sugarcoat it,"" Crump said last week. Brown, he said, ""was executed in broad daylight.""

ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER

Almost from the outset, Attorney General Eric Holder has shown a strong interest in the shooting death of Michael Brown.

Two days after Brown was killed, Holder said the case deserved a full review as the Justice Department dispatched its Community Relations Service to Ferguson to try and calm tensions. Soon thereafter, it launched an investigation to see if civil rights violations occurred. On Monday, President Barack Obama announced Holder would visit Ferguson on Wednesday to get an update on the criminal investigation and meet with local leaders.

Holder said aggressively pursuing these types of investigations is ""critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.""

Holder over the weekend ordered a federal medical examiner to perform a third autopsy on Brown, in addition to the St. Louis County autopsy and a private one performed at the request of Brown's family. Holder called the Brown family last week to express his personal condolences.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The Washington Post said the notice, now effective through Aug. 25, was issued at the direction of Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon.

The St. Louis County Police Department had asked for the initial restrictions last week because its helicopter was shot at during looting and unrest. That notice had lasted through Monday. The FAA agreed to order the first round of restrictions early last week to give police helicopters unrestricted access to that airspace.

In the letter to parents Michael Brown Sr and Lesley McSpadden, Sybrina Fulton speaks about losing her 17-year-old son in another senseless act of gun violence and gives advice on how best to cope with the tragic situation they've been thrust into. 

Fulton lost her son Trayvon in 2012 when he was shot dead in the apartment complex where he was living by resident George Zimmerman, who thought the black teen was a burglar. 

Two years later, Fulton says she still hasn't come to terms with the loss of her son, but says she's comforted by the overwhelming support she continues to receive. 

She adds that there is meaningful work in helping other families who have dealt with a similar loss and in raising awareness of the growing issue of gun violence.

'Neither of their lives shall be in vain,' Fulton writes in the letter published by {TIME}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3136685/travyon-sybrina-fulton-ferguson/"">. 'The galvanizations of our communities must be continued beyond the tragedies. While we fight injustice we will also hold ourselves to an appropriate level of intelligent advocacy. 
If they refuse to hear us, we will make them feel us'

Michael Brown was shot dead earlier this month after a confrontation with St Louis police officer Darren Wilson. 

An autopsy report released Sunday revealed he was shot six times, including twice in the head. 

His death has sparked violent protests in Ferguson, where police and protesters have been clashing nearly every night.

While Brown's death has become a national issue, Fulton says this is also a deeply personal issue for the teen's parents. 

'Michael is your son. A son that barely had a chance to live,' she writes, adding that the tragedy is further complicated by the 'fact that the killer of your son is alive, known and currently free'. 

However, Fulton says the Browns should expect to receive a 'well of support from all corners of the world'.

She advises them to surround themselves with 'proven and trusted support' and to honor their son and his life - 'not the circumstances of his alleged transgressions'. 

'I have always said that Trayvon was not perfect. But no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed,' Fulton writes.

DailyMail,daily131,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2727818/Police-protesters-collide-Ferguson.html,"Police, protesters collide again in Ferguson",Associated Press,8/19/2014,1/3/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — Police and protesters collided in the streets of Ferguson again late Monday, a day after the Missouri governor summoned the National Guard to help restore calm to the St. Louis suburb where Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer.

The latest clashes came at the end of a day in which a pathologist hired by the Brown family said the unarmed 18-year-old suffered a bullet wound to his right arm that may indicate his hands were up or his back was turned. But the pathologist said the team that examined Brown cannot be sure yet exactly how the wounds were inflicted until they have more information.

An independent autopsy determined that Michael Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, the family's lawyers and hired pathologists said.

Witnesses have said Brown's hands were above his head when he was repeatedly shot by an officer Aug. 9 in Ferguson.

Protesters filled the streets after nightfall, and officers used bullhorns to order them to disperse. Police deployed noisemakers and armored vehicles to push demonstrators back. During one confrontation, officers fired tear gas and flash grenades. There were no reports of serious injuries.

After the streets had been mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave as well, citing the risk from gunfire that had been reported.

Crowd control remained the responsibly of police, with most of the National Guard units that had been summoned by Gov. Jay Nixon keeping their distance from the protests and protecting a police staging area.

In Washington, President Barack Obama said the vast majority of protesters in Ferguson were peaceful, but warned that a small minority was undermining justice.

During a brief pause in his summer vacation, Obama said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to ""listen and not just shout.""

The president also weighed in for the first time publicly on the militarization of some local police departments, saying it would probably be useful to examine how federal grant dollars had been used to allow local police to purchase military-style equipment.

Attorney General Eric Holder was scheduled to travel to Ferguson later this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death.

Obama said he also spoke to Nixon about his deployment of the National Guard in Ferguson and urged the governor to ensure the Guard was used in a limited way.

Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells, who assisted former New York City chief medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden during the private autopsy, said a bullet grazed Brown's right arm. He said the wound indicates Brown may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position across his chest or face.

""We don't know,"" Parcells said. ""We still have to look at the other (elements) of this investigation before we start piecing things together.""

A third and final autopsy was performed Monday for the Justice Department by one of the military's most experienced medical examiners, Holder said.

Also Monday, Nixon lifted the neighborhood's midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew two days after it went into effect when he declared a state of emergency.

Nixon said the National Guard troops would be under the direction of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, which is overseeing security during protests.

Police told protesters Monday that they could not assemble in a single spot, saying they had to keep moving. In federal court, a judge denied a request from the American Civil 
Liberties Union for a restraining order that would have prevented authorities from enforcing the rule.

Two men were arrested for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse, police said. A photographer for the Getty photo agency was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released.

Authorities were also establishing a designated protest zone for nightly demonstrations. The plan was announced Monday by St. Louis County police. It was not clear what would happen to those who refuse to use the area along West Florissant Avenue, where the majority of protests have occurred.

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney.

The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday. But she declined further comment, saying the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.

Family attorney Benjamin Crump said Brown's parents wanted the additional autopsy because they feared results of the county's examination could be biased. Crump declined to release copies of the report.

""They could not trust what was going to be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child,"" he said during Monday's news conference with Parcells and Baden, who has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

The second autopsy, Crump said, ""verifies that the witness accounts were true: that he was shot multiple times.""

Baden said one of the bullets entered the top of Brown's skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when he suffered that fatal injury. The hired pathologists said Brown, who also was shot four times in the right arm, could have survived the other bullet wounds.

Baden also said there was no gunpowder residue on Brown's body, indicating he was not shot at close range. However, Baden said he did not have access to Brown's clothing, and that it was possible the residue could be on the clothing.

Crump also noted that Brown had abrasions on his face from where he fell to the ground, but there was ""otherwise no evidence of a struggle.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

ISIS militants take to social media to encourage Ferguson protesters to embrace Islamic extremism,John Hall,8/19/2014,1/3/2016,"ISIS militants and their supporters are using social media to encourage protesters in Ferguson to embrace radical Islam and fight against the U.S. government.  

Jihadists in Syria and Iraq and their sympathisers in the West have taken to Twitter to send messages of support to hundreds of demonstrators taking part in a ninth night of angry protests in the U.S. city following the shooting by police of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

The militants' tweets denounce local officers for the way they have attempted to quell the violence, make reference to historic acts of police brutality, and even use the hashtag #FergusonUnderISIS in an attempt to get angry young men in the city to declare allegiance to the Islamist group.

The news comes as footage purportedly taken from the scene of the Ferguson protests appeared to show one demonstrator marching along a street holding a sign reading 'ISIS is here'.

One ISIS sympathiser calling himself Mujahid Miski, who claims to be from Minneapolis–Saint Paul but suggests he is now based in 'the horn of Africa', has led the campaign to encourage those taking part in the protests to embrace radical Islam.

In one message he tweets: 'So how is democracy treating you guys? #FergusonUnderIS #Ferguson.'

He adds: 'I thought u guys back in #Ferguson were supposed to be Free & that u had equal rights. I'd really like to know what changed? #FergusonUnderIS'.

Miski goes on to retweet dozens of messages by a Twitter user with the handle @AmreekiWitness, who claims to monitor and support the growth of radical Islam in the U.S..

Amreeki Witness' messages focus on the treatment of black people in the U.S., praise Malcolm X for embracing Islam and urge angry young black men to take up the religion as it means the police 'will fear you'.

In one message Amreeki Witness mocks the curfew police have imposed in Ferguson to bring an end to the disorder, saying: 'We IS guys hate you for your freedom, eh? Just like that freedom uplifting curfew in #Ferguson? Wake up, or they'll never let you outside.'

As the social media campaign began to take hold, with dozens of radical Islamists commenting on the Ferguson protests, Amreeki Witness tweeted: 'May be time to organize the Muslims in America upon haqq and mobilize to #Ferguson. Defend the oppressed, start jihad here.'

The message attracted a large response, with one Islamist calling himself Amarka Al-Ahlam responding: 'Preach, brother. We must organize brigades in preparation for the oncoming storm. #FergusonUnderIS #JihadinFerguson.'

Amreeki Witness added: 'They cower in fear of us whilst they massacre and oppress you! It's time to strike fear into the hearts of the oppressors. #FergusonUnderIS'.

News of the militants' campaign to encourage Ferguson demonstrators to embrace radical Islamism comes as footage purportedly from a CNN live stream of the protests appeared to show one young man holding a sign reading 'ISIS is here.'

It is not known whether the banner - footage of which has not yet been independently verified - was in support of the militant group or, as seems more likely, it was an attempt to compare ISIS to the local police force or the U.S. government.

Nevertheless stills of the alleged CNN footage were embraced by jihadists who have claimed they prove jihadists are already playing their part in the protests.

Chilling images of the alleged ISIS banner being carried by demonstrators have been widely shared by ISIS sympathisers on social media, who have used them to encourage supporters based in America to travel to Ferguson to further stoke the violence in the city.

News of ISIS' attempt to hijack the Ferguson protests come as Palestinian Twitter users sent messages of support to the demonstrators and gave advice on the best way to cope with the tear gas police are using to disperse crowds.

As images emerged of heavily armed police and armoured tanks on the streets of nearby St Louis, many Palestinian Twitter users expressed their solidarity with demonstrators.

The messages of support from Palestinians come amid reports that many of the Ferguson protesters were heard chanting 'Gaza Strip' as they marched through the heart of the city.

TWO SHOT AS GUNFIRE RINGS OUT IN FERGUSON: GAS MASK-CLAD REPORTERS LOOK ON AS COPS FIRE TEAR GAS AT PROTESTERS ARMED WITH MOLOTOV COCKTAILS IN SCENES RESEMBLING WAR ZONE

Two people were shot during another night of violence in Ferguson as police used stun grenades and tear gas on protesters who hurled rocks and bottles and in some cases Molotov cocktails. 

The ninth night of violence since the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown had started as an evening of peaceful protests. 

But the relatively peaceful protests eventually turned nasty on the streets of the St. Louis suburb after police in riot gear and gas masks formed a barricade and stood watch over the protesters for almost two hours.

As officers sat with guns pointed atop armored vehicles, the authorities used LRAD (Long Range Acoustic Device) crowd control systems to send out a painful noise to try and disperse the crowd.

Around 31 people were arrested overnight as police officers struggled to keep the situation under control, according to CNN.

At a press conference early this morning, Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson defended police actions overnight, including the decision to begin clearing the streets, during which several journalists were taken into custody.

Johnson used the press conference to remind both police and journalists that the world is watching their actions, while vowing to do whatever it took to make the community 'whole' again.

With no curfew in order on Monday, police were strictly enforcing protesters to keep moving along the sidewalk or they were subject to arrest for unlawful assembly.

Eventually things deteriorated rapidly, with reports that shots were fired and Molotov cocktails thrown. One protester ripped out a Do Not Enter street sign and pointed it toward officers. 

Police responded by first throwing tear gas and stun grenades and then moving in with guns drawn to clear the area.

CNN’s Don Lemon and Jack Tapper were presenting live from the middle of protests when teargas was thrown and they got caught up in the melee.

Lemon was quick to put on his bullet proof vest and gas mask while continuing to present live TV. Tapper meanwhile was kind enough to give his mask to a photographer who had been on the receiving end of the tear gas attack.

The reporters were eventually moved on by police, who said it wasn't safe for them to remain because there had been a shooting in the area where the media were presenting from.",138,NA,NA,NA

FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — The National Guard arrived in Ferguson but kept its distance from the streets where protesters clashed again with police, as clouds of tear gas and smoke hung over the St. Louis suburb where Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer.

Protesters filled the streets after nightfall Monday, and officers trying to enforce tighter restrictions at times used bullhorns to order them to disperse. Police deployed noisemakers and armored vehicles to push demonstrators back. Officers fired tear gas and flash grenades.

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said bottles and Molotov cocktails were thrown from the crowd and that some officers had come under heavy gunfire. At least two people were shot and 31 were arrested, he said. He did not have condition updates on those who were shot. Johnson said four officers were injured by rocks or bottles.

Demonstrators no longer faced the neighborhood's midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew, but police told protesters that they could not assemble in a single spot and had to keep moving. 
After the streets had been mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave as well, citing the risk from gunfire that had been reported.

A photographer for the Getty photo agency was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released. Two German reporters were arrested and detained for three hours. 
Conservative German daily Die Welt said correspondent Ansgar Graw and reporter Frank Herrmann, who writes for German regional papers, were arrested after allegedly failing to follow police instructions to vacate an empty street. They said they followed police orders.

Police mistrust still prevalent years after southern police became segregation symbols

WASHINGTON (AP) — For one night, all was well in Ferguson, Missouri. After a change in police command, violent protests decrying the shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown at the hands of white police officer Darren Wilson suddenly gave way to peaceful demonstrations.

A day later, Ferguson police, under pressure to disclose Wilson's name, also revealed that Brown was suspected of stealing cigars from a local store before his deadly encounter with Wilson. That announcement was met with disbelief and anger by several residents, who said police were trying to smear Brown's name to justify his shooting.

And the streets of Ferguson exploded anew.

Brown's death is the latest illustration of deep divisions between minorities and police that have simmered for generations. Concern about the events playing out in Ferguson has coursed all the way up to the White House. President Barack Obama said Attorney General Eric Holder would go to Missouri this week to check on the independent federal investigation into Brown's death.

""In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,"" the president said.

Aiming to defuse a crisis, Obama struggles to find his role as protests rage in Ferguson

WASHINGTON (AP) — When racial tensions erupted midway through his first presidential campaign, Barack Obama came to Philadelphia to decry the ""racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years."" Over time, he said, such wounds, rooted in America's painful history on race, can be healed.

Six years later, the stalemate suddenly seems more entrenched than ever. As Obama pleads for calm and understanding in Ferguson, Missouri, he's struggling to determine what role — if any — the nation's first black president can play in defusing a crisis that has laid bare the profound sense of injustice felt by African-Americans across the country.

As Obama sought to strike the appropriate tone Monday, he appeared to be trapped between the need, as president and commander in chief, to stand up for the government's right to ensure law and order, and the inclination, as an African-American, to empathize with those whose say the killing of an unarmed black man just goes to show how blacks are treated differently by police.

""In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,"" Obama said at the White House, in his most expansive comments to date about the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown just outside St. Louis.

But while Obama lamented the disproportional apprehension of young black men, he pointedly argued that's not solely the fault of overzealous cops. Police officers must be honored and respected for the difficult job they perform, Obama said.

Israel, Palestinians try to hammer out Gaza deal as cease-fire extended for 24 hours

CAIRO (AP) — Palestinian and Israeli negotiators in Cairo resumed indirect talks on Tuesday, trying to hammer out a roadmap for the war-torn Gaza Strip after Egypt announced a 24-hour extension of the cease-fire to allow more time for negotiations.

The extension of the truce fanned hopes of an emerging deal, however vague, though wide gaps remain on key issues, including Israel's blockade of Gaza, its demands for disarmament of the Islamic militant group Hamas and Palestinian demands for a Gaza seaport and an airport.

In an apparent attempt to pressure Hamas, Egypt said early Monday it would co-host an international fundraising conference for Gaza — but only if a deal is reached first.
That appears to play into the hands of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, which is seeking to regain a Gaza foothold, seven years after Hamas ousted it from power in the densely populated coastal strip.

Hamas, whose officials are part of the Palestinian delegation in the Cairo talks, has emerged weaker from the month-long Gaza war.

Officials say Iraqi army clashes with militants outside city of Tikrit

BAGHDAD (AP) — A local official and a resident say clashes have broken out between Iraqi security forces and militants on the outskirts of Tikrit.

They say the clashes began early Tuesday on the southwestern outskirts of the militant-held city of Tikrit, located north of Baghdad.

Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing their safety.

The Iraqi military shelled militant positions inside and outside the city, they said. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

The Islamic State group and other militants occupied Tikrit and the northern city of Mosul in early June.

As US bombs Islamic State group in Iraq, Syria's embattled president strikes them at home

BEIRUT (AP) — As the U.S. military strikes the Islamic State group in Iraq, Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces have significantly stepped up their own campaign against militant strongholds in Syria, carrying out dozens of airstrikes against the group's headquarters in the past two days.

While the government in Damascus has long turned a blind eye to the Islamic State's expansion in Syria — in some cases even facilitating its offensive against mainstream rebels — the group's rapid march on towns and villages in northern and eastern Syria is now threatening to overturn recent gains by government forces.

While Islamic State militants have so far concentrated their attacks against the Western-backed fighters seeking to topple Assad, they have in the past month carried out a major onslaught against Syrian army facilities in northeastern Syria, capturing and slaughtering hundreds of Syrian soldiers and pro-government militiamen in the process.
On Monday, Islamic State fighters were closing in on the last government-held army base in the northeastern Raqqa province, the Tabqa air base, prompting at least 16 Syrian government airstrikes in the area in an attempt to halt their advance.
In the northern city of Aleppo, there is a sense of impending defeat among mainstream rebels as Islamic militants systematically routed them last week in towns and villages only a few kilometers (miles) north of the city. An Islamic State takeover of rebel-held parts of Aleppo also would be disastrous for Syrian government troops who have been gaining ground in the city in past months.

Report: Portable anti-aircraft weapons used by armed groups in Syria pose aviation threat

WASHINGTON (AP) — Armed groups in Syria have an estimated several hundred portable anti-aircraft missiles that could easily be diverted to extremists and used to destroy low-flying commercial planes, according to a new report by a respected international research group. It cites the risk that the missiles could be smuggled out of Syria by terrorists.

The report was released just hours after the Federal Aviation Administration issued a notice Monday to U.S. airlines banning all flights in Syrian airspace. The agency said armed extremists in Syria are ""known to be equipped with a variety of anti-aircraft weapons which have the capability to threaten civilian aircraft."" The agency had previously warned against flights over Syria, but had not prohibited them.

Small Arms Survey, a Switzerland-based research organization that analyzes the global flow of weapons, published its findings Tuesday following last month's lethal missile attack on a passenger jet flying over Ukraine. The report focuses on launchers and missiles known as ""man-portable air defense systems,"" or MANPADS, which are dangerous to planes flying at lower altitudes or ones taking off or landing.

The new report estimated that several hundred anti-aircraft missile systems are already in rebel arsenals. Mostly Russian and Chinese in origin, the weapons have been seized by Syrian opposition militias from government forces and smuggled in from nations sympathetic to the insurgents, the report said.

The most immediate danger is that anti-aircraft weapons, especially newer and sophisticated models, could easily be diverted to extremist groups operating outside Syria, it said. Porous borders and the presence in Iraq and other neighboring countries of groups affiliated with al-Qaida and other extremists heighten the danger that anti-aircraft weapons could spread to other trouble spots.

Govt troops inch closer to rebel-held city in eastern Ukraine

DONETSK, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian officials and military commanders say the government has captured swathes of another town near the key rebel-held stronghold.

Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that one soldier was killed and four wounded when a volunteer battalion came under mortar fire before entering the town of Ilovaysk, 18 kilometers (11 miles) east of Donetsk. Among the wounded is the commander of the Donbass battalion, Semyon Semenchenko, who said government soldiers destroyed three rebel checkpoints and four firing positions in ongoing fighting.

Government efforts to quell the pro-Russian separatist front have focused lately on gradually encircling the largest rebel-controlled city of Donetsk.

Volunteer battalions have proven essential in the government offensive against armed separatists in the mainly Russian-speaking east in April.

Confusion in the brush: Private militias complicate law-enforcement situation on Texas border

MISSION, Texas (AP) — On a recent moonlit night, Border Patrol agents began rounding up eight immigrants hiding in and around a canal near the Rio Grande. A state trooper soon arrived to help. Then out of the darkness emerged seven more armed men in fatigues.

Agents assumed the camouflaged crew that joined in pulling the immigrants from the canal's milky green waters was a tactical unit from the Texas Department of Public Safety. 
Only later did they learn that the men belonged to the Texas Militia, a group that dresses like a SWAT team and carries weapons but has no law-enforcement training or authority of any kind.

The situation ended peacefully with the immigrants getting arrested and the Border Patrol advising the militia members ""to properly and promptly"" identify themselves anytime 
they encounter law-enforcement officers. But the episode was unsettling enough for the Border Patrol to circulate an ""issue paper"" warning other agents.

The presence of armed militia members working on their own in a region known for human smuggling, drug smuggling and illegal immigration has added one more variable to an already complex and tense situation.

Although the Aug. 6 incident in Mission resulted in no harm, it's not hard to imagine deadlier outcomes throughout the Rio Grande Valley, a wide area patrolled by more than 3,000 border agents, as well as hundreds of state troopers, game wardens, deputies and local police officers. Gov. Rick Perry is also sending as many as 1,000 National Guard troops.

Life after 'The Worm': In shadow of Rodman, ex-NFL player on marquee for Pyongyang fight night

TOKYO (AP) — Former NFL player Bob ""The Beast"" Sapp isn't exactly a household name back home in the United States. But he's big in Japan. Very big. And soon he hopes to be living large — for a week, anyway — in North Korea.

Shades of Dennis Rodman, anyone?

Sapp, a 6-foot-5, 350-pound tank of a man who played briefly as a lineman with the Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings before becoming one of Japan's best-known mixed martial arts personalities, will be topping the bill at a martial arts extravaganza in Pyongyang later this month. The two-day event is being staged by a Japanese pro-wrestler-turned-politician in an oddball attempt at sports diplomacy just as relations between North Korea and Japan are beginning to thaw.

""This is the No. 1 unusual and a little bit crazy thing (I've ever done),"" Sapp said of his upcoming trip. ""I've done everything from the NFL, pro wrestling, movies, I made the cover of Time magazine, done all types of commercials and now I'm going to North Korea. You name it, I've done it.""

About 20 wrestlers and martial artists from around the world are expected to attend. Organizers say the event — dubbed, rather blandly, the International Pro-Wrestling 
Festival in Pyongyang — will be broadcast over the Internet, aired on Japanese network television and also shown on North Korean state-run TV.",NA,NA,NA,NA
DailyMail,daily135,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2728772/Second-friend-cop-shot-dead-Michael-Brown-comes-defense-say-s-quiet-respectful-guy.html,He's quiet and respectful': Second friend of cop who shot dead Michael Brown comes to his defense,Louise Boyle,8/19/2014,1/3/2016,"A second friend of Officer Darren Wilson has come forward to defend the cop, describing him as a 'really quiet, well-mannered, respectful guy', who never showed any signs of violence.

The male friend of the Michael Brown shooter spoke to {GMA}<hyperlink=""https://gma.yahoo.com/""> on Tuesday but asked that his identity be concealed for his own safety. 

The friend has been exchanging text messages with the 28-year-old Ferguson officer and said: 'I can tell that this is really hard on him.'

The friend also said that he had played hockey with Wilson for years and had never seen him get into a fight. 

The show of support for Officer Wilson came after a female friend told a radio station this weekend that the cop shot and killed Michael Brown, 18, because the teen tried to grab his gun, punched him in the face and then charged at him on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri. 

A woman calling herself 'Josie' called {The Dana Show}<hyperlink=""http://danaloeschradio.com/alleged-friend-of-officer-darren-wilson-offers-his-side/""> last Friday to say Wilson had told her Brown had 'bum-rushed' him prior to the shooting.  

'Josie', who would only give her first name but said she was friends with the cop's girlfriend, had her account corroborated by a source who said it matched what Wilson told investigators,{CNN}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/18/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1""> reported on Monday. 

The woman said most friends and family were too afraid to speak out but she wanted the public to know Wilson's side of the story.

Josie said that on August 9, Wilson came across Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson walking down the middle of a street in the St Louis suburb and pulled up to tell them to get on to the sidewalk.  

'He pulled up ahead of them. And then he got a call-in that there was a strong-arm robbery. And, they gave a description,' she told {KFTK}<hyperlink=""http://danaloeschradio.com/alleged-friend-of-officer-darren-wilson-offers-his-side/"">.

'And, he’s looking at them and they got something in their hands and it looks like it could be what, you know those cigars or whatever. So he goes in reverse back to them.

'Tries to get out of his car. They slam his door shut violently. I think he said Michael did. And, then he opened the car again. He tried to get out. He stands up.

'And then Michael just bum-rushes him and shoves him back into his car. Punches him in the face and them Darren grabs for his gun. Michael grabbed for the gun. At one point he got the gun entirely turned against his hip.

'And he shoves it away. And the gun goes off.

'Well, then Michael takes off and gets to be about 35 feet away. And, Darren’s first protocol is to pursue. 

'So, he stands up and yells, ''Freeze!'' Michael and his friend turn around.

'And Michael taunts him… And then all the sudden he just started bum-rushing him. He just started coming at him full speed.

So [Wilson] really thinks [Brown] was on something, because he just kept coming. It was unbelievable.

'And so he finally ended up, the final shot was in the forehead, and then he fell about two to three feet in front of the officer.'  

The friend's report, which has not been verified, added to the growing number of different versions of events from the day of the fatal shooting.

According to {St Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""""> crime reporter Christine Byers on Monday, more than a dozen witnesses had backed up Officer Wilson's report of what happened on August 9.

The reporter later admitted she was on maternity leave and her post was 'personal'.

Gilbert Bailon, editor for the St Louis Post-Dispatch, issued a statement which read: 'Christine Byers is a police reporter for the St Louis Post-Dispatch who has been on FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act) since March. She is not involved in the Ferguson coverage while she is on leave. Her tweets are personal.

'She has tweeted today in regards to her tweet Monday: ""On FMLA from papaer. Earlier tweets did not meet standards for publication.""'

Wilson is on paid administrative leave following the shooting and pending the outcome of the investigation.

The 28-year-old officer won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February this year.

'He never intended for any of this to happen,' Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson said. 'It’s devastating, absolutely devastating.' 

Assistant pathologist Shawn Parcells told {CNN}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/videos/""> on Monday afternoon that it cannot be proved from the initial autopsy whether Brown was rushing the officer or simply standing at a distance.

Earlier on Monday, an eye-witness to the shooting released a video of Brown in the street with Wilson pacing back and forth beside his lifeless body in the street.

Piaget Crenshaw lives in an apartment with a balcony overlooking the street where the 18-year-old was killed.  She said today that she waited until now to release the video as 
she feared for her safety and the officer's name had not been released. 

She told {CNN}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/videos/""> today that she had recorded the incident because she believed that something was wrong. 

'From it all initially happening, I knew this was not right,' Miss Crenshaw said. 'I knew the police shouldn't have been chasing this boy and firing at the same time. 

'And the fact he got shot in his face, something clicked in me and I thought someone else should see this so I recorded.'

The radio caller's version of events also contradicted the statement of Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson who said at press conference on Friday that Officer Wilson was unaware of the store robbery when he stopped Brown.

Chief Jackson released the name of Officer Wilson last Friday after mounting public pressure. He had waited after saying that the officer received death threats on social media.  

The Brown family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said on Monday that the teenager had been 'executed in broad daylight' as the results of their independent autopsy were revealed. 

Michael Brown died from a 'kill shot' to the top of the head, medical examiner Dr Michael Baden revealed today - but could have survived his five other bullet wounds.

Dr Baden told a press conference in Ferguson, Missouri on Monday that he had reassured the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, that her son did not suffer.

The family's autopsy, which was released on Sunday, revealed the unarmed 18-year-old had been shot at least six times by Wilson. 

Eye-witnesses have also claimed that Brown had his hands up to signal that he was surrendering. 

The shooting of the unarmed black teenager has sparked eight days of protests in the once quiet Missouri suburb. 

Protests over the teen's shooting on August 9 had seen looting and violence in the area. Following a brief calm, trouble returned at the end of last week, prompting Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to put a curfew in place from midnight to 5am. 

Nixon lifted the curfew on Monday while ordering the National Guard to help restore order.

He deployed the Guard Monday following an overnight clash between armored police and what he called ‘a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community'.   

Nixon said the Guard will be under the direction of the state Highway Patrol.",18,NA,NA,NA

Now Egypt puts the boot in as it urges U.S. authorities to 'exercise restraint' in dealing with Missouri riots,John Hall,8/19/2014,1/3/2016,"Egypt has taken the unusual step of urging the U.S. to exercise restraint in dealing with racially charged demonstrations in Ferguson, Missouri.

Echoing language Washington used to caution the Cairo government as it cracked down on Islamist protesters last year, Egypt's Foreign Ministry said it was 'closely following' the escalation of violent protests following the shooting dead by police of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. 

It is highly unusual for Egypt to criticise such a major donor, and it was not immediately clear why the government would have taken such a step at this stage.

The development came as ISIS militants used social media to encourage protesters in Ferguson to embrace radical Islam and fight against the U.S. government. 

Ties between Washington and Cairo were strained after Egyptian security forces killed hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters following the army's ousting of freely elected President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013.

Western allies have voiced concern about the democratic credentials of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief who toppled Mursi and went on to win elections.

The United States has, however, continued to provide military and other support to Cairo.

In a statement released today, however, Egypt's Foreign Ministry's urged the U.S. government to exercise restraint when dealing with the Ferguson protesters.

The wording of the statement read similarly to a message issued by Barack Obama's administration in July 2013, when the White House 'urged security forces to exercise maximum restraint and caution' in dealing with demonstrations by Morsi supporters.

Egypt today said it was 'closely following the escalation of protests' in Ferguson, which began after the fatal shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old black teenager Michael Brown by white policeman Darren Wilson, 28, on August 9.

Nine days of violent protests have since taken place, with demonstrators shooting at police at officers criticised for a 'heavy handed' effort to disperse the crowds.

Human Rights Watch said in a report last week that Egyptian security forces systematically used excessive force against Islamist protesters after Morsi was ousted in 2013.

Egypt said the report was 'characterised by negativity and bias'.

News of Egypt's intervention in the protests come as ISIS militants and their supporters used social media to encourage demonstrators to embrace radical Islam and fight against the U.S. government.

Jihadists in Syria and Iraq and their sympathisers in the West have taken to Twitter to send messages of support to hundreds of demonstrators taking part in a ninth night of angry protests.

The militants' tweets denounce local officers for the way they have attempted to quell the violence, make reference to historic acts of police brutality, and even use the hashtag #FergusonUnderISIS in an attempt to get angry young men in the city to declare allegiance to the Islamist group.

Additionally, footage purportedly taken from the scene of the Ferguson protests appeared to show one demonstrator marching along a street holding a sign reading 'ISIS is here'.

One ISIS sympathiser calling himself Mujahid Miski, who claims to be from Minneapolis–Saint Paul but suggests he is now based in 'the horn of Africa', has led the campaign to encourage those taking part in the protests to embrace radical Islam.

In one message he tweets: 'So how is democracy treating you guys? #FergusonUnderIS #Ferguson.

He adds: 'I thought u guys back in #Ferguson were supposed to be Free & that u had equal rights. I'd really like to know what changed? #FergusonUnderIS'.

Miski goes on to retweet dozens of messages by a Twitter user with the handle @AmreekiWitness, who claims to monitor and support the growth of radical Islam in the U.S..

Amreeki Witness' messages focus on the treatment of black people in the U.S., praise Malcolm X for embracing Islam and urge angry young black men to take up the religion as it means the police 'will fear you'.

In one message Amreeki Witness mocks the curfew police have imposed in Ferguson to bring an end to the disorder, saying: 'We IS guys hate you for your freedom, eh? Just like that freedom uplifting curfew in #Ferguson? Wake up, or they'll never let you outside.'

As the social media campaign began to take hold, with dozens of radical Islamists commenting on the Ferguson protests, Amreeki Witness tweeted: 'May be time to organize the Muslims in America upon haqq and mobilize to #Ferguson. Defend the oppressed, start jihad here.'

The message attracted a large response, with one Islamist calling himself Amarka Al-Ahlam responding: 'Preach, brother. We must organize brigades in preparation for the oncoming storm. #FergusonUnderIS #JihadinFerguson.'

Amreeki Witness added: 'They cower in fear of us whilst they massacre and oppress you! It's time to strike fear into the hearts of the oppressors. #FergusonUnderIS'.

News of the militants' campaign to encourage Ferguson demonstrators to embrace radical Islamism comes as footage purportedly from a CNN live stream of the protests appeared to show one young man holding a sign reading 'ISIS is here.'

According to new research from the {Pew Center}<hyperlink=""http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/"">, almost half of white people (47 per cent) surveyed think that race is getting too much attention in Ferguson compared to 18 per cent of black people and 25 per cent of Hispanics who feel the same way. 

Some 61 per cent of Republicans think that racial issues are grabbing too many headlines compared to 21 per cent of Democrats and 46 per cent of Independents, according to the poll of 1,000 adults.

Another survey question show a racial divide in trusting the police to carry out a thorough investigation. 

More than half (52 per cent) of white people surveyed said they had confidence in the shooting investigation compared to only 18 per cent of black people.  

The research appeared to lend support to the tone of some conservative commentators who have been quick to slam Obama for his perceived racial basis.

The President called for understanding in the face of racially-charged anger on Monday, saying that the vast majority of protesters in a St. Louis suburb were peaceful, but warned that a small minority was undermining justice.

He expressed sympathy for the 'passions and anger' sparked by the death of Brown but said giving in to that anger through looting and attacks on police only stirs tensions and leads to further chaos.

He said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to 'listen and not just shout.'

'That's how we're going to move forward together, by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another,' Obama told reporters at the White House. 

Fox News host Todd Starnes tweeted about another comment Obama had made after a reporter's question about racial tensions in Ferguson.

Starnes posted: 'Obama: ""I have to be very careful about not pre-judging."" Well, that train has already left the station.'

Conservative lawyer {Larry Klayman}<hyperlink=""""> accused the President of starting a 'race war' and giving preferential treatment to his 'black brothers'. 

Journalist Daniel Greenfield wrote a piece for {FrontPage}<hyperlink=""http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/238806/obamas-racism-fun-and-profit-daniel-greenfield#.U_J9nXpzhiI.twitter""> magazine entitled 'Obama's Racism For Fun And Profit' where he remarked: 'Obama sends racial and post-racial signals...He tends to avoid explicitly racist rhetoric. Instead he empowers those who do.'

The Pew research on Ferguson followed a study on Monday which found more than half of black Americans think Officer Darren Wilson should be convicted of murdering Michael Brown - compared to just 17 per cent of white Americans.

The results, from a survey carried out by {Rasmussen}<hyperlink=""http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/august_2014/a_tale_of_two_cities_blacks_whites_sharply_disagree_about_ferguson"">, revealed a stark difference in attitudes towards the death of the 18-year-old, which has sparked riots in the St Louis suburb and across the U.S.

Nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of the 1,000 American adults surveyed believe Wilson should be found guilty of murder, while another quarter (26 per cent) thought he was acting in self defense when he gunned down the unarmed teenager in broad daylight on August 9.

But 57 per cent of black adults think he should be convicted compared to only 17 per cent of white Americans and 24 per cent of other minority Americans.

Of those who are undecided about what should happened to Wilson, most - 56 per cent - are white.

The survey results also showed that black Americans are more convinced that the violent riots since the killing are legitimate outrage rather than criminal activity. 

Police have said they fired tear gas and rubber bullets in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails over the weekend.

Exactly a quarter of all those surveyed said they believed the protests have mostly been legitimate outrage, whereas 52 per cent think the riots have been carried out by criminals taking advantage of the situation.  

Among these, 54 per cent of white Americans and 53 per cent of other minorities think the violence is mostly down to criminals, compared to 35 per cent of black people surveyed.

In addition, black Americans are more likely to think the protests are legitimate anger.

As tension grows in Ferguson, the Missouri State Police and the state National Guard have been called in to help deal with the violence.

Of those who took part in the survey, 27 per cent believe the police have responded well, while a similar percentage - 28 - call their response 'poor'. 

The results also showed that black Americans were more than twice as likely as whites and other minority adults to rate the police response as poor.

The racial divide apparent in the survey results is reminiscent of the trial of George Zimmerman, who shot dead an unarmed African-American teenager in Florida in 2012. Zimmerman was found not guilty at a trial last year.

This latest survey shows that eight out of ten black voters believe the system is unfair to minorities.

Brown, 18, was shot dead on August 9 and sustained six bullet wounds, including the fatal shot to the top of his head. His killer was identified as Darren Wilson, who has since been placed on paid administrative leave.

The survey by Rasmussen Reports was carried out on August 15 and 16 and involved 1,000 people. ",106,NA,NA,Hyperlink for Larry Klayman doesn't seem to work

Darren Wilson text messaged a close friend to say that he can't leave protective custody because he would be immediately recognized - making him and his young child a target.

In his messages Wilson, 28, also thanked for the support of his friends which he said was 'really keeping me going'.

He had texted Jake Shepard, his friend of 14 years, who showed the messages to MailOnline because he wanted the public to get a more accurate picture of the friend he described as always having 'pure intentions'. 

Shepard, 28, said he felt that there were two sides to this story and that he wanted to re-balance the coverage of the death of Michael Brown, 18.

Brown's killing has sparked nine nights of riots and protest in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri.

Shepard told MailOnline he thinks Wilson did the right thing according to his training. But he believes that the police in general should have better training to use non-lethal force before opening fire.

He said: 'It's sad for Mike Brown and his family. Darren could have just Tasered him and Mike would have spent six months in jail or something and maybe got his act together after that.

'Darren could have gone on with his life too but now both of their lives are over. It sucks. 

'STAY SAFE': TEXTS FROM WILSON TO SHEPARD

Friday, August 15 

(After Shepard does CNN interview)

Wilson: 'Thanks buddy I wasn’t expecting that

Shepard: 'No problem buddy, you deserve it'

Wilson: 'It means a lot thank you'
 ....

Monday, August 18: 

Wilson: 'The support is really keeping me going during this stressful time. Just stay safe. I appreciate all you have done'

Later...

Wilson: 'I can't go out' 

'I'm sure Mike's family is having a hard time but at least they have the support of the whole nation behind them, openly. Darren doesn't get that'.

Shepard's comments came as people have begun to come out in support of Wilson, who lives in a quiet middle class suburb of St Louis in a ranch style house.

A rally took place on Sunday in downtown St Louis where around 100 people - many of them cops - held up posters in support and cheered as drivers honked their horns. Two Facebook pages have been set up to back him with a total of 35,000 likes.

The first text that Wilson sent to Shepard was on Friday after he spoke to CNN in a brief interview.

It read: 'Thanks buddy I wasn't expecting that'. Shepard replied: 'No problem buddy, you deserve it.'

Wilson replied: 'It means a lot thank you.' 

The two then texted over the weekend and Darren explained that he cannot go out in public and that anyone wanting to reach him should leave their messages with the Ferguson police department.

On Monday Wilson texted: 'The support is really keeping me going during this stressful time. Just stay safe. I appreciate all you have done'.

... Now both of their lives are over. It sucks. I'm sure Mike's family is having a hard time but at least they have the support of the whole nation behind them, openly. Darren doesn't get that'
                         - Friend Jake Shepard 

In another message he told Shepard that due to all the attention: 'I can’t go out'.

Shepard told MailOnline: 'People are very suspicious of law enforcement as it is and something like this happens you will always be remembered as the cop who murdered Mike Brown, regardless of what happens at trial or if he's ever charged or fired.

'Obviously he's not going to be able to be a cop over there (in Ferguson) any more.

'He’s going to have to resign but there's always going to be a negative connotation to his name, and it sucks. He doesn't deserve that.

'He's had pure intentions with everything I've ever seen him try and do. When we played hockey he wasn't the guy out there trying to fight people, he didn't care about stuff like that.

'He just wanted to play and have fun with his friends'.

Asked if he knew where Wilson is now, Shepard said: 'I know he’s safe because I have a friend in law enforcement who said he has been put under protection and guard 24 hours a day.'

'I feel like he's still around (St Louis)'.

Shepard said that he first met Wilson in 2000 when they were in the same year at St Charles West High School and that they played hockey together.

After that Wilson attended Saint Charles Community College between 2004 and 2005 where he studied criminology and criminal justice, the institution’s president Dr Ron Chesbrough told MailOnline.

Wilson went back to the same college in 2011 and completed a criminology course - by then he was a policeman.

Describing his friend, Shepard said: 'He’s pretty shy, we had hockey practice three or four nights a week so you get to know people.

'He's the type of guy who never had anything bad to say about anyone. Through all of this people are always asking me questions about what he's like and I realized that when you're talking to him he's never talking about himself, he's always asking about you and what's going on with you.

'He’s happy to be around his friends, he goes with the flow, he's laid back….he's just a normal guy'.

After Wilson was named as the officer involved in the shooting, Shepard was one of the first to come to his defense and wrote on Facebook that he 'has the biggest heart'.

Shepard said that Wilson 'had a rough life' because his mother died when he was 16 and his biological father lives in another state, meaning that he never really had parents for much of his youth.

Whenever he asked Wilson about it he did not like to talk about the past, Shepard said. 

Another of Wilson's friends spoke out earlier in the week. A woman calling herself 'Josie' called radio program {The Dana Show}<hyperlink=""http://danaloeschradio.com/alleged-friend-of-officer-darren-wilson-offers-his-side/""> last Friday to say he had told her Brown had 'bum-rushed' him prior to the shooting.

‘Josie', who would only give her first name but said she was friends with the cop's girlfriend, had her account corroborated by a source who said it matched what Wilson told investigators, CNN reported on Monday.

According to the St Louis Post-Dispatch more than a dozen witnesses have backed up Officer Wilson's report of what happened on August 9.

Meanwhile, Wilson’s father, John Wilson, 60, - who lives in Texas - has been nervously watching the Ferguson furor play out on national TV news and talk shows.

'It goes without saying that I love my son very much,' Mr Wilson told MailOnline as he stood on the wooden deck outside his single-story prefab home on a remote country lane, east of Houston.

Mr Wilson said that he has spoken to his son since the shooting but he was reluctant to reveal what father and son spoke about or how Darren is handling the tense situation he is in.

'The police have chosen not to make any comment about my son, other than to release his name,' added Mr Wilson. 'And Darren himself has not made a statement. So until they do come out and say something, I am not going to talk about it either.'",321,NA,NA,NA

Hedy Epstein, who helped the Allies convict Nazi war criminals during the Nuremberg trials after the Second World War, took part in a march from Kiener Plaza to the Wainwright building that houses Governor Jay Nixon’s office on Monday.

The group, numbering over 100, chanted ‘National Guard has got to go’, before several were arrested for ‘failing to disperse’.

Some of the protesters had linked arms in front of the building, blocking the doorway.

As Ms Epstein was led away by St Louis Metropolitan Police she told {The Nation}<hyperlink=""http://www.thenation.com/authors/steven-hsieh/"">: ‘I’ve been doing this since I was a teenager. I didn’t think I would have to do it when I was 90. We need to stand up today so that people won’t have to do this when they’re 90.’

Her arrest follows that of a Getty Images journalist, who was detained and subsequently released.

Photographer Scott Olson said he was ‘arrested for just doing my job’. As with previous arrests of journalists over the past week, no charges were filed against Olson, who by Monday night was back shooting photos.

The shooting of the unarmed black teenager by white cop Darren Wilson has sparked eight days of protests in the once quiet St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.

Protests over the teen's shooting on August 9 had seen looting and violence in the area. Following a brief calm, trouble returned at the end of last week, prompting Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to put a curfew in place from midnight to 5am.

Nixon lifted the curfew on Monday while ordering the National Guard to help restore order.

He deployed the Guard Monday following an overnight clash between armored police and what he called ‘a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community'.

Nixon said the Guard will be under the direction of the state Highway Patrol.

Meanwhile, a second friend of Officer Wilson has come forward to defend the cop, describing him as a 'really quiet, well-mannered, respectful guy', who never showed any signs of violence.

The male friend of the Michael Brown shooter spoke to GMA on Tuesday but asked that his identity be concealed for his own safety.

The friend has been exchanging text messages with the 28-year-old Ferguson officer and said: 'I can tell that this is really hard on him.'",38,NA,NA,NA
DailyMail,daily141,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2728619/As-protests-rage-Obama-struggles-role.html,"As protests rage, Obama struggles to find his role",Associated Press,8/19/2014,1/4/2016,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When racial tensions erupted midway through his first presidential campaign, Barack Obama came to Philadelphia to decry the ""racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years."" Over time, he said, such wounds, rooted in America's painful history on race, can be healed.

Six years later, the stalemate suddenly seems more entrenched than ever. As Obama pleads for calm and understanding in Ferguson, Missouri, he's struggling to determine what role — if any — the nation's first black president can play in defusing a crisis that has laid bare the profound sense of injustice felt by African-Americans across the country.

As Obama sought to strike the appropriate tone Monday, he appeared to be trapped between the need, as president and commander in chief, to stand up for the government's right to ensure law and order, and the inclination, as an African-American, to empathize with those whose say the killing of an unarmed black man just goes to show how blacks are treated differently by police.

""In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,"" Obama said at the White House, in his most expansive comments to date about the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown just outside St. Louis.

But while Obama lamented the disproportional apprehension of young black men, he pointedly argued that's not solely the fault of overzealous cops. Police officers must be honored and respected for the difficult job they perform, Obama said.

""There are young black men that commit crime,"" the president said. ""We can argue about why that happens — because of the poverty they were born into and the lack of opportunity or school systems that fail them or what have you — but if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted, because every community has an interest in public safety.""

It's a delicate balance that's likely to leave no one fully satisfied.

Aiming to reassure edgy Americans that the federal government is fully engaged, Obama announced that Attorney General Eric Holder would travel Wednesday to Ferguson to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death. Obama said he also spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who has deployed National Guard units, and urged him to ensure the use of those units is limited and constructive. ""I'll be watching over the next several days,"" the president said.

But there are no plans for Obama himself to visit Ferguson soon. White House officials said they were mindful that a presidential visit, with all the security and logistics required, could divert law enforcement resources that are already stretched thin.

Obama also called for the U.S. to reassess the militarization of local police departments that have purchased military gear from the Pentagon. Federal grants for such equipment have come under intense scrutiny amid the alarming images of armored vehicles and tear gas canisters filling the streets of an American suburb.

""There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement,"" Obama said. ""We don't want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions.""

Yet for all the talk of procurement and sentencing disparities and police tactics, Obama has steadfastly avoided personalizing this latest bout of racial friction.

Unlike in 2013, when Obama declared that slain teen Trayvon Martin ""could have been me,"" Obama has been careful not to describe Brown's death through the lens of his own experience as an African-American.

And unlike in 2009, when Obama exacerbated tensions by saying police acted ""stupidly"" by arresting a black Harvard University professor at his own home, this time Obama is leaving the fault-finding to investigators. Obama said Monday he has to be careful about appearing to put his thumb on the scale by weighing in while a federal probe is underway.

Witnesses have said Brown's hands were above his head when an officer shot him repeatedly on Aug. 9 in Ferguson. But police have said the officer was physically assaulted during a struggle over his weapon. Meanwhile, the aggressive police response to the subsequent protests has drawn criticism from across the U.S.

Obama's impassive response to the unrest in Ferguson contrasts with a second-term approach in which he generally has been more willing to engage on issues of race. In his remarks Monday, which came during a brief break from Obama's two-week vacation on Martha's Vineyard, the president pointed to his signature initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which aims to bring government, business and nonprofit groups together to empower young minorities to pursue a better future.

""We're making some significant progress as people of good will of all races are ready to chip in,"" Obama said. ""But that requires that we build and not tear down, and that requires we listen and not just shout.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Reporters in Missouri have tallied up stories from at least 12 witnesses who back the account of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown, 18, last week.

Still, a civil rights verdict against Wilson could subject him to execution under federal law.

The DOJ is conducting interviews with an eye toward determining if a federal case will be made of the shooting, regardless of whether the state of Missouri charges Wilson with murder or manslaughter.

It's conceivable that he might not be charged for killing the teen, but still face a trial in federal court for violating his civil rights.

Americans who act 'under color of law' – including police officers – to deprive a person of his constitutional rights 'by reason of his color, or race' can be convicted of violating the {civil rights law}<hyperlink=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/242"">.

'And if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section,' the law reads, offenders can be 'imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.'

Attorney General Eric Holder will pay a visit to the Missouri flashpoint zone on Wednesday.

'I intend to meet with FBI investigators, and prosecutors on the ground from the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney’s Office officials about the ongoing investigation,' {Holder}<hyperlink=""http://molwps.andweb.dmgt.net/www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-873.html""> said Monday in a statement.

'As I informed the president this afternoon, the full resources of the Department of Justice are being committed to our federal civil rights investigation into the death of Michael Brown.'

'During the day today,' he added, 'more than 40 FBI agents continued their canvassing of the neighborhood where Michael Brown was shot.'

Brown's grandfather also demanded on Monday that Barack Obama visit him there personally, but Obama had dodged a question hours earlier about whether he'll make the trip.

And Democrats in Congress are reluctant to ask the president to go – sticking with political loyalties instead of putting him on the hot seat.

Les McSpadden spoke to Al Sharpton on {MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/obama-weighs-in-on-brown-case-319270979880""> Monday night, saying that Obama owes him a visit to calm the waters after his grandson met his end on a Ferguson street after an alleged strong-arm robbery.

'America is built on people coming together at times like this, and now is the time for my president to step forward,' McSpadden told the community organizer-turned-TV-host. 
'I want to say this to my President: I voted for you, so you ought to be able to meet with me.'

So far, though, Obama's allies in the Congressional Black Caucus are declining the opportunity to pressure him into going.

Obama himself ducked the question on Monday during a press conference at the White House after a reporter asked him, 'Have you considered going yourself?' 

He dodged by suggesting he didn't want to get directly involved when a federal investigation into the shooting is underway.

'I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed,' the president said.

Instead, he said his role would be 'to get at those root causes' of race-based civil unrest – a nod to his 'My Brother's Keeper' initiative, aimed at black men.

Obama is sending Attorney General Eric Holder to Ferguson in his stead. The nation's top law enforcement official – also, like Obama, an African-American – will arrive Wednesday.

MailOnline reached out to a dozen members of the black caucus, all African-American federal lawmakers. None would offer even a hint of suggestion that Obama should make the trip himself, and none would speak on the record.

Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver said Monday on MSNBC that 'I don't think the president needs to come to Ferguson. 'It adds another distortion. We don't need that now.'

But that has been the only weigh-in from a black member of Congress, even as the St. Louis suburb's streets have become a virtual war zone amid racial tensions.

All the chaos, one congressional aide to a Black Caucus member told MailOnline, is leading congressmen and women to keep their powder dry.

'No one wants to be the one who demands Obama come down there, and then things get worse. Everybody loses that way, and this is a killer election year,' the staffer said on condition of anonymity.

Four press secretaries said plainly, but only on background, that their bosses would be steering clear of the controversy entirely.

Brown, 18, was shot six times as he allegedly charged a white police officer, drawing riots from the black community in Ferguson – and an aggressive police reaction complete with military vehicles and arms provided by the federal government.

A tired-looking Obama said Monday that the law enforcement's paramilitary show of force could indicate that the Pentagon has gone too far in outfitting police forces with surplus gear.

'There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,' the president said at the White House. 'That would be contrary to our tradition.'

But he has no plans to visit what has become the latest Ground Zero in America's continuing racial divide.

DailyMail,daily145,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2728597/Many-communities-mistrust-police.html,Many communities still mistrust police,Associated Press,8/19/2014,1/4/2016,"WASHINGTON (AP) — For one night, all was well in Ferguson, Missouri. After a change in police command, violent protests decrying the shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown at the hands of white police officer Darren Wilson suddenly gave way to peaceful demonstrations.

A day later, Ferguson police, under pressure to disclose Wilson's name, also revealed that Brown was suspected of stealing cigars from a local store before his deadly encounter with Wilson. That announcement was met with disbelief and anger by several residents, who said police were trying to smear Brown's name to justify his shooting.
And the streets of Ferguson exploded anew.

Brown's death is the latest illustration of deep divisions between minorities and police that have simmered for generations. Concern about the events playing out in Ferguson has coursed all the way up to the White House. President Barack Obama said Attorney General Eric Holder would go to Missouri this week to check on the independent federal investigation into Brown's death.

""In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,"" the president said.

The depth of this distrust becomes obvious in polling. While the unrest was occurring in Missouri, almost two-thirds of blacks — 65 percent — surveyed by the Pew Research Center said police went too far in their response to the Ferguson protests, while one-third of whites agreed and nearly another third said the police response has been about right. The Pew survey was conducted Aug. 14-17.

Police long have tried to overcome their image as symbols of oppression, images brought to the forefront during the civil rights movement by officers like Bull Connor turning attack dogs and water hoses on protesters in Alabama in 1963.

One factor that breeds distrust is racial disparity between police and the communities they serve, experts say. Ferguson is nearly 70 percent black, while the police department is more than 90 percent white.

Distrust is also fueled by a perception of unchecked police violence through the ages: the 1992 acquittal of four white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of black motorist Rodney King; the 1967 beating in Newark, New Jersey, of cab driver John Smith; Miami in 1980, after the acquittal of six white police officers in the beating death of black motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie; Cincinnati in 2001 after 19-year-old Timothy Thomas was shot and killed by a police officer. Rioting followed each of these cases.

""More African-Americans and Latinos believe police stop people without due cause, use excessive force and engage in verbal abuse than white Americans,"" said Ronald Weitzer, a George Washington University sociology professor who has studied race and policing in the U.S. and internationally.

Brown was shot multiple times by Wilson on Aug. 9. Police have said little about the encounter, except that it involved a scuffle in which Wilson was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say Brown had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

Tensions boiled over after a candlelight vigil the next night, as looters smashed and burned businesses, while police fired tear gas and smoke bombs. Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is black, was placed in charge of security, a move that was cheered in Ferguson.

But things escalated again Aug. 15, after Ferguson police released Wilson's name along with video they said showed Brown robbing a store shortly before he was killed. Brown's family condemned the revelation.

Weitzer described several different forms of police behavior that breed distrust, particularly among black and Latino males. That included unwarranted stops of individuals on the street by police, such as New York police's highly criticized ""stop-and-frisk"" tactic, he said.

""They're not only more likely to be stopped by police and subjected to some kind of abuse, but it also happens repeatedly, and this is something we don't see in the white community,"" Weitzer said.

Although the St. Louis County medical examiner had conducted an autopsy, Brown's family ordered their own. Family attorney Benjamin Crump said Monday that Brown's parents ""could not trust what was going to be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child."" The Justice Department planned to conduct its own autopsy.

Without directly referencing the video revelation, Holder said he was troubled by ""the selective release of sensitive information"" surrounding Brown's case, and said his agency would preserve the integrity of its investigation, ""no matter how others pursue their own separate inquiries.""

""This is a critical step in restoring trust between law enforcement and the community, not just in Ferguson, but beyond,"" Holder said.

American University professor Cathy Lisa Schneider, who wrote a book on urban unrest, said distrust breeds frustration with police when there is no avenue of redress ""and usually an increasing intensity of police violence.""

It's ""almost always cases of where the local authorities are completely impervious to the concerns of people who are vulnerable to police violence and do not know how to stop it,"" Schneider said. ""It is the most potent symbol of racial domination and subjection. It is also the most painful.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

A large crowd gathered behind police tape as news of the fatal shooting spread, raising their arms and chanting, 'hands up, don't shoot', a refrain which has become the war-cry for protesters on the streets of nearby Ferguson following the cop killing of Michael Brown.  

A St Louis police chief waded into the crowd on Tuesday to explain what had happened in an effort to calm tensions following the second police shooting in the city in ten days.

The suspect, 23, charged at officers waving the knife when he was killed at 12.30pm, Police Chief Sam Dotson said. 

There are now fears that the shooting could cause tensions to boil over again tonight in Ferguson. On Monday 78 arrests were made, the majority for people refusing to disperse when ordered by police.

Ferguson's leaders urged residents on Tuesday to stay home after dark to 'allow peace to settle in' where the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Brown has sparked nightly clashes between protesters and police.

Today's shooting took place outside the Six Stars Market, four miles from Ferguson which has been rocked by unrest over last week's cop shooting of black teenager Michael Brown. 

No officers were injured in today's incident. The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. 

The suspect stole two energy drinks, according to {KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/BREAKING-Officer-involved-shooting-in-St-Louis-271876701.html"">, left the store but then returned to take a pastry. 
{Fox}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/19/officer-involved-shooting-in-north-st-louis-2/""> reported that the man, who was behaving 'erratically', got into a dispute with the owner who called 911.

When police arrived, the man reportedly shouted: 'Shoot me now, kill me now.'

The 23-year-old was holding the knife in an overhand grip, the police chief said today. 

The officers left their patrol car without their weapons drawn and warned the man multiple times to drop the weapon, the police chief said. 

However when the man charged at them with the knife raised and was within three or four feet, they opened fire and killed him.

The officers who shot the man were placed on administrative duty pending an investigation into the death. 

Chief Dotson waded into the crowd today to share more details about the police's initial investigation, in an apparent effort to calm tensions. 

Bystanders asked why the man was not Tasered, according to a reporter for {Msnbc}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/st-louis-shooting"">.

Tasers are not standard issue for the St Louis Police Department, {Christopher Hayes}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/501818456728436737""> reported. 

A heavy police presence was on the scene cordoning off the area with crime scene tape and blocking intersections with patrol vehicles.

The cop shooting on Tuesday comes ten days after a police officer in a St Louis suburb shot dead an unarmed teenager.

Officer Darren Wilson fired at least six shots at 18-year-old Michael Brown on August 9 in Ferguson, killing him in the street. 

The National Guard arrived in Ferguson Monday but kept its distance from the streets during another night of unrest.

Protesters filled the streets after nightfall Monday, and officers trying to enforce tighter restrictions at times used bullhorns to order them to disperse.

Police deployed noisemakers and armored vehicles to push demonstrators back. Officers fired tear gas and flash grenades. 

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said bottles and Molotov cocktails were thrown from the crowd and that some officers had come under heavy gunfire. 

Demonstrators no longer faced the neighborhood's midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew, but police told protesters that they could not assemble in a single spot and had to keep moving. After the streets had been mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave as well, citing the risk from the reported gunfire.",493,NA,NA,NA

Usually, Kass, the president's senior policy adviser for nutrition, cooks dinner for the first family at the White House. But yesterday the president went to his aide's home for dinner instead.

The two were joined for dinner by the president's deputy chief of staff, Anita Breckenridge. 

First Lady Michelle Obama is still on Martha's Vineyard. She did not accompany the president and their daughter Malia back to Washington on Sunday evening.

The White House provided no additional details on Obama's dinner last night, and the press never saw the president enter or exit Kass' building.

Kass and the Obama family are close, having known each other from their days in Chicago, Illinois. Kass's family lived in the same neighborhood as the Obamas, and his father taught Malia's fifth-grade class.

When the Obama family moved to Washington, Kass did, too, taking a job as assistant chef at the White House and later food initiative coordinator.

While the White House chef handles formal dinners for the president, Kass serves as the Obama family's personal cook. He is also the executive director of the first lady's Let's Move! program. 

Kass and President Barack Obama are close personal friends as well and regularly golf together. They also known to frequently play basketball and pool against each other at the White House.

'He is a close enough friend that he’s almost a family member,' Richard Wolffe, a friend of Kass and the author of three books about the Obamas, told Vogue.

The president spent most of yesterday in meetings at the White House, then made a live statement on the fighting in Iraq and Ferguson, Missouri, before ducking out to visit Kass.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the family of Michael Brown, says the exact time and location for the memorial has not been finalized.

The shooting of the unarmed Brown by officer Darren Wilson has stoked more than a week of unrest in the city. Police have used tear gas, sound projectors and other means to turn back demonstrators, some of whom have lobbed Molotov cocktails and bottles at officers.

Kelly, 72, who served as New York City's top cop for more than a decade, had some harsh words for Ferguson’s law enforcement, calling on the town's officials to release information about the shooting of the 18-year-old unarmed black teenager.

In a phone interview with {Bloomberg News}<hyperlink=""""> Tuesday, Kelly said that the Ferguson Police Department might have prevented some of the violence that engulfed the community had it been forthcoming with the details of the deadly confrontation between Brown and Officer Darren Warner.

‘It certainly has the potential for quelling or lessening disturbances,’ Kelly told Bloomberg News. ‘You tell them what you know and tell them what you don’t know, rather than dribbling it out.’

Kelly, who currently heads risk management services for real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Inc, was likely alluding to his department's response to the 2006 killing of Sean Bell - an unarmed African-American man who was fatally shot by officers 50 times outside a Queens nightclub on the eve of his wedding.

Bell's violent death sparked anger among African-American leaders and the community at large, but no widespread riots or looting.

Officer Wilson shot Brown six times August 9, but it was not until nearly a week later that information started trickling out about the incident and the 28-year-old cop at the center of the firestorm.

‘The toothpaste is out of the tube here,’ Kelly said. ‘There’s lots of things that should have been done differently, and you have to live with them.’

Mr Kelly, who stood at the helm of the NYPD from January 2002 until December 2013 as part of Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration, also did not mince words when addressing the skewed racial makeup of the Ferguson police force.

The former top cop called it 'mind-boggling' that only three out of the 53 cops serving the Missouri town were black given that Ferguson was nearly 70 per cent African-American.

While much has been written and said about the presence of armored vehicles and officers in tactical gear more often seen in combat zones than American suburbia, Kelly stopped short of calling out the perceived over-militarization of Ferguson’s police.

He did, however, note that National Guardsmen who have been called up by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to restore order in Ferguson were not trained in 'policing tactics.'

In 2011, Kelly came under sharp criticism from civil libertarians for cracking down on Occupy Wall Street protesters in Manhattan.

Kelly was also attacked in the media for perpetuating the controversial stop-and-frisk policy, under which hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, the vast majority of them minorities, were subjected to searches by police.",46,NA,NA,NA

LOUIS (AP) — A large crowd, some chanting ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" gathered Tuesday at the site where St. Louis police officers shot and killed a knife-wielding man after a reported convenience store robbery.

The shooting happened just a few miles from Ferguson, where the fatal shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old, Michael Brown, by a white police officer has touched off days of sometimes violent protests. The crowd had largely diminished within several hours of the shooting.

St. Louis Police Capt. Ed Kuntz said police responded shortly after noon following a report of a robbery at a convenience store. The suspect, a 23-year-old black man, refused police orders to drop the knife, Kuntz said.

When the man allegedly raised the weapon and moved toward the officers, both opened fire, killing him, said Kuntz.

Police Chief Sam Dotson said the man was acting erratically and told officers to ""shoot me now, kill me now.""

A man who said he witnessed the shooting, Robert Addison, 36, said the suspect cursed officers as he told them, ""You'll have to kill me.""

Both officers were placed on administrative duty pending an investigation, but Kuntz said the shooting appeared to be justified.

A crowd of about 100 onlookers gathered at the site within an hour of the shooting. Some chanted ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" which has become the mantra of protesters in Ferguson after witnesses described Brown as having his hands in the air when he was shot Aug. 9.

But on Monday, Jon Hamm displayed his athletic abilities when he threw the ceremonial first pitch for his hometown team, the St. Louis Cardinals.

The 43-year-old was at Busch Stadium in Missouri for Jon Hamm Bobblehead night showing some local pride dressed in a white baseball cap and matching jersey.

With the number 23 embroidered on his Cardinals jersey, the St. Louisian gave it his best throw in front of a packed stadium.

The scruffy-faced actor wore a navy long sleeve shirt under his crisp sports apparel and paired the look with tan trousers.

At the game versus the Cincinnati Reds, Jon grinned after he 'rainbow bounced' the ball to hall of fame shortstop Ozzie Smith, according to sportswriter R. B. Fallstrom who called the pitch on Twitter.

Following the honorable throw, Hamm attended a press conference where he shed light on the tumultuous events happening in Ferguson, Missouri.

'I grew up in Normandy, which is right next to Ferguson. It's rough, obviously. It's a bad situation all around,' said the Million Dollar Arm actor.

He changed his shirt to a collared plaid long sleeve as he addressed his thoughts regarding the fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old teenager Michael Brown by a city police officer on Saturday.

'That's my neighbourhood. I know there's a lot more good people in those neighbourhoods than there are bad people,' expressed Hamm.

He continued: 'It's a bad situation all around. There's no positive spin to it. When all the facts come out and hopefully all the light is shone on all sides of it, hopefully the justice will be carried out. But it's hard. It's really hard.'

At least 10 journalists have been arrested or detained since Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was killed Aug. 9 by officer Darren Wilson. Reporters for CNN, Al Jazeera America and other outlets say they have been harassed or physically threatened.

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, in charge of security in Ferguson, said Tuesday that members of the media have had to be asked repeatedly to return to the sidewalks, because of safety concerns. In some cases, he said, it was not immediately clear who was a reporter, but once that was established, police acted properly.

""In the midst of chaos, when officers are running around, we're not sure who's a journalist and who's not,"" Johnson said at a news conference. ""And yes, if I see somebody with a $50,000 camera on their shoulder, I'm pretty sure. But some journalists are walking around, and all you have is a cellphone because you're from a small media outlet. Some of you may just have a camera around your neck.""

The arrests and detainments, which have ranged from several minutes to several hours, have been widely criticized: President Obama said last week that police ""should not be bullying or arresting"" reporters for merely doing their jobs. Last Friday, 48 American media organizations, including The Associated Press, sent a letter to law enforcement officials in Ferguson, criticizing the treatment of reporters.

""Officers on the ground must understand that gathering news and recording police activities are not crimes,"" the letter read. ""The actions in Ferguson demonstrate a lack of training among local law enforcement in the protections required by the First Amendment, as well as the absence of respect for the role of newsgatherers. We implore police leadership to rectify this failing to ensure that these incidents do not occur again.""

Overall, at least two people were shot and at least 57 arrested during protests overnight Monday, authorities said.

On Tuesday, Ryan Devereaux of The Intercept, an online investigative publication, tweeted that he was arrested and jailed, then released several hours later. Getty photographer Scott Olson said Monday that he was arrested ""for just doing my job"" and eventually released. As with previous arrests of journalists, no charges were filed against Olson, who by Monday night was back shooting photos.

Two German reporters were arrested and detained for three hours Monday. Conservative German daily Die Welt said correspondent Ansgar Graw and reporter Frank Herrmann, who writes for German regional papers, were arrested after allegedly failing to follow police instructions to vacate an empty street. They said they followed police orders.

On Sunday night, Sports Illustrated reporter Robert Klemko tweeted that he was tear-gassed, handcuffed and then released a few minutes later. The Telegraph's Rob Crilly and the Financial Times' Neil Munshi also reported that they were briefly detained Sunday.

Last week, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post said they were handcuffed and put into a police van after officers came into a McDonald's where they were doing some work. The Washington Post reported that Lowery said he was slammed against a soda machine. Reilly told MSNBC that an officer slammed his head against the glass ""purposefully"" on the way out of the restaurant.

The reporters were subsequently released without any charges.

Ryan Grim, Washington bureau chief for The Huffington Post, said in a statement that ""compared to some others who have come into contact with the police department, they came out relatively unscathed, but that in no way excuses the false arrest or the militant aggression toward these journalists.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Members of the coalition, including the ACLU and National Bar Association, have filed lawsuits seeking the incident report in the shooting of Brown by Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson.

The Justice Department has launched an independent investigation into the case.

The National Bar Association, a national network mainly of black lawyers and judges, filed a lawsuit this week claiming the Ferguson Police Department is in violation of the state open-records law for not releasing reports, videos and photos about the Aug. 9 shooting. It also seeks records related to the police officer.

The ACLU has also filed two lawsuits requesting copies of incident reports from both the Ferguson Police Department and St. Louis County.

The group wants Justice Department officials to prepare reports on police killings, police training, police oversight, racial profiling of minorities and youth, and police policies such as ""stop-and-frisk.""

""We continue to look in dismay at the lack of a release by the Ferguson Police Department of the incident report, a public record that is required by law to be available to the public,"" Lawyers' Committee President Barbara Arnwine said in a briefing. ""There's no explanation, no excuse for the lack of that release.""

The group has recommended that dashboard cameras be mandatory in police cars, that police officers wear body cameras, and that a law enforcement commission be created to review police tactics.

Calls for requests for comment from St. Louis County Police were not returned.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson did release the officer's name last week, as well as police reports and surveillance video from a convenience store robbery in which Brown was a suspect. It drew further community outcry over the incident.

Janai Nelson of the NAACP-Legal Defense Fund said the police response to the shooting death has been uncoordinated and led the community to distrust police and public officials.

""What is of grave concern to the Legal Defense Fund is the absence of state and local leadership at nearly every level of the investigation of incident,"" Nelson said. ""We call on Ferguson to lead. We call on the elected officials of Ferguson to engage with members of their community to ensure them that the investigation into Michael Brown's death will be fair and just.""

The ‘Hands up, don't shoot’ gesture was a show of solidarity with the people in Ferguson, Missouri, who are protesting the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 by a white police officer.

The idea to show solidarity for the dead came from safety Brandon Meriweather and cornerback DeAngelo Hall.

Meriweather said the team's defensive backs decided as a group to pay a pregame tribute as they came through the tunnel and onto FedEx Field.

‘We just want to show our supporters what’s going on in St. Louis,’ Meriweather told WNEW.

‘That could have been any one of us,’ said Safety Ryan Clark. 

‘That could have been any one of our brothers, our cousins. ...When you get an opportunity to make a statement and be more than a football player, it's good.’

The Redskins defeated the Browns 24-23.

Protesters have gathered daily in Ferguson since Brown was fatally was shot on August 9. 

Police say Brown struggled with the officer before being shot six times, but witnesses have said he was not aggressive toward the officer and had his hands raised above his head before he was shot. 

As a result, the words 'hands up, don’t shoot' have become a rallying cry of protesters, both in Ferguson and online.

But compared with the violent aftermath of Michael Brown's shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, the fallout from the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York now seems notable for what's been absent: no guns pointed at raging protesters, no billowing tear gas, no lengthy delay in revealing an officer's name, no National Guard troops.

The relative calm in New York followed a carefully calibrated response by city and police officials intended to neutralize possible unrest. The response drew on the lessons from other high-profile use-of-force cases involving black victims that roiled the city in the late 1990s.

""What you want in a democracy is the ability to express your concerns, but you don't want it to spill over into disorder,"" Police Commissioner William Bratton said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. ""I think we've had a very informed and reasonable response to the issues raised by everybody. There's been no violence.""

Initial outrage over Garner's July 17 death was fueled by an amateur video showing an arresting officer appearing to put him in a chokehold, banned under police policy, and Garner gasping ""I can't breathe"" before falling unconscious. The next day Mayor Bill de Blasio postponed a family vacation, spoke with black community leaders and called a news conference with Bratton.

De Blasio, a Democrat, called the death a ""terrible tragedy"" and the video ""very troubling."" Bratton conceded ""this would appear to have been a chokehold."" Both promised a thorough investigation.

Officials say police commanders reached out to community activists and offered condolences to Garner's family. On July 19, two days after the death, the New York Police Department released the name of the officer and announced he had been placed on desk duty while a prosecutor determines whether to bring criminal charges. On July 31, de Blasio and Bratton sat next to the Rev. Al Sharpton at a City Hall roundtable about community concerns.

Demonstrations after Garner's death have been peaceful, even after the medical examiner ruled it a homicide. A rally in Times Square last week protesting the deaths of Brown and Garner resulted in only five arrests for minor offenses and no serious clashes. NYPD officials said Tuesday they're in contact with organizers of a Sharpton-led march planned for Saturday, an effort to preserve calm headed by a Community Affairs Division staffed with hundreds of officers citywide.

Activist Joo-Hyun Kang, of Communities United for Police Reform, said the department's record on dealing with outrage over possible brutality is checkered at best, pointing to an ugly clash last year between police in riot gear and a bottle-throwing crowd after the police slaying of a teenager in Brooklyn. The emphasis on keeping order after Garner's death ""fails to address the racial profiling that caused it in the first place or how these cases send the message that police officers are above the law,"" she said.

The challenges harken back to the torture of Abner Louima with a broken broomstick by an officer in a police station bathroom in 1997 and the death of Amadou Diallo in a hail of 41 bullets fired by four white officers searching for an armed rapist in 1999. Both cases sparked demonstrations resulting in hundreds of arrests and frayed then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already tense relationship with the black community.

But Howard Safir, police commissioner under the Republican Giuliani amid both crises, says conditions could have been worse if city and police officials hadn't taken swift steps to keep the peace. During a closed-door meeting after the Louima assault, it was decided he and the mayor should visit Louima in the hospital and meet with community leaders in Brooklyn, Safir recalled on Tuesday.

Similarly, the pair decided to attend Diallo's funeral after the administration concluded, ""This one has legs and we have to get on top of it real quick,"" he said.

One measure used to quell unrest was to negotiate with Diallo demonstrators and persuade them to use designated protest areas policed by officers in what are called soft uniforms — windbreakers and baseball caps.

The department then, as now, also benefited from racial diversity in its ranks, experience with crowd control at large events including the New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square and a robust community affairs operation geared toward developing relationships in communities before tragedy strikes, Safir said.

The bikers include members from groups including Outcast MC - America's oldest all-black motorcycle club - and Dominant Breed.

The riders arrived in town on Saturday and have been helping to protect stores against looters as well as joining in peaceful rallies protesting the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

One rider told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch over the weekend that the clubs don't have a specific strategy to help protect the city. 

‘But normally when they see our presence [troublemakers] don't come around much,’ he said. 

The bikers have also been spotted at a memorial site for the slain teen in recent days and their presence is widely considered to be having a positive impact.

Protesters and local residents have shared photos on social media of the bikers, wearing their signature black jackets and skull masks. 

Outcast MC was founded in Detroit in 1969 and has chapters around the country.

The bikers aren't the only group on the streets of Ferguson working to restore order and support the peaceful protesters. 

Amnesty International and the Black Panther Party are among the other groups that currently have a presence in the town along with local student and church-based organizations. 

Funeral services for Brown, the black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer,  are planned for Monday.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Brown family said the exact time and location for the memorial has not been finalized.

The shooting of the unarmed Brown by officer Darren Wilson has stoked more than a week of unrest in the city. 

Police have used tear gas, sound projectors and other means to turn back demonstrators, some of whom have lobbed Molotov cocktails and bottles at officers.

The volatile scenes prompted Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to deploy the National Guard in an effort control the unrest. ",79,NA,NA,NA

DailyMail,daily161,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2729363/Christie-Too-soon-draw-conclusions-Ferguson.html,Christie: Too soon to draw conclusions on Ferguson,Associated Press,8/19/2014,1/4/2016,"LONG BRANCH, N.J. (AP) — Republican Gov. Chris Christie said it's too soon to draw conclusions about the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by police in Ferguson, Missouri, and the subsequent unrest there and criticized other politicians who have weighed in.

Christie was asked at a town hall event Tuesday whether the protests in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, gave him pause about the militarization of police in New Jersey.

Christie, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, cautioned against drawing conclusions or generalizations about the Aug. 9 shooting of the black 18-year-old by a white police officer or what has happened in the days since until all the facts are known.

""None of us quite know yet exactly what happened in Ferguson,"" he said. ""I've been urging people to not pre-judge anything here.""

Christie, a former prosecutor, said he always hated when politicians would weigh in on his cases and criticized those who have in this case.

Politicians and public figures ""who jump out now and start saying a lot of things, they're just trying to get their name in the newspaper,"" he said.

He also accused news anchors of making a ""spectacle"" out of the situation in Ferguson, where police officers in riot gear have lined the streets as violence erupts nightly.

Christie went on to praise the nation's justice system as the best in the world and said the overwhelming majority of police officers in the country are hardworking people who put their lives on the line every day.

He also urged prayers for Brown's parents and said that, as a parent, losing a child would be unthinkable, regardless of the circumstances.

""The sorrow and pain that these parents must feel right now is indescribable,"" he said.

The Rev. Al Sharpton had criticized Christie for his silence on the shooting.

Christie made the same case against generalizations last week.",NA,NA,NA,NA
