But the tinder fueling the anger and resentment that has exploded in Ferguson has been building for decades.

The town has seen many middle-class homeowners who eagerly moved to St. Louis' northern suburbs after World War II to buy brick ranch homes with nice yards leave in later years, replaced by poorer newcomers. Good blue-collar jobs have grown scarce; the factories that once sprouted here have closed shop. Schools have struggled.

And local governments — slow to evolve — often now look little like the people they represent. For the African American community, it creates a sense of lost opportunity in a place much like other aging suburbs in the Rust Belt and across the country.

""For a young black man, there's not much employment, not a lot of opportunity,"" said Todd Swanstrom, a professor of public policy at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""It's kind of a tinder box.""

The seething tensions prompted Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to declare a curfew in Ferguson on Saturday, one week after a white police officer shot and killed Brown, an 18-year-old African American. The declaration followed another night of looting.

Critics say an initial heavy-handed response by police using tear gas and rubber bullets touched off the unrest, with mainly white officers facing off against mainly black crowds.

Since Brown's death, race and police tactics have dominated the headlines blaring from this town 12 miles northwest of St. Louis' Gateway Arch. But that's only part of the story.

From jobs to schools to racial transition, Ferguson and its neighboring towns — where many protesters came from — have undergone sweeping changes in recent years. Some places have become pockets of poverty, comparable to the poorest spots in St. Louis.

Others, like Ferguson, remain more mixed, with middle-class subdivisions built alongside run-down streets and big apartment complexes like the one where Brown lived. Either way, Swanstrom said, the area highlights the growing challenge of the ""suburbanization"" of poverty.

""This was a catalyst for something much deeper, the lack of economic opportunities and representation people have,"" said Etefia Umana, an educator and board member of a community group called Better Family Life. ""A lot of the issues are boiling up.""

It's been boiling for decades.

St. Louis' jumble of suburbs — there are 91 municipalities in a county of about 1 million people ringing the city — has long been sharply segregated. Until the late 1940s, restrictive covenants blocked blacks from buying homes in many areas.

Well into the 1970s, tight zoning restrictions and other rules, especially in places near the city's mostly black north side, kept many of the areas largely white, said Colin Gordon, a University of Iowa professor who has studied housing in St. Louis.

That began to change by the 1980s, when middle- and working-class white families began leaving north county — as the area around Ferguson is known — for newer, roomier housing farther out in the exurbs. In their place came a flood of African American families from St. Louis in search of better housing and schools.

""When black flight out of the city began, this was the logical frontier,"" Gordon said. ""It became what the city had been, a zone of racial transition.""

In Ferguson, the change happened fast. In a generation — from 1990 to today — the population changed from three-fourths white to two-thirds black. Even as the area's demographics shifted, good blue-collar jobs sustained many of these towns, said Lara Granich, a community organizer.

""Everyone in our parish was a brick layer or a letter carrier or something. I didn't know anyone who had gone to college, but they all made a decent living,"" said Granich, who grew up in nearby Glasgow Village, another neighborhood on the decline. ""The people who live there now tend to work at McDonald's.""

The recession hurt, too. This part of the St. Louis region took the brunt of the foreclosure crisis, with subprime loans turning bad and investors scooping up cheap houses to rent. Auto plants that had sustained a black middle class shut down.

Since 2000, the median household income in Ferguson has fallen by 30% when adjusted for inflation, to about $36,000. In the census tract where Brown lived, median income is less than $27,000. Just half of the adults work.

The Rev. Steven Lawler, rector of St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Ferguson, really saw the change in 2008, when visits to his food pantry soared. They haven't gone down since.

""I know there are places where an economic recovery's happening,"" he said. ""But in the places where people are most stressed, there hasn't been a recovery.""

Still, as Lawler and others note, Ferguson has some things going for it. Its pleasant, old downtown has seen a revival in recent years, with a busy Saturday farmers market and a new craft brewery. It still has middle-class neighborhoods of historic homes. The headquarters of a Fortune 500 company, Emerson Electric Co., sits on a serene campus just up the hill from the gas station that looters burned on Sunday night.

Gail Babcock, program director at Ferguson Youth Initiative, was quick to note her town still has a strong sense of community. Every morning this week volunteers poured in to clean up from protests and looting. The challenge is in connecting its poorer residents — especially younger ones — to it, she said.

""It's very hard for them to find jobs,"" said Babcock, who runs a community service program for youth convicted of minor criminal offenses. ""That sets up a situation where they tend to get in trouble, and they probably wouldn't under other circumstances.""

Then there are the schools, one reason why many families moved to these suburbs in the first place. Two north county districts — including the one where Brown graduated from high school in May — have lost their state accreditation in recent years. The district Ferguson shares with a neighboring town remains accredited but scores low on state tests.

That was a big reason why John Weaver took the morning off work Friday, drove his plumbing truck to the nearby city of Florissant and asked the visiting governor what he planned to do about the problems that have plagued these neighborhoods for years.

Nixon acknowledged there's ""a lot of work to do."" Weaver was not impressed.

""All these politicians say they'll fight for our education. I feel cheated,"" he said in an interview later. ""And if I feel cheated, how should these kids feel?""

These issues are all tied together for Shermale Humphrey, a 21-year-old who joined the protests this week. She plans to enlist in the Air Force, but right now works at a McDonald's near where Brown was shot. She's something of a veteran activist — helping to organize strikes by fast-food workers in St. Louis — and sees race, politics and economics here as closely intertwined.

""It's a shortage of everything,"" she said. ""It's a shortage of jobs. Of African Americans on the police force and in government. Of people not being able to get a good education.""

Adding to the frustration, many protesters say, is that the people still running many of these towns don't much look like the people who live there now. Just three of Ferguson's 53 police officers are African American. Six of seven City Council members are white. So are six of the seven school board members, who run a district with a student body that's 78% black.

Many of these towns are still run ""like little fiefdoms"" by remnants of their old white middle class that may not share the concerns of newcomers, said Umana, who moved to Ferguson eight years ago.

""The numbers flip-flopped, but the power structure remained the same,"" he said.

It has been hard to build black political leadership in these fast-changing suburbs, said Mike Jones, an African American veteran of St. Louis' political scene. Indeed, it's been harder than in St. Louis, which has long been racially mixed.

But a more diverse set of voices at Ferguson City Hall, Jones said, might have avoided the heavy-handed police response that only inflamed protests.

""The question is how — in a city that's 67% African American — do you have absolutely no African American political representation?"" Jones asked. ""That's what leads you to a police force that could become involved in this sort of incident.""

It's an issue more communities will have to face, Jones predicts, as traditionally ""urban"" issues of poverty and racial change migrate to suburbs often less-equipped to deal with them. And not just in the St. Louis area.

A study last month by the Brookings Institution found the number of poor people living in high-poverty suburban neighborhoods nationwide more than doubled in the last decade, growing much faster than in big cities.

Chris Krehmeyer, who runs the St. Louis community development nonprofit Beyond Housing, says he knows colleagues around the country dealing with a lot of the same issues as he is in north St. Louis County, tackling housing, jobs and schools all at once. The key, he said, is to build trust with residents before the community blows up.

Ferguson is a bellwether, he said. ""This story could happen in lots of different places, all over this country.""",195,NA,"The turmoil in Ferguson, Mo., has been threatening to explode for decades",NA

Palestinians are tweeting advice on how to cope with tear gas. Tibetan monks have showed up to offer prayers. Russian officials, Iran’s official news agency and China’s state-run media are offering lectures on human rights abuses.

What started as a small-town police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old black man in suburban St. Louis has quickly become an international incident.

As the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., stretches into a second week, scenes of cops in military-like vehicles clashing with protesters are being beamed around the world. A global audience is watching the events with shock and sympathy -- but also a sense of superiority and schadenfreude.

For countries that are often on the receiving end of human-rights lectures from Washington, the situation in Ferguson, Mo. -- the violence, the race troubles and arrests of American journalists -- has presented an irresistible opportunity to turn the tables and accuse the U.S. of hypocrisy.

“The Ferguson incident once again demonstrates that even in a country that has for years tried to play the role of an international human rights judge and defender, there is still much room for improvement at home,” China’s state-run {New China News Agency}<hyperlink=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2014-08/18/c_133564928.htm""> said in a commentary published Monday, just hours before Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon ordered National Guard troops into the city. “Obviously, what the United States needs to do is to concentrate on solving its own problems rather than always pointing fingers at others.”

But Chinese media haven’t been devoting as extensive coverage to the Ferguson unrest as have their counterparts in Russia, where the story has been featured prominently on TV news.

Russian officials have taken an even more strident tone -- perhaps not surprising, given the toxic atmosphere between Moscow and Washington of late. Taking note of the unrest in Ferguson, the Foreign Ministry urged “our American partners to pay more attention to restoring order in their own country before imposing their dubious experience on other nations.”

The United States “has positioned itself as a ‘bastion of human rights’ and is actively engaged in 'export of democracy' on a systematic basis,” but “serious violations of basic human rights and barbaric practices thrive” in the country, Moscow {said in remarks}<hyperlink=""http://archive.mid.ru//brp_4.nsf/newsline/4C5DC24943D83D4444257D3500403EFF""> Friday responding to a U.S. report to a United Nations committee on racial discrimination. [Link in Russian]

In Iran on Monday, Ferguson was top news, even overshadowing a magnitude 6.2 earthquake that injured dozens. The Islamic Republic News Agency, the government’s official news service, commented that “violence has become institutionalized in the U.S. in recent years, but since President Obama, the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner, came to the White House, the violence has intensified, and now it has erupted against blacks in Ferguson.”

A prominent Cuban news site, Cubadebate, {asked in its opinion pages}<hyperlink=""http://www.cubadebate.cu/opinion/2014/08/17/renace-con-fuerza-el-ku-kux-klan/#.Vi7HH7dY5Bd"">: ""Is the Ku Klux Klan coming back with force?"" [Link in Spanish]

""Now, as in times past, we can see the brutal segregation and abysmal inequality for blacks and immigrants, in housing, education, work [and] public health, and yet other human rights violations in the so-called most democratic nation in the world,"" the column by Cuban journalist Lillian Lechuga concluded.

Even in tiny countries such as Sri Lanka, which doesn't have particularly strained ties with the U.S., the Ferguson situation has become a cudgel to hit back at Washington.

Taking umbrage over a U.S. {security warning}<hyperlink=""http://srilanka.usembassy.gov/information_for_travelers/security-messages.html""> to Americans on Aug. 8 in connection with an increase in protests and anti-American sentiment in Sri Lanka, the island nation’s Daily News opined: “For the U.S. to issue a travel warning for Sri Lanka does seem odd at a time when there are race riots in Missouri.”

“The world is concerned about gun violence and its toll in the U.S., and even though the U.S. president says he is concerned as well, he has not been able to do anything about its epidemic prevalence,” the paper said.

The press in Mexico has provided steady and fairly straightforward coverage of the Ferguson case, but there have been commentaries that condemned police abuses and the treatment of minorities, the kinds of things for which Mexico often gets taken to task.

“It is worth remembering that in the neighboring country there are frequent cover-ups … of extreme police abuses against black youth,” the leftist daily La Jornada said in an editorial last week.

Gabriel Guerra Castellanos, a former Mexican diplomat and political consultant, wrote in Monday's {El Universal newspaper}<hyperlink=""http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2014/08/71917.php"">:

“The images are shocking, outrageous. If someone were to tell us this was the old South Africa, or the U.S. South half a century ago, we’d believe it.” [Link in Spanish]

Guerra went on to blame, among many factors, the militarization of urban police forces.

“In the middle of 2014, a police force that looks more like an invading army is attempting to take over the small community of Ferguson,” he wrote.  “There are police and politicians who prefer a Blackhawk helicopter to patrol cars. Anyone can inflate their childhood fantasies as they wish. But size does matter, and in this case, less is more.”

Scenes of tear gas, Molotov cocktails and flash grenades in Ferguson have surprised many in Egypt, the Palestinian territories and other places where such violence is more common.

A popular blogger in Cairo, who writes under the pseudonym {The Big Pharaoh}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TheBigPharaoh/status/499875602066055168"">, tweeted a picture from Ferguson and commented: “Nope, this is not Egypt or Turkey. This is in the USA.”

Mariam Barghouti, a university student and blogger in the West Bank city of Ramallah, has tweeted out tips for reporters and others in Ferguson who face tear gas from police.

“Remember to not touch your face when tear-gassed or put water on it. Instead use milk or coke!” she wrote last week.

Voicing solidarity with those facing off against police in Missouri, {she said}<hyperlink""https://twitter.com/MariamBarghouti/status/499760284907864064""> a “made in USA teargas canister was shot at us a few days ago in #Palestine by Israel, now they are used in #Ferguson.”

After taking the highly unusual step of sending human rights monitors to Ferguson, London-based Amnesty International on Sunday called for state and federal probes into Brown’s death, as well as the tactics of Ferguson police. Atop the group’s {U.S. website}<hyperlink=""http://www.amnestyusa.org/"">, its “Stand With Ferguson” campaign gets equal billing with its “Gaza Crisis” and “Panic in Iraq” briefings.

“Amnesty International has a long and tested history of monitoring and investigating police conduct, not just in foreign countries, but right here at home in the United States,” Amnesty USA executive director Steven W. Hawkins said in a statement. “Our delegation traveled to Missouri to let the authorities in Ferguson know that the world is watching.”

America’s persistent problems with gun violence and racial divisions -- in a time with an African American president who advocates stricter gun control -- are perplexing even to its closest allies.

Britain's Telegraph newspaper published an {opinion piece}<hyperlink=""http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100283343/a-black-president-couldnt-stop-the-ferguson-race-riots/""> from a U.S. scholar explaining to online readers why “a black president couldn’t stop the Ferguson race riots.”

Meanwhile, Germany’s {Der Spiegel}<hyperlink=""http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/proteste-in-ferguson-kritik-an-militaerischer-ausruestung-der-polizei-a-986337.html""> interviewed a security expert who opined that what transpired in Ferguson could never happen in Germany. [Link in German]

In the U.S., ""the police quickly appear very militarized. That would never be the case in Germany. We are very restrained in our use of guns; they are weapons of last resort,” said Marcel Kuhlmey, professor in the department of security management at the Berlin University of Economics and Law.

“In the U.S., it seems to me, the police are far quicker to resort to guns,” he added. “Even at the training stage, there is a much heavier emphasis on shooting” than in Germany.",34,NA,A global audience is watching events in Ferguson with shock and sympathy -- but also a sense of superiority,NA

Jay Nixon's curfew for Ferguson, Mo., may backfire",Matt Pearce; Molly Hennessy-Fiske; Tina Susman,08/16/2014,10/26/2015,"In an unusual declaration for an American city, Gov. Jay Nixon imposed a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew Saturday after fresh violence erupted here amid public anger over the shooting death of an unarmed black man by a white police officer.

The governor's curfew and state-of-emergency decree underscored the gravity of the situation in Ferguson, where officials have been unable to calm tempers and racial tensions since the Aug. 9 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by police Officer Darren Wilson.

Critics, from black leaders in Ferguson to Amnesty International USA, were quick to assail Nixon's move and said it could further infuriate protesters who have gathered on the streets of the St. Louis suburb nightly since Brown's death.

Some protests have led to looting by groups of young men. Many protesters have tried to prevent the looting, only to see shop windows smashed and youths fleeing with stolen goods.

At a chaotic news conference where Nixon was shouted down at times by residents demanding that charges be filed against Wilson, the Democratic governor said the only way to restore peace was to ensure safety on the streets.

“We cannot have looting and crimes at night,” Nixon said. “We can't have people fearful.”

“We can't have police officers killing people!” someone in the crowd yelled.

State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, whom Nixon put in charge of Ferguson's security on Thursday, said enforcement of the curfew would not be heavy-handed, but his words did not quiet skeptics. Nixon did not say how long the curfew would be in place.

“It's clear that the community doesn't feel heard,” Steven W. Hawkins, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement. “We criticize dictators for quelling dissent and silencing protesters with tactics like curfews; we'll certainly speak out when it's happening in our own backyard.”

Malik Shabazz, the national president of Black Lawyers for Justice and a former leader of the New Black Panther Party, said police could complicate matters if they tried to enforce the midnight deadline.

“They go out there, it's over,” Shabazz said. He said he had 100 volunteers better suited to keep watch on demonstrators. “We gotta secure it ourselves.”

As twilight descended on Ferguson, police blocked vehicular traffic on the south end of West Florissant Avenue, the scene of most protests and unrest. They also barricaded a shopping complex about half a mile down the road. At least 200 demonstrators holding signs and chanting cries for justice marched along the avenue in a peaceful procession.

Last year, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, also a Democrat, asked residents of Boston, Cambridge and Watertown to shutter themselves inside as police scoured the area for the brothers suspected of bombing the Boston Marathon. New Orleans imposed a curfew in the chaos after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and in 2001, Cincinnati declared a curfew after a white police officer's shooting of an unarmed black teen led to riots.

Ferguson officials had hoped that Johnson's presence would calm the city. Johnson, who is black and grew up in Ferguson, took over security from the city's white police chief, Thomas Jackson, on Thursday, after five consecutive nights of clashes between protesters and police. Johnson immediately called off the military vehicles and tear gas that had been used on demonstrators, and Ferguson enjoyed its first calm night Thursday.

That changed when police on Friday released a report naming Brown as a suspect in a strong-arm robbery that had occurred minutes before he was shot. Brown's family and many Ferguson residents said the robbery report, which was accompanied by a video of the incident that was also released, was aimed at deflecting attention from what they see as the real crime: Wilson's shooting of an unarmed young man.

Freeman Bosley Jr., a lawyer representing the man who was walking with Brown when he was shot, said releasing the report and video was like “throwing a hand grenade at the table.”

A federal law enforcement source said Saturday that Ferguson police had planned to release the video Thursday, but were talked out of it by federal officials.

“We strongly objected and we told them it would just embroil the community,” said the source, who was not authorized to speak on the investigation and asked not to be named. When the video was made public, the source said, “we told them we were not happy.” The source added that FBI agents working a separate civil rights investigation into the shooting had acquired the video and didn't plan to make it public.

Bosley's client, Dorian Johnson, and several other witnesses have said Wilson shot Brown as he held up his hands. Police have said Brown attacked Wilson and was shot during a scuffle.

FBI agents have begun interviewing people in Ferguson as part of a federal investigation into the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutors also are investigating Brown's death, but there have been calls for the county prosecutor, Robert McCulloch, to withdraw from the inquiry because of what some critics say is a poor history of prosecuting law enforcement officers in controversial cases.

“There is a history of reduced charges or no convictions at all,” said U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, a St. Louis Democrat. Clay said the “only way to true justice” was to have an independent investigator because of the “past history of prosecutions of police shootings in St. Louis County.”

Ed Magee, a spokesman for McCulloch, said the prosecutor hoped to present evidence to a grand jury as soon as this week. Magee denied allegations of bias by McCulloch.

“That's just not true. He can be objective,” he said, noting that McCulloch had held the elected office since 1991. “Always has been.”

McCulloch was county prosecutor in 2000, when two white enforcement officers shot to death two unarmed black men in a car in Berkeley, about two miles from Ferguson. Then, as now, officials delayed identifying the law enforcement officers amid public anger.

A grand jury declined to indict the officers, who said they had been in danger of being run over as they tried to arrest one of the men in the car on drug charges. A federal civil rights investigation concluded the officers fired “out of fear and panic.” The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that on grand jury tapes, only three of 13 detectives who testified said the car was moving toward the officers when they opened fire. Two of those three were the shooters.

At the news conference, Nixon and Johnson urged residents to cooperate with the curfew. “This is not to silence the people of Ferguson,” Nixon said.

But Mary Moore, a protester who lives in nearby Florissant, was worried. Rather than enforcing a curfew, she said, officials should focus on investigating Brown's death.

“Until that happens,” Moore said, “the curfew is a problem before it starts.”",459,NA,"Missouri governor orders curfew, declares a state of emergency after new violence in Ferguson",NA

At least two people were shot Sunday night, and police were fired upon in street protests that have escalated since the Aug. 9 shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old black youth, Michael Brown, by a white police officer in this largely black St. Louis suburb.

Police said there were signs of a pre-planned and coordinated attempt to disrupt the city and launch an advance on the police command post not far from the scene of the shooting.

“There were shootings, vandalism and other acts of violence that clearly appear not to have been spontaneous but premeditated criminal acts,” Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson told reporters early Monday.

“The catalyst was not civil disobedience, but pre-planned agitation,” he said.

At one point, a McDonald’s restaurant that has been near the center of the street agitation in recent days was overrun by unruly protesters, forcing employees to lock themselves in a storage room, Johnson said. 

Not far away, police fired tear gas at a large crowd as protesters swept toward the main police command post, hurtling bottles and bottle rockets, he said.  Authorities received reports of at least two people shot during the evening, though police were not involved in either incident. The extent of their injuries was not known.

“Based on these conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response,” Johnson said.

“We are planning additional steps to quiet the violence. We are all determined to restore peace and safety to the people of Ferguson, and I believe the continued resolve of the good people of this community will ultimately triumph over the few people bent on violence and destruction,” he said. 

The new street eruptions came as a private autopsy revealed that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

Anthony Gray, an attorney for the Brown family, said a diagram provided by New York forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden, commissioned by the family to do an independent examination, revealed details of the bullets that struck Brown’s body.

The fact that one of the shots struck the top of Brown’s head, Gray said, was significant.

“To have a shot that’s at a 90-degree angle from the top of his skull to the bottom of his chin, almost vertical, that sounds like an officer standing over him,” Gray said.

Baden said his examination suggested that none of the six bullets was fired at point-blank range, but all were fired from at least one to two feet away.

“There’s no evidence of powder residue,” Baden said in a telephone interview with the Los Angeles Times.

Baden said two bullets struck Brown in the head: one in the forehead and one at the top of the head — fired at “a right angle to the top of the head.”

“The top of the head one was the one that would have made him unconscious and fall to the ground,” Baden said.

But it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from that, he said, without also considering witness statements and marks on Brown’s clothing. “The head is very movable, and it can be in a number of positions,” he said.

At least one of the wounds to Brown’s arm “could have been defensive,” Baden said.

Police say Brown had participated in a strong-arm robbery at a mini-mart shortly before his encounter with Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson.

Wilson, police said, was confronted by Brown inside his police car in a scuffle that led to the shooting. At least one witness who was accompanying Brown that afternoon has said Brown was shot as he walked away from the police officer with his hands raised, and then was hit with additional bullets.

The latest round of street clashes Sunday began about 8:30 p.m. -- well before the midnight curfew.

A large group of protesters marched toward a shopping center containing a police command post. They held their hands aloft, chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot.”

Police began lobbing smoke canisters and tear gas toward the marchers when they neared the command post and refused to back down.

At first protesters fled, then held their ground in the middle of the street. A few protesters grabbed smoke canisters from the street and hurled them back at police. Large numbers of people found themselves unable to flee as police advanced in half a dozen military-style vehicles because the street was blocked by the crowd behind them.

Johnson said the first sign of problems came at 8:25 p.m., with reports of someone shot. A number of officers responded but shots were fired at them and Molotov cocktails were hurled in their direction as they approached, he said.

Within minutes, more shots were fired to the north and there were reports of another person shot. At least eight people were seen with guns, Johnson said.

Looting began at several businesses, including a pizza restaurant and an auto parts store, and shortly before 9 p.m. the crowd began approaching the police command post at the shopping center, he said.

Officers called in support from other police agencies and began deploying tear gas, Johnson said.

No officers were injured.

Citizens appeared stunned by the level of mayhem even after nearly a week of nightly protests.

“It’s unbelievable. This is something you would see on TV in a third-world country. Tear gas — I’ve never seen it escalate to that point,” said Martin McDonald, 38, a truck driver from the town of Florissant who said he joined the protests for the first time on Sunday.

Chris Hudson, 31, a construction worker, said he wished protesters would gather near the police station, instead of paralyzing a residential area.

“I feel like they’re taking advantage of the situation,” he said as stood on the side of the street, watching as police advanced in a cloud of gas.

“They should have let people be. It’s not even 12 yet,” said Nikki Chamberlain, 36, referring to the midnight-to-5-a.m. curfew ordered by Nixon on Saturday. “It’s like they didn’t give us a chance.”

She watched as a young man threw a gas canister back at police.

“Good,” she said. “Give them a taste of their own medicine.”

She gestured into the surrounding darkness.

“Somewhere out there, there’s still people’s houses getting broken into, people getting raped, kids getting molested. And they’re out here with people demonstrating peacefully. A peaceful situation turned into a war. We’re not here acting like animals,” she said.

Kenny Thompson, 21, said protesters were marching peacefully until confronted with a heavy police response.

“I feel like the situation got out of hand when the police came toward everyone in so much force instead of coming toward everyone in a polite way,” he said. “We were all sitting here responding just fine, us people, walking, talking — whites and blacks, no racism at all.  But the officers came full force, shooting mace and tear gas.”

Thompson rubbed his eyes and doused his face with a bottle of water after inhaling the gas. Several gunshots were heard, and Thompson called out to those who began running.

“It’s OK, he shouted. “That’s our people shooting at the cops.”

Earlier Sunday, Ferguson had hopes for peace. More than 1,300 people gathered for a rally at the Greater Grace Church, filling the sanctuary and spilling out the door.

The Brown family hosted the event, along with the National Bar Assn. and civil rights leader Al Sharpton’s National Action Network. Sharpton and Martin Luther King III called for the nation to respond constructively and address what Sharpton called the militarization of police.

Sharpton told the community to take positive action. “Don’t loot in Michael’s name,” he implored.

He also told residents to vote, noting that the 12% turnout in the last election “is an insult to your children.”

But the most celebrated speaker was Johnson, who took over the police response last week at the direction of the governor.

Johnson, dressed in his uniform and wearing his badge, told the audience that he had met with some of Brown’s relatives on Saturday.

“They brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart,” Johnson said. “I wear this uniform. And I should stand up here and say I’m sorry.”

The crowd erupted in cheers.

Brown’s death will make the world safer for young black men, Johnson said.

“When this is over, I’m going to go in my son’s room, my black son, who wears his pants sagging, wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, because that’s my baby,” he said.

What touched off the outcry near St. Louis?

Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was shot multiple times and killed Aug. 9 in a confrontation with a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., a St. Louis suburb.

What do police say happened?

According to St. Louis County’s police chief: Brown was walking with a friend in the middle of the street when Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson tried to exit his vehicle. Brown pushed the officer back into the police car, then entered the car, and a struggle ensued over Wilson's weapon. A shot was fired inside the car. Wilson and Brown then exited the vehicle, and the fatal shooting occurred.

Nearly a week after the shooting, police said {Brown was the primary suspect}<hyperlink=” https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1275136-ferguson-police-report-in-michael-brown-shooting.html”> in a robbery that occurred just before the shooting. Hours after releasing that information, Ferguson's police chief said Wilson did not know Brown was a robbery suspect, but stopped him because he was walking in the middle of the street. The police chief {later said Wilson was aware}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-fergsuon-shooting-police-name-20140815-story.html#page=1”> that cigars had been taken in the robbery of a store nearby, but did not know Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, might be suspects. The chief said Wilson then saw cigars in Brown’s hand and realized it might be connected. Police said Brown did have stolen items with him.

What do witnesses say happened?

Dorian Johnson told Fox 2 that he and Brown were walking in the street when the police car pulled up. The officer said to ""get the eff onto the sidewalk,"" he recounted. Johnson said the officer reached out of the car window and grabbed Brown around the neck. Johnson was named as a second suspect in the police report of the convenience store robbery, but Ferguson's police chief said Johnson {didn't participate in the crime}<hyperlink=” https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/500364668700200960”>.

Another witness, Piaget Crenshaw, said she saw police chase Brown. “He ran for his life,” she said. “They shot him and he fell. He put his arms up to let them know that he was compliant and he was unarmed, and they shot him twice more and he fell to the ground and died.""

What did an autopsy show? 

According to the private preliminary autopsy released Sunday night, Brown was shot six times, including once in the eye and once in the crown of the head. The forensic pathologist said the shot to the crown of the head was the fatal round. 

Who was Michael Brown?

Friends and family have described the teenager as a ""gentle giant"" who was {a day away from starting college}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-michael-brown-20140817-story.html”> at a technical school. His teachers {told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/michael-brown-remembered-as-a-gentle-giant/article_cbafa12e-7305-5fd7-8e0e-3139f472d130.html”> that he had fought hard to graduate from high school, where he had at various points been a member of the Junior ROTC program and the football team. Friends told the Post-Dispatch that Brown eventually wanted to own his own business. 

Who was the officer who shot Brown?

Ferguson authorities named the police officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson, 28, a six-year veteran of the department. Wilson has no disciplinary record. Police appeared to be guarding his home, and {nobody has answered the door}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-fergsuon-shooting-police-name-20140815-story.html#page=1”>.

Who is investigating the shooting?

A {grand jury has begun hearing evidence}<hyperlink=” http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/A%20grand%20jury%20has%20begun%20hearing%20evidence%20in%20the%20case.”> in the case, and, because a member of the Ferguson Police Department fired the shots, an outside agency -- the St. Louis County Police Department -- is investigating. The FBI and Justice Department have launched a parallel investigation. 

What kind of unrest has there been in Ferguson since the shooting?

In addition to mourning and memorials for Brown, there have been {demonstrations}<hyperlink=” http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-hands-up-20140813-story.html”>, street clashes and looting. A St. Louis County {police officer shot and critically wounded}<hyperlink=” http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-police-shooting-08132014-story.html”> a man who police say pointed a gun at him early Wednesday, and the same night, a woman was shot in the head by a civilian but was not seriously injured, police said. Several others have been shot in the crowd by fellow demonstrators, police said.

Police, often wearing riot gear and using military equipment, have been spraying tear gas and shooting rubber bullets to break up crowds.

In the middle of last week, Missouri's governor replaced Ferguson and St. Louis County police with the Missouri State Highway Patrol to provide security in Ferguson.

There were peaceful demonstrations in Ferguson the night after the Highway Patrol was put in command. But the nights after the announcement of Wilson's name and the release of robbery allegations against Brown have seen {protesters looting stores}<hyperlink=” http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-unrest-20140816-story.html”> and engaging in tense standoffs with police.

On Saturday, a week after the shooting, Missouri's governor declared a state of emergency in Ferguson and instituted a {midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew}<hyperlink=” http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-curfews-beyond-ferguson-20140816-story.html”>. Unrest, especially at night, continued to flare, and Missouri's governor has called in the National Guard. In recent days, protests have been more peaceful and {arrests have decreased}<hyperlink=” http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-community-activism-lauded-in-calm-ferguson-protests-20140821-story.html”>.

What do protesters want?

Protesters initially said they wanted the officer who killed Brown to be identified, fired and charged in the killing, and they want the Ferguson police force to reflect the racial demographics of the largely African American community. They also said that they want respect from police and that they don't want to be shot the way Brown was. Soon, crowds were also protesting the way police responded to the initial demonstrations.

Are blacks disproportionately targeted in Ferguson?

Blacks make up 65% of Ferguson's population, yet they accounted for 86% of traffic stops, 93% of arrests after stops and 92% of searches after stops in the city last year, according to {a racial profiling report}<hyperlink=”http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/Reports.php?lea=161”> by the Missouri attorney general.

When stopped by police, blacks in Ferguson were twice as likely as whites to be arrested -- even though police found contraband for 34% of whites they stopped and searched, versus 22% of blacks -- said Scott Decker, a criminologist on a team contracted by the attorney general's office to compile the data.

------------

FOR THE RECORD 
Aug. 13, 6:48 p.m.: An earlier version of this post attributed the percentages of contraband found by police to all people stopped. The percentages apply to people who were also searched. The post also stated that blacks accounted for 80% of traffic stops; in fact, they accounted for 86%.

------------ 

Who are Ferguson’s police officers?

The Ferguson Police Department has 53 total commissioned officers, three of whom are black and two of whom are other minorities; the rest are white, the police chief told the Los Angeles Times. Three of the officers are women and 50 are men, he said.

The officer who shot Brown is a six-year veteran of the department and has been put on paid administrative leave, officials said. Ferguson’s police chief said death threats led him to decide to initially withhold the officer's name.",119,NA,What is the #Ferguson issue? Here's a Q&A to catch you up,UPDATED UP UNTIL 8/21/14
LATimes,lat7,http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-protests-michael-brown-020140819-story.html,Ferguson turns tense around midnight; protesters step in to keep peace,Richard A. Serrano; Tina Susman;  Matt Pearce,08/19/2014,11/27/2015,"After a night of virtual calm on Ferguson streets, protests over the Aug. 9 police killing of an unarmed black man turned tense shortly before midnight Tuesday when someone threw a bottle and police swarmed to make an arrest.

The night appeared on the verge of spinning out of control until some protesters stepped in. They linked arms and formed a line to separate police from possible troublemakers.

Matt Mendoza, 29, of St. Louis, said he was among them.

""It's what I can do to help with the situation,"" he said as protesters backed off. ""From what I'm seeing, police are instigating when they break off and start running, creating utter chaos. It's better to just let it go.”

Shortly before the trouble began, protest leaders had stopped marching to hold a prayer and to try to get demonstrators to go home and return for a protest outside the county justice building in the morning.

After the prayer, however, the demonstrators lingered.

Suddenly the situation turned confusing. Apparently after a bottle was thrown, police made a movement and young men in the crowd started running. After police made an arrest, demonstrators appeared to throw bottles, and police deployed what sounded like noisemakers.

The situation remained fluid on West Florissant Avenue. About 1:45 a.m., police in riot gear searched, handcuffed and sat five individuals in the middle of the street beside a military-style vehicle.

Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, the officer in charge of the police presence, was out with troopers in the crowd at the McDonald's in the protest area. Johnson wore a bulletproof vest but not a helmet.

In the nearly two weeks since Brown's death, the demonstrations have turned unruly after dark. On Monday night and into Tuesday morning, police made 78 arrests, confiscating at least two guns and a Molotov cocktail.

Johnson has accused outsiders of stirring up trouble in the darkness. At least 14 of those arrested were from outside Missouri. 

One of them, Carl Dix, denied that outsiders were troublemakers. ""There are no outsiders in the struggle against injustice and oppression,"" said Dix, from Brooklyn, N.Y. The locals he met, he said, ""have wanted to hug me.""  

Tuesday night, dozens of people were marching up and down the sidewalk and, at least for the moment, the atmosphere was calm.

The Rev. Robert White of the Peace of Mind Church in St. Louis was among the older community leaders trying to keep the peace.

""The police are out here to protect us,” he told CNN. White urged protesters to ""give Ferguson a break"" and let businesses get back on their feet.

“If we could end tonight without one person getting shot, that would be a real blessing,” he said. 

Missouri Atty. Gen. Chris Koster briefly came to the streets to address demonstrators. His spokeswoman issued a statement in his name voicing confidence in St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch.

""It is my understanding he has placed the matter in the hands of two highly experienced prosecutors, one of whom is African American,"" Koster said in the statement. ""I trust in their ability to diligently and fairly present the evidence in this case."" 

A St. Louis County grand jury was expected to begin hearing evidence Wednesday. Meantime, federal officials are conducting a parallel civil rights investigation.

A group of African American attorneys has called on McCulloch  to remove himself from the case, accusing him of bias. He has declined to do so. 

Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/edit”> said he would not call on McCulloch to back out. In an evening statement, the Democratic governor said: ""From the outset, I have been clear about the need to have a vigorous prosecution of this case, and that includes minimizing any potential legal uncertainty. I am not asking St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCullough to recuse himself from this case.

""There is a well-established process by which a prosecutor can recuse"" himself, Nixon continued. ""Departing from this established process could unnecessarily inject legal uncertainty into this matter and potentially jeopardize the prosecution.""  

Earlier Tuesday, U.S. Atty. Gen. {Eric H. Holder Jr.}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/eric-holder-PEPLT000001873-topic.html”> said federal investigators had interviewed hundreds of people in connection with the Brown killing. A federal autopsy performed at Holder's orders showed that Brown was shot six times, officials said. Holder is to visit Ferguson on Wednesday. 

In an op-ed piece posted by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch titled “A Message to the People of Ferguson,” Holder strongly defended his decision to push forward with the civil rights investigation. Local law enforcement officials in Missouri are being accused of not moving fast enough in investigating Brown’s shooting by a white police officer.

“The people of Ferguson can have confidence that the {Justice Department}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/u.s.-department-of-justice-ORGOV0000160-topic.html”> intends to learn – in a fair and thorough manner – exactly what happened,” Holder wrote.

“This is my pledge to the people of Ferguson,” he added. “Our investigation into his matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will be independent.”

The attorney general revealed that about 40 {FBI}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/fbi-ORGOV000008-topic.html”> agents and some of the Justice Department's civil rights division’s “most experienced prosecutors have been deployed to lead this process, with the assistance of the United States attorney in St. Louis.”

In Missouri on Wednesday, Holder plans to meet with community leaders, FBI investigators and federal prosecutors, he said, “to receive detailed briefings on the status of the case.”

Holder went on to warn protesters in Ferguson against looting and violence, calling those who engage in such activities a small minority who only “seriously undermine, rather than advance, the cause of justice.” He added, “Violence cannot be condoned.”

Federal law enforcement officials said a {U.S. military}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/defense/u.s.-military-ORGOV000021106-topic.html”> medical examiner had concluded a federal autopsy of Brown and it showed six gunshot wounds, according to a government source who asked not to be identified. Holder confirmed in his op-ed that the autopsy was complete.

The federal autopsy was the third postmortem to be performed on Brown. The first was performed by the St. Louis County medical examiner, and the second was on behalf of Brown’s family.

The results of the county autopsy have not been made public. The private autopsy, like the federal postmortem, showed six gunshot wounds.

Holder has said that the civil rights investigation will review the county-performed autopsy.

Separately, a group of African American attorneys called for McCulloch to remove himself from the investigation and let the Justice Department take over the case.

At a news conference on the steps of the courthouse in downtown St. Louis, Kendra Howard, leader of the Mound City Bar Assn., said residents of nearby Ferguson and elsewhere were “gravely concerned about the lack of transparency and lack of candor” of McCulloch’s office since Brown’s death.

“Mr. McCulloch has shown that he is emotionally invested in protecting law enforcement, and therefore should immediately step aside and allow the Justice Department to investigate the death,” Howard said.

Ed Magee, spokesman for the county prosecutor’s office, has denied allegations that the  office cannot be impartial in the case. McCulloch hopes to begin presenting evidence to the grand jury on Wednesday, depending on the availability of witnesses, Magee said.

McCulloch has been the elected prosecutor in St. Louis County since 1991, reelected every four years by a large majority, most recently on Aug. 5, Magee said. “The residents of St. Louis County have faith in Mr. McCulloch, and he will continue to carry out his duties,” Magee said.

But the delay in releasing details of the shooting, including the name of the police officer involved – Darren Wilson – and the revelation that Brown was shot at least six times, has angered the community and led to allegations of an attempted coverup.

“The only information released has been irrelevant and aggravated a tense situation,” Howard said, alluding to last week’s particularly inflammatory revelation that Brown was a suspect in a robbery that occurred shortly before he was shot.

Ferguson police released the video on Friday -- the same day they released Wilson's name. 

On Tuesday morning, after peaceful protests in Ferguson devolved into the ninth night of unrest, residents gathered to clean up debris from West Florissant Avenue.

Schools remained closed in Ferguson as officials feared for the safety of children who would be walking to and from campuses. 

Brown's parents said they were planning a public memorial for their son on Monday. Michael Brown and Lesley McSpadden said the prosecution of the officer who shot their unarmed son was the only way to bring peace to the streets of Ferguson.

""Justice will bring peace,"" McSpadden told the ""Today"" show’s Matt Lauer. 

“We need to keep the focus on Michael Brown Jr.,” Brown’s father said.

The family expects Michael Brown's body to be released in the next 48 hours,  said one of its attorneys, Anthony Gray.  

Gray said the parents were devastated by the nightly clashes, which they feel “divert all of the attention from honoring their child and allowing him to begin the process to rest in peace. That’s not how they want him to be remembered. They do not want that to be their son’s legacy.”

Gray, who was out with protesters on West Florissant late Monday, did not fault police, calling their approach “experimental.” He praised the Highway Patrol's Johnson, chosen by the governor to take over control of the effort from local police last week. 

“If we maintained the course we were on before Ron got involved, it would probably be 10 times worse than it is now. Nobody is itching to go back to the security measures they deployed in the beginning,” Gray said, referring to Ferguson police.

Johnson made an effort late Monday to forestall violence, Gray said, holding troopers back from engaging with the crowd of protesters. 

“I don’t know if it will work or not. I’m just going to trust that they’re doing what they can to balance the interests that are at work,” Gray said.  “What Ron Johnson brought to the street, if he had more of that in the people around him, the situation would be totally different.”

Johnson has called on protesters to stay inside after dark, and although Gray wasn’t sure if that was the solution to the violence, he said the dynamic needed to change.

“Everybody needs to take a break,"" Gray said. ""We’ve got a big memorial service that needs to be planned,” he said.

Nixon had deployed National Guard troops for the first time overnight Monday to assist the Highway Patrol and {St. Louis}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/edit”> County police.

A spokesman stressed that guard troops came to Ferguson in a supporting role, not to man the front lines with police, who faced off with protesters in riot gear Monday night, lobbing tear gas and rescuing two gunshot victims.

“They had a limited support role there at the command center, staying there to secure the command center,” spokesman Scott Holste said of the guard.

The deployment came after police complained the night before that protesters had approached the command center, throwing Molotov cocktails and glass bottles, leading police to respond with tear gas and smoke canisters. 

During the worst of the clashes, protesters demanded to see Johnson, who had walked the streets with protesters hours earlier pleading for calm.

“Ron Johnson, where are you?” a protester shouted.

Johnson appeared hours later at a command center briefing, where he justified the use of force, saying officers were at risk. He displayed a Molotov cocktail and two guns seized during the melee, which he said included two fires set by vandals at a home and business, and urged legitimate protesters to stay home after dark Tuesday.

“All of these criminals at night that are masking themselves and hiding themselves behind peace, let them come at night so we can identify them, so we can take them away from our community and put them away and make our streets clear,” he said.

Johnson urged protesters to come out only in the daylight so that provocateurs could not hide behind peaceful crowds. 

At times, Johnson grew emotional as he defended the actions of law enforcement officers, raising his voice as he described the chaos around them. ""We just had officers in the midst of gunfire,"" he said.

He vowed to restore calm.

""This nation is watching each and every one of us,"" he said. ""We're going to solve this.... We're going to make this neighborhood whole. We're going to make this community whole.""

As if to get a little help from a higher power, Johnson had a chaplain open the news briefing with a prayer for peace.",361,NA,Ferguson turns tense around midnight. Protesters step in to try to keep peace.,NA
LATimes,lat8,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-police-shooting-08132014-story.html,"Protests again roil Ferguson, MO., over Michael Brown shooting",Matt Pearce ,08/13/2014,11/27/2015,"Protests racked this St. Louis suburb for a fifth straight night Wednesday as anger flared anew over the police killing of an unarmed young black man.

Armored personnel carriers and officers wearing body armor and carrying assault rifles greeted demonstrators. When the crowd ignored orders to disperse, officers unleashed tear gas and rubber bullets, witnesses said.

Police sealed off the area that was the scene of vandalism and looting Sunday night.

“We’ve done everything we can to demonstrate a remarkable amount of restraint,” St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said in an interview outside the command post. “If there was an easy way to fix this, we would have already solved the problem.”

Officers had heard sporadic gunfire, he said. At least 10 people were arrested.

One of them was St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, a friend of his, Liz Peinado, said in a Twitter post. During the unrest, French has posted videos on social media of protests and the police presence on the streets. His arrest could not be independently confirmed late Wednesday.

Gov. Jay Nixon tweeted that he was canceling planned appearances to visit the area Thursday. He added: ""Closely monitoring situation....  Ask for calm & urge law enforcement to respect rights of residents & press.""

President Obama was briefed on the situation, a White House spokesman tweeted.

During the nighttime confrontation, protesters with shirts wrapped around their faces held signs that read, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” as police closed in on the crowd. The slogan has been adopted by protesters because witnesses said 18-year-old Michael Brown was running with his hands in the air when a policeman shot him to death Saturday in Ferguson.

In live amateur video posted to social media, police could be overheard telling the group to get out of the area or they would be arrested. Clouds of tear gas were visible in the background.

The latest unrest came hours after St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said details about the Brown shooting would not be released any time soon.

“We are still in the information-gathering part of the investigation,” McCulloch said in a televised news conference.

He urged anyone with information to come forward and promised that every piece of evidence would be reviewed, presented to a grand jury and eventually made public.

By withholding details from the public during the criminal inquiry, investigators would be better able to gauge witnesses’ credibility, he said.

Along with the St. Louis County Police Department, the FBI and civil rights attorneys from the Justice Department are conducting parallel investigations.

Racial tension has simmered since Saturday’s shooting, beginning with a protest late that day. Then, on Sunday night, vandals rampaged through 12 businesses, burning one and breaking windows.

Ferguson is a working-class suburb of 21,000, where two-thirds of residents are black but police and city officials are predominantly white.

Although the largest protests have been peaceful, demonstrations have turned ugly at night.

Mostly, the protests have been bloodless. But about 1 a.m. Wednesday, St. Louis County police said, an officer shot and critically wounded a man who had pointed a handgun at the officer near the site of the Brown shooting.

Earlier Wednesday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said he would not identify the officer involved in the Brown shooting because a rumor had misidentified the officer and prompted death threats.

The officer who shot Brown was injured in the confrontation and the “side of his face was swollen,” Jackson said. The officer was treated at a hospital, the chief said, and he was “very shaken.”

Jackson said the department has asked protesters to rally only during daylight hours to ensure community safety.

Local law enforcement authorities released only a few details about the shooting, and several witnesses have disputed the police account.

Brown had been walking down a street with a friend Saturday about noon when, according to police, an officer drove up and attempted to get out of his patrol car, and Brown pushed the officer back into the car.

After an altercation over a weapon in the car, the officer and Brown got out of the vehicle, and the fatal shooting occurred, according to Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief. Bystanders said Brown had raised his hands to surrender when the fatal shots occurred.

Wednesday evening, a brief contretemps occurred when two journalists were taken into custody.

Serrano,08/14/2014,11/27/2015,"The Justice Department is pushing ahead with a possible federal criminal prosecution of the officer who shot an unarmed black man in Ferguson Mo., where peaceful protests were taking place Thursday evening under the new direction of the Missouri State Highway Patrol.

“Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence, but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,” Nixon said at a news conference.

By early evening in Ferguson, dozens of people had assembled in one gathering, holding signs and writing on the sidewalk in chalk near the QuikTrip store in Ferguson that on Sunday was looted and set on fire.

The Ferguson and St. Louis County police departments had been the lead law enforcement presence in the St. Louis suburb since Saturday's fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old. Clashes between law enforcement officers and protesters intensified as the week wore on, and the heavy police response included the use of armored vehicles, tear gas and rubber bullets. On Wednesday night, two journalists were detained.

The aggression had not been one-sided, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson noted, saying at a news conference that protesters had directed gunfire and firebombs toward police. He cited two officers with minor injuries, one of whom was hit with a brick and suffered a broken ankle.

The highway patrol has had a presence in Ferguson already: Before Nixon’s announcement, a patrol spokesman said the agency had 50 to 60 officers, including two SWAT teams, in the city this week.

Meanwhile, FBI and Justice Department investigators from St. Louis and Washington have already spoken with key witnesses who saw a Ferguson police officer kill Brown, Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said Thursday. He pledged that the investigation to determine whether criminal charges would be filed would be “thorough and fair,” but cautioned that the review would “take time to conduct.”

Holder did not discuss the substance of the witness interviews, but his statement was a sharp departure from the silence of local officials, who have refused to discuss any aspect of their investigation and declined to name the officer who fired the fatal shots.

Earlier on Thursday, Obama said there was “no excuse” for “excessive force” by police or for looting or violence aimed at law enforcement. Obama said the police had a responsibility to be “open and transparent” about the events that led up to the shooting of Brown.

The Ferguson police chief said he was also working to de-escalate any tensions between officers and demonstrators.

“What is happening now is not what any of us wants,” Jackson said at a news briefing, adding that officers and community leaders are planning to better “facilitate” demonstrators’ right to rally.

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) told reporters Thursday that although she backed the decision by law enforcement authorities to not release details of the Brown case, the strong police response to protests in Ferguson had become a problem.

“I think the demilitarization of the response is going to help a lot” to ease strife in the suburb, she said. When asked about community tensions, she described the problems as “a wound that’s not going to heal overnight.”
The ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit Thursday to obtain copies of initial police reports regarding Brown’s shooting after St. Louis County police rejected the group’s open-records request for the incident report.
At a community meeting Thursday morning, dozens of beleaguered residents and community leaders filled the pews at the Christ the King United Church of Christ in neighboring Florissant, and it didn't take long for the grievances to pour out.

Although they were upset over the shooting, community members — especially the parents of young children — indicated their primary concern had become the police response to the demonstrations that followed.
Sierra Smith, 27, lives in the Canfield apartment complex not far from where Brown was shot and where many of the worst clashes with police have occurred. Speaking into a microphone, she described how at night the police had blocked the streets to the apartment complex, making it almost impossible for residents to get in or out.
When a neighbor ran out of formula and diapers for her newborn, Smith said, the police blocked them from going out for more.

“We get up to the top of the street and they tell us to turn around,” Smith said. “If you go out, you better be wearing the armor of God.""

Others expressed disgust for white out-of-towners who were seen lighting trash bins on fire and carrying Molotov cocktails. The Sunday looting and vandalism that shut down neighborhood stores was also stopping residents from doing needed errands.
Traci Blackmon, one of the organizers of the meeting, said: “I got calls that people don't have toiletries. People don't have food.”

Tremaine Combs, 32, said fear had infected his 5-year-old son in recent days. As they were leaving a nearby Walgreens on Wednesday evening, he said, his son spotted a police officer driving by. “He was so terrified that he started crying,” Combs said.

On Wednesday night, armored personnel carriers and officers wearing body armor and carrying assault rifles had greeted demonstrators. After ordering the crowd to disperse, officers unleashed tear gas and rubber bullets, witnesses said.

Police sealed off the area that was the scene of vandalism and looting Sunday night. At least 10 people were arrested.
One of them was St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, according to a Twitter post by friend Liz Peinado. During the unrest, French has posted videos on social media of protests and the police presence on the streets. His arrest could not be independently confirmed late Wednesday.

During the nighttime confrontation, protesters with shirts wrapped around their faces held signs that read, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” as police closed in on the crowd. The slogan has been adopted by protesters because witnesses have said Brown was running with his hands in the air when a police officer shot him to death Saturday.

In live amateur video posted to social media, police could be heard telling the group to leave the area or they would be arrested. Clouds of tear gas were visible in the background.

St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said Wednesday that details about the Brown shooting would not be released any time soon. He urged anyone with information to come forward and promised that every piece of evidence would be reviewed, presented to a grand jury and eventually made public.

By withholding details from the public during the criminal inquiry, investigators would be better able to gauge witnesses’ credibility, he said.

The St. Louis County Police Department is investigating the shooting, and the FBI and civil rights attorneys from the Justice Department are conducting a parallel investigation.
Racial tension has simmered since Saturday’s shooting, beginning with a protest late that day. Then, Sunday night, vandals rampaged through 12 businesses, burning one and breaking windows.

Ferguson is a working-class suburb of 21,000. Two-thirds of residents are black, but police and city officials are predominantly white.

Although the largest protests have been peaceful, demonstrations have turned ugly at night.

Jackson, the police chief, has said he decided not to identify the officer who killed Brown because a rumor that circulated soon after the shooting that misidentified the officer had prompted death threats. The officer was injured in the confrontation with Brown and the “side of his face was swollen,” Jackson said. The officer was treated at a hospital, the chief said, and was “very shaken.”

The “hacktivist” group Anonymous released what it said was the officer’s name Thursday morning, but Jackson said the report was inaccurate.

Local law enforcement authorities have released few details about the shooting, and several witnesses have disputed the police account.

Brown had been walking in the street with a friend Saturday about noon when, according to police, an officer drove up and tried to get out of his patrol car, and Brown pushed the officer back into the car. After an altercation over the officer's weapon in the car, the officer and Brown got out of the vehicle, and the fatal shooting occurred, according to St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar.

About 10 p.m., someone threw plastic water bottles, and the crowd protesting the Aug. 9 shooting surged, confronting nervous police in riot gear. Suddenly, the National Guard mobilized, after keeping a low profile throughout the day.

Sirens screamed. Authorities ordered protesters to disperse. Tear gas wafted over the darkened streets. But the standoff continued, and police made several arrests.

It was a day of demonstration and investigation, as a pathologist for the Brown family said his preliminary autopsy suggested no sign of a struggle by the unarmed black man. President Obama said U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. would visit Ferguson on Wednesday, and Holder announced that FBI agents had conducted several new interviews in the neighborhood where Brown was killed.

Police have said Brown, 18, was shot after confronting Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson inside his police car. But at least one witness who was with Brown that afternoon has said Brown was shot as he walked away from the officer with his hands raised, then was struck by additional bullets.

Dr. Michael Baden, a renowned New York forensic pathologist who performed a preliminary autopsy for the dead man’s family, said Brown had been shot at least six times and probably could have survived all but one. Baden said he believed the bullet that hit the top of Brown’s head and traveled through his brain was probably fatal.

Appearing before reporters in the sanctuary of the Greater St. Mark Family Church in St. Louis on Monday, Baden and three of the Brown family attorneys displayed the diagram of Brown’s wounds that was released with the autopsy.

Two of the gunshot wounds were graze wounds, Baden said, and two may have been reentry wounds. Baden also said there were abrasions on the right side of Brown’s face, which he believes occurred when Brown was struck in the head with a bullet and fell to the ground.

Baden’s report suggested that Brown was shot from a distance of at least one to two feet. But he said he needed access to Brown’s clothing before he could make a more definitive determination.

Attorney Benjamin Crump said the Brown family had asked for the independent autopsy because of uncertainty at the time over whether federal officials would conduct their own examination of Brown’s body.

“It answers just the basic questions,” Crump said, “the number of shots, which was always a question that not only the family had, but the citizens of Ferguson and people all over the country.”

At the White House, Obama repeated a call for calm in the community and said the amount of military-style equipment that police forces have been receiving from the federal government needed to be reviewed.

Obama said the Justice Department would carefully monitor events in Ferguson and the use of Missouri National Guard units.

National Guard mobilization should be “limited and appropriate,” Obama said, noting that the decision to use the military units had been made by state officials.

It’s important to ensure that “peaceful protesters” have an opportunity to air their grievances, Obama said, adding that law enforcement officers need to be able to protect communities against people who are using the unrest as an excuse for looting or violence.

And he decried a “gulf of mistrust” between residents and police that exists in “too many communities.”

Holder did not identify the new FBI leads and said more than 40 FBI agents were canvassing the neighborhood where Brown had been shot. He said a third autopsy on Brown’s body was being performed Monday “by one of the most experienced medical examiners in the United States military.”

Local officials also have performed an autopsy, but its findings have not been released.

The attorney general requested the public’s patience during the Justice Department’s investigation, but voiced concern about the separate state investigation.

“The selective release of sensitive information that we have seen in this case so far is troubling to me,” he said.

Although Ferguson was not under curfew Monday night, police told demonstrators — some waving roses at dusk — that they needed to keep moving and avoid congregating on sidewalks and parking lots.

A midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew that had been in effect for two nights was lifted for Monday evening. But each night, demonstrators clashed with police and troopers, who used tear gas to disperse the crowd. At least two people were shot overnight Sunday, seven people were arrested, and officials managing the police response complained they were pelted with bottles and Molotov cocktails as gunshots rang out.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon issued the executive order early Monday to bring in the National Guard, saying in a statement that its “limited mission” will be to protect the command post so local law enforcement officials can ensure the safety of peaceful demonstrators.

Community and civic leaders who have been in Ferguson for the recent demonstrations told reporters Monday that they were worried about another challenging night.

Malik Shabazz, a former New Black Panthers leader who has been working in Ferguson trying to keep demonstrations peaceful, said he thought the National Guard would exacerbate the situation.
 
“We have a tough job tonight,” he said, adding that he didn’t want peaceful demonstrations “overshadowed by agents and provocateurs.”

On West Florissant Avenue, Toriano Johnson, a barber at Prime Time Barbershop, said the curfew had backfired.

“You’re trying to shut people up. That’s not going to work,” he said. “You can move them around, but it’s still going to be a movement until justice is served.”

Shortly before the bottles began flying Monday night, Capt. Ronald Johnson, the Missouri State Highway Patrol officer in charge of security in Ferguson, strode through the dark up West Florissant Avenue, the scene of so much violence and tension since Brown’s death.

A police helicopter thundered overhead as groups of people, some carrying signs, some waving red roses, marched down the sidewalk. Police vehicles prowled the avenue, red and blue lights flashing.

Asked why police would not permit protesters to stand still, Johnson said the constant movement was to prevent infiltrators from blending in with the peaceful crowds and wreaking havoc, as had occurred Sunday night, when tear gas was hurled at marchers who said they had done nothing wrong.

But Johnson said he saw Molotov cocktails being thrown — not by marchers at the front of the pack, but by others behind them.

“Protesters do not need to stand still,” he said when a woman challenged the official orders. “They need to be heard.”",532,NA,"Obama to send Atty. Gen. Holder to #Ferguson, says National Guard use should be 'limited'",no images (only videos)

Protests have occurred every night since a Ferguson police officer fatally shot a young black man on Saturday. The reporters were among those who came to Missouri to cover the shooting and its aftermath.

Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of the Huffington Post were taken into custody in a McDonald's restaurant near a demonstration.

The action appeared to catch Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson by surprise.

""Oh, God,"" he told the Los Angeles Times when he learned what had happened. Then Jackson called the St. Louis County Police Department, which was heading the command Wednesday night.

“I told them to release them,” Jackson told The Times.

Lowery and Reilly were set free shortly thereafter. The chief said his staff had been unaware of the arrests until notified by a reporter.

Jackson said both Reilly and Lowery had interviewed him earlier in the day and had asked thoughtful questions. He said whoever arrested them was ""probably somebody who didn't know better.""

Lowery and Reilly tweeted that they were in a McDonald's near a demonstration when police came inside and asked patrons to leave.

""Officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking me to walk out of,"" Lowery tweeted after his release. ""Was waiting to be taken away, large black man SCREAMING for help in back of police truck. They refused his calls for paramedics. 'I'm dying. I'm dying. Please call help' he screamed. They mocked him.""

Lowery said he was released without paperwork or explanation.

Since the unrest began Saturday night, dozens of protesters have been arrested and one has been critically wounded by gunfire. At least 10 more people were arrested later Wednesday night as the unrest continued. 

Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html”> tweeted that he was canceling planned appearances to visit the area Thursday.

He was gathering his things and preparing to leave when his bag slipped off his shoulder, he said, so he told officers he would adjust his bag. Then, Lowery told Maddow, the officers said, ""Let's take him,"" forcibly removing him and putting him in temporary restraints.

""I was never looking to get arrested,"" Lowery said. “I don’t believe Ryan and I did anything to warrant getting arrested.""

Washington Post Executive Editor Martin D. Baron said ""there was absolutely no justification"" for Lowery's arrest and called the police conduct appalling.

""He was illegally instructed to stop taking video of officers,"" Baron said in a statement. ""Then he followed officers' instructions to leave a McDonald's — and after contradictory instructions on how to exit, he was slammed against a soda machine and then handcuffed. That behavior was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news. The physical risk to Wesley himself is obvious and outrageous.

Certainly public safety requires police forces of well-trained officers ready to put their lives on the line for the people they serve. It also requires that the people who pay for and rightfully expect to be protected by the police have well-founded confidence in them, and that confidence requires in turn that the public has an opportunity to discover and challenge bad or outmoded police policies, practices and attitudes.

Less than a week has passed since the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, and even less time since the killing of 26-year-old Ezell Ford here, so it is simply not yet possible to say with certainty whether police in each case followed their training and policy. But a basic fact of life in Ferguson is undeniable: An overwhelmingly white police force disproportionately stops and arrests African Americans. It is a situation that resonates in other cities across the nation, where occupation-style policing in nonwhite neighborhoods once prevailed and may prevail still. People must have reason to believe that police will hear and heed their legitimate complaints, and if there appears to be no safe and rational forum for that conversation, they will seek another one, as the violent encounters in Ferguson over the last five nights show.

Los Angeles is high on the list of cities with long histories of police abuses, especially in African American neighborhoods. Those include a number of deadly encounters between officers and mentally disturbed people that could have been avoided, so the Ford shooting is necessarily seen and felt in that context. But Los Angeles also has a history, albeit a much shorter one, of police reform and community engagement, so there may exist sufficient residual confidence that Ford's tragic death will be properly investigated and any necessary corrective action taken.

That's still not enough, though. Even if it turns out that policy and procedure were scrupulously followed in the Ford shooting, it is hard to believe that police cannot refine their encounters with unarmed citizens to avoid the use of deadly force — and to avoid reopening wounds that have barely begun to heal here and remain raw elsewhere.",40,NA,"Two police shootings -- one in Ferguson, Mo., one in L.A. -- have some sad common threads",NA

Michael Brown, an 18-year old African American man was shot by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. The Washington Post had more on the story about what one witness called an ""execution style slaying.""

Lawyer Freeman Bosley Jr. told the Post that, ""Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's, has told the {FBI}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/fbi-ORGOV000008-topic.html”> that Officer Darren Wilson confronted the two because they were walking in the middle of the street.

""Wilson cursed at the pair and ordered them onto the sidewalk, Bosley told The Washington Post. When they refused to comply, he said, the officer grabbed Brown's throat through the window of his cruiser, pulled out a pistol and shot him. Wilson then chased Brown, shot him in the back and shot him five to six more times as Brown's hands were raised, Bosley said.""

An autopsy, commissioned by the Brown family, suggests that account is not true, at least in regard to the most incendiary charge. None of the bullets fired at Johnson entered his body through his back. That hardly means that Wilson was justified shooting Brown even once. Nor does it necessarily mean Wilson is a murderer. The simple fact is we don't know.

The rush to condemn Wilson's conduct and the gallop to martyr Brown may have set land speed records. The New Yorker, like numerous outlets, reported that Brown was walking to his grandmother's house when confronted by Wilson. A video released from the by turns hapless and devious Ferguson police department alleges he was actually walking from a thuggish and brazen shoplifting of a box of cigars from a convenience store.

That fact is almost surely irrelevant to Wilson's state of mind, since the police said he didn't know about the incident. It is, however, inconvenient from the martyrdom angle.

But don't tell that to the legions of too-often interchangeable activists, commentators and reporters who have convinced themselves that we know exactly what happened, or at least all we need to know.

Until charges are brought against Wilson, this will go on.""

Hayes — actually one of MSNBC's cooler heads in this tale — was quick to respond to critics that he was simply reporting on the mood in the city. I'm sure he's right about the mood of the people he's listening too. But such moods have no legal standing whatsoever.

Nearly everything about this story is ugly: The gleeful ideological and bureaucratic point-scoring, the spectacle of a militarized police force and bunkered police leadership, the self-congratulatory advocacy journalism, the Molotov cocktails and despondent victims of looting, the vulture-like descent of Sharpton and Co., and the constant rationalizations of lawlessness that come with seeing the right ""context."" (Context! Is there nothing it can't do?)

Save for the occasionally reported efforts of Ferguson residents and civic leaders to restore calm and clean up the nightly mess, there's little admirable or uplifting to any of it. There's the air of ""the worse, the better"" behind so many of the agendas.

There also seems to be a bipartisan desire to make President Obama part of the story. He is the first black president and a former community organizer, after all. The media maw needs a quote.

Obama, as is his wont, took the bait. His comments Friday were defensible on the merits, but what was the point?

While peaceful demonstrators tried to dissuade them, even attempting to block shop fronts with their bodies, small groups of looters smashed windows and rushed into several stores, grabbing merchandise. Police in riot gear shouted on bullhorns, ordering them to disperse.

A group of five men broke into a beauty supply store before they were confronted by other protesters, who halted them by forming a chain in front of the entrance and chanting, ""Hands up, don't shoot!""

The would-be looters then rushed the mini-mart that has become a center of controversy after police released surveilance video Friday purporting to show Brown grabbing cigars and strong-arming a store clerk not long before his fatal encounter with police.

The Brown family’s attorney accused Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson of character assassination Friday for releasing the video purportedly tying Brown to the robbery at the same time the department released the identity of the officer who later shot him.

“He chose to talk about something to darken up this man’s past,” attorney Anthony Gray said at a news conference Friday.

Protests outside the mini-mart unfolded relatively quietly with a somewhat festive atmosphere Friday night, then turned disruptive in the early morning hours of Saturday.

""You must disperse immediately or you will be subject to arrest,"" officers said over a megaphone as the crowd stood in the street.

At first the protesters began to clear the street, but then some bottles were thrown and soon glass littered the asphalt. At least three Molotov cocktails were lobbed, CNN reported.

Kevin Brankley, 29, a construction worker, said he knew Brown, who was shot one week ago by a Ferguson police officer. Brankley saw police shoot tear gas at one point near the intersection, and some civilians shot guns into the air in response.

Cones that formed a roadblock near the intersection were being dragged by protesters closer to the police.

""The more worse they act,"" Brankley said of the police, ""the more worse we’ll act.""

Latasha Hughes and Bianca Bailey, who attended the same high school as Brown, watched in dismay as groups of mostly young black men looted at least two nearby stores.

Bailey, 20, was still wearing her uniform from the McDonald's next to the mini-mart.

“It's a tragedy,” she said of the looting, “But at the same time, it's a lesson. The choices that they're making are going to have consequences.""

Hughes said she felt divided.

“As far as the looting, I can’t condone it,” she said, “But if it's the way they think they can have justice ....”

She watched protesters confronting police, including a woman who she heard shout at officers: ""Go ahead and shoot me!""

Hughes, 20, was glad that police in four armored vehicles held back, not intervening to stop the looting, but said they also fed the mayhem.

""Having a standoff with police, trying to entice them, that's a no-no,"" she said. ""They're doing their job to protect and serve. They don’t want to have a mass murder.""

A helicopter passed overhead, illuminating the scene as police began to advance at about 1:30 a.m., urging protesters to clear the streets.

“Was it important, was it worth it?” one young woman asked a young man in front of a smashed meat market after rioters had moved on.

“I think it's pretty stupid, to be honest,"" said Marqueise Gordon, 18, who said he watched the events at the meat market but didn't participate. “The same store that people are breaking into is the same store people are going to go into to buy whatever,” he said. “It doesn’t make sense.”

Still, he held up a bottle of liquor, which he said the looters had given him.

An older man watched the chaos. “This is crazy. This is not what it's for,” he said as several young men ran past, toting boxes of beer. “Why?” he called to them, in a tone of despair. “Why?”

Down the hill, advancing against them late Monday night, were police officers in gas masks and riot gear, most of them white.

“Don’t shoot!” some of the demonstrators yelled, inching closer to the barely visible police line. One man drifted several dozen feet closer with his arms up, lifting his shirt and spinning around as if to say: Look, no gun.

Then an older woman in a dust mask to shield her a bit from the swirling tear gas spotted him and shouted, “Get your ass back here!”

The two sides were locked in confrontation in this working-class suburb of St. Louis, where the police shooting of an unarmed young black man triggered a night of looting Sunday — and demands for justice from a predominantly black population.

The nighttime standoff and billowing tear gas on West Florissant Avenue reflected simmering racial tensions in Ferguson, population 21,000, where two-thirds of residents are black but police and city officials are predominantly white.

In a suburb abandoned by some whites as blacks moved in decades ago, the death Saturday of Michael Brown, 18, brought national attention to what many black residents say is a pattern of racial injustice here.

As the U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation in conjunction with a separate county police inquiry, black leaders called for nonviolence but accused local police and other officials of condoning racism in Ferguson and greater St. Louis for too long.

“In the greater picture, what we saw … was the boiling over of tensions that had been going on for a long while,” said Antonio French, a St. Louis city alderman who is black.

James Clark, vice president of a St. Louis nonprofit, Community Outreach for a Better Life, said the violence following Brown’s death was “due to a total alienation of a certain class of African Americans.”

Ferguson’s police chief and mayor are white. Of the six City Council members, one is black. The local school board has six white members and one Latino. Of the 53 commissioned officers on the police force, three are black, said Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson.

Blacks in Ferguson are twice as likely to be stopped by police as whites, according to an annual report on racial profiling by the Missouri attorney general. Last year, 93% of arrests following car stops in Ferguson were of blacks. Ninety-two percent of searches and 80% of car stops involved blacks, the report said.

Brown was walking down a street with a friend Saturday when, according to police, an officer drove up and attempted to get out of his patrol car. Brown pushed the officer back into the car, then entered the vehicle as the two men struggled over the officer’s gun, according to Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County Police Department.

During the altercation a shot was fired inside the car, Belmar said. The officer and Brown then got out of the car, and at that point the fatal shooting occurred, Belmar said. Brown was shot “more than just a couple of times,” but it was unclear how many shots were fired, Belmar said.

Witnesses challenged the police version of events. One resident, Piaget Crenshaw, said Brown “ran for his life.”

“They shot him and he fell,” Crenshaw said. “He put his arms up to let them know that he was compliant and he was unarmed, and they shot him twice more and he fell to the ground and died.”

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles pledged in a televised interview that “justice will be served” and called on the people of Ferguson to “have faith in the process.”

Belmar told reporters: “I understand that the public has a right to be skeptical … but I would also ask the public to be reasonable because it takes a long time to make sure we do this investigation the right way.”

At the police station Monday morning, protesters said they wanted the police officer identified, fired and charged in the killing. They also demanded that the Ferguson police force reflect the racial demographic of the community. The demonstrators raised their hands in mock surrender, chanting: “Hands up! Don’t shoot!”

“People are angry, people are hurt, people are fed up,” said one protester, Derek Laney, 49, of St. Louis.

Jerryl Christmas, 50, a defense attorney and former prosecutor for the city of St. Louis, watched from the sidewalk Monday in a bright striped tie, holding a small bullhorn.

“Look out here right now,” Christmas said, gesturing to the line of white police officers. “The lack of black police officers either on the street or at the administrative level…. This whole area, this city is a racial powder keg.”

As riot police squeezed protesters farther down the street Monday morning, Jackson, the city’s police chief, stood, sunburned and sweating, in the shade of a billboard across from the police station. He said he was shot at three times outside Wal-Mart during Sunday night’s riots.

He said about 12 businesses were damaged by a crowd that smashed windows, looted stores and set a fire inside a mini-mart. Some chanted: “No justice! No peace!”

Police arrested 32 people for looting. Several police officers were slightly injured.

Jackson said he planned to identify the suspended officer involved in Brown’s shooting after he contacted him — in case the officer wanted to go elsewhere for his own safety.

Police arrested seven people during Monday’s demonstration in the morning, Jackson said. “We want them to be able to protest,” he said. But after peaceful protesters left, they were replaced by angry demonstrators “not so much interested in peaceful resolution,” Jackson said.

As Brown’s parents wiped away tears at a news conference in Ferguson, their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, told reporters: “I don’t want to sugarcoat. That brother was executed in broad daylight.”

Crump, who also represented the parents of slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin, said the Brown family and many other Ferguson residents didn’t trust the police or local authorities.

“They are devastated that this happens again and again and it’s swept under the rug again and again,” Crump said. “Not this time.”

Brown’s parents said they had planned to drop off their son to begin community college on Monday. Instead, they were planning his funeral.

Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, wept as she held up a photo of her son. “We are going to do this right,” she said. “We don’t want no violence because Michael wouldn’t have wanted violence.”

Michael’s father, Michael Brown Sr., repeated three times: “We need justice for our son.”

Earlier Monday, a school district adjacent to Ferguson canceled the first day of school, saying it was concerned for student safety following Sunday night’s violence.

On Monday afternoon, the sound of hammers could be heard for more than a mile up and down West Florissant Avenue, where looters had smashed windows at fast-food restaurants, auto shops and other buildings the night before.

Workers hustled to replace Zisser Tire’s windows with plywood. Thieves had stolen tire rims from the showroom; video captured one thief using a rim to smash out each of the windows.

Dennis G. Ferguson, a salesman for the store, said he had called the owner the night before and debated bringing in rifles as looters worked their way down the street. Ultimately, he decided against it.

Ferguson insisted that the looting did not reflect the neighborhood.

“This is a nice community,” he said, recounting that residents had helped protect businesses overnight. “We had several teenagers come by to see if they could help clean up.”",314,NA,"Protesters outraged by the killing of Michael Brown take to the streets in Ferguson, Mo., and confront police",NA

But the return of smashed shop windows and sporadic looting overnight after more than a day of largely peaceful demonstrations and a lower-key police presence prompted some residents to warn that public anger over the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown had not subsided.

“This is wonderful. This is what should have happened a long time ago,” Robert Powell, 42, said as he watched looters during the night hop through the shattered glass door of a meat market.

Powell, who owns a professional cleaning service, grew up on the city's west side, and to him, this was small-time crime.

He dismissed the looters as ""suburban nerds"" likely to get busted. But after years of living in a town where he said African American men are singled out for harsh treatment by the police, he shared the looters’ frustration.

He gestured to surrounding businesses, whose fluorescent lights were now shattered, their parking lots strewn with broken bottles.

""They support these police, give them free food. People just got tired of it,"" he said.

Powell blamed the unrest on the Ferguson police chief's release of information Friday about Brown.

Along with the identity of the officer who shot Brown after a confrontation a week ago that allegedly began in the officer’s car, police on Friday also released surveillance video purporting to show that Brown had robbed a mini-mart shortly before his encounter with police.

Many Ferguson residents have said the release inappropriately pointed blame at Brown at a time when the focus should have been on the officer who shot him.

“I guarantee things will change after this,” Powell said.

A few young men ran by as he spoke, looted cigarillos spilling from their pockets. More were jumping the door into the market. Powell stepped to the curb and shouted: “Hey, get out of there!” They ignored him.

“The president needs to come here,” Powell said. “He needs to make sure they fire the police chief of Ferguson, get an alternative prosecutor and put [Gov.]{Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-unrest-20140816-story.html#”> in a corner. He's anti-black people and pro-law enforcement,” Powell said. “That will be a start.”

Further down the road, Etefia Umana and his son were walking past the scene of the earlier mayhem, with Umana pointing out businesses where citizens had prevented looters from entering.

""We had some friends who were blocking stores,” he said, though he admitted that at some businesses, “eventually they were overwhelmed.”

Umana said he came simply to bear witness. ""To make sure the community is safe.”",304,NA,A night of looting in Ferguson but police maintain a low-key presence,NA

Little could be seen of what lay at the bottom of the hill, where bright police lights blinded out the source of the tear gas that riot officers were tossing at the young men and women.

""Hands up, don't shoot,"" the protesters chanted, inching closer to the barely visible police line. One man drifted several dozen feet closer with his arms up, lifting his shirt and spinning around as if to say: Look, no gun. Then an older woman in a dust mask spotted him and shouted, ""Get your ass back here!""

When a Los Angeles Times reporter would interview one of the young demonstrators, the message was often the same, give or take a profanity: They wanted respect from the police. And they didn't want to become another Michael Brown, the 18-year-old unarmed man shot to death by police on Saturday.

Then they would go back to shouting at the police.

""These are the next kids to get shot, right here,"" said Troy Woods, 48, of St. Louis, gesturing at the demonstrators -- ""16, 17, 18 years old. ... They treat us like second class all the way down the line.""

Ricky Jones, 34, shouted his grievances. ""Insurance is high, gas is high, but that's not why I get mad,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, when I'm driving home, they ask me to pull over and get out of the car. No 'license and registration, please.' Get out of the car. Lay on the ground. Put your hands on your head.""

And whenever the next young black man gets killed by police, like Brown, he says, ""it doesn't even matter what the story is."" The outcome, he says, is basically the same.

Regina Woods, 43, watched the action from inside her car as police pushed the demonstrators farther and farther up the hill with tear gas and noisemakers.

""I came out to monitor our youth in their peaceful demonstration,"" she said, nodding to a group of shouting protesters. A few minutes earlier, some of them had started throwing stones at police.

Just then, another tear gas canister landed on top of the hill. She fled, along with many of the other onlookers.

A young woman warned a Times reporter to go, saying other protesters were thinking about bringing out guns.

LATimes,lat19,http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-fergsuon-shooting-police-name-20140815-story.html,Officer who shot Michael Brown didn't know he was a robbery suspect,Molly Hennessy-Fiske; Matt Pearce; Tina Susman,08/15/2014,02/18/2016,"The fatal encounter between a police officer and an unarmed young man began when the officer stopped the man because he was walking in the street, Ferguson’s police chief said Friday in a revelation that added to public anger and confusion over Michael Brown’s death.

The disclosure came hours after police released a report identifying Brown, 18, as a suspect in a robbery that occurred minutes before Brown was shot dead by Officer Darren Wilson, who was publicly identified Friday after nearly a week of public pressure.

The Brown family’s attorney accused Police Chief Thomas Jackson of character assassination for tying Brown to the crime.

“He chose to talk about something to darken up this man’s past,” attorney Anthony Gray said at news conference. “Let me be real clear to everyone here,” he added. “This family has never said Michael Brown was a perfect kid.”

Whatever Brown did, the family’s attorney and many residents who have taken part in protests and marches said he should not have ended up dead in the street, and they said the outcome spoke to racism in a police department that is overwhelmingly white. Brown was African American.

“I think it’s a coverup, basically,” said Jessica Holmes, who lives in Ferguson and who like many locals followed the flurry of news conferences that took place throughout the day, beginning with Jackson’s.

The renewed skepticism was echoed by others throughout the day and threatened to derail the relative calm that settled over the area Thursday, after Gov. Jay Nixon put Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson in charge of Ferguson’s security.

Angry protests punctuated by police in military gear throwing tear gas were replaced by an almost festive atmosphere Thursday night. By Friday afternoon, officials and the Brown family’s attorney were appealing for continued calm, even as they expressed anger and bewilderment at the latest turn of events.

“Do not take the bait from anybody who is trying to character assassinate Mike,” Gray said. “Don’t take that and begin to riot....This family is not for that.”

At a separate news conference, Jackson described Wilson, who has been placed on administrative leave, as a distinguished officer. He said the policeman was devastated by what had occurred and said Wilson suffered a swollen face during his encounter with Brown.

“He never intended for any of this to happen,” said Jackson, who also said that his “heart goes out” to the Brown family. “I can’t imagine what they’re going through.”

Nobody answered the door of Wilson’s red brick house Friday. “He’s not there,” said one police officer parked nearby, who was not authorized to speak to the media. “You're probably wasting your time if you're hoping for him to come back,” another officer said. “Let me ask you: Would you stay there?”

According to Jackson, Wilson had just finished responding to a call that was unrelated to the robbery when he came upon Brown and a second man. Wilson stopped them because they were “walking down the middle of the street,” Jackson said.

After the news conference, the chief told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Wilson was aware that cigars had been taken in the robbery of a store nearby, but did not know Brown and the other man, Dorian Johnson, might be suspects. Jackson said Wilson then saw cigars in Brown’s hand and realized it might be connected.

Police have said that when Wilson tried to get out of his vehicle, Brown pushed him back into the car, then entered it and began fighting for the officer’s gun. A shot was fired inside the car. Wilson and Brown got out of the vehicle, and the fatal shooting occurred, police have said.

Witnesses, including Johnson, say that Wilson made the first move toward Brown. Johnson said the officer ordered the two to “get the eff onto the sidewalk,” then grabbed Brown around the neck. Another witness, Piaget Crenshaw, said she saw police chase Brown. “They shot him and he fell,” Crenshaw said.

Police released a copy of a {police report}<hyperlink=”http://documents.latimes.com/police-report-michael-brown-case/”> on a call that was received regarding a strong-arm robbery that occurred at a convenience store minutes before the shooting. Portions of the incident were captured by surveillance cameras. Jackson did not identify Brown as a suspect in that incident, but the police report did.

According to the report, Brown and Johnson entered a convenience store on Aug. 9. It said information from three surveillance cameras, a clerk and a patron in the store, whose names were redacted, indicated that Brown handed a box of cigars to Johnson.

As Johnson set the cigars on the counter, “Brown turns away from the counter with another box of … cigars and walks towards the exit door,” the report says. It goes on to describe an altercation between Brown and someone who came out from behind the counter and “stands between Brown and the exit door.”

“Brown aggressively pulls” the person toward him “and then immediately pushes him back into a display rack,” the report said. “Brown towers over” the person, “appearing to intimidate him,” it said. According to the report, Brown then followed Johnson out the door. Johnson was not charged with a crime, Jackson said.

When still photographs of the robbery were shown on a television at a nearby McDonald's, viewers started comparing details of the suspect's clothing to what Brown was wearing when he was shot and killed, arguing that Brown wasn't the man shown in the pictures.

Outside, the Rev. Erick Winston, 42, a minister in Ferguson, said he had brought his daughter to Jackson’s news conference “just to see how the process goes, so that the facts come out.”

Of the robbery revelation, Winston said, “Even if he was a robbery suspect, he was still unarmed. The procedure [for police dealing with robbery suspects] is to call for backup. How this ended was totally uncalled for, regardless of whether he was a suspect, and if he did it at all, we don't know.”

Local authorities are investigating the case, as are the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department.

Johnson, the Highway Patrol captain, offered his own criticism of the police department’s release of the information, expressing concern that it had given out details of the robbery without answering questions about it or Brown’s alleged involvement.

“These are two separate issues,” Johnson said of the robbery and Brown’s death. “I’m not going to say one justifies the other. I think if we’re going to give answers, we need not give hints. We need to say it.”

He and Nixon appeared before the media and an impassioned crowd of citizens for a news conference that exposed the simmering anger and distrust among many residents.

“We have children and families that we love. If we cannot trust our police officers, who can we trust?” Michelle Foster, who lives in neighboring Florissant, asked Nixon.

Nixon said people should look to Johnson, who grew up in the community and who has been on the streets reaching out to angry residents.

Foster was skeptical.

“This distrust has been going on for so long it's going to take many years” to rebuild, she said later.

Another resident, Curtis Royston III, expressed doubts in Johnson’s ability to lead Ferguson through the turmoil unless he could guarantee an improvement over police in disseminating information to the public.

Otherwise, Royston predicted more violence because “we’re back where we were before.”

Nixon was asked whether he thought heavily armed Ferguson police had mishandled the situation after Brown’s shooting. He said no. But he described the community reaction as “an appropriate outpouring of angst,” and said the focus should be on how and why Brown died.

He also said that the investigation would take time.

“I think there are going to be some bumps along this road to justice,” Nixon said. “I think there are going to be some moments of angst between now and the finish line.”",879,NA,"The Ferguson, Mo., police officer who shot unarmed Michael Brown, 18, is identified as Darren Wilson",NA
LATimes,lat20,http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-michael-brown-20140817-story.html,"Autopsy shows Michael Brown was shot six times, and twice in the head",Molly Hennessy-Fiske; Richard A. Serrano,08/17/2014,03/24/2016,"Michael Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, a preliminary private autopsy found, a Brown family attorney said Sunday night.

This mostly black St. Louis suburb has been racked by unrest since Brown was shot by a Ferguson police officer Aug. 9. More turmoil erupted hours before the midnight curfew was to take effect.

Protesters have marched every night since Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man, was killed by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. Some demonstrations have been punctuated by looting, vandalism, tear gas and rubber bullets.

On Sunday, the Brown family received a diagram from the private autopsy performed by former New York City Medical Examiner Michael M. Baden, family attorney Anthony Gray said. The diagram showed six entry wounds, including two to the head, he said.

“It raises the same questions we had before,” he said, adding, “The bullet marks on the body are consistent with the witness statements.”
One of the wounds was on top of Brown’s head, Gray said.

“To have a shot that’s at a 90-degree angle from the top of his skull to the bottom of his chin, almost vertical, that sounds like an officer standing over him,” he said.

Baden said his examination suggested that none of the six bullets was fired at point-blank range, but all were fired from at least one to two feet away.

“There’s no evidence of powder residue,” Baden said in a telephone interview with the Los Angeles Times.

Baden said two bullets struck Brown in the head: one in the forehead and one at the top of the head — fired at “a right angle to the top of the head.”
“The top of the head one was the one that would have made him unconscious and fall to the ground,” Baden said.

But it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from that, he said, without also considering witness statements and marks on Brown’s clothing. “The head is very movable, and it can be in a number of positions,” he said.

At least one of the wounds to Brown’s arm “could have been defensive,” Baden said. 

The autopsy results were first reported by the New York Times.
Police say Brown had participated in a strong-arm robbery at a mini-mart shortly before his encounter with the Ferguson officer.

At least one witness who was accompanying Brown that afternoon has said Brown was shot as he walked away from the police officer with his hands raised, and then was hit with additional bullets.

Also Sunday, U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. instructed the Justice Department to have a federal medical examiner perform an autopsy on Brown, citing “extraordinary circumstances” and the family’s request. It will be the third autopsy in the case, counting the local official one.

Holder’s decision is the latest development showing that federal investigators are conducting a far different inquiry than local officials. Federal authorities are reviewing the shooting to determine whether there were any civil rights violations, while local officials said they were trying to determine whether the officer was justified in using lethal force.

More than 1,300 participants filled Greater Grace Church and spilled out the door for an afternoon rally hosted Sunday by Brown’s family, Al Sharpton’s National Action Network and the National Bar Assn.

Sharpton urged the community to take positive action, and to vote. “Don’t loot in Michael’s name,” he implored. He added, “You all got to start voting and showing up — 12% turnout is an insult to your children.”
Among those who spoke was Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson, who took charge of the police response to protests late last week at Gov. Jay Nixon’s direction.

Johnson, appearing in uniform, told the crowd that he had met Saturday with some of Brown’s relatives.
“They brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart,” Johnson said. “I wear this uniform. And I should stand up here and say I’m sorry.”

On Sunday, as protesters returned to the streets, the St. Louis County Police Department tweeted about 9:15 p.m.: “Molotov cocktails [were] being thrown at police. Tactical units on the scene. Please leave the area!”

Authorities said gunshots had been reported in the central demonstration area and warned people to clear the streets.

Protesters were marching peacefully, holding their hands in the air and chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot.”
Overnight Saturday and into Sunday, protests broke out as police sought to enforce the curfew imposed to quell unrest. An unidentified male was in critical condition after being shot.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Al Nothum said the wounded man was a protester shot by a fellow protester. The motive was unclear, he said, adding, “We don’t know if it was intentional or not.” The victim was driven to a hospital in critical condition, he said.

Seven people were arrested in connection with the Saturday clashes, all for failure to disperse, he said.

Nothum said Johnson “made it real clear that we will use any force necessary.”

Saturday was the quietest in nearly a week, with no reports of looting, Nothum said. “Last night was one of the best evenings that we had even though it was quite hectic.”

On Sunday night, some protesters were astonished at the police response.

“It’s unbelievable. This is something you would see on TV in a third-world country,” said Martin McDonald, 38, a truck driver from Florissant who had joined the crowd for the first time Sunday. “Tear gas — I’ve never seen it escalate to that point.”",388,NA,"A private autopsy shows that Michael Brown was shot six times, including twice in the head",NA

A police patrol car was also shot at when officers came to the aid of the gunshot victim, who was the target of an unknown gunman, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson told reporters.

Seven people were arrested for failure to disperse during a night that saw police deploy smoke canisters and tear gas to hold back demonstrators who for the past week have been protesting Brown's death.

Brown was shot Aug. 9 by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson after a confrontation that police said began in the officer’s car. Witnesses said Brown was holding his hands aloft in surrender when he was hit.

In contrast to the mayhem of earlier this week, there was no looting Saturday night, and a midnight curfew announced earlier in the day by Gov. Jay Nixon kept the streets largely empty except for sporadic incidents.

In part, that was because officers were deployed in front of businesses previously targeted by looters and were able to prevent any attacks, Johnson said, but he said several gunshots were heard during the night.

“I can tell you that I was disappointed in the actions of tonight,” Johnson said, but he said the police deployment appeared effective in protecting businesses.

“It was effective. We sustained the health of those businesses, and we also sustained the safety of the protesters that were out [and] around tonight,” he said.

Johnson said officials had received reports of armed subjects inside a barbecue restaurant where demonstrators had gathered. One person came into the street carrying a gun, and police deployed smoke canisters in an effort to push back the crowd, Johnson said.

Once police received a report that someone had been shot, they deployed tear gas in an attempt to reach the victim. The shooting victim was taken to the hospital in a private citizen’s car, he said.

“Also a police car at that location was shot at. We can’t confirm that it was hit, it was shot at,” he said.

The people inside the barbecue restaurant fled as police approached, Johnson said.

During the course of the night, ""I did hear several gunshots fired into the air,"" he added.

Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who was trying to get the crowd of demonstrators in the street to disperse after curfew fell, told the Los Angeles Times that he heard gunshots come from a “hard-core” group that didn't scatter when other demonstrators did.

The evening unfolded with police deploying several armored personnel carriers and vans filled with scores of riot police. Protesters had advanced toward a press cordon where dozens of journalists watched from a distance.

“This is the Police Department! You are violating the state-imposed curfew,” a voice called out on a bullhorn.

A protester replied, also via bullhorn: “We have the right to assemble peacefully. ... We are Mike Brown! We are Mike Brown! We are Mike Brown!”

Then a police leader, behind the lines, called out, “Gas, gas, gas!” and the police fired smoke-filled canisters, though it was unclear whether they contained tear gas. A police line inched ahead.

At a news conference earlier Saturday, Nixon urged residents to obey the curfew, as did Johnson, a Ferguson native the governor put in charge of the city’s security on Thursday.

Johnson had pledged that enforcement of the curfew would not be heavy-handed.

“This is not to silence the people of Ferguson,” Nixon said.

About half an hour before the curfew was to take effect, a few men stood guard in the rain at a makeshift memorial where Brown was shot at the Canfield Green Apartments. A few sounds rang out, possibly gunshots. But the back streets were mostly silent and empty.

“It's peaceful over here,” said Canfield Green resident Phil Walker, 39, “and it's going to stay that way.”",68,NA,"Police deploy smoke canisters and tear gas against protesters to enforce midnight curfew in Ferguson, Mo.",NA

Scenes of police in riot gear and clouds of tear gas have been all too frequent in Ferguson since Brown was gunned down Aug. 9, and Twitter has served as a live stream of the clashes between cops and civilians.

The hashtag #Ferguson has remained the top trend on Twitter for nearly the entire week, as a mixture of established print, television and digital reporters have used the website as a rolling notepad, chronicling developments both large and small through tweets, photographs and brief videos.

Twitter has seen more than 4 million tweets containing the hashtag #Ferguson in the last seven days, with more than 450,000 between Friday and Saturday evenings, according to Topsy.com, a website that provides data on social media trends. In one hour Saturday, about 23,000 tweets carried the hashtag.

Twitter has served as a haven for journalists in recent years, with reporters often breaking details of rapidly developing stories at 140 characters rather than waiting to publish longer articles online or in print, or to go on the air with them.

Although many stories have hijacked the attention of Twitter's 271 million monthly active users, few have dominated the website for as long as the clashes and civil unrest in Ferguson.

""The St. Louis metropolitan area has been an extreme example of racial segregation for 100 years,"" said Clarissa Hayward, an associate professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis. ""St. Louis is the beginning of the West, the nexus of the Midwest and at the border of the South.""

The practices and politics of St. Louis created the problems that underlie the tension that boiled out in Ferguson this week, Hayward said.

St. Louis enacted racial zoning laws in 1916 that were struck down the following year, Hayward said. But the city turned to racial covenants on property deeds to preserve its segregation. The system continued until 1948, when the {U.S. Supreme Court}<hyperlink=” http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/justice-system/u.s.-supreme-court-ORGOV0000126-topic.html”> struck it down in its landmark Shelley vs. Kraemer decision.

The city's economy has been tied to the Midwest Rust Belt, failing to benefit from the last several decades of industrialization in the South. The metropolitan area lost two Chrysler assembly plants, as well as a Ford assembly plant, among many industrial losses to its economy.

Meanwhile, its repressive social sensibilities pushed its black population into a ring of suburbs that have poorly funded schools and local governments still dominated by white officials.

""Ferguson is part of a suburban ring that was white until the 1970s when the blacks could begin to move,"" said Margaret Garb, an associate history professor at Washington University. ""Many blacks went to Ferguson from north St. Louis, which was devastated by industrial closures and bleak project housing.""

The suburban school districts have been so poorly funded that some of them lost their accreditation, the result of funding cutbacks by the state, and students were forced to accept busing to other school districts, Garb said.

""There is a debate over whether St. Louis is a Southern city or a Midwest city,"" Garb added. ""The great migration of blacks early in the 20th century had a big impact on St. Louis, which was a stopping-off point for many on the journey to Chicago and Detroit.

""They arrived just as the good jobs were leaving,"" she said. ""That is one of the stories of the black migration.""

The city peaked about 1950, when the census reported 850,000 residents. By the {2010 census}<hyperlink=” http://www.latimes.com/topic/social-issues/2010-census-EVHST0000235-topic.html”>, it had dropped to just 320,000, even while the metropolitan area had surged to 6 million.

The area's long history with segregation may offer some explanation of why the police tactics this week in Ferguson appeared to inflame residents rather than keep the peace.

""When I learned that the police department was 95% white in a predominantly black city I was surprised,"" said Clark McPhail, an emeritus professor at the {University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}<hyperlink=” http://www.latimes.com/topic/education/colleges-universities/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign-OREDU0000155-topic.html”> and one of the nation's top experts on police tactics in controlling assembled groups.

McPhail said his assessment of their tactics was also a surprise. ""They were way behind the curve in their training and the way they responded. Tear gas is almost guaranteed to turn the crowd against the police. They were out of it.""

McPhail said the police were geared up for a major confrontation when there was little reason to expect a lethal confrontation.

""We have data of tens of thousands of protest events for the 20th century and the 19th century and violence occurs in 10% or 15% of the cases,"" he said. ""If police are not trained that way, they show up scared to death.

""If police grant the protesters some leeway rather than react to trivial violations of the law, it can be possible to defuse it,"" he said.",64,NA,The St. Louis metropolitan area has been an extreme of racial segregation for 100 years,NA

At a news conference, St. Louis police Chief Sam Dotson said the suspect held a knife overhead in ""a threatening manner"" as he approached at least two officers.

It was not clear how many shots were fired, and Dotson did not disclose the race of the man who was shot or of the officers. Both officers opened fire, and no one else was injured, Dotson said.

The incident unfolded in the shadow of Ferguson, where police and civilians have clashed since Aug. 9, when a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed young black man who witnesses have said had his hands up when he was gunned down.

As Dotson spoke shouts could be heard off-camera, and reporters repeatedly asked the chief if he feared similar unrest in St. Louis. City Alderman Antonio French, who has been heavily involved in the protests in Ferguson, said on Twitter that a crowd was already forming at the scene of Tuesday's shooting.
At one point Dotson was asked if he thought Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon should consider deploying the National Guard in the city.

“I think this is an incident that happened in the city of St. Louis,"" Dotson said.

At least one witness to the incident told police that the suspect may have been intentionally trying to provoke the police into shooting him. Dotson said the man was acting erratically before the shooting occurred.

""Shoot me, kill me now,"" the man said, according to Dotson.
Both officers have been placed on administrative leave and Dotson said he would try to make information available as quickly as possible. Based on the preliminary facts, though, Dotson seemed to suggest the officer's actions were justified.

“If a person is charging you with a knife and they’re within three or four feet, that’s a lethal range for a knife,"" he said.

The man's identity was not released, but Dotson described him as a 23-year-old male.

The shooting came as tensions in Ferguson were entering their 10th day. After days of clashes between police and protesters that made clouds of tear gas and images of riot police commonplace in the St. Louis suburb, tensions seemed to fizzle when the Missouri Highway Patrol was given control last week.

But a series of weekend protests turned violent again, leaving several people injured by gunfire and dozens of protesters in police custody. None of the gunfire came from police, said Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson.

Johnson and St. Louis County Police have both said officers have been the targets of gunfire and Molotov cocktails in recent days, and officers fear a group of outside ""troublemakers"" have hijacked what had been peaceful protests.",49,NA,"St. Louis police shoot, kill knife-wielding suspect just miles from #Ferguson unrest",NA

""Hands up!"" they chanted, their arms aloft. ""Don't shoot.""

""This is how the boy died!"" Kendrick Strong, 42, hollered at police officers Tuesday morning. ""This is how the boy died! With his hands up in the air!""

As St. Louis' predominantly black northern quarter has teetered toward chaos the last four days after police in the suburb of Ferguson killed an unarmed black 18-year-old, the chant has been one inescapable constant amid the worry and confusion and clamor.

The hands-up — a sign of surrender and submission black men and boys here say they learn early on when dealing with police — has been transformed into a different kind of weapon.

""If you're angry, throw your arms up,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who traveled to St. Louis in the wake of the death of Michael Brown. ""If you want justice, throw your arms up. Because that's the sign Michael was using. He had a surrender sign. That's the sign you have to deal with. Use the sign he last showed. We want answers why that last sign was not respected.""
Brown was shot and killed by an officer Saturday while Brown, according to witnesses, was running away with his hands up. Police say the shooting occurred after a struggle between Brown and a policeman over the officer's gun.

In the days since the shooting, riot police have been sweeping the streets in scenes that might be more recognizable in the Middle East. Stores have been looted, a gas station burned, a Catholic charity's window smashed. Teens have hurled rocks at cops. Officers have launched tear gas.

Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Brown's parents, has demanded that police identify the officer who shot Brown, but the Ferguson police chief declined to do so, citing death threats.
President Obama, noting the Justice Department is aiding local officials in investigating the shooting, said in a statement Tuesday, ""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding."" 

Local and national black community organizations have begun deliberating their roles in how to respond to Brown's death. And everyone wonders when the convulsive nighttime violence that has turned Ferguson into an unpredictable ""war zone"" — as some officers have put it — will end.

Just as ""Ferguson"" has transformed into instantly recognizable shorthand signifying the latest juncture in an unsettled national conversation over race and policing, the ""hands up, don't shoot"" chant has joined a long line of activist slogans that crystallize the heart of a community's moral outrage: Hell no, we won't go. No justice, no peace.

Demonstrators had taken up the chant Monday when hundreds of demonstrators, many older, marched in the streets in front of the Ferguson Police Department, their arms raised toward the blazing sun. About two-thirds of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are African American, but police and city officials are predominantly white.

The black teens and twentysomethings who took to the streets in Ferguson on Monday night did the same, lifting their hands to the glaring lights of a police chopper and the line of police vehicles — with officers in front — trying to keep them at bay.

But they also used the hands-up sign as a tool for provocation, drifting toward the police with their arms up, as if daring for a response. They mixed the hands-up chant with a taunting, obscene anti-police chant. The police eventually drove the group away with tear gas.

In Clayton the following morning, the hands-up protest was deployed again to confront police officers, but with more peaceful intentions. For several black men who looked on as a line of demonstrators held up their hands, some while on their knees, the symbol had powerful and even painful personal resonance.

Mark Sutton, 24, of St. Louis recalled an incident when he was 18. He had gone to the Saint Louis Galleria Mall with his little brother to pick out a prom suit, but ID checkers at the entrance wouldn't let him in.

Sutton said that as he walked away with a cellphone to his ear, a police officer grabbed his hand; surprised, he yanked his arm away and then was thrown to the ground, handcuffed and Tasered.

""That could have been me in '08,"" Sutton said of Brown's fate. ""I wouldn't be here to tell this story. I wouldn't be here to protest.""

Other men at the Clayton rally, young and old, shared similar stories.

""See this dent?"" said Aha Sen Piankhy, 38, tapping a finger to a scar on his face. ""I got smacked in the head with a flashlight because I didn't say, 'Yes, sir.'""

He added, ""I was 14 years old.""

Aha Sen said the hands-up chant was ""a good tool"" because it showed that police apparently violated the covenant not to shoot when hands are up — a gesture resented among black boys and men in the first place.

Brown, he said, ""knew to put his hands in the air, and they still killed him.""

But Strong said he detests the new symbol.

""You're showing yourself as weak. It says, 'I give up, I surrender to your authority,'"" he said. ""Whether his hands were up, if they were down, it doesn't matter.""

But when a police officer smirked at protesters Tuesday morning, Strong decided, the gesture seemed the best way to express displeasure.

Colbi Drake, 22, a student at the University of Missouri, had a different outlook on holding her hands up, citing other cases of young unarmed black men around the country who were killed.

""This is a very peaceful way of representing the people who aren't able to do this themselves,"" she said. ""That was always the symbol of surrendering. 'I have nothing! My hands are up!' Why would you still shoot? It makes no sense.""

And then Drake went back to watching the demonstrators facing police, with their arms raised to the sky.",54,NA,Michael Brown shooting: Protesters adopt hands-up gesture as symbol of defiance,NA

The {poll from the Pew Research Center}<hyperlink=""http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/"">, released Monday, shows Americans overall closely divided on whether the shooting by police of unarmed young black man Michael Brown in Ferguson raised ""important issues about race.""

But that overall division comes in large part because of sharply differing views by blacks and whites.

Blacks, by 4 to 1, said events in Ferguson did raise important racial issues. Whites were more closely divided, with 37% saying the case raised important racial questions, while 47% said they thought race was ""getting more attention than it deserved.""

Similarly, blacks by more than 3 to 1 said they thought the police reaction to events in Ferguson had ""gone too far,"" while whites divided almost evenly on that question, with 33% saying the police had gone too far, 32% saying the police reaction had been about right and 35% saying they did not know.
Whites had far more confidence than blacks about the official investigations into the shooting, with about half of whites, but only about 20% of blacks, saying they had at least a ""fair amount"" of confidence. Roughly three-quarters of blacks said they had ""not too much"" or no confidence at all in the investigations.

Those disparate views reflect frequently documented differences in how blacks and whites see issues of race. But the gap in perceptions of Ferguson was notably smaller than the racial differences Pew found last year in reactions to the jury verdict in the shooting of {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/trayvon-martin-PEOCVC000188-topic.html"">, the black teenager killed by {George Zimmerman}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/george-zimmerman-PECLB0000014809-topic.html"">, a neighborhood watch volunteer of white and Latino heritage in Florida.
Black perceptions of both events were quite similar, with about 80% of African Americans saying both cases had raised important racial issues.

But white perceptions of Zimmerman's acquittal by a Florida jury were more starkly in conflict with those of blacks. In the Florida case, whites by 28% to 60% said that race was getting too much attention, a much larger margin than the 37%-47% division of white opinion regarding Ferguson.

The different responses to the two cases may be a function of time, however. The unrest in Ferguson is now in its second week, but in the Florida case, Zimmerman's acquittal came after almost a year-and-a-half of racially charged debate over the shooting.

In addition to the racial divide, reactions to Ferguson also split along familiar partisan lines. Democrats were far more likely than Republicans to say that the shooting raises important racial issues. Among white Democrats, for example, only 25% said the racial issues were getting more attention than they deserved. Among white Republicans, 60% said they believed that was the case.",72,NA,"Blacks overwhelmingly say events in #Ferguson, Mo., raise important racial issues; whites closely divided",NA

As this city long ago learned, when the public loses trust in its police, many people suffer.

In Ferguson, a fatal confrontation between an officer of an overwhelmingly white police department and a young black man has led to more than a week of street protests because the community rejected the department's explanation of events. In Los Angeles in 1992, acquittals of the officers who beat Rodney G. King touched off days of rioting for precisely the same reason. The parallels don't end there, yet it seems that Missouri officials have refused to learn the lessons of Los Angeles' experience. To name a few:

• More than two decades ago, civic leaders here grasped the importance of diversity on the police force. Today, the {LAPD}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/law-enforcement/los-angeles-police-department-ORGOV000939-topic.html""> mirrors the city quite closely — Latinos are the department's largest ethnic group, and blacks make up just over 10% of the force, roughly equivalent to their representation in the city. Ferguson's force is almost entirely white — only three of 53 commissioned officers are black — even though the population of the city is two-thirds black. It is difficult for residents to trust a force that feels foreign.

The riots forced deep reflection in Los Angeles over how police should best handle unruly crowds. The department today attempts neither to yield to violence nor to provoke it. It's not always successful — by its own admission, its handling of a May Day rally in 2007 was cause for ""great concern."" Still, the LAPD's reputation for restraint in crowd control is generally deserved. By contrast, authorities in Ferguson responded to initial protests with heavy arms and tactics; the situation escalated rapidly.

The LAPD, after some hesitation, now routinely releases the names of officers involved in shootings. That practice shows that police are accountable, too. In Ferguson, authorities withheld the officer's name at first, convincing protesters that he was being protected.

The Los Angeles Police Department is far from perfect. Recent revelations about incorrectly categorized assaults have raised questions about the accuracy of its crime data, and last week's shooting of a mentally ill black man serves as a reminder that violent confrontations remain a tragic fact of police work. But for police to maintain the support of residents when mistakes are made or civilians hurt, there must be trust, which is best won through a commitment to transparency, accountability and addressing shortcomings openly and honestly. That's a lesson that's still being learned here, and it's what has been missing in Ferguson.",17,NA,"The makeup of police force in #Ferguson is almost all white, while the city's population is two-thirds black",NA

There were no assault rifles, riot gear or armored personnel vehicles that had inflamed tensions over the last week in this St. Louis suburb that has seethed with anger over the police killing of an unarmed black man.

Hundreds gathered near the site where police had fired tear gas and rubber bullets into unruly crowds for four straight nights in a show of force that was nationally criticized.

Hours earlier, Missouri Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html""> put the State Highway Patrol in charge of security over local law enforcement agencies and placed Capt. {Ronald Johnson}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/sports/football/ronald-johnson-PESPT0013813-topic.html"">, who is black and who grew up in Ferguson, in charge. By Thursday night there was a sea change.

People cheered as cars passed, horns honking, as if the hometown team had just won a championship. One demonstrator galloped down the street on a horse with his fist in the air. There were chants and demands for justice for Michael Brown, the 18-year-old shot and killed by a police officer. But there was also laughter. The sidewalks were so full that people spilled into the edges of the streets, grinning and shaking each others' hands.

At the center of it all was Johnson, who walked with the crowd and said in a televised interview that ""sometimes you just need to let people speak.""

After the unrest Wednesday night, Johnson said, he ""prayed for a better day, and we got a better day.” He told demonstrators they could stay as long as they wanted, as long as they kept the streets clear and avoided trouble, because police “will protect the safety of the community.”
Holding up a photo of Brown, Johnson said, ""This is why we are here.""

Shortly before 8 p.m., protesters outside a burned convenience store approached police cars and began yelling. But several representatives of the Black Panthers stepped in and urged the crowd to move back — and Johnson emerged to mingle with the crowd. Scores of bystanders obliged, while chanting and waving signs, and the police cars proceeded up the street without incident.

Kiarra Jones, 37, was impressed.

The accountant from St. Louis grew up here, and had joined protesters Sunday who were confronted by police.
“This is much more relaxed, a much calmer environment,” she said. “There's police present, but it's not an aggressive presence, intimidating the crowd.”

St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, among those jailed by police Wednesday, chatted with people. Others in the crowd began cheering. The charred convenience store, a victim of rioting earlier in the week, had been festooned with pastel chalk graffiti: “RIP Mike” and “Black men matter.” Dozens of children drew in chalk on the parking lot, danced and played hopscotch.

“I hope there's a fair investigation, that justice can be served and police brutality, not just against blacks, can be stopped,” Jones said.

Angela Smith, 39, of Ferguson stood beaming on the sidewalk, preaching to everybody who passed.

“Better than yesterday, y'all!” Smith said to a woman while holding a bright pink sign reading, “No justice, no peace.”

Another woman approached. “Feels like our 'hood, our home again!” Smith told her. “There's no invaders telling us we can't protest.”

“Mmm-hmm,” the woman responded. She was followed by two police officers, one whom was shaking hands with a young man in shorts and a Cardinals baseball cap.

“This is what we needed,” Smith said. “This is the first day we get to start healing. And I hope these young people appreciate that.”

About six girls passed on the sidewalk, cheering and laughing as car horns honked. “The babies are not crying today!” Smith said, watching the girls.

Outside of the ruined husk of QuikTrip, the torched convenience store, police officers and officials mingled with demonstrators, chatting and joking.

“What I'm seeing is hopefully a catalyst for change,” said St. Louis Det. Kevin Bentley, who said he normally worked undercover but was spending the night in uniform. “Nothing wrong with protest. This country was founded on protest.”

On a grassy patch near the parking lot, Stephen Wood, 51, surveyed the crowd chanting “hands up!” He felt satisfied, as if a burden was being lifted.

""This is needed. People need to learn to come together,” said Wood, a factory worker who lives in nearby Delaware, Mo.

He too had joined protesters Sunday and watched the peaceful gathering deteriorate into clashes with police in riot gear and the looting of business.

“It looked like Beirut out here. Most of us are common people — we go to work and do common things. To come out here and see something like Iraq is frightening,” he said.

The rioting, he figures, was a necessary evil.

“When people are oppressed and they want to be heard, they go to an extreme,” Wood said, his voice hoarse from chanting.

""What good is the Constitution; what good are these laws if we don’t use them?” he said.

Wood called Brown a martyr, and said Thursday night's gathering was a celebration of his potential. “We're cheering on a hero who didn’t get a chance to be who he was going to be.""

Earlier, Brown’s family attended a separate demonstration at the Arch in St. Louis, their first rally since he was killed.

Eric Davis, Brown’s cousin, who was with Brown’s mother and sister, told CNN that the family wanted to “come out to a very peaceful demonstration.” They had not attended previous demonstrations because they “didn’t want to get tear-gassed or shot with a rubber bullet.”

Davis said the family was still looking for answers. “We’re in the dark, and that’s a hard thing to do when you’ve lost a child,” he said.

Davis said the family spoke with U.S. Atty. Gen. {Eric H. Holder Jr.}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/eric-holder-PEPLT000001873-topic.html""> on Thursday. He assured them that the {Justice Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/u.s.-department-of-justice-ORGOV0000160-topic.html""> would have a hand in the investigation into Brown’s death.

“We have no trust in the Ferguson Police Department,” Davis said.

Justice Department officials talked with several witnesses to the shooting and are pushing ahead with a possible federal prosecution of the officer who shot Brown.

The Ferguson and St. Louis County police departments had been the lead law enforcement presence in the city since the shooting. Clashes between law enforcement officers and protesters intensified as the week wore on and images of crowds being tear-gassed evoked outrage nationwide.

President Obama on Thursday said there was “no excuse” for excessive force by police or for looting or violence aimed at law enforcement. Obama said the police had a responsibility to be “open and transparent” about the events that led up to the shooting of Brown.",28,NA,"Peaceful demonstrations unfold Thursday night in Ferguson, Mo.",NA
LATimes,lat30,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-ferguson-20140819-story.html,President Obama chooses his words carefully on Michael Brown ,Christi Parsons; Kathleen Hennessey,08/18/2014,04/13/2016,"As  they watched police in military gear spread tear gas in a St. Louis suburb in recent days, {White House}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/white-house-PLCUL000110-topic.html""> aides knew President {Obama}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/barack-obama-PEPLT007408-topic.html""> would be expected to weigh in on race.

But rather than bold words, Obama's reaction in this case has been shaped by an acute awareness of self-imposed limits.

White House officials argued that in a nation polarized on racial issues — and deeply split about the president — strong language from Obama about the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown and the protests and looting in Ferguson, Mo., would risk worsening the problem rather than making it better.

""His words can't heal things overnight — centuries of racial history and decades of economic unwinding take time to repair. But if his words are careless, they can inflame the situation, and he knows that,"" said one senior aide, speaking anonymously to discuss the president's thinking.

As a result, Obama has not offered another ""{Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/trayvon-martin-PEOCVC000188-topic.html""> moment"" of empathy with a young black man who some people believe was the victim of racial prejudice.
Instead, in a brief news conference at the White House on Monday, Obama offered carefully balanced statements about the need to ensure the rights of peaceful protest, but also to combat criminal behavior.

""We've got to make sure that we are able to distinguish between peaceful protesters who may have some legitimate grievances and maybe long-standing grievances, and those who are using this tragic death as an excuse to engage in criminal behavior,"" he said.

The closest Obama came to personal reflection was when he talked about sending in federal investigators and defended his decision not to go to Ferguson himself.
""I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed because ... the DOJ works for me,"" Obama said, referring to the Justice Department. ""When they're conducting an investigation, I've got to make sure that I don't look like I'm putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other.""

The White House reaction has been shaped less by the Martin case than by another racially charged incident from early in his presidency — the firing of Shirley Sherrod — that many Americans have probably forgotten.

Administration officials forced Sherrod, a black Agriculture Department official, to resign in 2010 after she was accused — falsely, as it turned out — of making anti-white comments. White House aides pushed to quickly remove her in a botched attempt to get ahead of a media controversy.

Sherrod's story has become a cautionary tale in the White House about the dangers of reacting too quickly to a racially charged situation.

White House officials say the president has, over time, become mindful of getting caught up in the swirl of a media storm — even those that carry personal resonance.

Some of his political allies endorse the reticence.

""He really has said as much as probably he should,"" said Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Rep. {Marcia L. Fudge}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/marcia-l.-fudge-PEPLT007832-topic.html""> (D-Ohio). ""I know there are a lot of people who want him to be much stronger, but the reality is, we really live in two Americas.""

Rather than using the president's personal story to address the unrest in Ferguson, aides worked back channels to communicate with the African American community. The president received regular briefings from Atty. Gen. {Eric H. Holder Jr.}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/eric-holder-PEPLT000001873-topic.html"">, and Obama announced Monday that he was sending Holder to Ferguson on Wednesday.

Obama has won strong marks from civil rights leaders for the Justice Department's investigation and the rare decision to conduct a separate autopsy. Those moves sent strong signals that the administration would not be leaving the case to local authorities, said {NAACP}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/social-issues/racism/naacp-ORNPR000027-topic.html"">  President Cornell William Brooks.

Given the unrest in Ferguson, Obama has had to be more cautious so as not to inflame tension, Brooks said.

""But his actions speak volumes,"" Brooks said. ""The prose of his conduct and decisions outweigh the poetry of any press release.""

Although Obama is reluctant to dive into racial controversies, in his second term he has shown a willingness to speak at length and in personal terms about his experience with prejudice. He has given more attention to programs targeting young black men, and he has spoken more bluntly about the gun violence and economic inequality that disproportionately affect black communities.

That was notably true in the Martin case, in which Obama called a small team to his office a few days after {George Zimmerman}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/george-zimmerman-PECLB0000014809-topic.html""> was acquitted of shooting Martin and said it was time for him to address the nation.

""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" he said, in what became the headline quote from his remarks.

Obama also crafted Monday's much less emotional comments mostly without the help of his speechwriting staff, officials said.

""I've said this before, in too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,"" Obama said. ""In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear.""

But before the Martin remarks, there were mistakes, White House aides acknowledge.

Five years after it happened, advisors this week were still thinking about the swift, harsh reaction that followed Obama's off-the-cuff remarks about the arrest of black scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. in 2009. Although Obama's remarks were wide-ranging, what lingered was his quote that police had ""acted stupidly.""

His attempt to make up for the stumble with the awkward and gimmicky White House ""beer summit"" with Vice President {Joe Biden}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/joe-biden-PEPLT007548-topic.html"">, Gates and the officer who made the arrest was not a high point in race — or public — relations.

""Go back to the beer summit. Go back to the comment that he made about Trayvon. How much grief did he take for that?"" Fudge said. ""At some point you say, 'I don't want to be the person who divides this nation. I want to bring us together. That is what the role of the president is.'""

Just as prominent in his mind as Martin, one advisor said, is the memory of Sherrod, who was pushed from her job over supposedly anti-white remarks she made to a black audience.

After listening to her full speech, however, administration officials decided Sherrod's words had been taken out of context and misrepresented by conservative critics. The administration apologized to her for the firing and offered her a new position. That experience warned them against getting disoriented by the media storm itself.

Obama has made it known that he wants to be ""open and clear about his feelings on the subject"" when he speaks publicly about Ferguson, but that he didn't want to prejudice the situation, senior advisor Valerie Jarrett said.

Like the rest of the president's staff, she said, she's trying to follow his lead in not giving in to a ""gut reaction"" to the events surrounding Brown's death in Ferguson.

Times reporters Matt Pearce and Molly Hennessey-Fiske saw that people were laughing, shaking each other's hands and, after a long week, feeling relieved.

Angela Smith, 39, of Ferguson, stood beaming on the sidewalk, preaching to everybody who passed.

“Better than yesterday, y'all!” Smith said to a passing woman while holding a bright pink sign reading, “NO JUSTICE NO PEACE.”

Another woman approached. “Feels like our 'hood, our home again!” Smith told her. “There's no invaders telling us we can't protest.”

LATimes,lat32,http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-hawthorne-ferguson-street-20140816-column.html,"Race, violence in Ferguson, Mo., cop killing play out on Main Street",NA,08/15/2014,04/13/2016,"As it runs along the eastern edge of the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., Florissant Avenue resembles hundreds and perhaps thousands of commercial strips around the country. Five lanes wide, it is lined with fast-food restaurants, banks, pawnshops and storage facilities.

This is precisely the territory that architect {Robert Venturi}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/arts-culture/architecture/robert-venturi-PEHST002031-topic.html""> was defending in 1966, when he asked near the end of his book ""Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture,"" ""Is not Main Street almost all right? Indeed, is not the commercial strip of a Route 66 almost all right?""

Not this week, that's for sure.

It wasn't media reports or urgent tweets from Canfield Drive, the nearby street where the unarmed teenager Michael Brown was shot by a police officer while walking to his grandmother's apartment, that finally gave the Ferguson story wide traction.

Instead it was pictures of the action on the strip, where local police, after a night of looting on Saturday, unleashed an oversized show of force, driving tanks and armored vehicles past the {McDonald's}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/business/consumer-goods-industries/food-industry/mcdonalds-ORCRP017293-topic.html""> and the check-cashing outlets, pointing automatic weapons at protestors and ultimately sending tear-gas canisters not just down the middle of Florissant but into nearby frontyards.
Those photographs, which began to circulate midweek on social media and then on television and newspaper websites, made it look as if an invading army were marching directly on American suburbia.

And as much as race is at the forefront of the story in Ferguson — where the population, nearly 70% African American, is protected by a police department that is 94% white — it wasn't race per se that made the country pay attention.

It was the sight of a militarized police force moving across this familiar commercial landscape. It was photograph after photograph showing Main Street looking anything but all right.
Of course, race is part of that story too. In the last decade the suburbs just northwest of St. Louis have seen their black populations grow significantly. If the makeup of the county police force has changed at all, it has done so far more slowly.

In a larger sense, economic and demographic shifts have continued to blur the distinction between city and suburb, and in fact threatened to make that distinction useless on a national scale in much the same way it's been useless in Los Angeles for many decades.

Much about the Ferguson case remains unknown or in dispute, including the question of precisely how and when the confrontation turned violent. Ferguson police officials announced Friday that Brown was a suspect in a robbery on Saturday morning. They also said the officer who shot Brown was unaware of that fact.

In ""Complexity and Contradiction,"" Venturi was eager to take on a certain rigid brand of American good taste while also fighting various internecine professional battles. The questions he posed about Main Street and the commercial strip, in fact, were directed largely at the architect and critic Peter Blake, who had written his own book on this section of the American landscape two years before.

In ""God's Own Junkyard,"" Blake complained that the aesthetic order and calm central to, say, Thomas Jefferson's design for the University of Virginia were almost impossible to find in postwar American architecture, especially its commercial variety.

Venturi found Blake's disdain amusing, ironic and revealing all at once. ""The pictures in [his] book that are supposed to be bad are often good,"" Venturi wrote. ""The seemingly chaotic juxtapositions of honky-tonk elements express an intriguing kind of vitality and validity.""

Over time the ""seemingly chaotic"" elements of the commercial strip have faded into a kind of numbingly homogenous landscape of chain restaurants and drive-through Starbucks.

Today we don't look at images of a street like Florissant Avenue and see anything jarring, the way Venturi and Blake did. Unless of course it's filled with riot police and plumes of tear gas.

So maybe it's time to ask some modified version of Venturi's questions, while realizing that the implications are far different — and the stakes arguably higher, at least in political terms — this time around.

If the protests and the police overreaction had happened only on Canfield Drive, away from the recognizable corporate signage on Florissant, would we still be talking about this story?

And what about the police response? Was there something about the architectural character of Florissant that led officers to defend it with such a dramatic and ultimately absurd show of force?

Does a largely white police force see protestors in the middle of a strip like that, only recently abandoned by white residents, and feel as though its own turf — or its own culture — is threatened?

Does America?

Venturi praised ""the commercial strip of a Route 66"" as a way of reassuring his readers that there was architectural and cultural opportunity — even progress — visible in the same postwar built landscape where Blake and others saw aesthetic and perhaps moral decline. Venturi also glimpsed in that roadside architecture a fundamentally democratic kind of energy.

There is always in the American character a countervailing desire to turn that chaos into order, to iron out the wrinkles, to squash the moments of visual, cultural or political unpredictability. Just look at the recent efforts to paint Frank Gehry's proposal for the Eisenhower Memorial as disrespectful or, in its mildly unkempt aesthetic, somehow un-American.

There is a law-and-order camp in architecture as well as in politics.

Ferguson, refreshingly, saw a very different kind of police presence on Thursday, when the Missouri Highway Patrol took over and gave protestors plenty of room to operate. That newly humane approach seemed to directly echo sentiments from August Heckscher, a writer and cultural advisor to the Kennedy White House whom Venturi quotes at length in ""Complexity and Contradiction.""

Heckscher, in his 1962 book ""The Public Happiness,"" wrote about the dangers of any effort to impose civic order by force alone, as the police tried to do in Ferguson.

""Rationalism proves inadequate in any period of upheaval,"" he wrote. ""Equilibrium must be created out of opposites. Such inner peace as men gain"" — and as cities gain, he might have added — ""must represent a tension among contradictions and uncertainties.""

Later, as New York City parks commissioner from 1967 to 1972 under Mayor John Lindsay, Heckscher was instrumental in issuing permits to allow huge antiwar rallies in Central Park.

The path from Venturi to the St. Louis suburbs, then, is shorter and straighter than you might guess, and the common ground between the two involves more than just imagery of the commercial strip.

It also involves our ever-shifting levels of tolerance for dissent in urban space, suburban space and privately owned public space. It involves {Occupy Wall Street}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/demonstration/occupy-wall-street-EVGAP00019-topic.html"">. And the Florida subdivision where George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin.

And a long blog post this week on Ferguson, ""A Brief History of Black Folks and Sidewalks,"" by writer Stacia L. Brown. Her essay focuses more on Canfield Drive than on Florissant Avenue; it has a good deal to say about how the historical tensions between police and African Americans have played out in public space.

The questions Venturi asked in 1966 were hopeful and intentionally naive, in keeping with the tone of the book, which he labeled a ""gentle manifesto.""

The questions we ask about Ferguson in the days and weeks ahead should be more pointed. They are prompted, after all, by police officers who acted as if the same commercial strip Venturi was moved to defend, in admiration for the messy vitality and freedom of American culture, was theirs to throttle and control.",21,NA,The sight of militarized police moving across the town's main street gave Michael Brown story traction,NA
LATimes,lat33,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-missouri-shooting-20140815-story.html,"State police take over security in Ferguson, Mo., with 'softer' stance",Matt Pearce; Joe Mozingo,08/14/2014,04/13/2016,"er several nights of tense street confrontations, state and federal authorities stepped in Thursday to curb the aggressive tactics of local police against demonstrators protesting the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager.

Missouri Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html""> dispatched the State Highway Patrol to take over security in Ferguson, promising ""a softer front"" to law enforcement after images of police wielding automatic weapons, flash grenades and tear gas drew stunned reactions from across the country.

""Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,"" Nixon said at a news conference.

Highway Patrol Capt. Ron {Johnson}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/henry-c.-johnson-jr.-PEPLT007867-topic.html"">, who is black and grew up in this predominantly black suburb of St. Louis, was tapped to lead the effort. ""It means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence,"" he said.

Later in the day, Johnson joined demonstrators near the scene of previous confrontations stemming from the fatal weekend shooting and exchanged hugs and handshakes with protesters as they passed. Officers stood by with casual demeanors, without visible body armor or rifles.
One man told Johnson that his niece had been hit with tear gas during the demonstrations. ""What would you say to her?"" the man asked.

""Tell her Capt. Johnson is sorry and he apologizes.""

President Obama weighed in from his vacation in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., saying that he had asked U.S. Atty. Gen. {Eric H. Holder Jr.}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/eric-holder-PEPLT000001873-topic.html""> to investigate the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who several witnesses said had his hands up when he was killed. The president was also critical of the arrest of two journalists covering the unrest.
""We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances,"" the president said. ""He was 18 years old, and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again.""

Obama issued a stern admonition to both police and looters.

""There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" he said.

""There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their 1st Amendment rights,"" he said. ""Police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.""

Holder said federal agents would help authorities ""conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.""

The racial dynamic of the city has long been a volatile mix: Two-thirds of residents are black, and police and city officials are predominantly white.

When demonstrations began after the shooting Saturday, the feeling that police viewed residents as enemy combatants inflamed anger on the streets, as did officials' refusal to release the name of the officer who shot Brown.

Large protests over the last several days have been mostly peaceful during daylight hours. But after vandals looted 12 businesses Sunday night, officers in military vehicles and riot gear swarmed into neighborhoods ordering demonstrators and residents to leave.

The officers fired stun grenades, tear gas canisters, bean bags and rubber bullets on those who refused. A small minority of the crowds lobbed bottles, rocks and Molotov cocktails.

Similar clashes repeated over the next three nights.

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) had urged the {Justice Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/u.s.-department-of-justice-ORGOV0000160-topic.html""> to take a stronger role in ending the crisis.

""We need to demilitarize the situation,"" she said. ""This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution.... My constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests.""

At a church in Florissant, a town neighboring Ferguson, residents expressed their outrage over Brown's killing. They said they also were concerned about the aggressive police presence in the area.

""A lot of people are scared to death to come outside,"" said Sierra Smith, 27, who lives near where Brown was shot.

She described how police had blocked the streets around her apartment complex at night.

A neighbor with a 3-week-old baby was blocked by police from going out for formula and diapers when she ran out, she said.

Tremaine Combs, 32, said he took his son on an errand to Walgreens when his son spotted a police officer driving by.

""He was so terrified that he started crying, and he's only 5 years old,"" Combs said.

Dozens of demonstrators took to the sidewalks and median in front of the burned-out husk of a QuikTrip gas station and convenience store on West Florissant Avenue, holding signs calling for justice for Brown.

""So far, no police is around; that's the way I like it,"" said Dion Dupree, 21, who lives nearby. ""I haven't been to work all this week. Leave us alone, and let us get our justice.""

Tishawn Stroud, 30, said the police's tactics had created an ugly cycle.

""When the public sees things like that, they feel like they're in a war zone,"" Stroud said. ""Then they begin acting like they're in a war zone.""

Clark McPhail, one of the top experts on controlling public gatherings and an emeritus professor at {University of Illinois}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/education/colleges-universities/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign-OREDU0000155-topic.html""> Urbana-Champaign, said police appeared to have made serious errors in handling the scene in Ferguson.

""They were geared up as though they were going into combat,"" he said. ""I am always stunned when I see police agencies behave that way in the 21st century.""

Plumes of tear gas have appeared nearly every night, enforcing the picture of suburban Ferguson as a battleground.

Riot control experts say the use of tear gas can not only quell unrest, but can incite it if not used properly.

In 1993, after a two-month standoff, federal agents fired tear gas into a compound occupied by the Branch Davidians near Waco, Texas, triggering years of investigation into the subsequent conflagration that took 76 lives.

Seattle police in 1999 fired so much tear gas into crowds of thousands who were protesting a World Trade Organization meeting that they ran short of canisters.

Paul Wertheimer, a crowd control expert who runs the consulting firm Crowd Management Strategies, said chemical irritants can be controversial but were sometimes needed. ""It's not the worst thing you can do to people.""

Johnson, of the Highway Patrol, did not say whether his officers would use tear gas. But other officials in the agency said tactical vehicles and SWAT teams would not be on the front lines.

As officers and federal agents planned for Thursday night's deployment, {FBI}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/fbi-ORGOV000008-topic.html""> and Justice Department investigators from St. Louis and Washington spoke with people who witnessed the Brown shooting, Holder said.

He said the Justice Department was pushing ahead with a federal investigation in the case, saying it would be ""thorough and fair,"" but cautioning that the review would ""take time to conduct.""

The {ACLU}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/social-issues/american-civil-liberties-union-ORCIG0000034-topic.html""> of Missouri filed a lawsuit seeking to obtain copies of initial police reports on the shooting after its open records request for the incident report was rejected by police Wednesday.

Meanwhile, a Democratic congressman said he was planning to introduce a bill to restrict a {Defense Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/defense/u.s.-department-of-defense-ORGOV000094164-topic.html""> program that provides machine guns and other surplus military equipment for free to law enforcement agencies.

Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) wrote to colleagues that city streets should be a place for businesses and families, ""not tanks and M-16s.""

A few thousand demonstrators had gathered for a candlelight vigil in the evening to honor the dead man, Michael Brown, 18, who was shot Saturday around noon by a Ferguson police officer. 

Mourners placed candles, flowers and a teddy bear where Brown was killed, the Associated Press reported, and some youths spray-painted ""R.I.P. Michael"" on the street.

But then the mood turned ugly. Television footage showed people vandalizing police cars, kicking in store windows and carrying out goods, including bottles of alcohol. At least one large fire was reported. 

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley confirmed widespread property damage but said no injuries had been reported. 

""Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess,"" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told Fox 2 KTVI-TV. ""Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.""
Late Sunday, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported that gunshots had been heard, and a SWAT team had been seen in the area. 

Earlier, police in riot gear watched but did not intervene.

On Sunday morning, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the unarmed Brown had been struggling for a Ferguson police officer’s gun in a patrol car before he was killed.

Witnesses have said the youth, who was black, had his hands in the air as he fled the patrol car.

Brown's mother said she didn't understand why police didn't subdue him with a club or Taser.

""I would like to see him fired,"" Lesley McSpadden told the Associated Press, referring to the officer who shot her son. ""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty.""
Belmar said there would be a thorough investigation, with possible inclusion of the FBI. Because Brown is African American, the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People has said it would seek a federal investigation.

In a statement on its {Facebook page}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/St-Louis-County-Police/122091914476260?hc_location=timeline""> Sunday afternoon, the St. Louis County Police Department, which is handling the shooting investigation, said, “The FBI will be contacted today and notified of the incident. If they choose, they may conduct a separate use-of-force investigation on this incident directly with the Ferguson Police Department.”

Adolphus Pruitt, the vice president of the {NAACP}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/social-issues/racism/naacp-ORNPR000027-topic.html""> Missouri State Conference and president of the St. Louis NAACP, told the Los Angeles Times that two  Justice Department representatives had arrived in St. Louis late Sunday.

The Rev. Al Sharpton of the National Action Network said in a statement Sunday that he had been speaking with Brown’s family and that Brown’s grandfather had asked him “to come to St. Louis in light of the police killing of his grandson to assist the family in achieving a fair investigation and justice.”

According to Belmar, Brown was walking with a friend in the middle of the street when an officer attempted to exit his vehicle. Police said Brown pushed the officer back into the police car.

Brown then entered the officer’s vehicle and a struggle ensued over the officer’s weapon, according to police. During the altercation a shot was fired inside the car.

The officer and Brown then exited the vehicle and at that point the fatal shooting occurred, Belmar said.

The officer who fired the shots has been placed on paid administrative leave and has not been identified. He has been on the force for six years.

Belmar said Brown was shot “more than just a couple of times,” but it was unclear how many shots were fired.

Witnesses' accounts have differed from that of the police.

Dorin Johnson, a friend of the victim, told Fox 2 that he was walking in the street with Brown when the police squad car pulled up. The officer said to ""Get the eff onto the sidewalk,"" he recounted.

""It was not but a minute from our destination and we would be off the street,"" Johnson said.

Johnson said the officer didn't get out of his police car, but reached  ""his arm out the window and grabbed my friend around the neck.""

Another witness, Piaget Crenshaw, said, ""I witnessed the police chase after the guy, full force. He ran for his life. They shot him and he fell. He put his arms up to let them know that he was compliant and he was unarmed, and they shot him twice more and he fell to the ground and died.""

Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, told the {Associated Press}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/missouri-crowd-shooting-kill-police-24915554""> that she was driving through the neighborhood Saturday afternoon when she saw her grandson running a few blocks from her house.

Brown was supposed to start college classes Monday.

""He was running this way,"" she said. ""When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.""

Louis Head, Brown’s stepfather, held a sign that said, “Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!”

McSpadden said the shooting was “wrong and it was cold-hearted.”

Belmar said Sunday that the entire incident scene extends roughly 35 feet from where the police car was parked to where the fatal shooting took place, and where shell casings matching the officer’s weapon have been found. He said toxicology reports could take six weeks.

While the police held the news conference Sunday at the Ferguson police station, hundreds of protesters gathered in front, holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot me.""

The protesters chanted, ""We want answers"" and ""No justice, no peace,” some carrying signs saying ""stop police terrorism"" and ""disarm the police,"" according to the Associated Press.

“We are sorry that a young man lost his life and ask all to give their condolences to the family along with their thoughts and prayers,” the St. Louis County Police Department said in its Facebook statement.

“We are investigating this incident as we would any other shooting,” the statement said. “There is no bias or favoritism applied as we are an outside agency and were not involved.”

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson described the shooting as tragic in an interview with Fox 2. ""It’s tragic for the community. It’s tragic for our police family.”

""We want this to come to a conclusion quickly,” Jackson said.",273,NA,18-year-old shot 'more than just a couple of times' by Missouri police officer,NA

He added that he had asked the {Justice Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/u.s.-department-of-justice-ORGOV0000160-topic.html""> and {FBI}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/fbi-ORGOV000008-topic.html""> to conduct an independent investigation of what happened.

Obama criticized police for their tactics and the arrests of two reporters Wednesday night.

“Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground,” Obama said.
His remarks came as his administration was under growing pressure to ramp up the federal response to the racial tensions in Ferguson. Obama issued a statement earlier in the week, but calls for a personal reaction — and deeper {White House}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/white-house-PLCUL000110-topic.html""> engagement — had grown along with the unrest in the St. Louis suburb.

Protests have escalated into violent clashes with police since a Ferguson police officer shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown on Saturday afternoon. The situation spiraled significantly Wednesday as police fired rubber bullets and released tear gas into the crowds. Journalists from the Washington Post and Huffington Post were arrested.
As the clashes have grown more intense, political leaders in both parties have criticized the heavily armed, confrontational tactics used by the Ferguson police.

Missouri's Democratic Sen. {Claire McCaskill}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/claire-mccaskill-PEPLT007895-topic.html""> issued a statement shortly before Obama spoke calling for ""demilitarizing"" the situation in Ferguson. The ""response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution,"" McCaskill said in a statement.

And Sen. {Rand Paul}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/rand-paul-PEPLT007915-topic.html""> (R-Ky.), in an {op-ed article}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter""> for Time magazine, denounced the ""militarization of our law enforcement."" Police departments across the country have become too heavily armed as part of an ""unprecedented expansion of government power,"" Paul said. 

Moreover, he said, ""given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.""

Witnesses have said Brown was running with his hands in the air when the police officer fired. The St. Louis County Police Department has released few details about the incident and have refused to release the name of the officer involved.

The Justice Department has said it is assisting local authorities with the investigation. Atty. Gen. {Eric H. Holder}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/eric-holder-PEPLT000001873-topic.html""> Jr. briefed Obama on the situation Wednesday night, the {White House}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/white-house-PLCUL000110-topic.html""> said.
Obama has weighed in on issues of race and justice repeatedly throughout his second term, and has shown a particular willingness to speak out on the lives of young African American men. In the wake of {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/trayvon-martin-PEOCVC000188-topic.html"">’s  case, in which a neighborhood watch volunteer was acquitted in the killing of an unarmed Florida teen, Obama showed the events touched him personally, saying, “This could have been my son.”

“Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,” Obama said in July 2013.

With far fewer details known about what led to Brown’s shooting, Obama’s statement Thursday was more cautious and less personal. He described the incident as “heartbreaking and tragic” and sympathized with Brown’s parents.

“His family will never hold Michael in their arms again,” he said.

Obama however focused more closely on the responsibly and role of authorities in calming the outcry. He expressed confidence in Missouri Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html"">, who has been criticized for failing to be present in Ferguson. The president spoke to Nixon by phone Thursday morning and said he was confident the governor was “going to be able to communicate his desire to make sure that justice is done.”

Obama made his statement from the cafeteria of the elementary school in this well-heeled resort town. During his annual summer vacation here, he typically delivers statements to the press from outside whichever secluded, luxury home his family is renting. But this time he traveled into town to speak about Ferguson, as well as the success of the humanitarian mission to aid Yazidi refugees in Iraq. Immediately after the brief statement, he continued his vacation and headed to the golf course.",187,NA,"No excuse for 'excessive force' by police in #Ferguson, Obama says",NA

Both became unwitting symbols of injustice and, in the process, performed a painful but valuable public service.

King owed his stature to a grainy videotape of his beating by police, shot from a nearby balcony by a stranger and broadcast around the world — proof for all, except a Simi Valley jury, that Los Angeles cops were dangerously out of control. We have a better, smarter, more professional Police Department in L.A. today because of the repercussions from that night.

There is no video witness to Brown's shooting death by a Missouri police officer Aug. 9. But millions of tweets, photos and shared online posts have chronicled what's happened since then, as residents gathered to protest the shooting and {officers met them with armored tanks}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-police-demilitarize-20140816-story.html%23page=1"">, assault rifles and police dogs, and fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd.

That overcharged response stoked anger that helped turn protests into riots.

Those images have given the tragedy a {global reach}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-ferguson-michael-brown-shooting-world-reaction-20140818-story.html%23page=1""> and made suburban Ferguson the symbol of an oppressive strain of urban policing that rules through arrogance and arbitrary force.
It's a department that sports combat gear and tricked out tanks, but can't afford the $50,000 or so it would cost to equip its 18 patrol cars with dashboard cameras that could record every police encounter.

But I don't need to know exactly what happened in the moments before Brown died to understand why the locals might not trust their police force.

For nearly a week after Brown's death, police officials refused to release the name of the officer who shot him. That stoked frustration among residents already primed for a whitewash.

Anger deepened when the department released a private surveillance video from the afternoon Brown died, showing him stealing a handful of cheap cigars from a convenience store and shoving the clerk who tried to stop him.

That makes Brown look like a bully. But it doesn't make him someone who deserves to be shot by a cop if he was just walking on the street instead of the sidewalk.

::

It's been disheartening to see peaceful marches to protest Brown's death devolve into late-night incidents of violence and looting.

We saw that here in last summer's {protests after the verdict}<hyperlink=""http://articles.latimes.com/print/2013/jul/19/local/la-me-banks-trayvon-protest-20130720""> in the {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/trayvon-martin-PEOCVC000188-topic.html""> case, when a few dozen young people peeled off from the praying-and-singing crowd and wreaked havoc along Crenshaw Boulevard.

""This is not your grandmother's civil rights movement … walking slowly, carrying signs,"" local activist Marqueece Harris-Dawson told me then. The teenagers wanted action; they had their own agendas. And the older generation ""didn't know how to organize or control it.""

In Ferguson, that same split took hold. During the day, families showed up, community groups kept tabs on the crowd and people flowed in from nearby cities to join the hundreds walking with hands raised in surrender and chanting ""Don't Shoot.""

After dark, many of those folks left, wary of being trapped between heavily armed police and angry young men nursing years of grievances and carrying guns of their own.

St. Louis Alderman Antonio French put it best, explaining the dramatic descent from order to chaos: ""The man/boy ratio was off.""

In other words, there weren't enough men willing to take the risk and try to reason with hotheads who don't respect their elders or the police and don't see the value in playing by the rules. The community has to do a better job, he said, of growing grass-roots leaders.

::

It's naive to think of a protest like this as some kind of organized campaign, with roles mapped out in advance. There are too many emotions and agendas, too many things that can go wrong.

It's peaceful for hours, then it's not. A window is shattered, a gun is fired, a fight jumps off — and suddenly it's a riot. And all those well-meaning folks walking around with their hands in the air are being doused with tear gas and pummeled with rubber bullets.

The National Guard has been called out, but that won't solve the problem. People in Ferguson are angry and that anger isn't likely to ease as this drags on. Law enforcement officials need a strategy that offers the promise of justice and doesn't limit the rights of law-abiding protesters because some fools act up.

I'm old enough to remember our Rodney King moment, when the police officers charged with his beating were acquitted and parts of the city were gripped by anger that turned into mayhem. The violence was wrong, but I understood the pain some of those rioters felt.

That's why I'm not judging Ferguson by a handful of hoodlums, but by the residents who risked their safety and stood between looters and the stores they tried to ransack, and the volunteers who showed up every morning to comfort business owners and sweep up broken glass.",92,NA,"'The man/boy ratio was off,' St. Louis Alderman Antonio French says of the Ferguson situation",NA
LATimes,lat39,http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-former-seattle-police-chief-reacts-to-ferguson-20140815-story.html,Seattle police chief during WTO unrest appalled by Ferguson violence,Maria L. LaGanga,08/16/2014,04/14/2016,"Th first thing Norm Stamper thought when he saw images of the protests in Ferguson, Mo., following the police shooting of an unarmed black man was straight out of a folk song — “When will we ever learn?”

“My reaction was, ‘Please learn from my mistakes, from what I did and did not do during the week of WTO,’ ” said the former Seattle police chief, who presided over a law enforcement response to widespread demonstrations in 1999 that was vilified around the globe for its heavy handedness.

“Don’t tear gas nonviolent and not-threatening protesters,” Stamper continued. “And for God’s sake, don’t bring dogs out … It’s a throwback to the ‘60s and Bull Connor. The imagery sucks. It was really painful to see the images I saw from Ferguson.”

Stamper knows whereof he speaks. Fifteen years ago, when the World Trade Organization met in this leafy, progressive outpost, tens of thousands of anti-globalization protesters and labor union activists shut down the heart of Seattle’s city center.

The police response was swift, dramatic and iron-fisted. Officers wielded tear gas, batons, stun grenades and pepper spray. There were more than 600 arrests. The mayor called for curfew and a 50-block no-protest zone. Law enforcement agents in riot gear marched through the city streets.
“The biggest mistake in my 34 years of law enforcement was that we used a military response to a domestic situation, a military tactic that was absolutely unnecessary,” Stamper told the Los Angeles Times. “Why did we do it? It was the cop in me that supported my staff and believed that, if we needed to get emergency assistance to someone in medical distress, we wouldn’t have been able to do it.

“The cop in me should have been overruled by the chief in me,” Stamper said. “I blew it. The effect was to heighten tensions, not de-escalate tension .… A whole lot of others would not have acted as they did if we didn’t act as we did.”
The parallels to Ferguson are painfully obvious. Days of demonstrations followed the Saturday night shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man who had allegedly robbed a convenience store, by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson.

Largely white law enforcement agencies in this largely black suburb of St. Louis — a small town of 21,000 where racial tensions run high — pulled out the military gear, tear gas and camouflage, armored vehicles and police dogs, rubber bullets and sharpshooters.

It wasn’t until Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html""> dispatched the State Highway Patrol on Thursday to take over security in Ferguson that the incendiary situation began to calm down. Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black and grew up in Ferguson, was tapped to lead the effort.

“My new hero is Ron Johnson,” Stamper said. “What he has done is textbook conflict management, conflict resolution. It’s textbook interpersonal competence. The fact that he comes from the community, that he is African American, has achieved a high rank in the state patrol, he’s got instant street credibility.”

On Friday, Stamper decried what he calls the increased militarization of local police forces, which he called “a problem of massive proportions.”

Since the advent of the war on drugs, and particularly since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he said, “police officers are looking more, sounding more, acting more like soldiers than domestic peacekeepers…That translates into an occupational force. In a democratic society, a pluralistic and free society, police officers need to be a part of the community, not apart from it.”

Stamper said there was a place in modern policing for the kind of military equipment that many police forces have gotten in recent years from the federal government. But small towns with tiny police forces should not have arsenals that rival big cities'.

Instead, he called for regional SWAT teams that are staffed with carefully picked and thoroughly trained officers.
He remembers being deputy chief of the San Diego Police Department in 1984 when James Oliver Huberty opened fire in a San Ysidro McDonald’s, killing 21 people and wounding 19 others.

“He’s firing shots everywhere and attempting to keep the police at bay,” Stamper recalled. “We positioned a SWAT sharpshooter a distance away. We give him a green light, and he kills Huberty.

“What if before we did that, we had an armored personnel carrier at our disposal? We could have driven it into the fast food eatery and perhaps reduced the carnage.”",19,NA,"Seeing images of police with riot gear and dogs, former Chief Norm Stamper thought, 'When will we ever learn?",NA
LATimes,lat40,http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-tear-gas-ferguson-08132014-story.html,"Ferguson, Mo., police are using a blunt instrument – tear gas",Ralph Vartabedian,08/14/2014,04/14/2016,"The images have left a searing impression: Heavily armed police lobbing smoking tear gas canisters into the crowd of protesters.

The backlit plumes of smoke have appeared nearly every night, enforcing the picture of suburban Ferguson, Mo., as a battleground between black protesters and largely white police.

The use of the crowd control gas has inflamed the tension and exacerbated a sense among residents that police have taken an overly aggressive stance against protesters.

Riot control experts say that the use of tear gas can not only quell unrest, but also incite it if it is not used properly.

After a two month standoff in 1993, federal agents fired tear gas into a compound occupied by the Branch Dividians near Waco, Texas, triggering years of investigation of the resulting tragedy that took 76 lives.
Seattle police in 1999 fired so much tear gas into crowds of thousands who were protesting a World Trade Organization meeting on economic globalization that they ran short of canisters.

In 2003 in Chicago, 21 people died at a stampede in a nightclub after security guards used pepper spray on the dance floor.

Law enforcement agencies have continued to refine their policies and tactics in using tear gas or pepper spray, but have not retreated from their use, law enforcement officials and crowd control experts say.

The policies and tactics for tear gas use vary widely between departments, including dictating the kinds of situations that merit gassing groups of people and the level of  leadership that can authorize its use.

""Police are not allowed to use tear gas on crowds;  they can use it on mobs,"" said Sid Heal, a former deputy sheriff in Los Angeles who is considered a top expert on nonlethal weapons.

Heal said there are two certainties when using pepper spray or tear gas: The police are certain to be videotaped and there will be a lawsuit afterward.

""The use of different launching platforms requires a lot of training and careful analysis,"" said Edward Obayashi, a deputy sheriff and a use-of-force legal advisor to multiple law enforcement agencies in California. 

Obayashi said such tactics can be complicated when unruly crowds require responses by multiple law enforcement agencies that can have different policies.

The use of all weapons in California are governed by the decisions of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, while other parts of the country may have different rules from their own federal circuit courts, he said.

Tear gas was first used more than a century ago, and ever since law enforcement agencies have been refining their policies for employing it.

In general, the police are reluctant to use tear gas, because it is such a blunt instrument, threatening innocent bystanders as well as perpetrators.

If a wind is blowing strongly or in the wrong direction, the use of tear gas can backfire.

It is particularly risky in dense urban areas, where highrise buildings can have their ventilation system intakes near street level. An entire building can be accidentally contaminated.

Use inside a building is especially problematic, since the gas can become embedded in fabrics, drapes and carpeting, causing recontamination weeks later, Heal noted.

With so much at stake, law enforcement agencies require varying degrees of senior officer approval for its use.

The Los Angeles Police Department, for example, requires approval of a senior officer in the command structure, Heal said. By contrast, the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department allows sergeants to issue an order to fire tear gas, he said.

The massive rioting that hit Seattle in 1999 took police by surprise and they resorted to extensive use of nonlethal weapons, particularly tear gas. An after-action report on the police response found no fault in the tactics.

""When presented with the need to reopen the downtown area and protect the rights of all people, SPD had two basic choices when those obstructing the area refused to obey a lawful police order to disperse: They could use batons, with the potential physical injury that they cause, or they could employ chemical irritants and other less lethal munitions,"" the report said.

""The use of chemical irritants and other less lethal munitions allowed SPD to open the area, allowing Conference delegates to move among venues while avoiding serious injuries or fatalities. SPD did well to choose the latter course of action,"" the report said.

Paul Wertheimer, a crowd control expert who runs Crowd Management Strategies, said the Occupy Movement in 2011 highlighted the wide variation in law enforcement responses.

While police in New York and Oakland fired tear gas at protesters, Los Angeles did not.

""I thought Los Angeles was a good example of crowd control without excessive force,"" Wertheimer said.

Increasingly, protestors come prepared for the gas, carrying water, cloth, filters and even gas masks.

When police fire it into a crowd, it can exacerbate the very conditions that caused police to use it in the first place, stirring anger among people who might be bystanders and not instigators.

On the other hand, Wertheimer said, tear gas can also be a good choice. ""It's not the worst thing you can do to people,"" he said. ",2,NA,The police are certain to be videotaped and there will be a lawsuit afterward,NA

Barabak,08/14/2014,04/14/2016,"Win or lose—and there’s no question he’s running—Rand Paul has firmly established himself as the most intriguing Republican eyeing the White House in 2016.

Thursday brought fresh evidence as the Kentucky senator leaped headlong into the racial cauldron that is Ferguson, Mo., with a bluntly stated {Time magazine essay}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/%20%20""> on the police shooting of Michael Brown. Weighing in was hardly a surprise; there are flies circling honey pots with more restraint than a politician given a chance to hold forth on the issue of the day.
Rather, what was striking was the angry tone and underlying sympathies of Paul’s essay, a condemnation of the “rising militarization of law enforcement” in the country and assertion that equal justice under law is more a pleasing bromide than reality on the streets of 2014 America.

“Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention,” Paul wrote. “Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.”

Paul’s rhetoric is not just a break with others in the embryonic Republican presidential field; it challenges GOP political orthodoxy going back several decades, ever since Richard Nixon made law and order a cudgel to batter Democrats in the riot-torn 1968 campaign. The strategy may have reached its apogee—or nadir—20 years later, when the elder George Bush won the White House in part due to fears summoned by the lurid visage of black convict Willie Horton, used as a symbol of Michael Dukakis’ woolly headed liberalism.

All of which makes Paul, in a phrase that grew fashionable when Bill Clinton challenged the verities of his Democratic Party, a very different kind of Republican—one seemingly eager to shatter preconceived notions of him and his party.

Taking the side of protesters against alleged police brutality--however implicitly--is a startling way to position one’s self in a Republican primary. But it is wholly consistent with what has been an unorthodox Paul strategy from the start.

He has made it plain that his appeal is not to the barnacled Old Guard of the party but a younger, presumably hipper and more broad-minded constituency.  
“We need to be like the rest of America,” Paul memorably counseled fellow Republicans at a New Hampshire campaign appearance last year. “We're going to win when we look like America. We need to be white, we need to be brown, we need to be black, we need to be with tattoos, without tattoos, with ponytails, without ponytails, with beards, without.""

The issues that Paul has pursued, foremost among them personal protections against a vast, overweening federal government, are resonant with the libertarian devotees of his father, former Republican Rep. Ron Paul, a thrice-failed candidate for president.

But he also has sought to broaden his appeal, and that of the Republican Party, among skeptical black voters by taking on issues like prison-sentencing reform, noting the disproportionate impact the so-called war on drugs has had on young African American men.

What is more, Paul has ventured -- with decidedly mixed results -- before black audiences and other places where Republicans are scarcely seen. (Though some of the drama can be overstated; for all the talk of Paul’s brave {appearance earlier this year at UC Berkeley}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-rand-paul-berkeley-20140320-story.html#axzz2wVi4WP58"">, the fact is there are plenty of libertarians and even conservatives to be found in the San Francisco Bay Area, and many of those who attended were already supporters of the Kentucky lawmaker.)

Paul’s illuminating Time essay was an exercise in political finesse, wrapping his condemnation of police tactics around an argument against government overreach.

“There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement,” he wrote. “Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.”

That is not an easy argument to make—appealing to both the sensitivities of black voters and the unhappiness of big-government foes—and Paul has hardly proven the most supple of politicians. He did not help himself being caught earlier this month on camera {fleeing a conversation in Iowa with immigration reform advocates}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-dreamer-rand-paul-steve-king-20140805-story.html"">.

Both incidents unfolded on an August day, with a crowd of bystanders nearby. And both involved a police patrol car stopped in a predominantly African American community. In 1965, Frye and his mother were arrested (and roughed up by officers) and an impromptu protest began. Soon South Los Angeles and Watts were being consumed by days of looting and arson in what came to be known as the Watts Riots.

The parallels between the recent events in Ferguson and previous incidents and social movements in American history are many. Throughout the 20th century, interactions between police and African Americans and other groups have led to public protest and violence. This article lists just a small sampling of the vast literature on the subject.

“Riot and Remembrance: America's Worst Race Riot and Its Legacy,” by James Hirsch is one of several recent books detailing the long-forgotten history of the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, in which armed white residents torched black neighborhoods in the Oklahoma metropolis. The event began with the arrest of a black man following an encounter with a white woman in a downtown Tulsa elevator; to forestall his lynching by a white mob, a group of armed black men (including many {World War I}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/wars-interventions/world-war-i-%281914-1918%29-EVHST00000109-topic.html""> veterans) arrived at the courthouse where he was being held. The sight of armed African Americans (in a state with Jim Crow laws) led to what amounted to a white pogrom against Tulsa’s black community.

The Tulsa tragedy is also recounted in Tim Madigan’s “The Burning: Massacre, Destruction, and the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.” Online, readers can peruse {the report}<hyperlink=""http://www.okhistory.org/research/forms/freport.pdf""> issued by an Oklahoma state commission in 2001. 
Two decades after Tulsa, race {riots}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/riots/los-angeles-riots-%281992%29-EVCAL00021-topic.html""> swept through Los Angeles -- the so-called Zoot Suit riots of 1943 in which groups of mostly white servicemen beat up Latino youths. The California writer Carey McWilliams witnessed the violence, which also targeted black youths, and wrote about it in his ground-breaking 1949 work, “North from Mexico.” In a much more recent book, the historian Edward J. Escobar sees the Zoot Suit riots in the context of the many violent encounters with whites and police that helped forge the Mexican American community in Southern California in the first half of the 20th century. {His book}<hyperlink=""http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520213357""> “Race, Police, and the Making of a Political Identity: Mexican Americans and the {Los Angeles Police Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/law-enforcement/los-angeles-police-department-ORGOV000939-topic.html"">, 1900-1945,” is published by the University of California Press.
“Fire This Time: The Watts Uprising and the 1960s” by Gerald Horne is a detailed account of the events leading to the looting and arson that swept through South Los Angeles in 1965. In fiction, Walter Mosley’s 2004 novel “Little Scarlett,” is set in the community during the Watts riots. In an {interview with NPR}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3410079"">, Mosley recalled living in Los Angeles in the 1960s. African Americans were so angry at being marginalized (and of being the targets of police abuse) that even Mosely’s conservative, law-abiding father said he wanted to take a rifle and a Molotov cocktail and join the rioters (though he did not). “I wanna go out there and fight,” his father told him.

Almost four decades after Watts, Los Angeles erupted again, after the videotaped beating of {Rodney King}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/rodney-king-PEOCVC000206-topic.html""> by LAPD officers in a San Fernando Valley traffic stop. The rioting began just hours after the officers were acquitted in a televised trial. But even before the verdicts came in, an official report into the LAPD led by Warren Christopher {found widespread abuse}<hyperlink=""http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-10/news/mn-1962_1_lapd-officers-excessive-force-officers-laurence-m-powell""> in the department. Most troubling was the release of internal police text messages (sent from terminals in police cars) in which officers bragged of beatings suspects. ""Capture him, beat him and treat him like dirt…,"" one officer wrote.

The frustrations of African Americans in 1990s Los Angeles were also stoked by a second incident: the shooting of an unarmed 15-year-old girl in a South Los Angeles liquor store. The case is detailed {in a 2013 book}<hyperlink=""http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/04/entertainment/la-ca-jc-brenda-stevenson-20130804"">,  by the UCLA historian Brenda Stevenson, “The Contested Murder of Latasha Harlins: Justice, Gender and the Origins of the L.A. Riots.”

Of the riot itself, and the enormous psychic toll it took on Los Angeles, there are few books more moving than “Twilight: Los Angeles 1992,” which is based on Anna Deavere Smith’s one-woman play of the same name. (I was a dramaturge on the original, 1993 production at the Mark Taper Forum.) For me the highlight of Smith’s opus was then, as now, the soliloquy spoken by former gang member Twilight Bey. Riffing on the origins of his nickname and his sense of identity as a young black man, Bey says: “Twilight is that time of day between day and night…I call it limbo…So sometimes I feel as though I’m stuck in limbo, the way the sun is stuck between night and day in the twilight hours.”",4,NA,"Before Ferguson, there was Tulsa and Latasha Harlins: A reading list",NA
LATimes,lat44,http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-police-experts-20140815-story.html,"Robbery matters little in shooting death of Michael Brown, experts say",James Queally,08/15/2014,04/14/2016,"The fact that Michael Brown was a suspect in a strong-arm robbery that happened moments before he died should do little to quiet critics who have wondered why a Ferguson, Mo., police officer shot and killed the unarmed 18-year-old last week, law enforcement experts said.

On Friday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released surveillance footage and {a police report that revealed}<hyperlink=""http://documents.latimes.com/police-report-michael-brown-case/""> Brown was suspected of stealing a box of cigars from a local convenience store shortly before he was gunned down Saturday.

But in a second news conference, Jackson said Officer Darren Wilson did not know Brown was a suspect in the robbery before approaching him. Brown was stopped for impeding traffic, police have said.

“If the robbery in any way caused the initial contact it has relevance … if it didn’t, it has none,” said Wayne Fisher, a professor with the Rutgers University Police Institute in New Jersey. “The use of deadly force in this situation will be authorized if the office reasonably believed his life was in danger, that question does not appear to be directly related to whether or not Brown was a suspect in a robbery.”

While Jackson said he released the information regarding the robbery due to public records requests filed by reporters, other experts suggested the information could be used to sully Brown’s name and in some way justify the fatal shooting.
“The officers did not know that he was a suspect. But he was a suspect, so the only thing I can think of is they are trying to come up with some more evidence that has not been released yet of his dangerousness,” said James Lasley, a professor of criminology at Cal State Fullerton and former advisor to the {Los Angeles Police Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/law-enforcement/los-angeles-police-department-ORGOV000939-topic.html"">. “Maybe they’re trying to separate the two events, because obviously a strong-arm robbery is not going to justify the use of deadly force.”
Eugene O'Donnell, a former district attorney in New York City, said police may have released the robbery details to suggest Brown was acting erratically on the day of the shooting. While the police officer may have stopped Brown for the minor traffic violation, Brown may have been thinking the officer knew about the robbery.

""Obviously the cop's reaction is not affected, but what could be affected is [Brown's] reaction to the cop,"" said O'Donnell, who now serves as a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

Fisher and Lasley questioned the Ferguson Police Department’s resistance to releasing information, saying the delays likely led to the growing skepticism and anger in the St. Louis County community where clashes between police and citizens amid clouds of tear gas have been the norm for the past week.

“I think the longer they wait, the more they are calling into question the legitimacy of the shooting,” Lasley said. “Usually, in a shooting that is fully justified, [the police] are usually the first to go to the media and show that it was. The fact that they hesitated adds to the whole mystery of the situation. That’s very odd.”

Fisher said law enforcement in the area must do a better job of updating the public as to the status of the case if they hope to repair the already strained, if not destroyed, relationships between police officers and residents in Ferguson.

“There needs to be clear communication as to what happened and that communication needs to take place as soon as the information has been accurately compiled,” Fisher said. “If police officers are going to be authorized to use deadly force, then going forward, there needs to be public disclosure about the use of that authority.”

O'Donnell also said Jackson might want to recuse himself from future press conferences, as he is the face of the agency the community is railing against.

In short, O'Donnell said, residents and protesters are unlikely to believe anything Jackson says. 

“You’re in a delicate time when you’re releasing sensitive information and it needs to be done as objectively and comprehensively as possible,"" he said. ""It’s perfectly understandable in human nature that the chief is going to try and portray his agency in as favorable a light as he can.""

The women had come to protest but were unprepared for the sporadic clashes that unfolded after dark between police and demonstrators.  

Alexis Tucker had talked her two high school classmates into coming: Alexis Mays, a cautious biology major with a stylish handbag, and Elvony Pleasant, a psychology major with a quick wit.

Tucker, 19, a sophomore communications major at {Howard University}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/education/colleges-universities/howard-university-OREDU0000172-topic.html"">, had been protesting all week, despite her parents’ concern about her safety. Like her friends, she arrived on West Florissant Avenue dressed for a night out, her hair tied in a leopard-print scarf, wearing strappy sandals and carrying a matching purse.

They had parked in an area surrounded by a high metal fence behind a credit union, a spot that police had designated for protesters. They thought it was safe. But once the protest swelled after 10 p.m., police began massing, blocking the credit union entrance with their human chain:  dozens of officers clad in gas masks and riot gear.
The trio took shelter in the parking lot of a neighboring Family Dollar store and watched the standoff unfold, humming spirituals like ""Wade in the Water"" they had sung while marching earlier in the day, songs their grandparents had sung during civil rights protests.

They had reveled in the gathering that afternoon, chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot,” walking the street with a crowd that included plenty of other women and youths.

“Justice is necessary to fight for,” Tucker said. 

But they grew worried.
“It was peaceful protests, but now it’s past that,” said Pleasant, 18, a sophomore at the {University of Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/education/colleges-universities/university-of-missouri--OREDU0000584-topic.html""> Columbia, as she watched police with long guns zoom by in a military-style truck.

“Do you see how many people they just added to that line?” said her college classmate Mays, 19.

Someone threw a glass bottle. It shattered on the pavement in the breach, and police rushed forward. 

The young women cringed, drawing back toward the brick storefront. The lot was fenced. They had nowhere to run.

“Do not throw an object!” police instructed over a bullhorn, moving in a caterpillar line toward the offender.

“They are actually moving like soldiers, like that movie ‘300,’” Pleasant said in awe.

She quickly grew frustrated.

“We’re not trying to fight them,” she said of police. “We don’t have any of the gear they have on.”

As they watched, police arrested a woman.

""Why did she just get arrested?"" Mays wondered aloud.

Tucker scrutinized the blue line of police.

""It's a scary situation for both sides,"" she said.

The standoff cooled, then heated up momentarily when two boys rode their bike up to the police line. Officers barked, shifting forward as a mass.

“Kids!” Tucker yelled.

The boys retreated, and so did the police. The trio of students were disgusted. They had fond memories of seeing police officers visit their schools for anti-drug campaigns and other public service programs.

“How are the kids coming up now going to be looking at them? Like ‘I don’t trust you!,’” Tucker said.

They wished that the officers would take off their gas masks, drop their riot shields and nightsticks and talk to the people.

“It’s all about power,” Mays said, “I feel like they’re holding us hostage. I don’t know how they want us to leave.”

Two police helicopters circled, lights illuminating the line of uniformed officers and the protesters. About 11 p.m., a military vehicle zoomed into the dwindling crowd. An officer on top pointed a long gun.

“Why did he drive over there with a rifle pointed?” Mays asked.

“To provoke us,” Pleasant said.

Tucker pointed.

“They’ve got their sticks drawn,” she said.

Mays started to panic as she watched officers pulling on gas masks again.

“What are they doing? What are they getting those on for?” the biology major said.

Confusion erupted. Loud booms sounded down the street.

“They’re shooting!” Tucker shouted.

Police at the other end of the street had fired tear gas canisters. There had been a shooting, with two people injured.

The women sprinted to the darkest corner of the parking lot, briefly retreating. Then they moved back up to the street to see what had happened.

They watched as protesters refused to leave.

“Back up now!” an officer shouted over a bullhorn.

“This is our home!” a female protester shouted back.

Tear gas drifted closer. Tucker unwound her hair wrap. The women draped it over their faces. Mays donned sunglasses. They clutched tissues to their mouths. But their noses still burned, and started running.

“It smells like fireworks,” Pleasant said.

About 11:30 p.m. they wanted to leave, but would have had to cross through the police line. They decided to ask a black police officer for an escort, figuring he would be sympathetic. They approached him slowly, arms raised.

But he was short with them, saying they needed to ask officials down the street — where the tear gas was deployed.

“Will we get arrested or be able to get our car?” Pleasant asked.

He couldn’t say.

They walked to the edge of the street.

“People just want to go home,” Pleasant said.  “I just want to go home.”

Tucker was hungry. Mays had to go to work the next day, and it was her car that was stuck.

It was 11:42 p.m. Police took to the bullhorn again. Everyone in the area aside from journalists had to leave.

“You will be subject to arrest!” the officer warned protesters who had not left the area. “Do it now!”  the officer shouted.

The girls decided to cross the street and ask for help again.

A police officer yelled at them as they ran through the chaotic crowd.

“Let’s go!”

Tucker, exhausted and scared, struggled to remain composed.

“We are human beings,” she said.

A white police officer approached and asked what they needed. After the trio explained, he said he would try to help. He lead them back to the road, then escorted them to their car.

They drove directly to Steak ‘n Shake, where they pondered the menu and the night’s events.

They would have a story to tell their grandchildren, just as their grandparents had told them about civil rights protests of the 1960s. But what would their story be?

“You can’t stereotype police,” Mays said, “When we went to the black officer, he was actually meaner than the one who helped us, who was white.”

But Pleasant had learned a different lesson. They would not have needed to be rescued if they had not been trapped in the first place by police, she said. She thought the overwhelming show of force was unwarranted.

“If they have the power, they will use it,” she concluded, “any way they can.”",3,NA,Students came to Ferguson peacefully protest and end up trapped behind police line,NA

All of them were black men who died at the hands of law enforcement officers.

They are a handful of such cases since 1999, when Diallo, an unarmed man standing in a New York City doorway, was gunned down by cops who erroneously thought he had a gun.

{Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-hands-up-20140813-story.html"">, who was shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., on Saturday, is the latest victim of what civil rights advocates say is law enforcement's tendency to be overly aggressive when dealing with black males.

There is no federal database that tracks the numbers of people of any race killed by police in the United States. Some individuals and groups have compiled their own databases, using information from media and law enforcement reports.

Here is a look at some of the most famous cases involving black men who died at the hands of police, and the aftermath of the shootings.

{Amadou Diallo}<hyperlink=""http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/26/news/mn-2801""> was an immigrant from the west African nation of Guinea when he was hit with 19 bullets fired by four New York City police officers. It was before dawn on Feb. 4, 1999.

The policemen, none in uniform, thought Diallo fit the description of a man wanted for a series of rapes. They said they identified themselves as officers as they approached Diallo. When Diallo reached into a pocket to pull out his wallet, they opened fire, saying they feared he was reaching for a gun. Diallo was unarmed.

A grand jury indicted the officers on charges of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment. A jury acquitted all of them. Diallo's family sued the city and settled for $3 million.

{Manuel Loggins Jr.}<hyperlink=""http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/30/local/la-me-ln-oc-to-pay-44-million-settlement-in-deputys-slaying-of-marine-20130530""> was a 31-year-old Marine sergeant and a father of three when he was killed by an Orange County sheriff's deputy on Feb. 7, 2012. The deputy approached Loggins after Loggins crashed through a gate of San Clemente High School about 4:40 a.m., with two of his daughters inside his SUV.

According to the sheriff's department account, Loggins left the vehicle, then returned to it, ignored orders to show his hands and displayed a ""mean"" expression. The sheriff's deputy, who said he feared for the girls' safety, fired three shots through the window, killing Loggins as his 9-year-old and 14-year-old daughters watched.

The deputy was not charged. Loggins' family sued and settled for $4.4 million last spring.

{Ronald Madison}<hyperlink=""http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/05/nation/la-na-katrina-bridge-shooting-20110806""> was one of two victims of a New Orleans police shooting on the Danziger Bridge in the days after {Hurricane Katrina}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/disasters-accidents/meteorological-disasters/hurricanes-tropical-storms/hurricane-katrina-EVHST0000123-topic.html""> caused flooding across the city. Madison, 40, was mentally disabled. He was unarmed when he was shot in the back on Sept. 4, 2005. Madison and a 17-year-old named James Brissette were killed; four other people, all members of the same family, were wounded.

Prosecutors said the group was out walking in search of food and supplies in the wake of the hurricane. Authorities said a group of police opened fire on the unarmed individuals and tried to cover up what they had done by claiming they had been shot at.

Five New Orleans police officers pleaded guilty to obstructing justice in connection with the cover-up. Another five were {convicted of civil rights violations}<hyperlink=""http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/05/nation/la-na-katrina-bridge-shooting-20110806""> and sentenced in 2012 to terms ranging from six to 65 years in prison.

{Sean Bell}<hyperlink=""http://articles.latimes.com/2006/dec/02/nation/na-groom2""> was due to be married the morning after his fatal encounter with New York City police officers on Nov. 25, 2006. Bell, 23, was behind the wheel of a car outside a Queens strip club where his bachelor party had been held. Police, including plainclothes officers who had been in the club, said they approached Bell amid concerns that someone in his party had a gun.

Officers opened fire, saying Bell had rammed his car into one of them. They said they had identified themselves as officers and showed their badges, an account disputed by some witnesses in a subsequent trial. Bell was shot in the neck and torso and died. Two friends in his car were shot but survived.

Three police officers were indicted on charges ranging from manslaughter to reckless endangerment. They were acquitted in 2008, but all were fired or forced to resign after the police department concluded they had acted improperly. A lawsuit filed by the victims' families was settled for $7 million.

They then ran upstairs to Graham's apartment. One of them shot Graham once in the chest. The officer said he thought Graham was armed, based on conversations he said heard on his police radio. A bag of marijuana was found near Graham, but no weapon.

A judge threw out a manslaughter indictment against the officer who shot Graham on a technicality. A second grand jury failed to indict the officer, saying there was insufficient evidence to charge him. Graham's family and local lawmakers have called for the {Justice Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/u.s.-department-of-justice-ORGOV0000160-topic.html""> to investigate.

{Eric Garner}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-garner-homicide-20140801-story.html"">, 43, died on July 17, 2014, after a police officer in Staten Island placed him in an illegal chokehold during an encounter on the sidewalk, where police said Garner was selling illegal cigarettes. A bystander shot video showing Garner's final moments, and it quickly fueled major protests and demands that the officers involved face criminal charges.

The city's medical examiner ruled {Garner's death a homicide}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-garner-homicide-20140801-story.html""> because of the compression of his neck and chest.

Neither has been charged with a crime, and police say Garner's poor health and his refusal to cooperate with officers contributed to his death. Police Commissioner William J.

All of this takes me back to an absolutely staggering work of art I saw a couple of years back. {""Now he's out in public but everyone can see""}<hyperlink=""http://www.welcometolace.org/exhibitions/view/natalie-bookchin-now-hes-out-in-public-and-everyone-can-see/""> was a video installation produced by Los Angeles-based {Natalie Bookchin}<hyperlink=""http://bookchin.net/projects/out-in-public.html""> at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE) in Hollywood in the spring of 2012.

It featured 18 monitors staggered around a darkened room, with cuts of video taken off video logs — vlogs — which Bookchin harvested from YouTube. The clips consisted of average Americans of all races giving their thoughts about incidents in the news involving African American men, all of whom go unnamed.

At times a single monitor would speak; at others, they would all light up and people would utter a shared phrase such as, ""I'm not racist, but...""

The first time I saw the installation, I watched it four times over. (It is 16 minutes long.) Then I went back the following week and watched it again. I was so taken with it, in fact, that I called up Art in America and begged {to review it}<hyperlink=""http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/natalie-bookchin/"">. (Critic Christopher Knight wrote about it for the Los Angeles Times, praising how Bookchin ""deftly avoids [the] traps"" of sensationalism. You can find {his review here}<hyperlink=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/03/art-review-natalie-bookchin-at-lace.html"">.)
Bookchin's piece is remarkable for a number of reasons. There's the simple yet hallucinatory presentation, which makes it appear as if the walls are talking. But, more significantly, there's the content. It is a profoundly nuanced exploration of the spaces African American men are expected to occupy in our society.

Except those spaces are all over the map, with some vloggers opining at length on where black men should and shouldn't live, and others going on about the right time to ""show your blackness."" The piece is a stunning reflection of a society that is grappling with the notion of African American men as threats; that there might be places where they should and shouldn't be.
The fact that it went up at LACE roughly 10 days after the shooting of unarmed black teenager {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/trayvon-martin-PEOCVC000188-topic.html"">  in Florida made Bookchin's work feel eerily prescient. The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. — and {other unarmed black men since}<hyperlink=""http://www.citylab.com/crime/2014/08/two-more-unarmed-young-black-men-have-been-shot-by-police-since-michael-browns-death/376092/""> — gives it ever more urgency.

Yet beyond LACE's gallery installation, Bookchin's video piece has only ever been featured once in a museum — and that museum was in ... {Australia}<hyperlink=""http://monash.edu/muma/exhibitions/upcoming/direct-democracy.html"">. 
This is a shame. ""Now he's out in public..."" has a lot to say about the moment in which we are living. And it is the rare piece of art about race that is not only smart, it avoids being preachy or melodramatic, allowing viewers to draw their own conclusions.

There are numerous institutions that have the space for this type of work. Certainly, there is the {Museum of Contemporary Art}<hyperlink=""http://www.moca.org/""> here in Los Angeles (which currently has a lot of {gallery space to fill}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-mocas-blank-schedule-20140726-column.html#page=1"">).

LATimes,lat48,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-patrol-20140815-story.html,"In troubled Ferguson, police try a gentler approach",Molly Hennessy-Fiske,08/15/2014,04/14/2016,"St. Louis Police Sgt. Robert Ogilvie was getting off work late when he got the call from his boss to come join the new night patrol in this riot-ravaged suburb.

After days of protesters clashing with local police after the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African American, the governor had directed the state Highway Patrol to take over security in Ferguson.

The Highway Patrol is headed by Ron Johnson, who enlisted Ogilvie’s boss, Maj. Ronnie Robinson, to bring order to the suburb where a majority of the population is black and much of the city’s power structure, including the police department, is white. Johnson, Robinson and Ogilvie are African American.

So at 6 p.m. Thursday, Ogilvie and Robinson set out on foot in Ferguson to diffuse racial tension, one bystander at a time.

“It’s not always showing force,” said Ogilvie, a trim 48-year-old officer with shaved, graying hair and a thick mustache. “Sometimes you have to show compassion.”

This is what Ogilvie and Robinson had learned to do at the police academy where they were classmates 23 years ago: Walk with the people, listen to their problems, let them set the agenda. Community Policing 101.

Ideally, they would have made the rounds Thursday night in civilian clothes. But neither had time to change. They walked West Florissant Avenue conspicuously in uniform, Robinson in a dress cap and bright white shirt, Ogilvie in blue. Underneath, he still wore a bulletproof vest he knew he would not need.

This crowd posed no threat, he said to himself. They wanted an officer to talk to, not to attack.

Just then some young men in a passing car shouted the F-bomb, a common refrain aimed at police this week on the avenue.

Robinson, also 48, waved and shouted a greeting, unfazed. In response, the men chuckled.
“They’re laughing. They don’t expect the police to speak to them,” he said as he walked past a McDonald’s, a pawn shop and a furniture rental store. “Some kids — you’ve got to communicate.”

A black biker zooming past spotted Robinson, slowed and smiled, shouting, “Hey Ronnie!”

Robinson waved.

The 48-year-old Robinson had become a police officer, he said, because he believed in fairness. He attended high school not far from here, the same school attended by Brown, whose fatal shooting Saturday outside the QuikTrip gas station down the avenue sparked looting. A few of the businesses Robinson now passed were still battered and boarded up with plywood.

Many of the bystanders who lined the avenue Thursday night had also traveled from St. Louis to bear witness, familiar faces in neighborhoods Ogilvie and Robinson have policed for years. Ogilvie saw a few whom he had arrested.

About 8 p.m., a police cruiser suddenly zoomed up the street toward the charred hulk of the QuikTrip, where the crowd was thickest and most raucous. The cruiser arrived with lights flashing, sirens blaring.

A woman had fallen and needed medical attention. Ogilvie and Robinson wished their colleagues had sent an ambulance, or at least turned off the lights and sirens. Some onlookers started throwing bottles.

The pair tried to steer the crowd away from the police car. Older residents helped, including a man dressed in a suit and carrying a bullhorn. The crowd obeyed, and police drove the woman back to their nearby command center to get treated.

The Rev. Gill Ford was impressed.

“People are seeing a difference,” said Ford, national director for the NAACP in Baltimore, who arrived here after the shooting.

Still, he cautioned, “you can only take it one day at a time.”

Ogilvie and Robinson went back to walking West Florrisant, slowly. They shook hands and listened as residents vented their frustration with local police, everything from racial profiling to pernicious traffic tickets. One woman spent 15 minutes complaining to Ogilvie about getting ticketed outside of her own home. Just days earlier, Ferguson police had fired rubber bullets and rounds of gear gas.

Ogilvie and Robinson stopped to talk to a young woman with short blond dreadlocks who turned out to be a cousin of Brown.

Robinson gave her his condolences. And he promised police would work for justice for her family, to ensure that the truth of what happened to her cousin would be revealed.

Sabrina Webb, 22, walked away feeling a bit better.

“They’re going to do all they can,” Webb said. “To see that someone from the police actually cares, it brings a lot of relief.”

At one point, the officers were joined on the avenue by Johnson, the Highway Patrol chief, a tall, trim figure, also in uniform. He walked the crowd alongside St. Louis County Police Chief Joe Belmar, who is white.

Tammy Finley-Stewart, 31, was excited to see Johnson — the first African American officer she had seen since moving here from Chicago four years ago.

“We do not have confidence in our justice system, our police, that they are going to protect us and serve us,” said Finley-Stewart, who was wearing a T-shirt that said, “Don’t shoot.”

“You can’t serve somebody who doesn’t trust you,” she said.

Robinson said their approach wasn’t just about race, it was about empathy, sincerity. Half the officers who graduated in their academy class were white.

“If you give respect, you will receive respect,” he said.

Ogilvie had followed an older cousin onto the police force, a mentor who's also still serving. He figures Ferguson police would benefit from having more African American officers — of 53 commissioned officers on the force, three are black — but that white officers can do the same outreach. He saw them do it while working on a gang task force.

“Once you realize you’re part of the community, it changes everything,” he said.

Many of those Ogilvie talked to on the avenue asked what he thought of the shooting. He refused to blame the police officer involved, advising people to wait for all of the evidence to be analyzed.

He urged those who witnessed it to come forward and aid investigators, not to fear being derided by neighbors for snitching. He has two grown sons and sympathized with Brown’s family.

Ogilvie also knows what it’s like to be on the other side of that gun.

Back in 1994, he was in a shootout with a fleeing robbery suspect. Ogilvie didn’t shoot the man, who was from Ferguson. But he was hit twice, once in each leg, through and through. A jury found the shooter not guilty. Three months later, Ogilvie was back on the job.

By 10:30 p.m. Thursday, Ogilvie and his boss were still walking, his legs aching.

They have responded to scores of shootings, scores of funerals where tension was high. He thought of the neighborhood shrines erected for the fallen, and what would happen if they were swept away.

The crowds on West Florissant Avenue might linger for days, lifting their arms and shouting “Don’t shoot!” in homage to Brown. This place had become their shrine.

“Give them a chance to mourn,” he advised. “You might get some peace.”

The next morning, authorities would finally reveal the name of the officer who shot Brown — Darren Wilson — and say that Brown had been a suspect in the robbery of convenience store. Ferguson residents {would react with skepticism}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/"">, , expressing disbelief that Brown had been involved in any wrongdoing.

But on this night, the moon was high in the sky, the air on the avenue cool, smelling of fresh cut grass and marijuana. The street was still full of protesters, mostly young people shouting and honking, some toting beers and liquor bottles.

But there had been no violence, no looting. Shortly before midnight the officers headed home, exhausted and relieved.",5,NA,"After a week of unrest, protests and tear gas, police try a gentler approach in Ferguson, Mo.",NA

Authorities have used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to control the nightly crowds that have taken to the streets to protest the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Before the uproar, {Uncle Sam's Safari Outfitters}<hyperlink=""http://unclesams.com/common/home.php"">, a military surplus store in nearby Manchester, did not usually carry gas masks. Now they can’t keep them in stock, said co-owner Ann Dyer.

“We completely sold out and had to order more,” she said. “We sold 60 within 15 minutes"" on Monday. The store, which is about 20 miles from Ferguson, had 100 more masks delivered Tuesday morning and arranged some of them on a merchandise table near the door. 

Going for $39.99 apiece, the masks have been snapped up by both protesters and journalists, she said.

There is no age limit or other criteria for being able to buy a mask, Dyer said. There has also been a bit of a run on bulletproof vests, but those were being purchased mainly by journalists and firefighters, she said. The vests go for $299.99.
""We've only got one left,"" Dyer said.

Other firearm dealers in the area do not carry gas masks, and staffers at those locations have been pointing customers to online retailers to search for them. 

Sales for gas masks on {Amazon}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/business/amazon.com-inc.-ORCRP000672-topic.html""> have recently soared, according to the site, though it's not clear why.

The Rev. Robert White of the Peace of Mind Church in St. Louis was among the older community leaders seeking to maintain the peace.

He urged protesters to ""give Ferguson a break"" and let businesses get back on their feet. ""The police are out here to protect us,"" he told CNN.

""If we could end tonight without one person getting shot, that would be a real blessing,"" he said.

Missouri Atty. Gen. Chris Koster arrived to briefly address demonstrators. His spokeswoman issued a statement in his name voicing confidence in St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch, despite calls for McCulloch to withdraw from the case.
""It is my understanding he has placed the matter in the hands of two highly experienced prosecutors, one of whom is African American,"" Koster said in the statement. ""I trust in their ability to diligently and fairly present the evidence in this case.""

Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html""> also said in a statement that he would not call on McCulloch to withdraw.

A St. Louis County grand jury was expected to begin hearing evidence Wednesday, the same day Holder plans to meet with community leaders, the governor, FBI investigators and federal prosecutors.
In an op-ed piece posted by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Tuesday, Holder defended his decision to pursue a federal civil rights investigation contemporaneously with the local investigation.

He also warned rioters in this racially polarized city of 21,000 against looting and violence, calling them a small minority who only ""seriously undermine, rather than advance, the cause of justice."" Holder cautioned that ""violence cannot be condoned.""

Local officials said Tuesday that many of the 78 people arrested Monday night and into Tuesday morning were out-of-towners arrested for ""refusal to disperse,"" some from as far away as California and New York. St. Louis County police said in a late-evening email that between 8 a.m. Monday and 8 a.m Tuesday, that agency alone had arrested 52 people. Of those, 14 were from out of state.

""It is of note that 93% of those arrested were not Ferguson residents,"" Officer Brian Schellman, spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, said in a statement. ""Of all those arrested, 27% were not residents of Missouri.""

One of the arrested out-of-towners, Carl Dix of Brooklyn, N.Y., denied that outsiders meant trouble. ""There are no outsiders in the struggle against injustice and oppression,"" he said.

In his op-ed piece, Holder confirmed that the federal autopsy of Brown had been completed. A government source who asked not to be identified said a {U.S. military}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/defense/u.s.-military-ORGOV000021106-topic.html""> medical examiner had concluded that Brown was shot six times.

The federal autopsy was the third postmortem on Brown. The first was conducted by the St. Louis County medical examiner, the second on behalf of Brown's family. The private autopsy, like the federal postmortem, showed six gunshot wounds.

The results of the county autopsy have not been made public.

Holder has said the civil rights investigation will review the county-performed autopsy.

Local officials' delay in releasing details of the shooting — including the name of the police officer involved — angered the community and led to allegations of an attempted coverup.

On Tuesday, a group of African American attorneys called for McCulloch, the county prosecutor, to recuse himself and let the {Justice Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/u.s.-department-of-justice-ORGOV0000160-topic.html"">
take over.

At a news conference on the steps of the courthouse in downtown St. Louis, Kendra Howard, leader of the Mound City Bar Assn., said residents of nearby Ferguson and elsewhere were ""gravely concerned about the lack of transparency and lack of candor"" from McCulloch's office since Brown's death.

""Mr. McCulloch has shown that he is emotionally invested in protecting law enforcement, and therefore should immediately step aside and allow the Justice Department to investigate the death,"" Howard said.

Ed Magee, spokesman for the county prosecutor's office, denied allegations that the office could not be impartial.

Nixon weighed in on the question of recusal in a late, brief and confusing email that talked about the need to stick to the ""established process"" for replacing the sitting prosecutor with a special prosecutor so as not to inject ""legal uncertainty"" into the volatile case.

""From the outset, I have been clear about the need to have a vigorous prosecution of this case, and that includes minimizing any potential legal uncertainty,"" Nixon said.

As it turns out, the Monday meeting comes after a violent night of protests in Ferguson, where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot by police more than a week ago.

Anyone who knows the groundbreaking soul singer's biography understands that's not a question that inoculates against trouble. But in certain circumstances, such as when America is paying witness to the Ferguson, Mo., racial strife unfolding via social media on a Wednesday night, it's an appropriate one to ask.

In the case of the Hollywood Bowl's often heavy night of soul power, ""Get On Up: A James Brown Celebration,"" that question arose because of circumstances outside of anyone on the impressive roster's control. On an evening that witnessed urgent renditions of Brown classics from artists including {Aloe Blacc}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/entertainment/music/aloe-blacc-PECLB00000013558-topic.html"">, Angelique Kidjo, Bettye LaVette and D'Angelo backed by a 14-piece band that included seven former Brown sidemen, wondering on James Brown's likely response had nothing to do with his musical perfectionism or super-bad razzle-dazzle.

A night of music timed to connect his work to the recent biopic, ""Get On Up,"" the event was designed to serve as a reminder of the enduring legacy of an American original through performances of some of his biggest hits. To that end it succeeded.

However, I started thinking about this when I realized that it would be tough to tear away from Twitter and the events unfolding just outside my beloved hometown of St. Louis to focus on ""Get On Up."" Thus, as Los Angeles singer Aloe Blacc was working through a version of ""The Payback"" filled with requisite grunts, sweat and blasts of brass, and bandleader Christian McBride was pushing forth a heavy bass groove, on my Twitter feed someone had posted this from a Ferguson resident:
""I'm not sure we can get back into #ferguson. I asked a cop about road access and had a Sniper rifle pointed at my chest....""

Perhaps the phone should have been dropped right then, but I take notes on it. So when Blacc, known for his hits ""The Man"" and ""I Need a Dollar,"" embodied Brown's powerful message of vendetta and the song's co-writer, trombonist Fred Wesley, played along, the unfolding police action mixed with the music pumping from a tight band: ""Revenge! I'm mad! The big payback!"" The music suddenly became the soundtrack of horrifying news far away.
Originally a song about searing jealousy, the work assumed new meaning when surrounded by fresh context.

Another tweet, hard to ignore despite the energy onstage: ""Phone dying, tweets will stop. Chants of 'Hands up, don't shoot' and 'what if this was your town' will continue tonight in Ferguson,"" posted Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery after being detained by Ferguson police.

Twitter next informed me that a St. Louis alderman got arrested for illegal assembly as mesmerizing Benin singer Angelique Kidjo harnessed the percussive punches of Brown's ""Say It Loud!"" Surrounding her were some of Brown's musical messengers: emcee Danny Ray, sax player Alfred ""Pee Wee"" Ellis, trombonist Wesley and percussionists John ""Jab'o"" Starks, George ""Spike"" Nealy, Robert ""Mousey"" Thompson and ""Funky Drummer"" originator Clyde Stubblefield.

What would James Brown do? Would he pause in the middle of the show to acknowledge the strife? Would he say that all these years later, his black power anthems and bold declarations had lost their ability to direct change? Would he tell us that these performers had not risen to the occasion by acknowledging the discord?

I'd like to think that, unlike the performers onstage, he'd have decried the police action and spoken of the continued relevance of protest music or at least offered a message of peace for Ferguson. That none was forthcoming perhaps mattered only to me and a few other people — as I said, maybe I should have stopped checking Twitter and focused everything on those songs (could I have missed a mention while checking Twitter?). Still, that felt like a missed opportunity to celebrate Brown's best side: his advocacy for black youth and message of peaceful change.

This was especially true considering the crowd, which while not packed contained a big population of African Americans.

The day after {Martin Luther King Jr.}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/arts-culture/culture/martin-luther-king-jr.-PEHST001228-topic.html"">'s assassination, as much of urban America was experiencing drama akin to that occurring in Ferguson, Brown played a historic concert in Boston that helped defuse racial tensions. He did so by inviting onto the stage Boston's white mayor, Kevin White, and assuring the crowd that he was a good man — ""a swinging cat!""

As writer R.J. Smith recounted in his Brown biography, ""The One: The Life and Music of James Brown,"" ""Driving in the bus to the Garden, band member Fred Wesley said he was worried he might be shot en route or on stage. Some in the group were praying just to get through things; others were ready to run."" Boston remained peaceful that night, and over the following years Brown issued some of his most political music.

Onstage, Kidjo told a story about James Brown's impact on her life as a girl an ocean away. ""The first day my brother put James Brown on the turntable, I went flying from the kitchen going, 'What the hell is this one?!' And I said to myself, 'The language he's singing in, I want to learn that language.'""

""Say it loud,"" she sang at the Bowl, ""I'm black and I'm proud!""

A tweet from @TefPoe: ""This pastor was shot with a 60 cal rubber bullet but she's still here fighting the good fight and protecting others!""

Brown's was the language of music as power, and his former bandmates on hand manifested that most memorably during the final set by the great soul singer D'Angelo. Going deeper into the catalog first with solid, richly toned takes on ""I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing"" and ""Maybe the Last Time,"" the Atlanta singer teamed with the musicians to deliver heaviness and funk.

The evening concluded when D'Angelo delivered a version of ""Soul Power,"" Brown's ode to musical fury. As all of the vocalists from throughout the evening arrived onstage, the night's organizer, McBride, drove the entire band with heavy bass and intense eyes. In its own way, this is still a strong message.

""Know we need it! Soul power!"" the vocalists declared one by one. ""You know we got it! Soul power!""",0,NA,The James Brown celebration at the Hollywood Bowl seemed to call for an onstage mention of news from Ferguson,NA

The R&B crooner covered ""What's Going On"" to tease Wednesday’s salute to Gaye at {the Hollywood Bowl}<hyperlink=""http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/tickets/marvin-gayes-whats-going-on-john-legend/2014-08-20"">. The cover served another purpose, however, with Legend using the song as a platform to address the growing civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., after a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old.

“In this time of turmoil in America, and the world, ‘What’s Going On’ is appropriate,” Legend told the approximately 150 fans at Apogee Studio in Santa Monica before his performance.

Gaye’s meditation on social ills, itself inspired by an incident of police brutality and violence during a protest by antiwar activists, has maintained its urgent relevance more than 40 years after its release. And Legend’s fiery piano-led performance of the track, a warm-up of sorts for Wednesday's show, served as a reminder that musicians -- particularly soul singers -- used to stand for something more than scoring a late-night romance.

“One of our original sins in this country has been racism and slavery. And we still haven’t figured out how to solve that problem,” Legend said during an onstage interview with Jason Bentley, music director of KCRW-FM (89.9).
“We’ve given our police these military-style weapons, and you know, it’s a mess. But this is not new,” Legend continued. “... This was happening with lynchings well before the '60s, where there were all kinds of extralegal ways for black folks to get killed and for black bodies to not be valued in this country.""

But more bluntly: ""Black and brown people are just treated differently in this country,"" he said.

Legend, along with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, will tackle highlights from Gaye’s catalog, including a full performance of the iconic soul singer’s seminal album “What’s Going On.”

When asked if he believes music anchored by social issues has lost its place, Legend (who nabbed a Grammy for his 2010 collaborative album with the Roots that covered social and political soul music from the '60s and '70s) said he felt there was “less urgency” in the young community.

“There’s less of that angst, that urgency,” Legend said. “My theory is that the draft makes a difference. Because when each and every person has the potential to be sent off to Vietnam, it gives every young person a greater sense of urgency about what’s going on in politics, what’s going on in the world.

“Now that the people who choose to do it are doing it, I think fewer young people feel connected to decisions that politicians make,” he continued. “So I’m not saying we should have the draft. I am saying that because we don’t have the draft, fewer people feel that sense of urgency.”

The singer has been actively discussing the fallout in Ferguson with his more than 5.7 million Twitter followers. And he’s not the only musician responding to the civil unrest and getting involved.

Killer Mike penned an emotional letter on Instagram, writing “I care that we as humans care as much about one another more. I care we see past class, race and culture and honor the humanity that unites our species.”

J. Cole said he was “tired of being desensitized to the murder of black men” before he released the searing “Be Free,” which interpolated witness accounts of the fatal shooting and used the graphic image of Brown lying dead in the street as the single’s cover art.

Cole headed to the streets of Ferguson to help rally and pay tribute to Brown, as did rapper Talib Kweli -- who tweeted 10 reasons why he was making the trip. “Artists who make money off the community are obligated to be there when the community is being brutalized,” he wrote and later added, “Mike Brown loved hip-hop and wrote lyrics. He was a fan of hip-hop. The hip-hop community owes him.”

Legend’s showcase wasn’t all serious business, though.

He opened with steamy bedroom knocker “Tonight (Best You Ever Had),” and moved through fan favorites such as “Save Room,” “Maxine” “Ordinary People” and his latest single, “You & I.” He even broke down his creative process by demonstrating how he composed “Again” on a whim.  

And yes, there was time for his massive hit “All Of Me” -- the success of which he says he owes to his performance at this year’s Grammys.

“It took a long time to get there, but once it got there, it stayed there,” Legend said of the song that became his first No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. “It wouldn’t be what it is without that performance.""

Missouri Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html""> consequently dispatched the State Highway Patrol to take over security in Ferguson.

“There was a time in my life when I [cared],” Cole said in a statement. “Every chance I got I was screaming about it. I was younger. It’s so easy to try to save the world when you’re in college. You got nothing but time and no responsibility.

But one story that demands attention is what is happening on the streets of Ferguson, Mo. And while there's a lot, John Oliver provided a decent primer in 15 minutes on ""Last Week Tonight"" Sunday.

As is his usual method, Oliver devoted the second half of his show to diving deep into the complicated explanation of a story that, on the surface, appears bereft of any obvious comedic value. How does one go about mining a story about racial tensions and the increasingly violent conflicts on the streets of Ferguson for laughs?
Smartly, Oliver used Ferguson as a gateway into a whole other topic: the use of military-grade equipment by local police forces around the country. It's not just Missouri. Police as far away as New Hampshire and Michigan have received vehicles more appropriate to the streets of a war-torn city than Main Street U.S.A.

According to NBC News, the {Department of Defense}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/defense/u.s.-department-of-defense-ORGOV000094164-topic.html""> has transferred $4.3 billion in military equipment to local police since 1996.

So just what do police in, say, Keene, N.H., need with a BearCat armored personnel carrier? They need to protect, among other things, the town's annual Pumpkin Festival from the unpredictable and unforeseen threat of terrorists.

LATimes,lat59,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-michael-brown-20140817-story.html,"Among Michael Brown's neighbors, anger over a future lost",Molly Hennessy-Fiske,08/16/2014,04/15/2016,"To understand Michael Brown and why his shooting has unleashed such anger here, go to the place where he lived and died.

Canfield Green Apartments, a worn complex of brick buildings surrounded by trees and hills, has become a rallying point for protesters. They congregate at its center, Canfield Drive, the two-lane street where Brown, a black 18-year-old, died Aug. 9, shot multiple times by a white police officer.

The apartments are a working-class way station — a way out of the inner city, adjacent to the slightly pricier townhomes and tract houses.

""It's not the projects, and it's not Section 8, but it's not townhomes, either,"" said Lloyd Williams, 29, a friend of Brown's family who works at a casino.

But amid the trappings of a working-class haven is an edge of frustration and anger.

Many of the young have no work. Some have served time in prison for violent crimes, including clashes with police. The apartment complex community had a tense relationship with Ferguson officers.
In this mix, Michael Brown was known as a good kid — not an angel, but someone who had hope for the future.

It is part of the reason why his death has reverberated so strongly: He had hope, and he was killed.

""If his grandma said go upstairs, he went. He was respectful,"" recalled neighbor Kevin Seltzer, 30. ""He didn't bother people. That's why the community here in Ferguson, the real community of Canfield, we're upset now.""

Brown stayed at Canfield with friends and, earlier this year, with his grandmother at the adjacent Northwinds apartments. He had just graduated from nearby Normandy High School — no small achievement here.
He was heavyset and quiet, but not shy. He recorded rap music with his best friend and smoked marijuana with other young men.

Everyone called him ""Mike-Mike."" He's so big, they said, you have to call him twice. His cousin, Christine Ewings, said Brown had played on the high school football team but stopped because he was afraid of hurting smaller students.

Williams said he used to listen to Brown rap about improving his life as he was preparing to attend technical school, studying the heating and cooling trade. ""He was bettering himself,"" Williams said.

Brown didn't have a car or license. Like many here, he walked to nearby stores, including on the day he was shot.

Seltzer watched him leave that day in a T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops. Brown was headed for a nearby minimart to buy cigarillos — cigars often used to smoke marijuana.

He stopped briefly to chat with two white landscapers who had been chopping down trees in the complex. They complained about the work, and Brown put it in perspective.

He told them ""be thankful you have a job because some people don't have jobs around here,"" recalled Seltzer, who is among the unemployed.

Moments later, he said Brown departed with a friend, Dorian Johnson, 22, promising to be right back.

Police said that Brown then walked to a minimart and stole some cigarillos. Williams said he didn't know whether that was true, but he said in this neighborhood it wouldn't have marked Brown as much of a criminal. ""When you're growing up in a rough situation, everybody makes mistakes,"" Williams said.

Brown was later shot after being confronted on Canfield Drive by police Officer Darren Wilson in front of several apartment residents.

A woman who lives in the complex and asked not to be identified for fear of being targeted by residents and police said she heard the commotion and ran to her balcony. She said Brown threw his hands up in the air, shouting, ""Don't shoot!""

""The officer kept shooting and he fell to his knees, begging for his life,"" the woman said. ""That's when he finished him off, shot him in the head.""

The woman said she works in a warehouse and moved here in March with her 2-year-old daughter to escape the violence in inner-city St. Louis.

She knows hard-core criminals, and said that Brown wasn't one. He was not a known drug dealer, not a gang-banger.

""His death just pushed a lot of people over the edge,"" she said.

The simmering fear at the apartments has boiled over lately. Several residents have moved out, afraid of both demonstrators and the police.

""There's a bad vibe around here now,"" said the woman who witnessed the shooting. ""I don't feel safe.""

She emerged from her apartment Friday into the humid afternoon with her daughter following the sweet smell of barbecue to a free lunch in a tent set up by volunteers on the lawn across from an impromptu shrine set up on the street for Brown.

They retreated almost immediately. The night before there had been looting one street over on West Florissant Avenue. Now the governor had announced a curfew, and she was worried.

Kevin Brankley, 29, observed from the opposite side of the street, just as he had the day of Brown's shooting.

Brankley said he grew up in a tough area of St. Louis, and was almost accustomed to seeing bodies in the streets. But this shooting startled even him, ""movie-type"" violence in broad daylight against a man he knew to be laid-back.

Brankley, a construction worker, said he planned to stay at the complex, where he hoped neighbors would continue to look out for one another.

He said he didn't know Brown very well, but he added: ""It's not how good Mike was — it's how corrupt the police is,"" he said.

As a black man on these streets, ""it doesn't matter what you do,"" he said. ""You're not liked or hated for what you do. You're liked or hated for who you are.""",66,NA,"Before he was shot and killed by police, Michael Brown was a good kid, friends and neighbors say",NA

On Thursday, {in an essay}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> for Time magazine, he nailed one of the major problems with the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and the unconscionably militarized police response:

“If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off,"" Paul wrote. ""But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.”

As a libertarian, Paul blames “big government” for the disproportionality of the police response: “Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies — where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most Americans think of as law enforcement.”

And that is certainly a part of the problem. When you are a hammer, as they say, every problem looks like a nail.

But Paul is also refreshingly realistic (for a Republican) about the deeper roots of the problem:

“Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention,"" he wrote. ""Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for nonviolent mistakes in their youth.”

Amen. This is a shameful American reality that must be addressed. The election of our first black president was an important step toward racial equality, but, as we have seen {over}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin""> and {over}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Louis_Gates_arrest_controversy""> since 2009, it was nothing more than a balm for wounds that are far too deep to be healed by the election of a single human being.

Many folks have pointed out the extraordinary double racial standard at play when the situation in Ferguson is juxtaposed with what went down last summer in southeastern Nevada.

A well-armed white rancher who owed the feds millions of dollars in grazing fees incited a pseudo-militia of gun-toting nutcases to consider violence against the federal government. Who can forget the images of Cliven Bundy and his lunatic supporters, lying like snipers on a freeway overpass, their automatic weapons pointed east — toward Washington, I guess — itching for the chance to open fire on the gummint?

What happened? Nothing. The government backed off, the crazies melted back into the desert, and conservatives strained to disavow Bundy after {a reporter recorded him}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html?_r=0""> making blatantly racist remarks.

Seltzer, 30, lives at the Canfield Green apartments. He had seen Brown briefly before the 18-year-old left for a quick trip to the neighborhood mini-mart.

“I had just walked inside when I heard the shots,” said Seltzer, who is African American, lanky and tattooed.

He rushed to a window with his {iPad}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/services-shopping/apple-ipad-PRDCES000000029-topic.html"">, then a balcony to record the scene.

As a video played, two white workers could be seen standing by a truck outside the apartments, gazing toward Brown’s body in the street, saying, “He had his hands up.”

Seltzer filmed as police strung yellow tape and an ambulance arrived.
In one video, he can be heard saying, “I want to go over there, but I don’t want to disrespect the dead.”

Seltzer eventually approached the police cordon around Brown’s body, by then draped with a white sheet.

Ferguson and St. Louis County police can be seen in his later videos. Seltzer said Ferguson police tried to stop him from filming, saying, “You better get back, or you could be next.” He said one officer had his hand on his gun.

In one video, an African American woman Seltzer did not know who witnessed the shooting can be heard describing what she saw.
She said the officer pulled up to Brown in his car and shot at him from the window, then ""he stood over him and dumped on him,"" shooting him again.

Seltzer, who is unemployed, had moved to the apartment complex from the south side of St. Louis with his girlfriend at her urging, looking for quiet. He said two of his neighbors who witnessed the shooting had since broken their leases and left.

He shared his videos with several news outlets, and he hopes people who see them understand that Brown did not pose a threat to police.

“I just want them to see the truth. He wasn’t doing anything. That could have been me,” he said.

He was still trying to track down other eyewitnesses late Friday to tell their stories.

At least one of his neighbors said she had also rushed to film the shooting scene.

Terri Williams, 25, a recording engineering student and stay-at-home mother of five, had been on her way to the store when she heard gunshots and backtracked. By the time she returned, Brown lay in the street, she said, two officers standing over his body, one with gun drawn.

The image has haunted her.

On Friday, she and her family joined the {Rev. Jesse Jackson}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/social-issues/racism/jesse-jackson-PEPLT007437-topic.html""> as he led a procession of dozens to their complex from the looted Quik-Trip gas station that has become a rallying point for protesters.

They marched in the rain to a small shrine erected in the middle of Canfield Road where Brown was shot.

There the crowd observed a moment of silence.  Jackson prayed and posed for photographs with Williams’ children — including 1-year-old Jesse.

The family had fashioned construction paper hearts and taped them to their chests, each scrawled with a crayon message: “No justice, no peace.”

As the street emptied, Williams’ children played around her on the apartment steps. She stared at the shrine’s melted candles and waterlogged signs.

She was thinking about Brown again, twisting her long braids.

“That was somebody’s child,” she said. “That baby, laying in that street.""

She pointed, remembering something else: “His mama trying to get over there to identify her baby.”

Williams had watched the police hold the older woman back. She thought of her own young sons.

“He laid there bleeding out,” Williams said. “And I remember watching the blood just dripping.”

She grew quiet.

During the last week, Williams has been trapped at home by riot police, pepper-sprayed, her husband tear-gassed. But this is what will stay with her - the image of Brown’s bloody body in the street in front of her apartment.

Nixon made instant headlines when he announced a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew and declared a state of emergency in Ferguson, which had been hit with renewed violence overnight as the city simmers in anger over the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black man.

Then a woman who was holding a camera shouted at the governor, asking why the officer who shot Brown had not been arrested and charged with murder.

Nixon gave a long pause and didn't answer the question. Things only got rockier from there.

Tough news conferences have become a familiar scene around Ferguson in recent days, in which public officials have been rattled by residents and activists leaping in to ask more confrontational questions than the dozens of local and national reporters who are covering the story.
""I came from North Carolina, and I'm not leaving the streets until we get justice for Mike Brown!"" one man shouted from the back of the room.

Another woman jumped in to ask if Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson would provide two-way radios for citizens because she hoped to organize demonstrators Saturday night.

Another person asked about the earlier use of tear gas. Another about why a photo has not been released of Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Brown. Another asked about — well, sometimes it wasn't clear what was being asked, because the citizens and the activists sometimes all began shouting at the same time.
""Stop killing our people, police! Stop now!"" one man hollered over the rest.

At one point, Johnson, who was put in charge of Ferguson's security by Nixon on Thursday, spoke in a strong, but calm tone and said:

There was plenty of trouble to be managed among the fishermen drinking and fighting in the saloons and brothels, the Chinese immigrant cannery workers in their rickety shacks and out on the water where smugglers ran the Canadian border and hid out in the misty coves and channels of the San Juan Islands. 

With only a knife, a pistol and one deputy, Grandpa somehow managed to maintain law and order. If he were in charge of the small city’s police force today, though, he would have access to all kinds of high-caliber weaponry and armored vehicles to outfit a team of tactical officers in uniforms that would make them look like combat soldiers in Afghanistan. The federal government and military contractors would be eager to supply him with such gear, even though Anacortes is now a quiet community where the only reminder of the wild old days is a set of historical murals depicting a sanitized version of that livelier past.

Obviously, policing is different than it was 100 years ago. In most places, it is far less corrupt than it once was. In the South, police are no longer the enforcers for a racist social system. And cops have become professionals. Today’s officers are typically given intensive training in everything from community relations to handling a riot. 

My grandfather was incorruptible and, in a racist era, he befriended the leader of the beleaguered Chinese community, but he was no trained expert in law enforcement. He was just a big, strong man who figured out on his own how to do a tough job. He used common sense far more than his gun (as far as I know, he never once shot it at anyone). By contrast, today’s police, however well trained, seem to be ever more likely to use force rather than finesse.

One reason for that is the impressive amount of force they can now bring to a situation. With the War on Terror as an impetus and defense contractors as self-interested cheerleaders for the policy, the federal government has found ways to transfer vast amounts of military hardware to police departments across the country. Not only has this made cops look like an occupying army, it has encouraged them to act like one. Military-style police raids have become ubiquitous – as many as 80,000 such raids reportedly took place last year. 

Unfortunately, police work is still an inexact science and innocent people get mistaken for bad guys. This has always happened. But when a revved up, heavily-armed, battle-ready tactical squad comes crashing through the front door, an innocent person has less chance to raise an objection and a much higher chance of being killed. And the impact of this militarized policing is more often than not being felt in poor, minority communities where citizens are both more in need of police protection and more estranged from the police because of their overbearing presence.

Events in Ferguson, Mo., after the police killing of a black teenager, have aimed a spotlight on excessive force and excessive militarization of police. The debate it has fostered is a good thing for the country and, ultimately, a good thing for the police. If we could back away from giving cops the tools of war and, instead, put our national energy into finally addressing the plagues of poverty, underemployment and social alienation that are the product of centuries of racism, our communities would be far healthier and far safer and our police would have no need to act like commandos storming an enemy stronghold.",95,NA,Police should not be turned into occupying armies,NA

Nixon's curfew announcement came after violence erupted in Ferguson, Mo., early Saturday morning as crowds continued to protest the police shooting a week earlier of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black resident.

At least three business were damaged and looted Saturday. Earlier in the week,  heavily armed police officers lobbed tear gas and shot rubber bullets into crowds of protesters.

In recent years, authorities in Boston, New Orleans and other cities have enacted curfews as they contended with upheaval caused by hurricanes, racial tension and terrorism.

Last year, Massachusetts Gov. {Deval Patrick}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/deval-patrick-PEPLT00007676-topic.html""> asked residents of Boston, Cambridge and Watertown to shutter themselves inside as police scoured the area for {Tamerlan}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/tamerlan-tsarnaev-PEOCVC000288-topic.html""> and {Dzhokhar Tsarnaev}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-PEOCVC000287-topic.html"">, the brothers who carried out the Boston marathon bombings.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with Watertown police in April 2013. Police asked residents of all three cities to remain indoors as they searched for his brother. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was later located nearby hiding in a boat.

Many American cities, including Los Angeles, also maintain curfew laws for juveniles. But it is rare to see them strongly enforced.

Last month, the Baltimore City Council passed one of the country's strictest curfew laws, requiring children under the age of 14 to be home by 9 p.m. Children up to 16 are required to be home by 10 p.m. on school nights and 11 p.m. on weekends.",NA,NA,"Curfews are rare, but not unheard of, in response to violence or disasters in U.S.",NA

Gen. {Eric H. Holder Jr.}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/eric-holder-PEPLT000001873-topic.html""> said Thursday.

He said the Justice Department is pushing ahead with a possible federal criminal prosecution in the slaying of 18-year-old Michael Brown, saying it would be “thorough and fair,” but cautioning that the review would “take time to conduct.”

Though Holder did not discuss the substance of the witness interviews, his statement was a sharp departure from the silence of local officials who have refused to discuss any aspect of their investigation, declining to name the officer who fired the fatal shots.

Holder’s remarks also signaled that federal law enforcement officials may not wait for local authorities to act first, which traditionally happens when there are dual federal and state investigations.

Amid growing public pressure, Washington is moving forward even as local authorities continue to gather evidence to present to a local grand jury and await Brown’s autopsy and toxicology results, which could be weeks to complete. Often local investigations into police shootings take months to be resolved, and are ruled justified with little public accounting.
Holder also took aim at the images of heavily armed police officers using riot gear and military-style weapons against protesters.

“I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,” Holder said in a statement released after he briefed President Obama.

“At my direction, [Justice] Department officials have conveyed these concerns to local authorities.”

Holder said the Justice Department has offered technical assistance to local officials “to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.” He said local authorities in Missouri accepted the offer.
Holder also condemned looters and rioters. “While the vast majority of protests have been peaceful, acts of violence by members of the public cannot be condoned,” he said.

He criticized “willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers,” saying “such conduct is unacceptable.”

Further, Holder said members of the department’s Community Relations Service have been dispatched to Ferguson to meet with city, religious and neighborhood officials. Their aim, Holder said, is “to plot out steps to reduce tensions in the community.”

Holder’s actions came after calls from lawmakers in Washington for a stronger federal response.

Of course, accidental timeliness, if it seems to run with the news current instead of against it, can also help boost the profile of a piece of entertainment, even making its creators look prescient.

My Angeleno husband was stopped in Beverly Hills when he was 14 for having the temerity to run to meet his mom after visiting a friend nearby. The officer, questioning his story, returned him to the friend’s house to prove his innocence. His crime? He was just a kid with a backpack — no hoodie, no gang tattoos, no rump-revealing pants, no intimidation, no threat.

When I was growing up two hours away in the desert, it was my shy, bookish older cousin who was pulled over and made to lie face down on the searing asphalt in Indio with a shotgun trained on him because he supposedly matched the description of a criminal in the area. The only thing that matched was that he was a black man — not the car or his height. Now a doctor with his own grown son and daughters, my cousin has never forgotten the lessons of that day. 

Such a bitter stew of emotion is set to simmer internally after experiences like this. It’s a blend of shock, disbelief, anger, vulnerability, humiliation, sadness and resolve. 

For this mother whose body was nourishing and then soon to bear a perfect being — free from the blemishes, burdens and bitterness of generations before him — the idea of having to prepare him for a country that hasn’t caught up with his promise presented a quandary. 

For no matter how determined I am to affirm and embrace the racial progress here in America — and there has been progress, however incremental — I would be negligent to not equip him to face an America that itself has much maturing yet to do. Rather than wait for experience to color our children, my husband and I are determined to shape their experience and response. 

Even as we are discussing how to teach our now-3-year-old son how to be a black man, my husband and I refuse to treat law enforcement as if they are the enemy. We appreciate and respect the incredibly difficult task before them. Officers regularly face life-threatening scenes to keep us safe.

As a result, we teach our son (and our daughter, for that matter) to respect authority, to comport themselves always with self-respect and pride. 

But in the coming years, we will also teach one of the keys to survival: Authority won’t always respect you. Those who are armed with authority — the kind that can pierce the flesh and mortally wound — are also on occasion armed with bias, whether based on one-sided experience or misshapen exposure.

We will reluctantly repeat the lessons passed down from our parents: If you are stopped by the  police, keep both hands in plain sight on the wheel, respond respectfully and make no sudden moves. Remember to tell the officer what you’re doing before reaching for your documents.  

We will convey this to our kids: Just as we are teaching you, ultimately, to fear law enforcement officers, they will also fear you. They don’t know you; they won’t always see you. And though you have the right to do something or to be somewhere, it doesn’t mean that everyone in authority will respect that. 

So amid the unrest whose repercussions are still unveiling themselves, I wept as I did that day in the doctor’s office. Yes, I have a boy, and I have the task of teaching him how to live to be a man. ",36,NA,The difference in raising black boys can be a matter of life and death #blacktwitter,NA

Racial tensions have roiled the St. Louis suburb after the killing.

The parents of Michael Brown, 18, who was shot multiple times Saturday during a street confrontation with a Ferguson police officer, have called on authorities to release the name of the officer and prosecute him. Local law enforcement authorities and the Justice Department have launched parallel investigations into the shooting.

Benjamin Crump, the Browns' lawyer, told reporters that because the family has not called for any violence against the officer, the police should release his name. On behalf of the family, Crump said he is looking into ways to legally compel the police department to disclose the officer’s identity.

“We want answers too,” Crump said. “We want to know why he felt the need to shoot an unarmed kid.”

On Monday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said he would disclose by noon Tuesday the identity of the officer, who has been placed on administrative leave. But after threats were made to the police department and on social media, a department spokesman said it is not safe at this time to release the officer's name.

The announcement comes after another night of unrest Monday, albeit smaller than the previous night, when vandals broke windows, looted and damaged 12 businesses in Ferguson. In Monday night’s standoff, police in riot gear fired tear gas into crowds of protesters and arrested up to 15 people. 

A quieter demonstration followed Tuesday morning outside county justice buildings in nearby Clayton, with scores of demonstrators chanting, ""Who do you protect? Who do you serve!"" at police guarding the county justice center.

Carolynn Mabins, 55, of the city of St. Louis, said that even though she wasn't from Ferguson, she was marching along with other demonstrators because she thought Michael Brown was ""unjustly killed"" and because ""I want to see a change for the blacks.""

""Slavery's over,"" said Mabins. ""But we're still [fighting] slavery in Missouri.""

Crump called for police to release those who had been arrested during the protests.

“We understand these people were arrested because they held their hands up and saying, ‘Don’t shoot me’ for walking, ‘Don’t shoot me’ for being black,” Crump said. “If you want the community to trust you and calm down, don’t arrest us for exercising our constitutional rights.”

The heated protests in part have reflected the racial divisions in Ferguson, population 21,000, where two-thirds of residents are black but police and city officials are predominantly white. Black leaders have called for nonviolent demonstrations to address racism in the Ferguson and greater St. Louis police departments.

""The unrest that has taken place in the wake of Mr. Brown’s death at the hands of police is the unfortunate result of the understandable pain and frustration felt by that community,"" said Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund Inc. ""That pain and frustration are mirrored in communities across this country where unarmed black teens and adults have been killed by police and civilians. These feelings must be met with proactive efforts to address to what is clearly a deeply flawed system of police and civilian responses to perceived black criminality.""

Brown had been walking down a street with a friend Saturday when, according to police, an officer drove up and attempted to get out of his patrol car. Brown pushed the officer back into the car and after an altercation over a weapon in the car, the officer and Brown exited the car, during which the fatal shooting occurred, according to Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County Police Department, which is the local agency investigating the shooting.

According to witnesses, however, Brown had raised his hands to surrender when the fatal shots occurred.

Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Brown at the time of Saturday’s incident, {told MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”> that the officer confronted them after telling them to stop walking on the street and move onto the sidewalk.

Crump told reporters Tuesday that they are trying to arrange for Johnson to give a statement to federal investigators because he does not trust local officials.

Another witness, Piaget Crenshaw, told the local Fox news affiliate, ""I witnessed the police chase after the guy, full force. He ran for his life. They shot him and he fell. He put his arms up to let them know that he was compliant and he was unarmed, and they shot him twice more and he fell to the ground and died.""

On Monday, the Justice Department announced an investigation in conjunction with the separate county police inquiry, and black leaders called for nonviolence but accused local police and other officials of condoning racism in Ferguson and greater St. Louis for too long.

“In the greater picture, what we saw … was the boiling over of tensions that had been going on for a long while,” said Antonio French, a St. Louis city alderman, who is black.

James Clark, vice president of a St. Louis nonprofit, Community Outreach for a Better Life, said the violence after Brown’s death was “due to a total alienation of a certain class of African Americans.”

Ferguson’s police chief and mayor are white. Of the six City Council members, one is black. The local school board has six white members and one Latino. Of the 53 commissioned officers on the police force, three are black, Police Chief Jackson said.

Ferguson was once a white suburb. Now it is predominantly black. And it's hurting.

A young African-American man, Michael Brown, is dead, shot by police.

In the days since there have been anger, rioting, looting and, of course, the politics of race. And the thug behavior of the looters accomplishes something else:

It helps lock Americans into various camps from which we're comfortable listing grievances and condemning the behavior of others.

But it has little to do with illuminating the human tinderbox in some American cities, especially in those violent neighborhoods where residents and cops are under great stress.

St. Louis County police said Brown, who was 6 feet 4 inches tall, struggled with police, reportedly over a gun in a squad car, before he was shot. Neighbors say he was outside the car and had surrendered before the shots were fired.

The immediate, political reaction is to view the shooting through the twisted prism of race. But young African-American men are shot down every day in American cities, mostly by other black men.

And most of us shrug and turn the page and move on, often forgetting that in many neighborhoods there are lousy schools, and no jobs, but plenty of hopelessness and fear, a dangerous combination.

Ferguson has captured attention because of what has happened in the last few days. It's raw enough, and loud enough, and now Al Sharpton, the infamous race hustler and buffoon, has declared it to be fertile ground.

So he's just dropped in to St. Louis, holding news conferences, loudly demanding justice.

Most of us know that Sharpton is a carnival barker, sucking up the media limelight. In offering himself up as part of the show, he makes it about him. But it's not about him.

What's important is the anger and whatever else is seething, just below our common notice.

The rituals of this awful pathology aren't new, including a mob smashing windows, running through liquor stores stealing bottles of booze. Others smashed other stores, including a boutique, and stole what they could.

Stealing whiskey and clothes doesn't bring justice. It brings shame. It allows some to dismiss the entire community as lawless, and dismiss their concerns. Opportunists, both the brutally larcenous and the political, are drawn to it like hungry flies.

Sharpton, who created himself as a fear stoker and media manipulator, said Brown had raised his hands, the universal signal of surrender.

""That's the sign you got to deal with,"" Sharpton said. ""Deal with the last sign he had shown. We want answers why that sign was not respected.""

Sharpton said he wasn't there to stoke more controversy (although that's what he does best) and insisted his visit was all about determining facts and justice.

""I know you are angry,"" he said, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""I know this is outrageous. When I saw that picture (of Brown lifeless on the ground), it rose up in me in outrage. But we cannot be more outraged than his mom and dad. If they can hold their heads in dignity, then we can hold our heads up in dignity.""

Such appeals to dignity are difficult to assess when they are juxtaposed against images of riots and looting. And police officers, typically, feel as if they too are under attack.

After what happened in Ferguson, or when something similar happens in Chicago, we often hear from activists who seek to use a street death as leverage for more political power.

Yet what about the police? They don't make speeches. So you don't often hear from them.

One called me at WLS-AM on Tuesday, where I host a daily midmorning talk show with Lauren Cohn.

The caller said her name was Ann and that her father was an officer who died in the line of duty. (Her story checked out. In fact, I noted her father's death in a column years ago.)

What bothered her was a tendency among some to reduce this all to shorthand and make Brown's killing into a racial issue.

In another excessive-force police case I've been writing about — the killing of a 95-year-old World War II vet — the police officer and the victim were of different skin pigments. I've never mentioned it because I don't think it's relevant.

If someone attacks a police officer, Ann said, ""It's not a race issue.""

""If you attack a police officer with a weapon or attempt to take our weapon or come at us, you will suffer the consequences,"" she said. ""We have a right to go home to our families too. So stop using these excuses when you attack police officers. It's a growing trend, and it's very disturbing.

""It doesn't matter whether you're black, white or Hispanic. I see my friends getting attacked and then I see news reports feeling sorry for offenders, and our families and friends have to suffer with the stress we deal with,"" Ann said.

""Don't attack us and expect us not to go home to our family members. We have the right to go home every night after the job.""

There is no light on the case in Ferguson right now. We don't know what happened. Instead, there is a noise, opportunism, and anger. And of course, politics, something we understand in Chicago.",NA,NA,John Kass: The police shooting death in Missouri is less about race and more about anger and opportunity,NA

LATimes,lat83,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-mother-20140818-story.html,"A mother's lament: For young black men, high stakes and hard rules",Molly Hennessy-Fiske,08/18/2014,04/15/2016,"Christine Ewings learned in a phone call from a friend that her street had been closed because a young black man had been shot by police.

Ewings was not surprised. Months earlier, she was so worried about police stopping her 16-year-old son that she sent him to live with his father in quiet southern Missouri.

Then she learned that the man killed on Aug. 9 was her cousin, 18-year-old Michael Brown, or ""Mike-Mike,"" as everyone in the neighborhood called him.

Ewings, 46, rushed to the scene, where she found Brown's mother huddled next to the yellow police tape, staring at her son's body in the street. ""She cried until she couldn't cry anymore,"" Ewings said.

It was every mother's nightmare, but particularly here in this black neighborhood, where there is no harder or more painful task than trying to keep your son safe, Ewings said. It takes constant attention and diligence.

A young black man here is a potential target, a victim and a suspect, she said.

Ewings, a certified nurse assistant just retrained as a phlebotomist, had struggled to parent her son, facing the same challenge as Brown's mother, a grocery store clerk who lives nearby.

She knew the stakes were high. She wanted to set her son free slowly, to let him grow into being a man. But Ewings knew she had to keep him in line or he could end up dead in the street.

Ewings has three daughters, but she knew her son Daryus Watson would face distinct challenges. She tried to teach him what she figured all young black men needed to know: Stay in at night. Don't hang out, not even on the stoop. Don't engage with police. And be respectful to a fault if you get stopped.

""Just say, 'Yes sir' and let them deal with me,"" she would tell her son, warning him that it was only too easy to provoke police and get arrested.

""Don't engage with them, because they only need a reason,"" she would say.

Daryus chafed at her rules. One night when Ewings came home early from a late shift, she caught him hanging out on the stoop. Another time, she found him at a neighbor's house at 3 a.m., playing video games.

Now he lives with his father, who is helping him with his latest passion: boxing. Daryus got a summer job at a Hardee's restaurant, and is a B and C student on track to graduate. He has plans to go to technical school and become a welder. After his cousin's shooting, he returned to visit his mother, who has kept him in her sight.

Daryus, like Brown, does not have a criminal record — something else she counseled him to avoid.

""You've already got two strikes against you,"" she would say. ""You're black and you're a man. Don't let them give you a third strike, getting locked up.""

Ewings grew up here, attending public schools that were racially mixed. But neighborhoods remain self-segregated, she said. White parents don't live in her world, where sons must be trained to withstand police scrutiny.

""I just don't hear about them shooting a white boy to death in the middle of the street,"" she said.

Brown, who lived with his grandmother in a nearby housing complex, would stop by to see Daryus.

The two would play video games and talk about freestyle raps that Brown composed under the moniker Big'Mike and posted online — including ""Heaven,"" ""Lights Out"" and ""Body Bag.""

In one song, Brown talked about his hopes:

Everybody has their problems and their issues.

I just want to be one of them few that make it out of the hood,

come back, help my people out,

my hood and the people I grew up with.

Brown, the eldest of four children, connected with his disabled grandmother and came to stay with her in recent years, attending a local high school.

""She was working with him, keeping him focused,"" said Ewings, wearing a ""Justice for Michael Brown"" T-shirt.

At times, Brown and his grandmother clashed. He left days before the shooting to stay with friends in a neighboring apartment complex.

""I'm stayin with my home boi right now cause my peoples don't believe in me — that's sad,"" he posted on Facebook, where he went by ""Big Mike.""

But by the day of the shooting, they seemed to have reconciled. ""OK, I believe that everyone had faith in me the whole time,"" Brown posted.

One of Brown's greatest challenges was his size, at 6-foot-4 and 292 pounds, Ewings said. He was so tall his mother had to reach up to hug him. In this neighborhood, size can be a liability, turning young men into threats in the eyes of the police.

When police released surveillance video of Brown purportedly confronting a shorter, older mini-mart clerk before the shooting, grabbing a bunch of cigarillos and storming out, they called it a robbery. Ewings said if Brown had been smaller, or of a different race, the incident might be judged differently.

""Nobody's an angel,"" she said.

Ewings joined relatives and friends for a rally at Greater Grace Church on Sunday that drew more than 1,300 people.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson, who took control of the police response last week from local officers at the direction of the governor, addressed the crowd, apologizing for the often harsh treatment black men have faced from law enforcement.

""I wear this uniform. And I should stand up here and say I'm sorry,"" said Johnson, who is black.

Johnson told the audience that he too had a son at home with sagging pants, cap askew and tattoos on his arms.

He said Michael Brown was ""going to make it better for our sons,"" he promised.

Ewings burst into cheers.

""He apologized for the police,"" Ewings said. ""Somebody like him standing up there in a position of authority gives you hope.""",65,NA,"In Ferguson, Michael Brown's cousin says, young black men are potential targets, victims and suspects",NA
LATimes,lat84,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-police-demilitarize-20140816-story.html,Growing police use of military equipment faces scrutiny,Richard A. Serrano; Joel Rubin; Lisa Mascaro,08/15/2014,04/15/2016,"The image of Ferguson, Mo., police officers in camouflage pointing high-caliber rifles from armored vehicles at unarmed protesters has crystallized a debate over whether a decades-long flow of military-grade equipment to the nation's police departments has gone too far.

On both left and right, political figures as varied as Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. and Sen. {Rand Paul}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/rand-paul-PEPLT007915-topic.html”> (R-Ky.) pointed to Ferguson, denouncing what Holder referred to this week as ""unnecessarily extreme displays of force"" by police.

That debate fits into a larger pattern: A huge upsurge of mayhem in the 1970s and 1980s led to tough-on-crime measures across the country. Now, after two decades of improvements in most places, policies such as long, mandatory prison sentences and expansions of police surveillance are being questioned.

The use of military-style equipment by even small-town police departments is the latest tactic to come under scrutiny.

For years, the money and equipment has flowed copiously. Since 1995, the {Pentagon}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/defense/u.s.-department-of-defense-ORGOV000094164-topic.html”> has distributed $5.1 billion in surplus military equipment to U.S. police departments — sleeping bags, cameras and office equipment, but also assault rifles, mine-resistant armored personnel carriers and helicopters, said Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright.

The goods come free of charge except for the cost of picking them up.

The {Department of Homeland Security}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/defense/u.s.-department-of-homeland-security-ORGOV0000136-topic.html”> gives more than $1 billion a year to state and local police, much of it for equipment.

This year, the Pentagon program is up for what would normally have been a noncontroversial renewal. An effort in the House to repeal it failed this summer by a lopsided 355-62 vote.

Friday, however, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman {Carl Levin}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/carl-levin-PEPLT003901-topic.html”> (D-Mich.) said the program needed to be reviewed ""to determine if equipment provided by the Defense Department is being used as intended.""

In an age of mass shootings and terrorist threats, with local budgets flat, police chiefs face a huge temptation to fill their arsenals with federal largess, said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation and a former chief in Redlands.

""A lot of departments jumped at the opportunity to acquire things they normally could not afford,"" Bueermann said. But ""just because we can get the equipment, it doesn't mean we should use it.""

In some cases, the pitfalls become quickly apparent.

Last year, the small police department of Banning ordered an 18-ton tank complete with gun turret. A police sergeant was assigned to pick up the vehicle and drive it home. Along the way, he blew a tire on Interstate 10 in southern Arizona, careened across the roadway, totaled a pickup and knocked out the windshield of another vehicle.

No one was injured, but the accident cost Banning $42,000. Angry city officials and residents demanded to know why police needed a tank.

In other cases, departments have acquired equipment they could not afford to maintain. For some armored vehicles, ""a tire can cost $10,000 or $12,000"" to replace, said Mark Lomax, executive director of the National Tactical Officers Assn., a nonprofit group based in Doylestown, Pa., that trains SWAT teams.

Los Angeles Deputy Chief Mike Downing, who oversees counter-terrorism and other special operations, noted in a recent report that police SWAT teams, created in the 1960s, have morphed into military battalions.

Police departments that seek ""to justify their existence and budgets"" often begin using heavy equipment for relatively routine missions such as serving warrants, he said. That has become ""a dangerous and unnecessary temptation.""

Departments need to ask, ""Do we need the type of weapon they are offering?"" said Chris Nanos, chief deputy of the Pima County Sheriff's Department in southern Arizona. ""A 14-ton armored vehicle? I don't know what you would do with that.""

Lack of training and leadership can be as big a problem as excessive equipment, said Ron McCarthy, a former Los Angeles police SWAT team supervisor who now works as a consultant for police departments.

""If you're not going to provide the appropriate training, you shouldn't have the equipment,"" McCarthy said.

Armored vehicles, military uniforms, assault rifles and police dogs escalated tensions in Ferguson, he said, adding that the equipment should have been on standby, out of view, but ready to respond quickly if needed.

Still, he and other police experts said that military-grade equipment has an important role when used properly.

Eugene O'Donnell, professor of law and police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said some critics were ""in denial"" about the need for police to use force.

""This week's story is police overreaction. Next week's story is going to be police under-reaction,"" O'Donnell said.

The events in Ferguson showed that ""there are going to have to be serious strings attached to handing out military weaponry,"" he said. ""There are 18,000 police departments in the U.S., and some of those police departments are scary places indeed.""

But, he said, ""the power of looting and rioting to destroy a city is not to be sneezed at. School shootings and heavily armed people are a fact of life, and, like it or not, terrorism hangs over us.""

Some police departments already have begun rolling back the militarized approach, with the {LAPD}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/law-enforcement/los-angeles-police-department-ORGOV000939-topic.html”> in the forefront.

The turning point came in May 2007, when hundreds of LAPD officers swept through the city's MacArthur Park in a poorly orchestrated, chaotic attempt to clear out a large gathering of immigrant rights protesters. Officers fired scores of rubber bullets and struck protesters with batons as they pushed through park.

After an internal investigation found poor planning and training and ineffective control by commanders, then-Chief William J. Bratton ordered the entire department retrained in crowd-control measures.

Today, the department takes a far more patient approach. Its reworked tactics were on display during the Occupy movement in 2011, when thousands of protesters turned the lawn surrounding City Hall into a tent city. As police in other cities clashed violently with protesters, the LAPD took a hands-off approach.

But the LAPD has been an exception, said Jody Armour, a law professor at USC who studies police use of force.

""Using this equipment tactically, using it sparingly and wisely is a very hard thing to do,"" he said.

""When it's possible to get your hands on something for cheap or even for free that would otherwise be unattainable,"" he said, ""it's hard to say no.""",30,NA,Face-off in Ferguson underscores questions about police use of military-grade arsenals nationwide,NA

Overnight, an angry crowd turned violent after a vigil for 18-year-old Michael Brown, an unarmed man who was fatally shot by a Ferguson police officer Saturday. Police said Brown had struggled with the officer before the shooting. But witnesses and demonstrators have disputed the police account and demanded that the suspended officer be fired and prosecuted.

Employees of the damaged businesses focused Monday on cleaning up and assessing the losses.

Workers hustled to replace Zisser Tire's signature wraparound windows with plywood as evening approached. Looters broke into the store and stole tire rims from the showroom — each of them single display pieces for four-piece sets — and video captured one person using a rim to smash out each of the windows. Looters also entered the back of the store, broke into a gold Escalade and destroyed the dash.

Dennis G. Ferguson, a salesman for the store, told The Times that he had called the owner and debated bringing rifles down to the store as the looters worked their way down Florissant Avenue. Ultimately he decided against it. It was ""too dangerous,"" he said.

Another employee said that even after workers had arrived at the store Monday morning, a stranger came in and stole an {iPad}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/services-shopping/apple-ipad-PRDCES000000029-topic.html”> from the counter. Police caught him.

Ferguson insisted that the looting did not reflect the neighborhood. ""This is a nice community,"" he said, noting that residents had helped protect businesses overnight. ""We had several teenagers come by to see if they could help clean up.""

A few blocks away, workers replaced the shattered glass from a Family Dollar store in a strip mall where a cellphone store and two check-cashing and payday loan companies had been damaged.

At the end of the strip mall, the rioters smashed out the door of the {St. Vincent de Paul}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/religion-belief/christianity/roman-catholicism/vincent-de-paul-PEHST00000329-topic.html”> thrift store.

An alarm company had called store manager Bill Andre at 11:30 p.m. Sunday to tell him that the store's alarm was going off. Andre had been watching the chaos on the news.

""I said, 'I've been expecting your call,'"" Andre said.

When employees got to the store Monday morning, Andre said, ""We were shocked to see such minimal damage.""

No one had stepped a foot inside. There was half of a red brick inside, the weapon that had knocked out the glass door, causing perhaps $1,000 worth of damage. Nothing else in the store of hand-me-down clothes was missing. ""We don't have brand-new shoes to loot,"" Andre said.

But he figures he will wait a couple days to replace the door with new glass. ""We're afraid it'll happen again,"" Andre said.",1,NA,"A convenience store in Ferguson, Mo., was burned down following a vigil for Michael Brown, 18, who was fatally shot by a police officer. ",NA

Seeing that much military-grade equipment, even in a small St. Louis suburb like Ferguson, has highlighted the debate over whether the arming of the nation's police forces has gone too far.

Los Angeles Times correspondents checked in on a handful of police departments around the country to see how the debate affects them.

Seattle

Between May 2010 and March 2014, the Seattle Police Department received a laundry list of equipment from the {Defense Department}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/defense/u.s.-department-of-defense-ORGOV000094164-topic.html”> through its controversial 1033 grant program, gear that Sgt. Sean Whitcomb, the agency's spokesman, accurately labeled ""very boring.""

The department has posted the list, complete with pictures, on its {SPD Blotter website}<hyperlink=”http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2014/08/14/life-vests-tents-a-radiation-detector-and-other-items-purchased-by-spd-through-military-surplus/”>. It includes floatation vests and binoculars, signage and gloves, pistol holders, a radiation detector and rifle sights ""used by the approximately 130 officers who have passed the department's rifle-certification program.""

""We have equipment that we feel is necessary for a city of our size,"" Whitcomb told The Times. ""The equipment we have serves a police purpose. Our No. 1 priorities are protecting people's lives and looking after their well-being. Our second most important is looking after possessions and property.

""The gear that our department employees use ... is primarily defensive in nature,"" Whitcomb said. ""Our equipment is police specific. We don't have any military weaponry. The weapons we do own are specific to our profession. ... No rockets, no predator drones, no cannons, no tanks.""

The department’s SWAT team does use a BearCat - an armored truck for situations where there may be gunfire, Whitcomb said, but such a vehicle is standard operating procedure for modern police departments.

""It's used to get our personnel in and out safely, so we can rescue people and evacuate if necessary,"" Whitcomb said. ""You cannot do that in a sedan. Though we have put some armored plating on the doors in our cars. We also have purchased ballistic shields. It all goes back to the problem of gun violence in our country. ... But ultimately we are a police service. We are not the military.""

On using BearCats, he said: ""If you’ve got a potential for gun violence at a school, university, business complex, mall and you don't have one of these, you’re not providing adequate police services. ... In a post-Columbine era, you are not doing your job if you don't have one.""

Seattle police vehicles no longer automatically carry shotguns. Instead, shotguns and rifles are assigned to officers trained in their use.

""Being more strategic with our equipment,"" Whitcomb said, is ""an absolute good thing.""

The department's tactics have evolved through the years, from the 1999 protests surrounding the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle, in which police response was vilified internationally as heavy-handed and what then-Chief Norm Stamper has described as ""the worst mistake of my career.""

The Seattle Police Department is currently operating under a federal consent decree designed to ensure constitutional policing in Seattle. The {Justice Department}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/u.s.-department-of-justice-ORGOV0000160-topic.html”> began investigating the department in 2011, and reached a settlement with the city in 2012, which led to the federal oversight.

Whitcomb declined to comment on the situation in Ferguson, but he did talk about one measure his police department employs that was sorely lacking during most of the week in the small, troubled Missouri town – transparency.

“We promise to be open and transparent and share information with the public as these things unfold,” Whitcomb said. “So not only are we going to provide the public safety services and respond to these critical incidents, we will explain to you what we’re doing and how we’re doing it.”

Pima County, Ariz.

The Pima County Sheriff’s Department in southern Arizona has been offered free military surplus items from federal officials in the past, Chief Deputy Chris Nanos said Friday.

They’ve taken a few items, such as blankets and warm-weather socks. The blankets have been used to wrap up the bodies of deceased migrants found in the Sonoran Desert, some of which falls in their jurisdiction. The socks are used by volunteers who participate in search-and-rescue missions in the surrounding mountains.

They’ve sent back some items, such as a few standard-issue rifles.

“We found no use for them,” Nanos said. His department is the second-largest law enforcement agency in Arizona, with 1,500 paid personnel and 400 volunteers.

The military-style equipment they do have, such as BearCat armored vehicles, were purchased separately and are rarely used, he said. For instance, he said that while they receive up to 150,000 calls a year for service, they’re SWAT team has responded only about a dozen times.

“The reality is that brute strength is so seldom used and seldom needed,” Nanos said. “What we really need is better communication, the gift of gab, if you will. You need the ability to talk with others. That’s what a good policeman does. That’s what a good cop is. Someone who looks at a problem and finds a way to solve the problem, not just end the problem.”

Nanos said he could understand the willingness of law enforcement agencies to accept free equipment from the government, especially after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Still, he said, “Maybe it’s time to ratchet it back a little bit.”

“As an agency head, I would believe every agency is looking at what they have received ... and have a bit of a review process on that.”

His agency has a review process in place to determine whether they should receive equipment, even when it’s free. Nanos said it was important for local agencies to be skeptical about what they are taking and why they are taking it.

“The review needs to be there,” he said. “A 14-ton armored vehicle? I don’t know what you would do with that. That’s not us. Do we need the type of weapon they are offering? ... It’s really a matter of review and putting common sense into it.”

However, the issue goes beyond what hardware a department may have, Nanos said.

“How we train and who we recruit is even more critical,” he said. “We want them to hit the streets and be well-trained for any adversary, but clearly we want them to be guardians. It’s just that simple.”

Even before Ferguson, Pima County Sheriff’s Department officials debated the militarization of police, Nanos said. It’s especially poignant now.

“Myself, with all my command staff, we are closely watching what is going on in Ferguson,” he said. “In today’s world, Ferguson is just a shame that has to happen to bring this to the forefront. I would wage you that most agency heads in this country are having the same debate — the same conversation I’ve had with my staff or similar debates of balancing the militarization of the departments.”

Nanos, promoted to his current position at the beginning of the year, said he took a step back in January to see what the department could be doing better.

He reviewed their protocols, such as the classroom curriculum for cadets. They've made some adjustments, he said.

There is now less of an emphasis on telling the cadets about the dangers they'll face in the field and instead more of a focus on how to interact with the community.

He said his deputies were trained to be ""guardians"" rather than ""warriors.""

""We want to make sure the mind-set is always right. We expect them to be on top of their game in all areas of police work, and the big one is communication.""

“Our goal is serving the public. It doesn't say policing the public. It doesn't say we're at war with the public. We are public servants. I expect our staff to have the heart for servitude.""

Nanos said how the police department is perceived in the community is also key.

""Sometimes perception is worse than the truth. If we are perceived one way, even if it is not true, you have to do some work on yourself. You have to change that image,"" he said.

Raleigh, N.C.

The police department in Raleigh has purchased only a small amount of surplus military equipment, but no weapons in the last five years, said police spokesman Jim Sughrue. Among the items purchased are two gun cabinets, four spotting scopes, 30 ammunition cans and a graveyard registration kit.

""We practice community policing,"" Sughrue said.

The department emphasizes regular contact with community and civic groups, he said. Its philosophy is to use tactical equipment only in certain specialized situations such as serving drug warrants in cases where suspects are believed to be armed.

The department has a small number of civilian-made armored tactical vehicles, Sughrue said. The vehicles are deployed in situations where members of the public or police force are endangered or ""when we are dealing with people who are known to have been involved in violent felonies or are believed to be armed.""

Patrol officers are armed with sidearms, Sughrue said, though some also carry a backup semiautomatic patrol rifle. Officers have no fully automatic or military weapons, he said.

Like many departments, the Raleigh force recently switched from shotguns to semiautomatic rifles after studies found that the rifles are safer to deploy, Sughrue said. The department does not take part in the Pentagon’s Excess Property Program, known as the 1033 program, which provides surplus military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies.

Sughrue declined to comment on the use of military tactical equipment and weapons in Ferguson.

Nashville, Tenn.

The police department in Nashville has been closely following developments in Ferguson, said Don Aaron, the department’s public affairs manager.

What stands out, he said, is the ""lack of communication to the community and, conversely, to the rest of the country"" by police officials in Ferguson.

Unlike police involved in the Ferguson unrest, the Nashville force has never used its SWAT team for crowd control, Aaron said. The department generally uses its horse-mounted police officers for that purpose.

Nor has the department deployed either of its two armored vehicles - it calls them rescue vehicles - for crowd control, Aaron said. The vehicles are used to rescue civilians or police officers threatened by gunfire.

""You never say never, but we have not used an armored vehicle in a crowd-control situation,"" he said. ""It’s just not the type of situation where you would use that type of vehicle.""

Aaron said the department did not rely on military weapons or equipment, with only a relative handful of items provided by the military.

One armored vehicle was provided by the Air Force years ago. A more modern vehicle, a civilian-made model called a BearCat, was provided about 10 years ago through a {Department of Homeland Security}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/defense/u.s.-department-of-homeland-security-ORGOV0000136-topic.html”> grant, Aaron said.

The department’s SWAT team, which is issued semiautomatic rifles, is deployed primarily in dangerous situations such as hostage rescue, barricaded suspects or an active shooter, Aaron said. A Special Response Team within the SWAT unit carries semiautomatic rifles to serve outstanding felony arrest warrants, often against people wanted for violent crimes.

The department received eight military OH-58 observation helicopters around 1997, Aaron said. Four were repainted and used for police work, and four have been used for spare parts. The force also has 10 boats it received from the military that Aaron said were crucial in helping rescue people stranded during devastating floods in Nashville in 2010.

In January 2013, the Nashville Metropolitan Police Department began allowing officers who undergo training and pass certification tests to carry privately-owned semiautomatic rifles as backup weapons while on patrol. The weapons are not to be used for routine patrol work, Aaron said.

""Deadly events across the United States over the past few years ... demonstrate the high-powered weapons with which criminals are arming themselves,’’ a department news release said at the time. ""It has become increasingly clear that a pistol and a shotgun may not be enough for an officer to stop a threat to innocent civilians.""

The rifles are not intended for crowd control. ""Officers are to retrieve their rifles only when it is clear that a tactical advantage over a criminal suspect is warranted,"" the release said.

Boston

Former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis had proposed ordering hundreds of semiautomatic M16s under the federal surplus program, but the plan was never put in place, said police department spokesman Mike McCarthy.  Boston has not received any surplus military equipment from the Defense Department.

“The sentiment here is that we have a community policing philosophy that we completely buy into, and that means more interaction with the community on a personal level, rather than here’s a show of military force,” McCarthy said.

The department did purchase some rifles through the Department of Homeland Security, but they are given only to SWAT teams, and are utilized only on patrol, he said.

In parades to celebrate the city’s sports teams and in responding to events such as Occupy Boston, “our approach is a soft approach,” McCarthy said. “We don’t utilize officers in military gear or riot gear. We do just the opposite.”

New York City

Alex S. Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College and a senior policy advisor to the Police Reform Organizing Project, looked at police response to Occupy protests, and said that it was frequently small and mid-sized departments that often deployed military equipment.

“Boston, New York, Los Angeles, most of the big cities, did not have the militarized response” to Occupy protesters, he said. “It was the medium and small cities that were in some ways worst offenders.”

Denver, for instance, deployed military equipment it received during the {2008 Democratic National Convention}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/democratic-national-convention-%282008%29-EVHST000038-topic.html”> to break up Occupy protests; Tampa, Fla., police used a tank to break up similar protests.

Because much of the equipment comes from Homeland Security grants, he said, the equipment is spread over nearly every congressional district, city and state.

“You’ve got towns with 100,000 people that have as much hardware as New York City,” he said.

For the police departments, it makes sense to get the equipment - after all, it’s free, and is good for officer morale. But it serves “almost no considerable law enforcement purpose,” he said.

But surprisingly, big cities like New York, Boston and Philadelphia seem to be much less likely to use the military gear, he said. Vitale has written a book about the New York Police Department, “City of Unrest,” but says the {NYPD}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/law-enforcement/new-york-city-police-department-ORGOV0000107-topic.html”> generally uses the equipment only when there’s a legitimate need for it. When the U.N. General Assembly is in session, for instance, a few armored jeeps will be deployed by the U.N. Counter-terrorism officers have assault weapons, but don’t usually parade them around the streets.

Sometimes, though, the department can't seem to help itself: During a recent demonstration near the Israeli Consulate, the NYPD stationed two officers to keep the peace with AR-15s.

The victim was identified by relatives as Michael Brown, who was scheduled to begin college classes Monday, according to the {St. Louis Post Dispatch}<hyperlink=” http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/calm-returns-to-scene-of-ferguson-shooting/article_04e3885b-4131-5e49-b784-33cd3acbe7f1.html”>.

Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, told the {Associated Press}<hyperlink=” http://abcnews.go.com/US”> that she was driving through the neighborhood Saturday afternoon when she saw her grandson running a few blocks from her house.

""He was running this way,"" she said. ""When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.""

A spokesman for the {St. Louis}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/81045908”> County Police Department confirmed to the Associated Press that it was a Ferguson police officer who shot the man, but did not identify the officer and did not immediately give a reason for the shooting.

Calls by The Times to the police were not returned.

Louis Head, Brown’s stepfather, held a sign that said “Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!” the Post Dispatch reported. And Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, said the shooting was “wrong and it was cold-hearted.”

By early Saturday night, dozens of police cars remained parked near the shooting scene as mourners left votive candles at a makeshift memorial in the middle of the street.

At the height of the post-shooting tensions, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents, about two-thirds of whom are black, the AP reported.

The crowd eventually dispersed and police scheduled a news conference for Sunday morning.

LATimes,lat88,http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-michael-brown-obama-trayvon-martin-20140812-story.html,"In Michael Brown case, race rears once again for President Obama",Cathleen Decker,08/12/2014,04/14/2016,"Once more onto the high wire of race for President {Obama}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/barack-obama-PEPLT007408-topic.html”>, once more because a young black man had been shot dead on an American street.

On Tuesday, Obama offered a deliberately worded plea for peace in Ferguson, Mo., where nights of unrest have followed the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old whose life ended in a confrontation with police.

The president termed Brown’s death “heartbreaking” and called on others, as has Brown’s family, to honor his life with nonviolence.

“I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,” Obama said in a statement issued by the {White House}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/white-house-PLCUL000110-topic.html”>. 

“We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.  Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.”

It was thus after the 2012 killing in Florida of {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink”http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/trayvon-martin-PEOCVC000188-topic.html”> by {George Zimmerman}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/george-zimmerman-PECLB0000014809-topic.html”>, who later was acquitted in Martin’s death. It was thus after an earlier altercation between a black university professor and a white cop in Cambridge, Mass., that resulted in the professor's arrest. 

By virtue of his role as president, Obama represents all Americans, including Zimmerman and the unidentified cop in Missouri who fired the most recent fatal shot. By virtue of his birth, he is keenly aware of the punishments often visited on African American boys and men. Even with his public standing weakened by six tumultuous years in office, he remains the American best positioned to explain each side to the other, to try to seed understanding among those still listening.

The measured nature of Obama’s Tuesday remarks may be in part situational—the Justice Department is investigating the death, and he can’t presuppose the results of their inquiry; the facts of the shooting are in dispute; and any more emotional response might threaten to further inflame the passions he sought to tamp down.

It was not hard to imagine that his private view hews closer to his more emotional reactions after 17-year-old Martin was shot dead in a Florida suburb while walking back from a trip to buy Skittles.

In the spring of 2012, shortly after Martin’s death, Obama wrapped him in a familial embrace.

“If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon,” he said, personalizing the death in a way no president before him could have.

And later, after the verdict cleared Zimmerman, Obama {elaborated on the distance}<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHBdZWbncXI”> between white America and black America, particularly when it comes to the experiences of black men. He offered bracing reminders of the small yet significant slights commonly suffered, and how they burn.

“There are very few African American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me,” the president said. “And there are very few African American men who haven’t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happened to me, at least before I was a senator.

“There are very few African Americans who haven’t had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often.”

And, he added, “that all contributes, I think, to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario, that, from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different.”

It wasn’t different Saturday in Ferguson, nor was the aftermath of Michael Brown’s death: the tear-stained anguish of the parents, the national debate, the institutional apparatus of conflict. (The lawyer who represented Trayvon Martin’s family is now representing Michael Brown’s.)

Not much distance had been trod in the two years between the deaths of the two young men, and the country seemed not that much further along in what Obama described in his elaboration last year as “this long, difficult journey.”

“You know, we’re becoming a more perfect union -- not a perfect union, but a more perfect union,” he said.",43,NA,"Another shooting, another presidential plea for understanding",NA

Matt Pearce writes, ""The hands-up — a sign of surrender and submission black men and boys here say they learn early on when dealing with police — has been transformed into a different kind of weapon.""

Times reporter Matt Pearce is at a Ferguson protest this evening and files this dispatch from the street:    

It is, of course, not dark yet — the time that demonstrators have seen repeated spasms of street violence over the last four days in Ferguson.

But compared to previous days, a scene of calm and peace unfolded early Thursday evening as demonstrators met the man newly appointed to police them.

His name is Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson, and his presence was solitary and obvious as a march proceeded through some of Ferguson's worst-hit streets: Johnson is one of the only black police officers to be seen on these streets since unrest began, and he was walking along with hundreds of demonstrators protesting police brutality.

Johnson said he's from Ferguson, attended school in Ferguson, still has family and friends and Ferguson, and he was shaking hands and hugging demonstrators after he stopped at a street corner and watched them past.

One young man with a camera came up to him and began filming as he told Johnson that his niece had been teargassed.

""When you see your niece, tell her Captain Johnson said he's sorry and he apologizes,"" Johnson told him. The man left to rejoin the march — but then doubled back to shake Johnson's hand.

The scene was noticeably mellower than from the night before, when a similar march was met with a line of riot-gear clad police with clubs who were soon backed up by more officers in armored personnel carriers and police armed with assault rifles.

Instead, Thursday, Johnson had only brought a few officers to do traffic control as demonstrators passed.

""None of the officers have gas masks on their belts, I don't have a gas mask on my belt,"" Johnson told reporters who quickly surrounded him after marchers passed. ""Gathering is not an issue for me. We're going to have some barricades... We're going to plan together.""

Then, as demonstrators returned down the street, chanting forcefully for justice for Mike Brown, Johnson strode to the front of the march and paused it to ask a man with a bullhorn where they were going.

""We're going to QuikTrip and we're stopping,"" the man with the bullhorn replied. Johnson patted him on the shoulder — and then turned and started walking at the front of the march, as the demonstrators beside him shouted, ""No justice, no peace!""

Via Matt Pearce and Lauren Raab: In his first public action in Ferguson, Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol joined a  group of protestors marching in front of the QuikTrip, the site of looting and fire Sunday night. 

“I’m not scared to be in this crowd today and that’s why I walked up front,” Johnson told reporters. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered around him. Police stood by in standard uniforms, the riot-gear-clad presence and armored personnel vehicles of the past nights gone. 

Johnson, who took over leading security in Ferguson on Thursday,  said if his officers see groups of 10 or 20 people gathering, they’re “going to go have conversations with them to get a feeling of what is going on.”

“I roam these streets and that isn’t going to change,” he said.

Johnson said he has instructed police to take gas masks off. As long as traffic can move up and down the road and there is no looting, he said he would have no problems with people standing in the streets.

“What I expect tonight is that people will gather,” he said. “People will have conversations. But I don’t expect what we had last night…. Hopefully there’ll be some healing tonight.”

Johnson was born and raised in St. Louis and joined the Highway Patrol in 1987, according to his biography released by the governor’s office. He holds a criminal justice degree and is a graduate of the Northwestern University Traffic Institute School of Police Staff and Command and the FBI National Academy, and he is certified in police instruction and the development of assessment center exercises, it said.

Via Matt Pearce: Among the evolving cast of participants in Ferguson's week of street demonstrations, State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal has been one of its most visible faces.

She says she has been repeatedly tear gassed while demonstrating alongside her constituents and has publicly challenged public officials like Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson over police response to the protests. (On Thursday, she was drawing attention on social media for tweeting ""f---
you"" at Gov. Jay Nixon, calling his reaction to the crisis slow and inadequate.)
Thursday afternoon, Chappelle-Nadal was back at the scene of the protests on the sidewalks of the burned-down QuikTrip, preparing to appear on MSNBC, which has been covering the news in Ferguson extensively. She repeated her criticisms of Nixon, particularly for not coming down to the site of the protests, but was somewhat pleased by some of the day's developments.

""They finally did what they were supposed to do, which is not have a — what do you call that? — a military state in a bedroom community,"" Chappelle-Nadal told The Times. ""The world had to see the violent acts of these police officers for us to get the freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.""

Via Matt Pearce: Tyson Manker, 32, an attorney, former Marine and Iraq veteran from Jacksonville, Ill., said he came to Ferguson to show solidarity with demonstrators who have been squaring off police in recent nights.

And he was doing so in his Marines uniform.

""I don't want to see tanks on American streets, period,"" Manker said, adding: ""The reaction by police is what should be troubling to all Americans... The assaulting of journalists is just a small taste of what these people go through every day.""

 Even with Congress on break, prominent Democrats voiced frustration Thursday at the events in Ferguson, Mo., that, for some, were an all too familiar scene.
“How many more young men of color will be killed before we realize that we have a problem in America?” tweeted Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), the Civil Rights leader who as a young man worked alongside Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.
“This is a good time to consider the words of MLK Jr., who said that ‘Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the presence of justice,’"" he tweeted. He referred to “young people who might have become great artists, leaders, scientists, or lawyers if we offered them our support instead of our suspicion.”
Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, tweeted: “Police officers are supposed to protect and serve, not search and intimidate.” 
“Our hearts ache for the family of Michael Brown and for the entire community of Ferguson, Missouri,” said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader from San Francisco, who called the police response to the protests “deeply troubling.”

Via Lisa Mascaro: 
Several House Democrats, including Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, called for hearings in the House Judiciary Committee to investigate “concerns that local law enforcement is out of control” in Ferguson, Mo.
“The decision to adopt a military posture only served to aggravate an already tense situation,” the Democratic lawmakers wrote to the committee chairman, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.)
It is unclear if the Republicans, who control the House and its committees, will convene a panel. But Democrats may form an unusual alliance with key tea party Republicans who have also criticized the use of military-style hardware on the neighborhood streets of Ferguson.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Thursday criticized the “militarization” of local law enforcement, which he argued has been beefed up by federal spending.Paul’s comments could pose a new rift within the Republican Party, which has long hewed to a more law-and-order stance. But he was backed up Thursday by the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. Heritage, which is influential within the GOP, said that law enforcement needed to scale back its use of military-style hardware and tactics.
Missouri’s Republican Sen. Roy Blunt did not weigh in on that issue, but said he had spoken to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and would “continue to monitor” the situation.
“It's important to remember that this tragedy began when a young man lost his life,” Blunt said, “and I support local and federal officials in their efforts to conduct open, transparent, and parallel investigations into what happened here.”

The events have been organized on Twitter by the hashtag #NMOS14, which stands for “National Moment of Silence.” To identify each other and show solidarity, participants have been told to wear a red ribbon, cloth or bandana on their right arm at the vigils. 

In St. Louis, the vigil will be held at the Gateway Arch. In Los Angeles, a vigil will be held in Leimart Plaza Park, according to the event’s {Facebook page}<hyperlink=“https://www.facebook.com/NMOS14LA”>.

Via Richard A. Serrano: Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. took aim Thursday at the images from Ferguson, Mo. of heavily armed police officers using riot gear and military-style weapons against protesters. 

“I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,” Holder said in a statement released after he briefed President Obama. 
“At my direction, [Justice} Department officials have conveyed these concerns to local authorities.”

Holder said the Justice Department has offered technical assistance to local officials “to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.”

Holder also condemned looters and rioters. “While the vast majority of protests have been peaceful, acts of violence by members of the public cannot be condoned,” he said.

He criticized “willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers,” saying “such conduct is unacceptable.”

Via Maya Srikrishnan- Officers in body armor and carrying assault rifles. Armed personnel carriers. Tear gas and rubber bullets—these have been the tools police in Ferguson have deployed to calm unruly demonstrators in the wake of the police shooting of unarmed Michael Brown. But the machinery common to war is drawing scrutiny from federal and local authorities.  Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement Thursday that he is “deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message” to the community and law enforcement “must seek to reduce tension, not heighten them.”

Holder also said that Ferguson police have accepted the Justice Department's offer of crowd-control help as it continues to investigate the Brown shooting.

Via Maya Shrikrishana: The ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit Thursday morning seeking to obtain copies of initial police reports surrounding Michael Brown’s shooting  after their open records request for the incident report was rejected by police Wednesday. Law enforcement authorities have said details of the investigation  will not be coming any time soon. Civil rights advocates, demonstrators and Brown’s parents have called on police to release the name of the Ferguson police officer, but authorities have said no, citing safety concerns and death threats that have been made to the department.

Police use tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters in Ferguson, Mo.

Via L.A. Times reporter Maya Srikrishnan: Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement Thursday that he is “deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message” to the community.
 
Holder said the Department of Justice is offering technical assistance to control crowds “without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force” – an offer that he said was accepted by local authorities as of this afternoon.

His peers around him struggled to hold jobs and had multiple run-ins with the law, but Brown had graduated from high school and was headed for community college.

And he had another ambition: his music.

Calling himself Big’Mike, he was a prolific amateur rapper, recording solo and duet tracks and posting them online. He even included a phone number where he could be reached, asking for “features and advice.”

Brown's cousin, Daryus Watson, 16, said Brown used to shy away from freestyle rapping with him and that he had learned how to do it in only the last eight months. Brown taught himself, with help from friends, Watson said. The two chatted on Facebook about Brown's growing interest and how he had spent time in a studio matching his lyrics with beats. Brown posted a photo on Facebook showing how he composed his songs, scrawling lyrics on scraps of notebook paper that appear in a pile.

""I write all my lyrics down as I go off the top of my head,"" he wrote.

Many of his tracks were styled as hard-driving “trap” hip-hop, propelled by strong bass-filled beats and lyrics that tapped into familiar musical themes: money, success, drugs and sex. But some showed Brown's more vulnerable side, as he rapped about his love for his stepmother and the manners his grandmother extolled.

Sampling beats, styles and lyrics and rapping alongside fellow amateurs, Big’Mike had more than 150 followers on the SoundCloud page where he showcased his music.

Below are excerpts of his song lyrics and musical clips. Please be advised some of the lyrics contain explicit language and sexual and drug references.

“SMH Luh Vee”

“On my side of town
When the sun go down
You in trouble now”

“Devil get up off my back
I knock you off your feet
Another man down in my city
Why people so petty”

SMH Luh Vee” is the last song posted before Brown’s death. Fellow St. Louis amateur rapper Luh Vee also raps on the song.

“Forgiveness”

“My Pain”

“Feel my pain, feel my pain, my own momma don’t give a damn.”

The White House announced that Obama would return Sunday night for a couple of days to attend meetings, including one with Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. to talk about the discord in Ferguson, Mo. Holder will brief the president on the state of the St. Louis suburb after clashes between protesters and police over the police killing of an unarmed 18-year-old.

Obama will also meet with Vice President Joe Biden and with his National Security Council regarding the violence in Iraq, according to principal deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz.

The departure from this Massachusetts resort island is a rare one for Obama or any president, given that it isn’t triggered by a new emergency.

Obama always travels with a complement of national security advisors and top staffers, and his press secretary is fond of saying that the president is fully operational wherever he goes. He has been getting regular briefings on the developments in Ferguson from senior advisor Valerie Jarrett, an aide said, noting that she is in communication with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and key civil rights leaders including Al Sharpton to stay abreast of the situation.

In addition, Obama has made on-camera statements from his vacation spot over the last week, speaking about Iraq and Ferguson before a traveling group of White House reporters and television cameras. He has also made several phone calls to foreign leaders to talk about the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel.

Still, the president’s vacation retreat in a leafy expanse of the island does not have the same capabilities of the Situation Room, the secure White House headquarters that he uses when serious security briefings are required.

As a political bonus, photographs of Obama in the Oval Office might provide a visual cue that he is still working while Congress is on vacation.  

As the plans stand now, Obama will return to Massachusetts on Tuesday evening and resume his vacation with his family.

If the last week serves as a guide, he’ll be back to dining out with his family and, most likely, shooting a few rounds of golf.",36,NA,Obama back to the office for mid-vacation work break,NA

A cynic might see something nefarious in that.

But academics like {Samuel Walker}<hyperlink=”http://samuelwalker.net/”>, who has long been frustrated by the lack of available data, see something more mundane at play. “It’s just not an urgent issue for them,” Walker says.

It should be. One of the first steps to solving a problem is to identify and quantify it. {Anecdotally, and through media accounts}<hyperlink=”http://www.innocentdown.org/”>, it seems clear that people – particularly African Americans – die in officer-involved shootings often enough to justify concerted efforts at finding fresh approaches.

But absent the data to define the scope, it’s difficult to prescribe solutions. Is racism a significant factor? Or do these deaths stem from {documented tendencies}<hyperlink=”http://myweb.fsu.edu/bstults/ccj5625/readings/terrill_reisig-jrcd-2003.pdf”> by police to be more forceful while working in high poverty, high-crime neighborhoods, which are disproportionately populated by minorities?

Police work can be dangerous, and officers often are forced to make life-and-death decisions in the blink of an eye as they confront people who, in this gun-crazy culture, often are armed. Those who choose law enforcement for a career deserve our thanks, and a certain amount of consideration for the difficult nature of the job. But that shouldn’t extend to turning a blind eye to bad performances, and abuses.

It’s also true that relatively few of the {millions of encounters}<hyperlink=”http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/press/cpp08pr.cfm”> between law enforcement and civilians each year result in physical confrontation, and fewer still in the deaths of the innocent.

LATimes,lat100,http://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-militarized-cops-20140814-story.html,Racial prejudice and militarized cops are a bad mix in America,David Horsey,08/15/2014,04/14/2016,"The killing of a young black man by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., and the subsequent military-style police response to protests has illuminated two very disturbing phenomena. One is older than our republic -- racial prejudice -- and the other is relatively new -- the militarization of America’s cops. 

Generally, I have great sympathy for police. They get stuck dealing with all the bad consequences of our shameful failure to deal with numerous social ills, from mental health to poverty. That being said, here’s what I think about the situation in Ferguson: The police were out of control and did things they would be unlikely to do in a white suburb. 

If the accounts given by numerous eyewitnesses are to be believed -- and the people I’ve seen interviewed seem quite believable -- the fatal shooting of the unarmed 18-year-old black man, Michael Brown, was murder. There was a confrontation of some kind between Brown and the cop who shot him, but the policeman appears to have started shooting as Brown was running away from the situation and failed to stop shooting when Brown turned around and raised his arms in surrender. 

The black community, which makes up two-thirds of the town’s population, reacted with fury and some of the protests devolved into looting. Local police responded as if this was a terrorist attack and, Wednesday night, broke up a peaceful protest with tear gas and rubber bullets. The cops were dressed in military-style riot gear and brandished weapons of war from the back of armored assault vehicles, taking aim at citizens exercising their constitutional rights. 

Luckily, wiser men and women, including President Obama, Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. and Missouri Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/jay-nixon-PEPLT00007680-topic.html"">, spoke up and stepped in to get the police to stop treating Ferguson as if it were a war zone. Nixon put the state highway patrol in charge of the situation and by Thursday night, the people of Ferguson had their streets back.

Over the last few years, the best police departments have adopted community policing methods that have helped strengthen ties to troubled neighborhoods and taught cops smarter ways to handle tough situations. Unfortunately, at the same time, many departments have gotten equipped with heavy-duty armaments that are far better suited to the battlefields of Iraq than to America’s small towns, such as Ferguson. And, once such big toys of battle are in hand, the compulsion to use them is nearly irresistible.

Sen. {Rand Paul}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/government/rand-paul-PEPLT007915-topic.html""> (R-Ky.), giving a libertarian twist to the usual Republican rant against big government, rightly blames the feds for helping turn cops into soldiers. In an essay for Time magazine, Paul wrote, “Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies -- where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.”

Paul also boldly -- boldly for a Republican, that is -- said there is no question that race is a big factor in what has happened in Ferguson. “Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention,” Paul wrote. “Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for nonviolent mistakes in their youth.” 

Whatever stupid thing Michael Brown may have done to provoke the cop who shot him, it is hard to argue that the deadly result had nothing to do with his skin color. Cliven Bundy, the crackpot Nevada rancher who denies the legitimacy of grazing fees on federal land, flouted the law for two decades, then, with the backing of a gang of gun-toting yahoos, confronted police and challenged them to make him obey the law. The authorities backed down, no one got shot and Bundy remains alive and free.

Does anyone think a young black man could do the same thing and get away with it? If you do, you do not understand how far America still has to go to provide equal justice for every citizen. And we are not going to get any closer to that goal by turning our police departments into occupying armies.",99,NA,"Police shooting and protests in Ferguson, Mo., put unequal American justice in the spotlight",NA

The officer who killed Michael Brown will ""probably"" be identified as early as Friday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told the Los Angeles Times.

The release of the name could be delayed by unforeseen circumstances, he said.

Police have been under intense pressure to make known the identity of the officer, but have delayed the release of the information because of what they said were death threats.

""This is one of the instances where the value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family,” Jackson told KDSK television this week.

The refusal was repeatedly cited in public complaints about a lack of transparency in the police investigation of Saturday’s shooting, in which Brown was gunned down after what police said was a struggle that began in the officer’s car.

Several witnesses have said he was shot several times while retreating with his hands raised.

Jackson said he hadn't had a chance to see Thursday night's demonstrations, which were peaceful. He said there had been no reports of problems or arrests.
