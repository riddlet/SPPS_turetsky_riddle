In the case of Ferguson, police were firing rubber bullets, not real ones, along with tear gas and smoke bombs in an effort to tamp down protests and disperse demonstrators who had gathered for a fourth consecutive night Wednesday to demand justice for Michael Brown.

{Michael Brown's Parents: 'Stop the Violence'}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/video/michael-brown-shooting-parents-interview-stop-violence-24948918"">

Brown, 18, was unarmed when he was shot multiple times by a police officer in broad daylight Saturday afternoon, authorities said. The officer has not been identified to the public and he has been placed on paid administrative leave, authorities said. Protesters have demanded he be identified and brought to justice.

The response of the Ferguson and St. Louis County police to the protests has highlighted a growing trend in policing in the United States: police SWAT teams look increasingly like military forces, using military-grade equipment and justifying that use by noting that the public has increasingly-sophisticated weapons themselves.

The distribution of military equipment to local law enforcement began in the 1990s to help agencies fight the so-called war on drugs. It was expanded after 9/11, with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, to help law enforcement fight terror threats, experts said.

An official with the U.S. {Department of Defense}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/department-of-defense.htm""> told ABC News today that last October, Ferguson police received ""non-tactical"" equipment under the so-called ""1033 program"" that included two unarmored Humvees, a trailer and a generator.

The armored vehicle used by Ferguson, and seen in many of the images from Wednesday night, was not given to the town by the DoD, the official said. It was not a military vehicle.

There’s no information yet about what other tactical equipment the Ferguson Police Department may have received, the official said, but a complete list of the equipment provided to St. Louis County by the DoD shows the types of weapons being distributed: six .45-caliber pistols, 12 rifles, two sight reflexes, one explosive ordnance disposal robot, one helicopter, seven utility trucks, three trailers, one motorized cart, one pair of elbow pads, one pair of knee pads, one industrial strength face shield, two night-vision viewers, and computers.

The weapons that Ferguson police are using appear to be non-military issue, the DoD official said, and their camouflage uniforms were likely commercially purchased.

But experts said police equipment and training around the nation have been getting military upgrades. And critics say this can be a problem.

""When you arm police like soldiers and outfit them with military weapons and train them on military tactics and tell them they’re fighting a war, whether it's a war on crime or drugs or looters and rioters, they’re going to start seeing themselves as soldiers, and seeing the people they serve less as citizens with rights and more as potential threats, and that’s what we’re seeing,"" said Radley Balko, author of the book ""Rise of the Warrior Cop"" and a reporter for the Washington Post.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson was asked at a press conference on Wednesday why his department was using military-grade equipment to tamp down unarmed protesters angry over the death of Michael Brown.

""None of that was military equipment, all of the SWAT teams have big vans and that was the city SWAT team and [St. Louis] County SWAT Team,"" he said. When pressed why his department was using armored vehicles and rifles, he countered, ""People are using bombs now, pipe bombs and so forth.""

Since 1990, the federal government has distributed surplus military weapons to town and county police forces under a program known as 1033, through the Law Enforcement Support Office. In 2013, LESO distributed $450 million worth of supplies, including automatic weapons to towns such as Ferguson and counties such as St. Louis, according to a {report from the ACLU}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/report/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-police?redirect=criminal-law-reform/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-police-report""> released this summer.

Other law enforcement personnel, including former Los Angeles Police Chief and current New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton, have defended the equipment as necessary for defending themselves from a more dangerous citizenry.

“I don’t see us as militarizing police,” Bratton told the {Center for Investigative Reporting in 2011}<=""http://cironline.org/reports/local-police-stockpile-high-tech-combat-ready-gear-2913"">. “I see us as keeping abreast with society. And we are a gun-crazy society.”

Balko said that isn't necessarily true.

""There are more guns out there but there’s not much evidence that there’s a problem. The crime rate’s been dropping since 1994, and the Justice Department's done a couple of studies that show the type of gun typically used in a homicide, overwhelmingly, is low caliber handgun,"" Balko said. ""The job of police officer has been getting safer as crime rate has been dropping.""

""What’s happening in Ferguson is a reflection of militarization of policing happening across America,"" said Kara Dansky, senior counsel at the ACLU and the author of the report. ""It's the routine use of paramilitary tactics, using weapons directly from the U.S. military, in towns across America.""

""As we’re seeing in Ferguson, it tends to escalate the risk of violence, makes people less safe, and undermines the public's trust in law enforcement,"" Dansky said.

Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby was asked about criticism about the increased militarization of police forces in the U.S. at a news conference today.

""There is a law enforcement support program that the Defense Department administers which provides to law enforcement agencies around the country surplus military equipment, gear, arms, ammunition, vehicles,"" he said. ""This is a useful program that allows for the reuse of military equipment that otherwise would be disposed of that can be used, again, by law enforcement agencies to serve their citizens.""

""That said, it is up to law enforcement agencies to speak to how and what they gain through this system. And I'm not going to inject the Pentagon into this discussion. How this equipment is used to serve local citizens, again, is up for local law enforcement agencies to speak to,"" Kirby said.",319,2000,NA,NA

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the state's National Guard to be deployed to the city this morning after another violent night of clashes between protesters and police over the shooting death of Michael Brown on Aug. 9. Protesters have demanded that officer Darren Wilson be held accountable for shooting Brown.

The prosecutor's office in St. Louis County, which has jurisdiction in the case, said today a grand jury could begin hearing evidence against Wilson as soon as Wednesday to determine if he will be charged in the shooting.

Obama addressed the volatile situation in Ferguson for a second time in recent days and said he called Nixon about his decision to send in the Missouri National Guard.

""I spoke to Jay Nixon about this and expressed interest that if it was used, it would be in a limited and appropriate way,"" Obama said this afternoon. ""He described the support role they’d be performing and I’ll be watching to see that it’s helping, not hindering, progress.""

Obama also said Attorney General Eric Holder would travel to Ferguson Wednesday to meet with FBI and Department of Justice officials working the case. Holder said today there are more than 40 FBI investigators in Ferguson.

The state National Guard will arrive in Ferguson today to help protect the city's police command center during the protests, while the Missouri Highway Patrol continues to patrol the city.

Nixon order Guard's deployment this morning after protesters allegedly threw Molotov cocktails and fired gunshots at police Sunday night after the state-imposed curfew. Tonight there will be no curfew, Nixon said.

{Tear Gas vs. Molotov Cocktails in Ferguson Protests}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/video/tear-gas-molotov-cocktails-ferguson-protests-24974553"">

The governor later issued a statement saying, ""The Guard's immediate and limited responsibilities... are to provide protection, and ensure the safety of our Unified Command Center, which was the target last night of a coordinated attack.""

Nixon said he signed the executive order after actions by violent protesters Sunday night included ""the firing upon law enforcement officers, the shooting of a civilian, the throwing of Molotov cocktails, looting and a coordinated attempt to overrun the unified Command Center.""

He said the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local police would remain in charge of policing the streets.

In addition, the governor said, ""We will not use a curfew tonight.""

Capt. Ron Johnson said today that he assured people that ""protests will be allowed,"" but he added that he would not ""allowed vandals to impact the safety of this community... or disrupt the soul of this community.""

The police used tear gas Sunday night to clear protesters off the streets of the St. Louis suburb, action that police say was necessary because of shooting, looting and vandalism.

“When we saw violent acts … We had to act to protect lives and property,” Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson said at an early-morning news conference.

The situation “took a very different turn after dark,” Johnson said, deteriorating at 8:25 p.m. with a civilian shooting. Protesters fired at police and threw Molotov cocktails, he said.

Sunday’s clashes continued more than a week’s worth of unrest in Ferguson after the Aug. 9 death of Brown, 18. Activists raised their hands, reflecting reports that Brown had his hands raised when the officer fired.

Police shouted over a bullhorn Sunday, warning the protesters.

They fired tear gas to clear the area.

Some people sprinted away from the gas.

Some protesters stood their ground, however, holding up signs as smoke surrounded them.

Sunday’s clashes come as a preliminary private autopsy shows Brown was shot at least six times, {including twice in the head}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/michael-brown-shot-times-autopsy-shows/story?id=25017247"".

Officials hope that the change in policing and a softer response from the cops will avoid yet another night of clashes between cops and protesters.

Capt. Ron Johnson, the commander of the Missouri State Highway Patrol units who have taken charged of Ferguson's policing, was in the forefront of marchers this evening. At least one woman hugged the captain, according to the Associated Press. That was a sharp contrast to recent nights when marchers were confronted by police with riot shields, smoke grenades and rubber bullets.

Earlier in the day, {Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/jay-nixon.htm""> said that Johnson would now be in charge of policing in Ferguson, which has been roiled by angry protests and heavy handed police response since the Saturday death of Michael Brown, 18, by a Ferguson police officer.

""Immediate security will be directed by the Missouri State Highway Patrol,"" Nixon said today.

He added that the name of the officer accused of fatally shooting Brown should be released and that local officials have the ""methods and abilities to do that."" Ferguson's police chief has withheld the name, citing threats to his safety.

""I would hope that the appropriate release of that name, with the security around it if necessary ... be done as expeditiously as possible,"" Nixon said.

The governor said the streets of Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, have ""looked like a war zone and that's not acceptable. ... Literally, the eyes of the nation are upon us.""

Clashes between protesters and police continued for a fifth night Wednesday, with reports of Molotov cocktails, tear gas and rubber bullets being used.

{Michael Brown's Parents: 'Stop the Violence'}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/video/michael-brown-shooting-parents-interview-stop-violence-24948918"">

Before the shift to state troopers was announced, {President Obama}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/barack-obama.htm"">, as well as state and federal leaders, called for changes in how police deal with protesters in Ferguson.

""I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson,"" Obama said at a news conference. ""There is never excuse for violence against the police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.""

Other leaders also called for what Nixon dubbed ""a different tone.""

“We need to de-militarize this situation,"" Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said today in a written statement. ""This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution. I obviously respect law enforcement’s work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right. Today is going to be a new start, we can and need to do better.”

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder described some of the changes the Department of Justice deployed in Ferguson today to calm tensions.

“At my direction, the department is offering ... technical assistance to local authorities in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force,"" Holder said in a written statement. ""The local authorities in Missouri have accepted this offer of assistance as of this afternoon.

“Department officials from the Community Relations Service are also on the ground in Missouri to help convene law enforcement officials and civic and faith leaders to plot out steps to reduce tensions in the community,” Holder added.

Nixon, a Democrat, had hinted earlier in the day to a group in a church about forthcoming ""operational shifts"" to allow greater tolerance for protest in an effort to restore calm.

""We also need to allow folks who want to express their energy in an appropriate way that absolute right to do that, because we will not get the healing that we all need if the only response from the public is, 'Y'all just be quiet,'"" Nixon said. ""There is a certain level of emotion that needs to be expressed in order for us to reach a higher plane.""

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said today that there have been some minor injuries during recent protests, including a police officer who was hit with a brick, but he added, ""Right now, I'm at least happy that nobody's gotten seriously injured.""

He confirmed this morning that there will be discussions throughout the day about changes to police protocols during the rest of the protests.

""The tactical units will be out there if firebombs start getting thrown, property is being destroyed, shots are being fired. We have to respond to deadly force,"" Jackson said.

Today, New Black Panther members held a march in the St. Louis suburb, and other protests were expected.

The FBI had issued a warning to police officers that a Black Panther leader was trying to incite violence against law enforcement in Ferguson, the bureau confirmed to ABC News.

The FBI warned about the presence in the area of Chawn Kweli, who it identified as the chief of staff of the New Black Panther Party, Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis FBI field office, told ABC News. The FBI alert was not publicly released but was circulated among law enforcement groups as an officer safety warning.

Obama today also spoke out against the arrests of two reporters on the job in Ferguson Wednesday night.

""Police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs,"" the president said.

Obama first addressed the issue on Tuesday when he released a statement saying that {Department of Justice}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/justice-department.htm""> was investigating Brown's death alongside local officials.

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" he said as he took time off from a vacation in Martha's Vineyard. ""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.""

Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson today defended his department's use of rubber bullets and tear gas to quell protesters.

""There are complaints about the response from some people, but to me, nobody got hurt seriously, and I’m happy about that. I’m happy that nobody got hurt,"" Jackson said at a press conference today. Earlier he told ABC News the police had only used tear gas and rubber bullets when protests had turned violent on recent nights.

Jackson also defended the use of riot gear being used by the officers as necessary to protect police from what he said was a trend around the country of increasingly dangerous street weapons. The Associated Press reported that some people threw molotov cocktails at officers tonight.

""None of that was military equipment. All the SWAT teams have big vans with that. People are using bombs now, pipe bombs and so forth,"" he said before tonight's clashes.

Earlier today Jackson asked protesters to remain peaceful during their gatherings and to disperse before nightfall, but said there was no curfew in place.

""We ask that any residents wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner,"" a statement from the police department said. ""We further ask that all those wishing to demonstrate or assemble to disperse well before the evening hours to ensure the safety of the participants.""

Despite the chief's urging that gatherings disperse before sundown, another vigil was held for Brown's supporters. Before that, Jackson planned to march with civil rights leaders as a show of support to them.

The shooting death of Brown has angered the town, with many residents demanding a full, transparent investigation into why an officer fired multiple shots at an unarmed teenager. Brown's family, the NAACP, and the Rev. Al Sharpton have all demanded the police identify the officer involved.

Jackson was adamant, however, that he would not release the name of the officer who shot Brown due to concerns for the officer's safety. Even if Brown's family began to take legal steps to have the name made public, ""there's the appeal process,"" Jackson told ABC.

Brown's parents' attorney, Benjamin Crump, told ABC News today that the family was still deciding whether to sue the department to force the release of the officer's name.

Jackson said today that the name of a different officer had been circulated on social media as the identity of the shooter, and Jackson had to move that officer and his family out of Ferguson to protect them. Jackson himself has received death threats, including a ""nice young woman's voice"" telling him ""I want you to die.""

The {FBI}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/federal-bureau-of-investigation.htm""> is investigating Brown’s death. The shooting happened following a fight with the officer, police said. Witnesses say the officer shot after Brown raised his hands.

The officer who shot Brown has been placed on administrative leave.

Jackson said today that St. Louis Count police were waiting until they had spoken to all of the witnesses of the incident before releasing any details about the shooting, the number of bullets fired and where on the body they hit.

Jackson also noted that Wilson was ""treated for an injury.""

We were one of the main groups protesting. We’ve been out here every night. And everyone kind of rallies behind us. So as long as I keep the camera going, and I’m not rioting, and I’m not looting, then everyone knows that that’s not us.”

Since he started posting photos and short clips of rallies and clashes on Instagram last week, Haiku’s following went from 300 followers to almost 8,000. He also regularly uses Facebook and Twitter.

“Really my primary goal on social media was to show initially the amount of, the extent of force that the police were using against us. I mean, tear gas, they’re shooting us with rubber bullets, they come at us in riot gear,” he said. “Once we started getting in the encounters with the police where we were getting tear-gassed and things like that, it needed to be documented.”

[instabegin https://www.instagram.com/p/rs4uIvoXgF/ instaend]

Haiku said he wanted to document what was happening in Ferguson because he wanted to show that many of the protesters are peaceful. Many activists have taken to marching with their hands raised as a symbol of support for Brown, based on initial witness reports that the unarmed teen had his hands raised when the officer fired.

“The first night of protesting, actually, not even protesting, we were rallying at a memorial for [Brown],” he said. “Candles were lit, people had their hands up, signs. Everyone came in peace. For some reason the police decided to stand and provide a blockade against us, and not let us move forward. That riled the crowd up tremendously.”

Saturday night--hours before the state-mandated curfew was put in place--Haiku said he believed it would help things calm down.

“Honestly feel like it was a good idea, because again, I’ve been out here almost all day every day. I haven’t slept because I’ve been out here responding to different calls about fires, looting, violence,” he said. “When they announced the curfew my initial thought was that everyone was going to follow the curfew. Once I got out here and really the consensus was that no one was going to be following the curfew.”

Saturday, 11:49 p.m. – 9 minutes before curfew – Haiku had just left a meeting with protesters who were planning to stay out.

“I already know that the police are on stand-by because we actually left to have this meeting about what we were going to do, and they had different areas blocked off when we tried to come back,” he said. “My phone is blazing off the hook. I got people telling me ‘Let’s go!’”

On Sunday, Haiku hit the streets again, and came across more protests, one of which he said felt more like a block party.

“Earlier in the morning in the daylight, people were out here protesting you know but right now you’ve got a lot of partying,” he said. “I’m starting to get the feeling from a lot of people you know that are here for their own agenda and coming out with signs of their own Twitter address and you know their shirts promoting something and they’re passing out flyers for this and that … and it’s not – they’re starting to forget what the cause is.”

“The reason that we’re out here is because this is the scene where the execution of Mike Brown took place and we want justice, we want his killer arrested,” he added. “I don’t get that feeling from a lot of people out here, it just doesn’t have that protest feeling.”

[instabegin https://www.instagram.com/p/r0affeIXnL/ instaend]

Sunday was also the day the results of Brown’s private autopsy were released, {revealing that he had been shot six times}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/michael-brown-survived-shots-shot-killed/story?id=25017247> by officer Darren Wilson. Even still, Haiku thought protesters would heed the curfew on Sunday night, more so than they did Saturday night.

“I think the police have established that they are not bluffing about curfew so I don’t think there’s going to be as much of a turnout after midnight tonight like there was last night.”

Sunday evening, as the second midnight curfew approached, Haiku documented police gathering to prepare for another night of violent clashes.

“It looks like the police are positioning themselves to block off West Florence once again--it looks like they’re trying to clear everybody off of these side streets, give them some time to do that before they actually block it off.”

{And clashes between police and protesters did break out}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/photos/powerful-scenes-ferguson-missouri-24953212/image-33008393"">. While marching peacefully Sunday, Haiku met up with a friend, who was fresh from a standoff with police.

Haiku said he will not stop documenting the protests on the streets of Ferguson.

“I’m going to stand with the people,” he said. “I’m going to stand with the people because it basically is going to boil down to the police, who have been excessive, and they don’t care about me, because they’ve already gassed me, they’ve already shot people standing next to me, so if it comes down to choosing sides I’m choosing the people.”

Images of the police clashing with protesters have highlighted the racial tensions in the town. Many of the protesters are black, while the police force is nearly entirely white.

The police department has three black officers and 47 white officers, or about 6 percent black officers, according to the Ferguson police chief. The city of Ferguson, meanwhile, is about 68 percent African American, according to {U.S. Census data}<hyperlink=""https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=29:2923986"">.

Brown, 18, was shot multiple times by the unidentified officer, police said. His body lay slain on the sidewalk for hours as first Ferguson police and then the St. Louis County Police Department processed the scene, drawing immediate criticism aimed at the police for not removing his body more quickly.

Though the St. Louis County PD has taken over the investigation into the shooting, Ferguson police have been on the forefront of clashes with protesters in the days since Brown's death. They have been criticized by Brown's family, as well as the Rev. Al Sharpton and NAACP leaders, for not naming the shooting officer and for their heavily-armed response to protesters.

On Sunday night, violence erupted in Ferguson after the protests, as some individuals vandalized and looted stores, set fires and vandalized patrol cars. Protests resumed Monday night and Tuesday night without looting, but Ferguson police continued to fire rubber bullets and tear gas into crowds of demonstrators as they instructed everyone to go back to their homes.

One of the demands of protesters this weekend, printed on a flier handed out to crowds, was for a police force that more accurately represents the racial makeup of the community.

Protesters said that blacks have long been targeted by police.

""We have to stick together because we are targets,"" Robert Bredfford, an African-American 26-year-old, told the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-ferguson-teen-struggled-over-officer-s-gun-before-being/article_f9d627dc-e3c8-5bde-b2ab-7f0a3d36a083.html""> at the protests on Sunday.

""There’s a lot of talk about mentoring. I’m going to be working with the U.S. Justice Department community relations people to improve relations between the community particularly the young black males,"" Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told ABC News following the unrest.

Statistics from the {state attorney general back up that claim}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-ferguson-teen-struggled-over-officer-s-gun-before-being/article_f9d627dc-e3c8-5bde-b2ab-7f0a3d36a083.html"">, showing that in 2013, police pulled over black drivers 4,632 times and white drivers 686 times. Even after accounting for the difference in the number of black residents and white residents living in the city, blacks are pulled over at a 37 percent higher rate.

The data also show that blacks were twice as likely to be searched and arrested and African Americans in Missouri were 66 percent more likely to be stopped by police in 2013, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

But those numbers have to be taken in the context of the region, according to criminal justice expert David Klinger, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri at St. Louis.

""This area is surrounded by areas with a higher concentration of black population than the city, so when we do an analysis we need to look at that whole area. It's entirely possible that what is going on here is that it's not just residents [being pulled over],"" Klinger said.

""The real issue is not who gets stopped, unless there is evidence showing that they are stopping black people in a disproportionate number, but how are the stops being conducted?"" Klinger said.

The Ferguson Police Department does not have a record of racial profiling or transgressions. But the NAACP has an active complaint against the St. Louis County Police Department, according to the St. Louis Post Dispatch. But Klinger said that the St. Louis metropolitan area is on par with other cities in terms of relations between white police officers and black residents.

""To my knowledge there’s nothing more than the standard tensions in policing. I could be missing something but I’m unaware of any civil disturbance, on a large scale. Certainly nothing like the Los Angeles riots,"" he said.

The Ferguson Police Department and police union did not respond to requests for comment by ABC News. The Missouri state Fraternal Order of Police also did not respond.

""Any time you have any population that is relatively deprived, for lack of a better term, and has fewer resources, there’s going to be resentment,"" Klinger said. ""Unfortunately these types of communities have higher crime, so these communities will have a higher police presence because good people need more protection from knuckleheads,"" he said.

""My understanding is there’s nothing out of round in my current community as opposed to Los Angeles or New York or Washington, D.C.,"" he concluded. ""It goes with the territory that there's going to be some tensions.""",149,803,NA,NA

The demonstration had been peaceful until night fell, but then the marchers became more raucous, and police responded with armored vehicles, officers in riot gear, and periodic volleys of smoke and tear gas.

Protesters have vowed to continue marching until charges are filed against the officer who police say shot Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old who was killed Aug. 9.

Michael Brown's Family Hosts Rally to Remember Teen Shot by Cop

A rally at a church in Ferguson today was ""about standing up for our children,"" an attorney for the 18-year-old's family said.

""We're here to talk about standing up for our children, because if we don't stand up for our children, nobody will stand up for our children,"" attorney Benjamin Crump said.

The rally held at the Greater Grace Church was an attempt to bring the community together after the shooting of Brown last weekend, according to fliers distributed to Ferguson residents.

It was hosted by the parents of Michael Brown, but the two did not speak to the hundreds of people who gathered in the church. They took the stage with their lawyers, who spoke to the crowd.

Missouri Highway patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who is now overseeing security in the town, offered an apology for Michael Brown's death.

""I say that I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I wear this uniform and I should stand up here and say that I'm sorry.""

Ty Pruitt, Brown's cousin, spoke out against the police's release of a video allegedly showing the 18-year-old robbing a store shortly before he was shot. The release of the video has been criticized as an attempt to attack Brown's character.

""He was a human being, he was a younger cousin, he was a son. He was a uncle, a nephew. He was not a suspect,"" Pruitt said. ""He was not an object. He was not an animal. But that's how he was killed.""

The Rev. {Al Sharpton}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/al-sharpton.htm"">, Martin Luther King III, and Pastor Jamal H. Bryant of the Empowerment Temple also spoke.

The rally is also hosted by Sharpton's National Action Network and The National Bar Association.

Brown's family also hired forensic pathologist Michael Baden to conduct an autopsy.

""We were unaware that they were going to release it and we certainly were not happy with that being released. Especially in the way that it was it appeared to, you know, cast dispersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street,"" Nixon said.

Rallies for Michael Brown Outside Ferguson Turn Violent

A peaceful rally to protest police violence in the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting last week turned into a violent demonstration after businesses in parts of Oakland and Berkeley, Calif., were looted.

Vandals spray painted storefronts and smashed windows, {according to ABC affiliate KGO}<hyperlink=""http://abc7news.com/news/oakland-march-turns-to-vandalism/266065/"">.

""They started throwing rocks at the buildings,"" Will Kreber, who owns a game store business, told KGO. ""I understand their anger, but I don't know if this is the right way to go about expressing it.""

Oakland police say one officer was assaulted and two other officers were pepper-sprayed during the riot.

Mark Davis, a bakery owner, says looters are unfairly targeting innocent businesses.

""I don't think they think of consequences. Their solution is to punish people who have nothing to do with it. We're thousands of miles away from it, Missouri, but I've got to pay $700 for a window to be replaced,"" said Davis.

Reporters asked Dotson whether the officers should have used lethal force in this situation given the tensions in the area over Brown's death.

""Our policy is at the end of the day the officer should be able to go home, so (he should use) the amount of force necessary to overcome resistance. If a person is charging you within 3-4 feet that’s a lethal range,” Dotson said.

Police aggression. Detention of journalists. A call for respect for minority populations. They’re the type of issues the United States is usually scolding other countries about. This time, however, the criticism is coming the other direction.

Iran’s Grand Ayatollah tweeted about the “brutal treatment” of black people in the United States using the #Ferguson hashtag, China’s official mouthpiece wrote about America’s “human rights flaw,” and the Egyptian government called for “restraint and respect for the right of assembly and peaceful expression of opinion.”

The condemnation is not only limited to countries who may be gloating about the chance to slam the United States about its internal affairs for a change.

On Monday, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, through a spokesman, called on authorities “to ensure that the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are protected.”

“He calls on all to exercise restraint, for law enforcement officials to abide by U.S. and international standards in dealing with demonstrators,"" Stephane Dujarric, the spokesman said.

Amnesty International, the global human rights organization, said it had sent observers to Ferguson. It’s the first time the group has deployed such a team within the United States.

The killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer, and the police response to the protests that followed have raised tough, and for many Americans often uncomfortable, questions about the militarization of police, the treatment of press, and brought simmering racial tensions to the front burner.

Yet they have also afforded America’s foes the opportunity to point their fingers at the country that holds itself up as the beacon of freedom, justice and equality.

The United States has frequently denounced Iran’s suppression of dissent, including violent responses to political protests in recent years. But Iran’s Supreme Leader said the Ferguson violence was an example of American hypocrisy about human rights.

“Today like previous years, African-Americans are still under pressure, oppressed and subjected to discrimination. #Ferguson,” a Twitter account attributed to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, wrote on Sunday.

“Racial discrimination is still a dilemma in the U.S. #Ferguson,” he added. “Look at how US govt treats black community! It's not about 50-100 years ago but it's about today!”

Egypt, a country that has been criticized by the U.S. and others for its brutal police response to the Arab Spring uprising and persecution of minority sects, also weighed in.

The Foreign Ministry reportedly said it was “closely following the escalation of protests” in Ferguson and called on authorities to show “restraint.”

China’s official Xinhua news agency published a commentary saying that Ferguson is an example of how “racial divide still remains a deeply-rooted chronic disease that keeps tearing U.S. society apart.”

“The Ferguson incident once again demonstrates that even if in a country that has for years tried to play the role of an international human rights judge and defender, there is still much room for improvement at home,” the commentary said.

The Russian government, which rarely misses an opportunity to criticize the United States these days, has not said anything official about the Ferguson unrest, but RT, the Kremlin-funded network, has covered the protests closely.

Some opposition figures in Russia have lamented that the police response in Ferguson will give President Vladimir Putin, who often uses Western precedents to justify his own actions, an excuse the next time he wants to crack down.

“Dear American gvrnmnt [sic],you can't imagine how those who fight for freedom in Russia hate you these days. Putin saw this,” Maria Baronova, an activist who was arrested and jailed during an anti-Putin protest in 2012, wrote on Twitter.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Marie Harf responded to criticism from countries with mixed human rights records over the heavy-handed tactics of police in response to the Ferguson protests.

""When we have problems and issues in this country, we deal with them openly and honestly. We think that’s important, and I would encourage the countries you named particularly to do the same thing,"" Harf said, responding to a reporter who asked about reactions coming from countries including Egypt, China, Russia and Iran.

She rejected ""any sort of comparison"" between the U.S. urging Egypt not to jail journalists and opposition protesters and U.S. authorities’ handling of the protests in Ferguson.

“I clean up the streets for about three hours during the day. I don’t want to be around that area at night because of the tear gas being fired at the riots,” Dupree said.

“It was just horrific. There was more broken glass than I’ve ever seen in my life,” Dupree said. “I even saw bullet shells.”

Dupree said the police officers she encountered this morning were “kind-hearted,” although she said that in the past she has met officers who have been ""racist.""

Angela Tate, a counselor and director of the region’s Behavioral Health Response, said her 14-year-old daughter keeps asking over and over what exactly is going on.

“Her questions [are], ‘How long is this going on.’ She wants to go back to school,” Tate said. “Her questions haven’t been the deeper-thought level questions. It’s been more on the surface is what happens first and what happens next.”

Tate’s daughter is just one of 11,000 students in the Ferguson-Florissant school district who remain unable to go to school because of the protests. The district has postponed school twice since the protests began, meaning thousands of children have been left without their normal day-to-day routine.

The delayed school date is more than a minor annoyance because it can create more stress for young students already living through stressful and new event, some experts say.

Dr. Alan Kazdin, a professor of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale University, said an everyday routine is key to keeping down stress levels.

""Routines and rituals help keep a lid on anxiety,” Kazdin said. “You can’t reason a person out of these things.”

Tate said her daughter didn’t talk too much about her fears surrounding the situation, until a window was broken at a store next to Tate’s husband’s barber shop.

“’Is Daddy’s shop still safe?’” Tate recalled her daughter asking. “We have responded to her by watching the news reports together but not too much because that can become overwhelming. We can watch it once a night and try to talk to the facts. “

Tate said her goal has been to support her daughter but also be transparent with her if she does not know the answer to a question and to be clear it is ok to feel scared, afraid or unsettled.

“We talk about normalizing these emotions and the effects of this type of trauma,” Tate said.

Kazdin said monitoring how much children -- both teens and younger ones -- are exposed to events, either on TV or in person, is key in helping them feel safe and calm.

“Many children during September 11 [terrorist acts] had post-traumatic stress symptoms and it was perplexing,” Kazdin said. “They had no contact with September 11[events.] It turns out it was related to the amount of TV they watched [of events.]”

Carolyn Landis, a psychiatrist and professor of pediatrics at the UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, said parents can frame the scary events happening outside in a more positive manner to make children feel safe and secure.

“They can be anxious about going back to school and now there is unrest,” Landis said. “Definitely with younger children [parents should] be very careful about having a TV on because [of] nightmares. What they’re exposed to is what they’re going to be dreaming about, try to be as positive as possible.”

Gayle Babcock of the Ferguson Youth Initiative said she has heard from parents that young children have been unable to sleep after seeing or hearing violence in their neighborhood or on the television.

“As an adult I’m traumatized; most of the kids are [too,]” said Babcock, who works mainly with teenagers in the area as part of a traveling youth center. “The kids are saying the police need to talk to youth and need to hear them. The youth are not bad just because they’re teenagers.”

Both Tate and Babcock are working to provide young people and children in the community with access to counselors or other resources so that they don’t feel overwhelmed. Tate has been going to rallies with other counselors to talk to families or teens.

The St. Louis County Children’s Service Fund is planning to send an additional 25 counselors to the school district when classes start, effectively doubling the amount of counselors available to students.

While younger children may be without a clear schedule because of the protests, older teens have had the opportunity to participate in large daily protests likely for the first time. Amy Hunter, director of Racial Justice at the YWCA in St. Louis, said she has talked to many of the younger protesters, some of whom are the same age as her teenage children. She said she has found signs of hopefulness among the protesters, in addition to their anger over the death of Michael Brown.

“For many of the young people it’s one of the first times to have their voice and have their voice heard,” Hunter said. “This is how social movements change forever. I think a lot of the older middle-aged people are encouraging them to have their voices heard in a nonviolent way.”",92,537,NA,NA
ABC,abc18,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/unanswered-questions-fuel-anger-ferguson/story?id=24978751,How Unanswered Questions Can Fuel Anger in Ferguson,Gillian Mohney,08/14/14,04/05/17,"Unanswered questions surrounding the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, will continue to fuel anger among protesters, experts warned today as the state’s Governor called for the identification of the officer involved in the shooting.

Michael Brown, 18, was allegedly shot and killed by an unnamed Ferguson Police officer Saturday. While police say there was a struggle, witnesses have said that Brown had his hands in the air when he was shot.

The Ferguson Police department has faced mounting criticism from protesters for not releasing the name of the officer involved and details about the events that led to the fatal encounter.

“Information itself is power,” Dr. George Everly, a psychologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, told ABC News. “It’s a powerful [pacifier]. It’s better than putting {valium}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/lifestyle/health/benzodiazepine.htm""> in the water.”

Knowing details about a traumatic event can help a community feel more secure, Everly said. Without those details, Everly said people start to create their own narratives that can sometimes be more negative than the truth.

“If the leader isn’t speaking, then the community is,” said Everly. “They get angry at the lack of information. They think you’re concealing something.”

Deana Rohlinger, associate professor at the Department of Sociology at Florida State University, said without clear information or open dialogue protesters will remain angry as they don’t have a reason to trust authority figures.

“You have a dead young man and people want to understand why and how [this happened] and how are you going to move forward,” said Rohlinger. “It’s an emotional feedback loop. You keep fueling this moral outrage.”

Protesters continue to demand the name of the officer involved in the shooting, but the Ferguson Police Department has not yet released the information citing safety concerns for the officer and his family.

“We've been getting death threats as a result to that officer,” Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told reporters on Tuesday. “It's too volatile and dangerous. We think that the value of releasing his name is far outweighed by the safety at this point.”

Everly said there are good reasons to withhold information from the public, and that threats to an officer’s safety is likely one of them. But he warned that officials need to be proactive about providing information in situations of heightened emotion.

“People are asking these questions and you need to at least get out in front of them,” he said. “[You can say,] ‘This is what you’re wondering and this is why we can’t reveal that information at this point in time’… That in itself is providing information.”

Even without releasing a name, Everly said the police department could help accommodate some of the protesters' requests for more details and give a clear timeline for when the name will be made public. If they stonewall, he said the situation is more likely to escalate as protesters become increasingly frustrated.

“People are going to fixate on things. This is where leadership needs to understand human dynamics,” said Everly. “They will fill in their own blanks. They will fixate on that in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.”

In a press conference today, Gov. Jay Nixon called the release of the officer’s name “an important milestone” in the investigation and said there are “methods and abilities” to do it safely.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Michael Brown’s parents, said the lack of information was affecting confidence in the police force.

""This doesn't give the community confidence,” he said a press conference Tuesday. “It doesn't illustrate transparence or convince the community that the police aren't going to sweep this under the rug.”",46,412,NA,NA

The St. Louis County prosecutor said today that a grand jury is expected to begin hearing evidence Wednesday in the Ferguson shooting. Wilson will be offered an opportunity to testify before the grand jury, said Edward Magee, spokesman for the prosecutor's office.

Wilson has been a police officer for six years, the last four with the Ferguson Police Department. His chief said that Wilson's record has no disciplinary incidents.

""When I first heard [Wilson identified as the shooter] I didn’t believe it. I thought it was a mistake in all honesty,"" his friend said. ""I can never imagine him shooting anybody, even as a police officer.""

""He did not have a temper,"" even during the rough checking on the hockey rink where fights are common. ""Always just on an even heal. Really laid back.""

The angry descriptions of Wilson by protesters don't match the person that he knows, the friend said.

""I feel like maybe he’s been unfairly portrayed as a villain definitely. He was just doing his job and he was put in a bad situation where he had to make a decision that nobody really wants to make,"" the friend said.

Wilson's friend said he feels bad for the families of both Wilson and Brown.

""The whole situation is a tragedy for both Michael Brown and his family, and Darren and his family. Both of their lives are ruined,"" he said.

Wilson's spirits were buoyed by friends who organized a benefit for him, the friend said.

""Just knowing that people are behind him and aren’t as quick to jump to conclusions as everybody else I think is what means the most to him,"" the friend said.

""I don’t know if true justice can ever really be served. But I hope that some sort of change comes from this. Maybe police officers wear body cameras so no question as to what happened. I hope Mike Brown’s family finds peace somehow, if that’s possible,"" the friend said.

But Nixon rejected responsibility for failing to quell the ongoing unrest in Ferguson.

""I've been here almost every day,"" he said. ""The bottom line: we've been focused on meeting with groups, meeting with the parents, making sure that we were set up and then taking the unprecedented action on Wednesday to replace and to bring in the Highway Patrol.""

Nixon declared a state of emergency in Ferguson on Saturday and imposed a curfew following days of protests that erupted after unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer, who was identified Friday as Darren Wilson.

During his interview on ""This Week,"" the governor revealed that the state was caught off-guard by the Ferguson Police Department's decision to release surveillance video of Brown during an alleged store robbery on the same day they named the officer responsible for his death.

""We were unaware that they were going to release it and we certainly were not happy with that being released. Especially in the way that it was it appeared to, you know, cast dispersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street,"" Nixon said.

The security footage, which police said showed Brown allegedly committing a robbery at a convenience store just minutes before his death, reignited civil unrest in the town over the weekend. The Police Department claims that they were obligated to release the tape because of requests made by journalists under Missouri's ""Sunshine,"" or freedom-of-information law, despite the Department of Justice and federal investigators opposing its release.

An attorney for the Brown family, Anthony Gray, who also appeared on ""This Week,"" said the family was disturbed by the release of the surveillance video.

""Well, they first of all they were very appalled by it,"" Gray said. ""They saw it for the first time, at least a glimpse of it, on nationwide TV. They had requested an opportunity through the attorneys to see any video footage before it was released. That request obviously was not honored. So quite naturally, the reaction was very, on the part of the family, they were very disturbed by it. And I would just point out that no one from the family was given the opportunity to even authenticate that that was actually Mike Brown Jr. in the video.

""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender,"" the statement said.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said he could not release the police report of Brown's shooting because the county police had taken control of that investigation.

He defended his release of the robbery reports said that he had no choice.

""I released the videotape to you because I had to. I’ve been sitting on it... but too many people put in (Freedom of Information) requests,"" Jackson told reporters today.

Among the 19 pages of reports in the police packet released today was a report written by the police officer who responded to the 911 call regarding the store robbery. That officer watched a store surveillance video of the theft. He also responded to a report of Wilson's fatal confrontation with Brown.

""It is worth mentioning that this incident (the store robbery) is related to another incident,"" the officer wrote. ""In that incident Brown was fatally wounded... I responded to that scene and observed Brown. After viewing Brown and reviewing the video, I was able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect in this incident.""

The chief made clear, however, that Wilson's confrontation with Brown was not prompted by the report of the store's robbery. Jackson said his officer's contact with Brown began because Brown ""was walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.""

Below is a moment by moment description of what happened on Aug. 9 according to reports by the Ferguson police department and statements made today by Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson:

11:48 a.m. - Wilson was on a ""sick call"" where an ambulance had been summoned. Details of the sick call were not released.

11:51 a.m. - Police receive a 911 call from a convenience store on W. Florissant Avenue that reported ""stealing in progress.""

The officer's report said that the suspect identified throughout the report as Brown ordered several boxes of Swisher Sweet cigars. As the boxes were stacked on the counter, the suspect handed one of the boxes to his friend identified as Dorian Johnson. When the store employee asked to be paid, the suspect ""reached across the counter and grabbed numerous packs of Swisher Sweets and turned to leave the store,"" the report states.

The employee came out from behind the counter and tried to lock the door and stop the suspect from leaving. The suspect ""grabbed REDACTED by the shirt and forcefully pushed him back in to a display rack,"" the officer's report states. The suspect left the store, but returned ""and advances on REDACTED. Brown towers over REDACTED appearing to intimidate him,"" the officer wrote.

During the confrontation between the suspect and the store employee, Johnson put back on the counter the box of cigars that he had been holding.

People could be seen carrying hubcaps out of an auto supply store. A shoe store also was looted, with police swarming into the store's parking lot. A QuikTrip convenience store was overrun, with people grabbing items and running out of the store, glass shattered and items strewn about the sidewalk.

A fire later broke out, destroying the QuikTrip store.

Other witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows in the St. Louis suburb.

Police in riot gear stood on the street, trying to keep the situation under control. Police dogs were also brought to the area.

The protests followed a candlelight vigil for Brown, who wasn’t armed when he was shot Saturday. At the vigil, people placed candles, flowers and a teddy bear at the exact location where Brown was killed. One group of young men broke off to spray paint ""R.I.P. Michael"" on the street.

Demonstrators held their hands up in protest -- reflecting a witness’s statements that Brown had his hands up when he was shot by police.

“No justice, no peace,” demonstrators yelled.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie A. Dooley called for a peaceful dispersal following Sunday’s protests.

“Just need people to keep calm and [disperse] so no one gets hurt,” Dooley wrote.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after an officer encountered two people -- one of whom was Brown — on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson.

Belmar said a struggle began inside the officer’s squad car and spilled into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Police later said at a news conference that they “cannot say” how many times the unarmed teen was struck.

""Was the other subject, the deceased, the 18-year-old, armed with a handgun or rifle or any type of weapon at the time? The answer to that is no,"" Belmar said.

The Ferguson police officer involved has been put on leave as St. Louis County Police investigate the incident.

St. Louis 21st Ward Alderman Antonio French -- who posted video of Sunday night’s frenzy online -- told ABC News that anger from the shooting ""boiled over,"" and that residents want a full investigation into Brown’s death.

“I think it's too many men, especially young, black men, who feel like, you know, that they don't have equal citizenship and that the relationship between them and the police is adversarial and that they're on the losing end, and that their lives are not valued,"" French said.

“We have a lot of work to do as a greater community, black and white, to come together to let these young men know that they are a part of the community and that we have a place for them.”

Brown’s relatives remain stunned by the shooting.

“He was good kid and they did that to him for no reason,” Brown’s grandmother Desiree Harris said.",2000,7000,NA,NA

Captain Ron Johnson was given the task on Thursday afternoon of maintaining safety as the city headed into its fifth day of protests following the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown.

Johnson was seen marching among the protesters Thursday evening, listening to them air their grievances, and even hugging one of the women who came out to demonstrate.

Johnson's personal approach -- which included him telling how his daughter relayed a story from the Bible to him in an effort to encourage him during protests -- appears to be well-received by residents.

Even at today's news conference, Johnson made a point to focus on the residents of Ferguson in the crowd rather than reporters -- delaying the news conference as he called for all of the residents to come and sit in front of the crew of reporters.

""It is about the people who live in our community,"" Johnson said.

Part of his connection to the residents comes from the fact that he is their neighbor: Johnson and his family live in Florissant, the town directly next to Ferguson.

Reps. John Conyers, D-Mich, Bobby Scott, D-Va., and Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., have officially called for Congressional hearings to examine ""the extensive militarization of state and local police.""

In a {letter}<hyperlink=”http://democrats-judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/Conyers-Scott-Cohen140814.pdf”> to Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlate, R-Va., they noted: ""Mr. Brown's killing highlights what appears to be a continuing pattern of the use of deadly force by police against unarmed African Americans in cities around the nation.""

Hearings could address what the congressmen described as ""long-simmering racial tensions between an overwhelmingly white police force and a majority African-American population.""

""Why do local police dress in military-style uniforms and body armor…?"" they wrote. ""At best, confronting demonstrators with this show of force is a sign of poor judgment. In all likelihood, the decision to adopt a military posture only served to aggravate an already tense situation…""

He reportedly calls the bill the ""Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act.""

Some lawmakers have even suggested that police in Ferguson resembled soldiers in war-torn regions abroad, rather than officers tasked with keeping peace.

""Instead of being respected as citizens of this nation who have the right to vocally oppose what they believe is mistreatment [protesters] were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, and police equipped as though they are militia in a war zone,"" said Congressional Black Caucus Chair Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio. ""What I saw last night reminded me of violent responses to uprisings in countries around the world, not here in my own backyard. We are supposed to be better than that.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., joined the chorus:

If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn't have expected to be shot.

The outrage in Ferguson is understandable-though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.

… Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies-where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.

Some lawmakers went further, drawing parallels between the police response to Ferguson protesters and law enforcement treatment of civil rights advocates.

""The tragic killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown and the events that have transpired since the shooting in Ferguson are reminiscent of the violent altercations that took place during the Civil Rights Movement. Countless African Americans endured unwarranted hostility and excessive force from law enforcement while exercising their right to peaceful assembly and civil resistance,"" said Rep. Conyers, a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. ""It is a great travesty to find ourselves again witnessing the blatant violation of our right to peaceably assemble.""

McSpadden said she spoke Sunday with Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson.

“He had a heartfelt message for me, and it was that that could have been his son, and he was sorry, and he’s, like everybody else, supporting and hoping and praying that this doesn’t happen again,” McSpadden said, holding back tears.

A private autopsy performed Sunday at the request of Brown’s family showed that the teen was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, said Shawn Parcells, the medical investigator who performed the autopsy with Dr. Michael Baden.

It’s unclear whether Brown’s arms were raised when he was shot, but he was not shot in the back, despite witnesses’ claims, Parcells told ABC News.

Family attorney Benjamin Crump said the autopsy results are troubling.

“It confirms our worst fears that the witnesses were telling the truth, that her son was shot multiple times,” Crump said. “The most troubling was the head shot, you know, it’s just not justified in any way, fashion or form to execute this child like this in broad daylight.”

Crump said the family wanted an independent autopsy in order to find out the truth about Brown’s death. The St. Louis County Medical Examiner’s office previously conducted an autopsy, concluding that Brown died of gunshot wounds but releasing no details.

Attorney General {Eric Holder}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/eric-holder.htm""> has ordered a federal medical examiner to perform a separate autopsy because of the circumstances surrounding the shooting.

The shooting death of Brown has sparked riots and protests in the St. Louis suburb, a situation that intensified after Ferguson police released video Friday they say shows Brown robbing a convenience store before the fatal shooting.

McSpadden said she was surprised by the video’s release, and that it doesn’t help to explain the shooting that followed.

The shooting Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, sparked outrage, which continued today as residents marched to police headquarters to demand answers.

People in a crowd of about 200 people outside the Ferguson Police Department shouted ""We want answers"" and ""no justice, no peace."" Some carried signs saying ""stop police terrorism"" and ""disarm the police.""

Belmar said today that the incident began with when the officer allegedly had an altercation with two people, one of whom he said assaulted him in his police car.

""It is our understanding at this point in the investigation that within the police car there was a struggle over the officer's weapon,"" Belmar said.

According to the police chief, the officer said he then got out of his vehicle and shot ""at a subject.""

""There were shell casings recovered. The shell casings are all matched to one weapon, that's the officer's weapon,"" Belmar said. ""There were more than a few shell casings recovered. I cannot say at this time how many times the subject was struck.""

The officer was able to get out of the car and the fatal shooting occurred approximately 35 feet from where the vehicle was parked.

Belmar was not able to say how many times the subject was struck by police fire, but that it was more than a couple of shots.

The chief said that it was not yet clear whether the other person allegedly involved in the confrontation was armed.

The medical examiner is conducting the investigation to determine how many times the young man was shot, Belmar said.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson contacted the St. Louis County police immediately after the shooting to have the St. Louis Police Department Crimes Investigation Force take over the investigation. He told the Associated Press that at least one shot was fired in the patrol car.

The officer who shot the 18-year-old has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years, and has not had any other issues since he has been on the force, Belmar said. His name has not been disclosed.

He will be interviewed extensively today and will have a physiological evaluation before returning to duty, the chief said. The officer is currently on paid administrative leave.

Jackson told The Associated Press that police have contacted the second person who was involved in the altercation with the officer before the shooting, but that the person has not been arrested or charged.

The local chapter of the NAACP has called for the {FBI}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/federal-bureau-of-investigation.htm""> to handle the investigation of the shooting. Belmar said that the FBI could become involved, but had not as of today.

The two shots that hit Brown in the head were likely among the last that hit him and traveled from the back of his head to the front, indicating that Brown's head was tilted forward, either because he was bending over or falling over, forensic expert Dr. Michael Baden said at a news conference today. Brown had abrasions on his face from where he ""fell flat down unprotected,"" Baden said.

""The kill shot is right here, at the apex of his head,"" attorney Darrell Parks said.

A gunshot wound to his arm could show either that he was hit while walking away from the shooter with his back to the officer, or that he was facing the shooter with his arm up, either in a surrender position, defensive position, or other motion, Baden said.

Brown likely did not suffer, Baden said. The shot to the top of his head would have rendered him unconscious immediately, he said.

""Michael Brown's mom had the same question as any mother would have, which is was my child in pain?"" attorney Benjamin Crump said. ""And Dr. Baden shared with her in his opinion he did not suffer.""

""His mother also wanted to ask a question that neither Dr. Baden nor the lawyers could answer, which is what else do we need to give them to arrest the killer of my child?"" Crump said to applause in the church where the press conference was held.

The St. Louis County medical examiner's office confirmed that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and chest, and said that a toxicology report was complete. But the county medical examiner would not release any details from the autopsy or the toxicology report.

Baden said that in his experience, it calms the family and community to have the official autopsy report released right away after an incident.

""We found that the sooner the information goes out, the family is talked to, the family has a right to know how their loved one died, this calms the community and the family concerns over a cover up and not getting told truth,"" Baden said.

""There are very simple things that are found on day one of the autopsy, and the next day the autopsy report comes out to answer these types of questions, such as how many bullet wounds and most importantly did my loved one suffer,"" Baden said. ""We can answer those questions on day one.""

The autopsy was performed Sunday at the request of Brown’s family.

Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, was hired to perform the private autopsy along with Prof. Shaun Parcells for the Brown family after St. Louis County would not release the results of its autopsy.

The attorneys representing Brown's parents criticized the St. Louis authorities for not releasing autopsy results and said that the results show evidence that the shooting officer, Darren Wilson, should be arrested.

""There are two shots I want you to focus on today for my purpose because they show the bullets were moving in a back-to-front direction,"" family attorney Darrell Parks said. ""The kill shot is right here, at apex of his head, and it is a clear back-to-front position. The second shot to the head is a little dot right by his hairline and came out by the eye. That’s very important because it shows a back-to-front motion.""

""It supports what witnesses said about him trying to surrender, that he had his head in a downward position,"" Parks said. ""The officer needs to be arrested. Why would (Brown) be shot in the very top of his head? A 6-foot-4 man, it makes no sense. We believe those two things alone are ample evidence for the officer to be arrested.""

In addition to the two shots to the head, Brown was shot four times in the right arm and chest.

Attorney General {Eric Holder}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/eric-holder.htm""> has ordered a federal medical examiner to perform a separate autopsy because of the circumstances surrounding the shooting.

The St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office has also conducted an autopsy, concluding that Brown died of gunshot wounds but releasing no details.

Brown's death sparked outrage in the community and across the nation. One witness, Piaget Crenshaw, told ABC News that Brown was facing the officer with his hands raised in the air when the officer shot him.

The struggle began when the officer encountered two men, one of whom was Brown, in the street outside of an apartment complex, and one of the men pushed the office back toward his squad car, according to police. A shot was fired inside the squad car and then multiple shots were fired at Brown outside the car, killing him, authorities said.

A candlelight vigil was held Sunday night in Brown's honor.

The vigil later erupted into violence, with some individuals breaking into stores and looting goods while others vandalized police vehicles. A fire broke out in a QuickTrip store that had been looted earlier.",1000,2000,NA,NA

Brown, an 18-year-old African American man, was shot multiple times and killed Saturday by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer. The days since the shooting have been marked by tense standoffs between Brown's supporters and heavily-armed police officers, along with riots and looting of stores on Sunday night.

""The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time,"" Obama said.

{Looting, Vandalism After Vigil for Missouri Man Killed by Cop}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/vandalism-looting-reported-vigil-missouri-man-killed-cop/story?id=24923516"">

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" the President said in a statement. ""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.""

Obama emphasized that Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice will be investigating the shooting as well as local police in St. Louis County, Missouri.

Earlier today, Ferguson police said they would not identify the officer who shot Brown due to safety concerns. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said there had been death threats made against the officer involved in the shooting, in which Brown, 18, was shot multiple times on Saturday afternoon.

Jackson's decision comes despite a call on Monday from Brown's father Michael Brown Sr. to identify the officer who shot his son several times, killing him.

“This person’s got to pay for this,” Brown's father said.

""If the name of the victim is released, how is the name of the perpetrator not released? We cannot in good conscience ask for toxicology tests of Mr. Brown without asking for it of the officer,"" said Jamal Bryant, a pastor who appeared at a press conference with the Browns, their attorney Benjamin Crump, and the Reverend Al Sharpton today.

""This doesn't give the community confidence, it doesn't illustrate transparence or convince the community that the police aren't going to sweep this under the rug,"" Crump said.

The decision to not identify the officer came after another officer's name was released on social media as being the shooter, according to Jackson. ""We've been getting death threats as a result to that officer. Officer safety is why we are not releasing the name (of the officer who shot Brown.) It's too volatile and dangerous. We think that the value of releasing his name is far outweighed by the safety at this point.""

The Browns and civil rights leaders also used the press conference to urge supporters to remain calm and nonviolent in protesting the shooting. The pleas came after two nights in which protesters clashed with police and looted stores.

""I just want justice for my son. I really do. I need justice for my son,"" Michael Brown, Sr., said today. ""I understand everybody has their own pains because they have losses too, but I need everyone to come together and do this the right way so we can get something done about this. No violence, man.""

Sharpton emphasized the family's plea for non-violent protests.

""To become violent in Michael Brown’s name is to betray the gentle giant he was,"" Sharpton said. ""I know you're angry. I know this is outrageous. When I saw that photo, the outrage rose up in me. But we cannot be more outraged than his mom and dad, and if they can hold their heads with dignity, then we can too.""

The town of Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, was filled with tear gas as police in riot gear fired rubber bullets Monday night to disperse protesters, renewing tensions after Brown's shooting death on Saturday.

""We believe in the rule of the law but it's got to work both ways,"" Crump said at a press conference this afternoon.

Sharpton, Crump and others said they would only trust a full federal investigation into the shooting. The {FBI}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/federal-bureau-of-investigation.htm""> is reviewing the case, looking into possible civil rights violations, while the St. Louis County police department is the lead investigating agency.

Ferguson Police Chief Jackson offered additional details today about the violent encounter that led to Brown's death.

""What I can tell you is it started out as a routine encounter with two young men walking on the street. They were asked to get on the sidewalk,"" Jackson said. ""It quickly became a violent encounter and then became a fight, some kind of fight inside the car. Shots were fired. I don't know how many.""

Jackson said that the officer has been placed on administrative leave and his gun will be kept by investigators as evidence, though he is not prevented from having another weapon.

The officer will have to undergo two psychological evaluations as part of his administrative leave.

""He feels terrible about whole thing. He did not come to work with intention of this happening. He came to work to serve the community. He's sad and he is hurt. He's doing okay. It's a difficult thing,"" the chief said.

Brown and a friend were walking to his grandmother’s house, when the friend says an unidentified officer asked them to get off the street. Police say one of the men fought the officer.

Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, says her son didn’t fight anyone.

“Just because he’s 6-foot (tall), black walking down the city street doesn’t mean he fit the profile,” McSpadden said.",852,211,NA,NA

Tulsa, May and June 1921

Post-WWI Oklahoma erupted in a deadly race riot in 1921 in the prosperous Greenwood District, a mostly African American neighborhood of Tulsa. Left out of history books for decades, the 18-hour violent clash left between 50 and 300 dead and over 1,000 homes and businesses destroyed, {according to the historical society}<hyperlink=""http://www.okhistory.org/publications/encyclopediaonline.php"">.

By the time the National Guard arrived the morning after the riot, 35 city blocks had been burned to the ground and countless were injured.

President Harding discussed the riot while addressing students at Lincoln University.

Detroit, June 1943

Riots between blacks and whites at the Belle Isle integrated amusement park led to three days of violence beginning on June 20, 1943. Thirty-four people lost their lives. Of the25 blacks who perished, 17 were killed by white police officers. President Roosevelt released a "" {proclamation}<hyperlink=""http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16414&st=violence&st1=riot"">"" on June 21, saying,
