The community is reeling from riots some consider the worst in recent memory. The FBI has opened an investigation into the fatal shooting that preceded the riots.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

The St. Louis suburb of Ferguson is reeling today. On Saturday, a police officer shot and killed an 18-year-old African-American man who was set to start college this week. A march yesterday to protest the shooting ended in riots that destroyed one business and left at least a dozen others damaged. More than 30 people were arrested, and now the FBI says it's investigating the police shooting. Rachel Lippmann of St. Louis Public Radio has more.

RACHEL LIPPMANN, BYLINE: Mike Jacob and his employees spent Monday morning sawing plywood to cover the windows of his store, Sam's Meat Market. Last night the looters took liquor, cigars and even the safe.

MIKE JACOB: There's a lot of damage - a lot, a lot.

LIPPMANN: Jacob's store is about a mile from the apartment complex where Michael Brown was shot and killed over the weekend. Police say Brown and another individual allegedly assaulted the officer as he was trying to get out of his police car. A struggle for the officer's gun ensued. Police say one shot was fired inside the vehicle, but Brown was killed outside. A peaceful candlelight vigil and march disintegrated into violence and looting, but business owner Mike Jacob harbors no ill will toward the community.

JACOB: I think the people that want to do the damage inside the store - trying to steal the TV - it's not our customer. You know, it's 100 percent is not our customer. The community here is very good - smart people and good people.

LIPPMANN: Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson also suggested the looters were not from Ferguson.

THOMAS JACKSON: There were a whole lot of other people who were there just that were not going to be satisfied with peaceful protest. So what we ended up with is the peaceful protesters - which is pretty much this group here - leaving or dispersing, and what we were left with was a pretty violent crowd.

LIPPMANN: Jackson is standing outside the Ferguson Police Department where a third day of protests over the Michael Brown shooting was underway.

CROWD: Don't shoot.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: What do we want?

CROWD: Justice.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: When do we want it?

CROWD: Now.

LIPPMANN: Monica Timmons is among the 60 or so protesters who came out to demand that the Ferguson police identify the officer involved in the shooting. They want him charged with murder.

MONICA TIMMONS: I don't have kids, and this is why. I do not want to be scared to have a son in America. Like, ain't you scared to have one? You know, like, let's be real. You know, where do our sons got to look forward to? You want to bring a son to this so he can get killed? No.

LIPPMANN: Others in the crowd targeted their anger at Ferguson's mayor, demanding more black officers on the force. Currently there's only a handful in a city that is majority African-American. Police in riot gear kept a close eye on the boisterous crowd, and that's what most upset Montague Simmons.

MONTAGUE SIMMONS: So what we're seeing now is a police response to people who weren't even involved in any looting or any other acts of violence. And that's just increasing the tension, and actually, it's making people feel less safe. People are out here because they don't feel safe. They're seeing young people killed for no reason.

LIPPMANN: But despite everything, Simmons says people are at least starting to listen.

SIMMONS: So we're really trying to gather the energy to a place where we can actually begin to have conversations not just with each other, but have conversations with the city about doing something different. We can't go back to business as usual.

LIPPMANN: Protesters are scheduled to gather tomorrow at the office of Bob McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney in St. Louis county. Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, says he's hoping for a quiet night, but says his officers are ready if it's not. For NPR News, I'm Rachel Lippmann in St. Louis.",20,NA,NA,NA

Meanwhile, protests continue over the death of an unarmed teenager who was shot by police on Saturday.

Reporter Rachel Lippmann of St. Louis Public Radio says about 60 people gathered outside of the Ferguson, Mo., police department Monday. They're calling for police to identify the officer involved and to charge him with murder. Others want the police force diversified in the majority-African-American city.

Among the protesters was Monica Timmons.

St. Louis Public Radio has {live-blogging developments}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/live-updates-aftermath-police-shootings-ferguson-and-berkeley""> all day.

Our original post, covering the violence over the weekend and the shooting, continues:

A march and prayer vigil that began as a way to honor Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager who was killed by police Saturday, ended with looting and violence in suburban St. Louis Sunday night. At least one store was set on fire.

The killing, and the protest against it, happened in Ferguson, Mo., where Brown, 18, was shot and killed Saturday during an altercation with a Ferguson police officer on a street lined with houses. Police and witnesses agree the teen did not have a gun and that a third person was also involved; beyond that, the details of Brown's death are in dispute. A federal investigation has been opened alongside the local one.

Protests against the officer's killing of Brown {began shortly after the incident occurred}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/10/339334625/st-louis-police-black-teen-shot-in-altercation-with-officers""> in Ferguson, a predominantly African-American community northwest of downtown St. Louis. On Saturday, Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, was seen holding a cardboard sign reading, ""Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son.""

The case is being investigated by an outside agency, the St. Louis County Police Department.

Before violence broke out late Sunday, protesters had been chanting, ""Hands up, don't shoot! Hands up, don't shoot!""

St. Louis Public Radio's Rachel Lippmann {described the scene}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/peaceful-protest-against-police-brutality-turns-night-violence""> before things boiled over:

""The crowd that gathered near the site of the shooting, in the Canfield Gardens apartment complex, was large but peaceful. Community leaders called for a boycott of Ferguson businesses and collected money to pay for Michael Brown's funeral.

""His nickname was Mike Mike; he was called a 'gentle giant' by many of the people who knew him,"" Lippmann says of Brown on Monday's {Morning Edition}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/"">. Those people also say of Brown, who was to have begun classes at a local college Monday, ""fighting wouldn't have been in his nature — and the violence that erupted in his name wouldn't have been in his nature.""

That violence broke out after a series of peaceful and passionate rallies for Brown, Lippmann says. After a QuikTrip convenience store near the site of the shooting was overrun and set on fire, the looting quickly spread to an area 5 miles wide.

From the AP:

""Several other stores along a main road near the shooting scene were broken into, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People also took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer and carted rims away from a tire store.

""TV footage showed streams of people walking out of a liquor store carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters were standing atop police cars or taunting officers who stood stoic, often in riot gear.""

Calling the violence and looting ""very upsetting,"" a member of Brown's family {issued a statement}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/10/report-michael-brown-protesters-damage-police-vehicles-on-west-florissant/""> urging peace and justice.

The killing of Michael Brown, 18, has sparked three days of protests and rallies that have included clashes with police and looting, along with prayers and calls for justice for the recent high school graduate and his family.

Brown's death is being investigated by St. Louis County police; the FBI has opened its own separate inquiry. The decision not to release the officer's name publicly was made by Ferguson police, meaning that ""Mike Brown's family attorney would have to go to court to compel release of officer's name,"" according to local TV news {Fox 2 Now}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-will-not-release-officers-name-involved-in-mike-brown-shooting/"">.

Brown's family is now being represented by Benjamin Crump, who previously worked with the family of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. Crump tells Fox 2 Now that they'll seek to force the department to reveal the officer's name.

The case revolves around an altercation that involved Brown, the officer and a third person. Police say the incident reportedly included a struggle over a gun in the officer's police vehicle, where at least one shot was fired; some witnesses say they don't agree with the official account. In the end, Brown died in the street after being shot multiple times.

A young man who says he was with Brown before and during the confrontation says that as of Tuesday, police still had not spoken to him.

Dorian Johnson, 22, says he and Brown had been walking in the street when the officer ordered them to get onto the sidewalk.

""After telling the officer that they were almost at their destination, Johnson's house, the two continued walking,"" {MSNBC reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri"">. ""But as they did, Johnson says, the officer slammed his brakes and threw his truck in reverse, nearly hitting them.""

Things quickly escalated, Johnson says, with Brown and the officer engaging in a ""tug of war"" that didn't end until Brown was shot. Johnson says he and Brown then ran — and that the officer shot Brown several more times.

Johnson's attorney, former St. Louis mayor Freeman Bosley, tells MSNBC that police declined his offer of letting them speak to him.

Here are more developments we're seeing (updated at 4:50 p.m. ET):

President Obama released a statement on Brown's death Tuesday and gave his condolences to the family. He added:

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.""

The Rev. Al Sharpton will visit Brown's family in Ferguson on Tuesday morning and hold a news conference around midday. Sharpton spoke with family members last night on his MSNBC TV show, {Politics Nation}<hyperlink=http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation"">.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and grandfather, Les McSpadden, spoke out against the violence that has followed emotional protests in Ferguson. Lesley McSpadden told Sharpton, ""I should be celebrating — we all should be celebrating my son's graduation and going on to college. But we're planning a funeral.""

Some schools in the community postponed their first day of the academic year from Monday to Tuesday, citing ""unsafe conditions"" in the wake of the killing and protests against it, according to St. Louis Public Radio.

In Hazelwood School District, where classes began as planned Monday, Superintendent Grayling Tobias said, ""I want to reassure our community that we are listening to our students and allowing them to express their thoughts as needed."" He added that the school's staff would ""be there for our students if they need to process the information. What that means is listening, being highly visible, being highly vigilant, making sure that we are there for our students as they sort out their feelings related to this situation.""

The Ferguson community is a town of some 21,205 people — about two-thirds black and one-third white, according to census data highlighted by {St. Louis Public Radio}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/ferguson-numbers"">. The median household income is about $37,500.

In a tweet, St. Louis Alderman Antonio French adds that the town has ""a white mayor and mostly white city council. 53 police officers. Only 3 black (2 female, 1 male).""",234,NA,NA,NA

Religious leaders and activists are calling for calm and peaceful demonstrations after three nights of protests that alternately involved looting and police in riot gear.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Tensions are still high in a St. Louis suburb after Saturday's fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by police. The death of 18-year-old Michael Brown has sparked outrage in the community of Ferguson, Missouri. Peaceful demonstrations by day have turned to looting and civil unrest at night. Today, Brown's family gathered with civil rights leaders at a packed courthouse news conference. NPR's David Schaper is at the old historic courthouse in downtown St. Louis, and he joins us now. Hello, David.

DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Hi, Robert.

SIEGEL: What was said today, and what was the reaction?

SCHAPER: Well, you know, a lot of people in the African-American community both here, in St. Louis and from across the country - as this has attracted celebrity civil rights leaders and others to St. Louis - are saying, basically, here we go again - another African-American teenager or young, adult male shot and killed by police or other authorities - the latest in a series of similar events that we've seen all across the country. And it's becoming a point where many feel that the racist - that there are just too many racist attitudes towards young black men by people in authority across the country. The family is now being represented by Benjamin Crump who was the attorney for the family of Trayvon Martin a few years ago. He didn't hold anything back in terms of how he characterized the shooting, calling it, essentially, an execution. He was joined by a host of other civil rights leaders including the Reverend Al Sharpton who first and foremost called for peace tonight. He talked about the family, what they've been going through and the fact that the shooting victim in this case, Michael Brown, was a peaceful individual himself, and would - it would be doing his reputation - his legacy harm if there was any more looting or violent sort of demonstrations in the night. But then he also called for a thorough, evenhanded investigation by outside authorities - federal investigators outside of this jurisdiction. And a lot of people still are really on edge by what's happened here and what may transpire yet.

SIEGEL: David, President Obama released a statement on this case today. What did he say?

SCHAPER: Well, the president weighed in by saying that - he called the death of Michael Brown heartbreaking and that he and his wife, Michelle, send deepest condolences to the family and the community. He talked about how the events of the last few days have prompted strong passions in the community here and, really, across the country. He's urging everyone to try to let cooler heads prevail. I'm paraphrasing there, but remember the young man through reflection and understanding, his statement says. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. And he also offered up his prayers for Michael Brown and his family.

SIEGEL: How would you describe the mood in St. Louis today?

SCHAPER: I'd describe it as pretty edgy. I think a lot of folks are just a little rattled by what's happened. In Ferguson, the small suburb where this happened, the shooting is a culmination of long-simmering tensions between young African-American residents and the police. Ferguson is a low to moderate income suburb of about 21,000 people. Two thirds of those residents are African-American, but they point out that only three of the community's 53 police officers are black. And that rubs a lot of people the wrong way. The police chief admits it's a problem and has been telling reporters he's been trying to recruit more African-American officers. A lot of the residents I talked to - and these are three young men, aged 21, 26 and 30 - talk about this not just being a problem in Ferguson itself, but more broadly around the St. Louis area. There's quite a bit of tension, and they feel like young African-American males are targeted by authorities, and that people feel uncomfortable around them and think that they're, just by nature of how they look, up to no good.

SIEGEL: You mentioned the exhortations to people to refrain from violence or looting. Looking toward tonight, how are police planning to try to avert more looting and rioting?

SCHAPER: Police are saying they're ready for the worst but hoping they don't need to use tear gas and shoot rubber bullets as they did last night, and they're calling for peaceful demonstrations. They want to let people speak their mind and speak their peace, but they want to do so in a peaceful way. And religious leaders coming forward and saying let's have a community forum and let's have a forum indoors, keep people off the streets and make our point peacefully.

NPR,npr5,http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/08/13/340076968/what-policing-looks-like-to-a-former-investigator-of-misconduct,What Policing Looks Like To A Former Investigator Of Misconduct,Monica Potts,08/13/2014,01/20/2016,"When I was in my early 20s, my days were spent listening to New Yorkers tell me stories of how officers from the New York City Police Department had beaten them up. On most days, the person sitting across from me was a young, African-American man. (There were women, too, but they were fewer.) He would have filed an official complaint, either during his arrest or after, which then filtered through the city bureaucracy to land on my desk at the Civilian Complaint Review Board, or CCRB, an independent agency that investigates complaints against the NYPD.

It was my first job after graduating from college in 2002, and many of my colleagues were also 22- or 23-year-olds fresh off some elite, verdant, northeastern campus, filling out a resume while contemplating law school. The cops dismissed us as kids who didn't know anything about the job, and in some ways, they were right. I didn't know anything about New York City, the job of an officer or the lives of the young men who sat across from me. That would change.

Before I could begin an investigation, I had to interview the complainant. If he couldn't get to my offices in lower Manhattan, I had to find him at home. Home was usually Brownsville, East New York, East Elmhurst or Tremont — New York City neighborhoods far removed from the brunch spots where Sex and the City fans fought for outside seating, or where the trucker-hat crowd ironically carried their bodega 40s in brown paper bags. I came to learn that New York City was a place dramatically divided by race and class, and the line that marked the border between the two cities was blue.

Our most common complaints were about improper stops and searches, but complaints of excessive force came next. These two types of cases can't be neatly divided, though; they often intersected.

The Stories Of The Complainants

The stories that came from each young man were similar: He was minding his business on the sidewalk when a cop came up. Sometimes, he'd admit that he'd happened to have a joint or an open container of alcohol in his hand, which made him the target of an officer who'd been schooled in the {increasingly contested ""Broken Windows"" policing philosophy}<hyperlink=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/broken_windows_policing_deaths_racism_in_chokeholds_arrests_and_convictions.html""> that had reigned for more than a decade — go after the small offenses and you'll prevent worse crimes from happening.

The cop would ask him what he was up to, in a register that varied from genuinely curious to (more frequently) confrontational. The young man in question would be reluctant to answer at all, much less in the polite, deferential manner that officers demand. Maybe an argument would ensue, or maybe the cop would go straight in and start to handcuff the kid. That's when the predictable accusations would roll out:

He bashed my head against the wall.

He wrestled me to the ground and five or six cops were punching me.

He put his arm around my neck like this, in a chokehold.

When I was on the sidewalk, they started kicking me.

One of them stomped on my head.

""These all provide visuals for the stories I used to hear, but the stories are no longer confined to a case docket. They're spreading on YouTube for everyone to see, and allow us all to judge for ourselves.""- Monica Potts

The story was so common I could recite it in advance. The men were so specific, and their complaints so similar to others, that it seemed like whole neighborhoods might be rehearsing their statements. When you start to hear any story enough, it sounds less real. And it does sound crazy, right? Cops don't go around putting people in chokeholds, stomping on their heads! At least, that's what I thought at first. I was a young white woman in a middle-class job. I'd never even gotten a speeding ticket. I lived on the gentrifying edge of Brooklyn. The CCRB forced me to become familiar with other parts of the city.

The Stories On YouTube

There were almost never audio or video recordings in my cases, unless someone made a 911 call. These were the days when phones still flipped, and you had to punch 555-666-555 to write ""lol"" (and a lot of people didn't know what that meant yet anyway).

Things have changed a lot since I left the agency in 2004. Over the past few weeks, I've been watching the {YouTube videos of Eric Garner}<hyperlink=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ka4oKu1jo""> — who died after a cop put him in a chokehold and wrestled him to the ground — with a gnawing feeling of guilt. Garner may have been breaking the law by selling loose cigarettes on the street; he'd been {arrested 30 times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/nyregion/staten-island-man-dies-after-he-is-put-in-chokehold-during-arrest.html?_r=0"">. He was definitely arguing with police. Yet these are minor offenses, and he died for them.

There are other videos, like the video of Jahmil-El Cuffee having {his head stomped on}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-desk-duty-reportedly-stomping-man-article-1.1880818"">. And of course, in the past few days, I've followed the news of the {shooting of Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/12/339850929/in-ferguson-calls-for-calm-and-justice-after-teen-s-death?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=news""> in Ferguson, Mo. He was an unarmed black teenager who was stopped by police on Saturday afternoon, days before he was set to begin college. There's no video of the Brown shooting, but I can fill in the details in my mind. There's video of the aftermath, of the people of Ferguson holding vigils for the young man, surrounded by police in riot gear. These all provide visuals for the stories I used to hear from the men, but their stories are no longer confined to a case docket. They're spreading on YouTube for everyone to see, and allow us all to judge for ourselves.

These videos, though, aren't just displays of what may arguably be ""police brutality,"" on one hand, and ""justifiable force"" on the other. They're windows into neighborhoods where people are constantly policed, and often stopped and detained or arrested. People in these neighborhoods are policed as heavily for crimes like selling loose cigarettes as they are for major crimes like assault. After the urban riots of the 1960s and the middle-class flight to the suburbs, Americans decided that the inner city was a place of disorder and chaos, and the only way to make it safe was to establish powerful police forces.

This means two generations of city dwellers have grown up with an entirely different relationship to the police than those who grew up in the comfortable, white, middle-class suburbs did. The questions we should all be asking aren't just about the force used, or whether officers technically put Garner in a chokehold. (The questions we have about the Michael Brown case in Ferguson are more basic: What exactly happened?) The questions should be why we have so many neighborhoods where contentious encounters with cops are routine.

Let's establish one thing: Arrests almost always seem violent to an outside observer who isn't used to seeing them in the real world. They usually involve some use of force — even if it's the officer just grabbing the suspect's arms, it doesn't look like a TV arrest. The officers I spoke with at the CCRB used to joke that they'd never witnessed a suspect calmly put her hands behind her back when told to do so. Officers have the authority to use necessary force when someone resists arrest, and we are all legally obligated to comply with an officer's orders. If the arrest is bogus, we can fight it in court, but not on the streets. Most officers are just trying to make it through their day. They don't set out to injure anyone, but they're also not going to risk letting someone try to hurt them.

The question of whether an officer can use force gets murky when the arrest may not have been valid. The toughest cases I had involved officers stopping someone for a minor crime and then making an arrest. These crimes included minor drug offenses, ""quality-of-life"" issues and disorderly conduct. The disorderly conduct statute is broad and vague, and includes such offenses as ""congregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse."" It's a law that comes in handy when you want to break up protesters who are blocking a sidewalk or a group of people who seem to be on the cusp of rioting, or if you have a vague suspicion that the people who are gathering are up to no good.

The complaints I got from New York City's poorest neighborhoods, though, were that often officers approached groups of guys standing on a sidewalk. The officer would tell them to disperse, and they would become ""agitated."" ""Why do we have to leave?"" It's a good question. I came to learn that there are some communities where people drew suspicion just for hanging out on a stoop or a sidewalk. I saw cases with a familiar constellation of charges: disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and assault on an officer. Together, they were known casually as ""P.O.P.,"" or ""Pissing Off Police."" There wasn't much we could do in some of these cases. Technically, the offenses described by officers counted as disorderly conduct, which meant the arrest may have been justified.

The Stories Of The Officers

Officers also stopped people they said were acting ""suspiciously."" According to them, some neighborhoods are full of people ""furtively gesturing"" toward their waistbands — that was a favorite explanation for why an officer had stopped someone. When officers confront people, they become ""voisterous,"" a malapropism that seems like a portmanteau of voicy and boisterous. When the officer started to arrest the suspect, he or she ""flared"" their arms. (What they really did was flail.)

If, in the beginning, complainants seemed to have eerily similar stories, by the end of my two years I was seeing suspicious similarities between the officers' justifications for their actions, too. They even used the same wrong words.

It wasn't long before I began to understand that people living in New York City's poorest neighborhoods were always under surveillance. In the housing projects, the NYPD had rooms full of TVs with security camera feeds, and they could stop anyone in the hallways or stairways of project buildings any time. Outside the projects, they were always stopping, questioning and detaining young men for their ""furtive gestures.""

After a year at the CCRB, I understood why, if I were a young man who was minding my own business with my friends — having been stopped by police at random intervals for many of my teenage years — I might be disinclined to follow an officer's orders. I might, under such circumstances, put up a fight. More often, the fight is brought to them. Perhaps that's why so many people now seem to have their iPhones ready to record videos as soon as an arrest begins.

I left the Civilian Complaint Review Board well before civil rights organizations started to challenge the stop-and-frisk practices that disproportionately affected the communities from which we got most of our complaints. In 2010, a This American Life episode {featured}<hyperlink=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/414/right-to-remain-silent""> an officer who had secretly recorded his superiors enforcing quotas on summonses and arrests. In one of the most chilling interactions, a sergeant told Officer Adrian Schoolcraft to, in not so many words, pick a fight with black guys chilling on a stoop somewhere so that he could arrest them for disorderly conduct. So it did happen. And it may have happened a lot.

When Policing Is Fatal, Whom Do We Blame?

These videos make me believe the allegations I heard may have happened a lot more often than I would have guessed back then. Because I'm seeing it. It must be true that all of the other comfortable, middle-class, mostly white Americans watching these tapes also now realize how violent some neighborhoods are — not because of the criminals, but because of the police. The people in these heavily policed communities are now armed with the kind of evidence they've always needed to advocate for a change in the way they're treated by the people who are supposed to keep them safe.

When I investigated cases, I usually had only medical records and arrest reports. Most of the time, officers would admit to using force. If they used it because a person was resisting a lawful arrest, however, it was justified.

If you establish that police have the right to use some force, you have to determine what makes force excessive. {That's more complicated}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/07/29/335847224/what-we-see-in-the-eric-garner-video-and-what-we-dont"">.

""We've given police officers extraordinary powers and wide latitude to ""stop criminals,"" without spending a lot of time considering what we mean by ""criminals,"" and how far we're willing to go to stop them.""- Monica Potts

In 2010, a video surfaced of an officer in Seattle {punching}<hyperlink=""http://jezebel.com/5564875/cop-punches-teen-girl-in-that-face-for-jaywalking""> a girl in her late teens after he tried to stop her for jaywalking. It sounds horrifying. But if you watch the entire video, you see that right before, the girl had pushed the officer away from her. Which means the video is also evidence that she assaulted an officer, and she was definitely resisting arrest.

I think many of us tend to think that resisting arrest requires violently evasive actions on the suspect's part, but the reality is different. New York Magazine compiled {reactions from police officers to the Eric Garner video}<hyperlink=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/07/cops-react-to-the-death-of-eric-garner.html"">, and many point out that he appeared to be resisting arrest. They may be right. If I were investigating this case, I would have to point out that when the officers started to grab Garner's hands, he pulled them away and said ""Don't touch me!"" He demanded they leave him alone, a request officers are never likely to grant. Resisting arrest can be as mundane as that.

In the Seattle video, after the push, the officer punched her in the face, turned her around and handcuffed her. (Dispense with the idea that it matters she was a woman: It doesn't.) The average person watching it probably wonders: Was the push really that bad? Could he have subdued her without a punch? Here are questions I'd have to take into account as an investigator, from the cop's point of view: If you were him, would you wait to see if she could do anything to you worse than a push? How much potential danger would you tolerate to avoid punching her?

But I no longer watch these videos like an investigator would; the questions that they inspire are deeper. Is there anything else we can and should do to stop jaywalkers? The Garner video also starts out minor, but after he pulls his hands back away from the officers who are trying to handcuff him, it escalates quickly, with a swarm of officers and a chokehold that turns out to be deadly. Why was it so important to arrest him in the first place? Adding police officers to any situation is going to increase the likelihood of violence, and there's nothing we can do to change that except reconsider the conditions under which we add police. That's because, in any situation, we've given police officers extraordinary powers and wide latitude to ""stop criminals,"" without spending a lot of time considering what we mean by ""criminals,"" and how far we're willing to go to stop them.

Every time something like the Eric Garner case happens, the CCRB gets renewed attention. Indeed, New York Mayor John Lindsay established an oversight board composed of civilians in the wake of the Harlem riots, which {marked}<hyperlink=""http://wnpr.org/post/new-yorks-night-birmingham-horror-sparked-summer-riots#stream/0""> their 50th anniversary this summer.

After the Eric Garner case, the New York Times {ran a story}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/nyregion/9-cases-of-police-chokeholds-punishment-was-rare-review-board-says.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22%7D""> about how rarely officers were punished by the NYPD after the CCRB found they improperly used chokeholds. It's an important issue. The city banned chokeholds in 1993, although the definition is limited to maneuvers that restrain the passage of air through the windpipe.

It's not just an NYPD issue, though, as the Brown killing in Ferguson so clearly demonstrates. These cases, like every one that came before, will get bogged down in the narrow, individual details that define it. The Garner and Brown stories will become so abstract, we will lose touch with what they're really about. In the Garner video, you can hear the weary terror building in his voice. For what it's worth, you can hear the same fear later in the video, in the voice of an officer starting to realize something is wrong with Garner, ordering the people who have gathered to back up and give Garner some air. None of the officers involved set out to kill a man that day. Perhaps, rather than investigating the actions of any one officer, it's time to rethink what lengths we as a society will go to in the name of law and order.",81,NA,NA,NA

As we report on protests in Ferguson, Mo., {after a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/12/339850929/in-ferguson-calls-for-calm-and-justice-after-teen-s-death"">, we asked Hampton about his experience navigating relations between the police and the communities they serve. Here's an edited transcript of our conversation.

Conversation Highlights

In 23 years, what was your experience working in communities hostile to the police?

I asked people to see me as me, and not as the stories they read about cops in the paper. If I saw stories where I thought the police were wrong, I'd say that. We're supposed to be public servants. We work for the people. Our job is to de-escalate, not to escalate situations.

For a lot of the people who police in our community, they don't understand the community (that is, black or brown people). They're misinformed and then become frightened and afraid, and so the gun is their friend because it's the only thing that protects them.

Did you ever witness or intervene in an arrest of a black or brown suspect when you thought that arrest was being mishandled?

Yes I did. And I reported it. A call went out for five or six people shooting craps in this alley. I wasn't the primary car, but arrived on the scene second or third. When we got there, the guys threw dice and money and ran. A white officer chased them. When he caught up with one guy, he grabbed him. The guy didn't resist arrest, but the officer said, ""You don't make the police run,"" and started beating on him. He was taken to the police station. As I'd witnessed it, I went too.

At the station, they took the guy to a back room to process him. All this time, the officer was taunting him, calling him names. He was handcuffed to the desk, as is policy. They charged him and gave him a $25 fine. At no point in the documentation was there mention anywhere about the cop taunting him. The guy paid the fine, but as he was leaving, he got fed up and punched the officer in the face. Hard. All the cops then jumped him, cuffed him and charged him with assault on a police officer.

The key to all this is what's in the report — and the same goes for Eric Garner's report. They wrote in the report, ""D1 (Defendant) struck the C1 (Complainant) without any reason or provocation."" Now, is that what happened? No. The man was provoked. He was constantly being taunted.

Because we were all in the station and the man hit the cop in the face, our policy states that we have to write a statement. Five of us were involved. Four wrote their statements. I wasn't asked to write one. I did, though, and my statement was different [from] the other four. They lied about the taunting. So now the case is in the system. My statement ended up with the prosecutor. He called me up, and asked me to come down to his office. I went and he pointed out that my statement was different from everyone else's. I told him what happened, and he said they would have to drop the case because they couldn't have police officers disagreeing with each other in court.

As a cop, how do you make split-second decisions in volatile situations?

This may sound strange, but I don't think decisions are made in split seconds. They're made based out of your experience. Example: I was a cop in this city for 23 years. I'm African-American, very politically aware and aware of what goes on as it relates to these issues. When I was working, I'd come across a situation in my community, working with young black males, and as a result of my background and conditioning, I wasn't afraid. My decisions were based on what was in my head and how it informed me on how to relate to people. So I led with my mouth, not my gun or my fists.

""I wasn't afraid. My decisions were based on what was in my head and how it informed me on how to relate to people. So I led with my mouth, not my gun or my fists.""- Ron Hampton

In police training, there was supposed to be training during the firearms component to help you make those decisions. But the training itself is not free of bias, and sometimes reinforces [it]. Example: The paper target we'd shoot at was black. I asked about it. Why were targets black — not grey or white? He thought I was trying to be funny. It reinforced the idea that you could shoot black people.

I believe we make decisions based on what's in our mind, not in a split second.

How did you deal with the different perceptions different ethnic groups had of the police, and how did you negotiate them as a cop?

I think the power that police have is not the power of arrest, it's the power to influence the quality of life of people. That's how I did my job. The white community tell their children when in trouble, go to the police. Black people don't do that. We protect our kids from police.

At the dinner table ... white families will tell children how to interact with the police. They tell them the police are there to help. Blacks do not. My son is autistic and doesn't drive or speak, so I give this message more to my daughter. I tell her, ""If you're stopped by police, this is the way you have to behave."" That's not something white parents need to worry about.

Just because I was wearing the uniform didn't mean I could say my kids were safe, because in the end, they looked like me. Every day I would see things happening to people because of the color of their skin. When I was working the streets, everyone hanging on U Street was potentially a criminal, and that was how they were treated by other officers. I didn't accept that and couldn't be involved in that. When I was there, I was aware there was inequality when it comes to how the police treated black people, so if I had the chance, I felt I had the obligation to speak out against injustice. And as a result of that, some people I worked with didn't like me.

Did that affect your career?

It did in terms of moving up in the system. The system won't embrace those who are indifferent to it. I went to work every day on time, did what I had to do, but there were certain people who didn't want to work with me. I didn't have a problem with that.

Did you ever have any civilian complaints against you?

No, I never had any civilian complaints against me. And I don't say that arrogantly. But I lived in the community where I worked — in Adams Morgan, and then Petworth where I live now. People knew I was a cop because I walked to work in my uniform. I never hid the fact. ... Because when you treat people decently, you don't have to worry about that. When you mistreat people, that's when you have to worry.

""What happened in Ferguson is like a room full of gasoline, and Mike Brown's death was the lit match.""- Ron Hampton

Are arrests usually violent?

I arrested people in my time. I don't remember a violent arrest. It's always about how you handle a situation. Just because a person breaks the law, it doesn't mean that we have to demean them. Most people who break the law acknowledge that they have done something wrong. There's a humane way of doing things to not antagonize the situation.

What is a police officer's authority to use necessary force?

If I go to arrest someone and they are resisting, the policy is that I am authorized to use force necessary to make the arrest that is equal to force being applied. I might be wrestling around them, but all I need to do is get the cuffs on them and get them to the police. Anything beyond that violates the policy.

Once cuffed, they are under control. If a person has a knife and I have a gun, a gun is more powerful than a knife. But I'm not going to get close to him with a knife; I'll give as much time as he needs to get rid of the knife. If he lunges at me, then I'm going to have to shoot him. But I won't shoot him just because he has a knife in his hand.

What do you take away from what's happened in Ferguson, Mo.?

If I were investigating this, I'd first go to Ferguson and speak to the people who live there. The citizens will tell me about the relationship in that community. I haven't been, but I'm willing to bet you that the past relationship was based on cops' and citizens' difficult perceptions of each other. And that's key. Because what happened in Ferguson is like a room full of gasoline, and Mike Brown's death was the lit match.

And that's what it's like in a lot of these situations — there's no relationship there to build on.

What should young black men take away?

They should take away that you can't fight the police on the street and win. You need to understand and have a strategy about collection of information. Make a written report; get a lawyer. You have to figure out how to [create] a win-win situation, and that won't happen in the street. It's not about kowtowing, it's not about being weak. It's about winning. But to win, you have to still be here. And hopefully Eric Garner and Mike Brown's deaths will create strategies that will help.

I would hope that young men and women of color continue to be interested in joining the police force, for themselves and their communities. Because they would be the safeguard [against] abuse, and they would definitely have a voice. And I can say that because it works. So I'd seriously tell them to consider jobs in the police force or fire department, because that's the only way we're going to be able to witness and deal with [abuses of] the system.",61,NA,NA,NA

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm David Greene.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

And I'm Steve Inskeep. We'll learn more now about a town that's in the headlines in the worst possible way. Ferguson, Missouri, is the scene of protests after an unarmed black teenager was killed by local police. Steve Giegerich of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch has been reporting from that town outside St. Louis.

STEVE GIEGERICH: It is an urban-suburban. It was primarily a white suburb up till about 10 or 15 years ago, and then white flight took place. White residents moved further West. Right now, it's a city of 21,000 people, two-thirds of whom are African-American.

INSKEEP: What kind of relations have existed between the community and the police?

GIEGERICH: The situation has been fraught for a number of years. I've talked to between 30 and 40 residents of Ferguson in the last three days. Every one of them has a story of being pulled over, driving while black, shopping while black, being harassed as they walked down the street. I mean, it's a commonplace story. The relationship between the police department and the residents of Ferguson is just fraught with tension.

INSKEEP: Have the police said anything about that?

GIEGERICH: They have not addressed it. Yesterday, we finally pieced together what the breakdown is as far as the number of officers on the Ferguson Police Department. There's 52 officers altogether and only three are African-American.

INSKEEP: So two-thirds African-American population, less than 10 percent African-American on the police force?

GIEGERICH: Far less than 10 percent, yeah.

INSKEEP: That's reporter Steve Giegerich with the backdrop for Saturday's shooting.

GREENE: And now there is another shooting, according to the Post-Dispatch. Police critically wounded another man last night. In this case, unlike the case on Saturday, police say the man pulled a handgun. The shooting is said to be in an area where protests have continued. NPR's David Schaper has been watching the demonstrations.

DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: The early evening skies could not have been more clear, but the tension on the streets of Ferguson hung in the air like a thick fog. Dozens of angry protesters gathered in front of the crumpled and blackened shell of a QuikTrip convenience store that rioters torched Sunday night, a day after a Ferguson police officer shot and killed unarmed, black teenager Michael Brown during a confrontation. Police have suggested that Brown and the officer were struggling for the officer's weapon, but at least two witnesses have told news outlets that Brown was raising his hands as if to surrender as the officer fired several bullets into him. Like other similar incidents elsewhere around the country, this shooting has touched a raw racial nerve here in the St. Louis area.

RASHAWN PETERSON: This is crazy. This is an outrage.

SCHAPER: This is 31-year-old Rashawn Peterson of St. Louis, who is among those protesting the shooting.

PETERSON: Our people are tired. Our people are upset. Our people are so done with this mess and we're not going to tolerate this anymore.

SCHAPER: The protesters taunted the police, shouting, hands up - don't shoot. But then St. Louis County police officers in riot gear and armored vehicles moved in to try to head off another night of violence and unrest. Protesters eventually moved on, gathering outside of a nearby church where religious and civil leaders held a community forum. They preach the need for nonviolent protest and so did the shooting victim's father, Michael Brown Sr., on the steps of the historic courthouse, downtown St. Louis, earlier in the day.

MICHAEL BROWN SR.: I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way, the right way so we can get something done about this. No violence.

SCHAPER: Standing next to Michael Brown's father and mother, the Reverend Al Sharpton called for local officials to step back and let the FBI and other federal investigators take over.

REVEREND AL SHARPTON: The local authorities have put themselves in a position - hiding names, not being transparent - where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation.

SCHAPER: Ferguson police have still not released the name of the officer who shot the 18-year-old, citing death threats.

GOVERNOR JAY NIXON: We stand together tonight reeling from what feels like an old wound that has been torn open afresh.

SCHAPER: Missouri's Democratic governor, Jay Nixon, speaking at the second of two packed community forums at local churches last night, called for reconciliation and for healing to begin. And he also urged all to have patience during the investigative process.

NIXON: While remaining uncompromising in our expectation that justice must not be simply pursued, but in fact achieved.

SCHAPER: With the eyes of the country now focused on Ferguson, even President Obama is weighing in, urging in a statement for the nation to remember the young man through reflection and understanding and finding comfort in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.

Unrest erupted after an unarmed black teenager was shot and killed by police recently in the St. Louis suburb.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Ferguson is home to just a little over 20,000 people, and about two thirds of the population is African-American. And for more on the tensions there between the black community and the police, we're going to turn to Patricia Bynes. She's African-American, and she is the Democratic committeewoman for Ferguson Township. Welcome to the program.

PATRICIA BYNES: Hi, thank you, Robert. Thank you for having me.

SIEGEL: We've all heard about how few black police officers there are in Ferguson. There aren't many black elected officials either - 1 councilman in 5. Why is that?

BYNES: Well, anything other than a presidential election there is low voter turnout. And the African-American community has been disenfranchised for a very long time. When you have people who are worrying about can I get a job - can I get to work - can I put food on the table - when election day on Tuesday comes around, that is the furthest thing from their minds. And the whites that live in the community - they participate. And so they vote for who they want for counsel and mayor, and they don't always put practices in place that are best for the majority population there.

SIEGEL: Give us a sense, though, here, has there been an ongoing dialogue - some kind of discussion about community relations in this area and in other areas of St. Louis county? Has only this tragedy brought this out into the open or how open has the talk been?

BYNES: It depends on who you talk to. If you talk to those of us who are politically engaged in the African-American community, we've been discussing this for quite a long time. For a lot of the white people, the status quo is fine for them. There's no need for a discussion. They say that things are fine, and there's a huge disconnect there.

SIEGEL: What about the looting that's taken place? Who's doing it? Are these teenagers? Are they gang members? Are they - who is it?

BYNES: I was actually out there the night of the looting. I was trying to help calm things down, and I know that the people that were looting - they don't live in Ferguson. There have been reports that have been released from people who they arrested and they highlighted that, you know, so many of them came from the city of St. Louis, and they weren't actually Ferguson people.

SIEGEL: Well, there have been so many people including Reverend Al Sharpton and local community leaders urging people not to do this. Do you have hopes for tonight at least that it will be quiet in Ferguson?

BYNES: I do not think so. Last night there was a another officer-related shooting. I actually live in the apartment complex where that took place. People want answers. They feel like there's a cover-up going on. There was supposed to be an announcement yesterday to release the name of the police officer. That didn't happen. They said they want to stick to standard protocol and only do that if there are charges pressed. So the community is outraged because, Robert, there are some things that are undisputable when it comes to the Mike Brown shooting. This young man was unarmed. This young man was shot multiple times. This young man was shot in the head. There was no ambulance that was called for this young man, and his body laid out in the street for four and a half hours.

SIEGEL: You know, when people demand the name of the police officer - and I gather the response has been they'd be concerned for the safety of the police officer. There might be threats if the police officer were identified.

BYNES: Yes.

SIEGEL: But in a place with population 20,000, I'm a little bit surprised that actually most people don't know who the police officer was. I mean...

BYNES: Robert, I was just going to tell you people in the community have told me who the police is. They know who he is. It's about, I guess, releasing it at the much larger level. But people locally know who the cop is. The kids knew him. They told me that he would harass them all the time.

SIEGEL: Ms. Bynes, thank you very much for talking with us today.

BYNES: Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

And I'm Melissa Block. There are still lots of questions about what happened on Saturday in Ferguson, Missouri, that led to the death of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown. We know he was walking down the street in the middle of the day and passed a police car. We know he was shot and killed by an officer. And even after a news conference today, we don't know much more. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said there's no video of the shooting. And he did not name the officer, something the community has been calling for in protests. As NPR's David Schaper reports from Ferguson, the lack of information continues to fuel anger.

DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: There is one new bit of new information today according to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, and it's about the officer who got into a scuffle with and then shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown.

THOMAS JACKSON: He was injured. He's got - the side of his face is swollen, but he was taken to the hospital and treated for that.

SCHAPER: But Jackson added no other new details about what led to the confrontation and the shooting. The investigation into it is being handled by St. Louis County authorities. The prosecuting attorney late today said the case will go to a grand jury for a thorough review which could take some time. And that lack of detail from officials is frustrating many Ferguson residents, including 20-year-old Marcus Mopkins.

MARCUS MOPKINS: They don't want to give out no information or say what happened or who done what. But we all know what happened.

SCHAPER: A friend who was with Brown Saturday says the police officer initiated the confrontation and shot the 18-year-old several times as he had his hands up. The initial autopsy report only says Brown died of gunshot wounds, but not how many times he had been shot. Final results won't be released for weeks. And Ferguson police won't release the name of the officer who shot the teenager - for now citing death threats. Those concerns were echoed at a community meeting last night by St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch, who says the officer will be identified if he's charged.

ROBERT MCCULLOCH: What we're also mindful of the power that we have by naming somebody. And if nothing comes of it, then we've done some damage and we don't want to do any of that. So we just don't release names until there's an actual charge filed into public record.

SCHAPER: But answers like that don't satisfy young men in Ferguson such as Marcus Mopkins.

MOPKINS: I just - I'm fed up. I'm ready to cause damage myself.

SCHAPER: But other Ferguson residents insist there are only very few of them who feel that way. Community and religious leaders continue to call for demonstrators to remain peaceful.

A march down West Florissant Avenue from Chambers Road ended at the corner of Canfield Drive, not far from where Michael Brown was shot.

A crowd of about 100 people congregated at the corner. They were surrounded on three sides by police who were keeping their distance.

Many were calmly repeating the now-familiar chant, ""No justice, no peace.""

Among them, a group of about seven young men were angrily yelling and demanding that police officials release the name of the police officer who shot Michael Brown.

Later three armored vehicles approached the crowd, which had been largely quiet and peaceful. Some members of the crowd grew agitated.

Update at 5:06 p.m. ET: Ferguson Police Chief's Remarks

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson says ""race relations is a top priority right now"" and that his department is working with the Justice Department on the matter. In a news conference Wednesday, he denied reports that a curfew was in place and clarified that the department preferred that protests end at dark because that's when ""it starts to get violent.""

He said just over 40 people have been arrested since the protests began over the weekend.

The department will be meeting with Brown's family tomorrow, he said.

In a statement issued Wednesday, the Ferguson Police Department says it ""mourns the loss of Michael Brown's life."" The department also asks ""any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner.""

Later in the statement, the agency notes that evening protests have been used as an excuse for violence, saying that those events ""are not indicative of the City of Ferguson and its residents.""

The statement is the ""first official news release"" from Ferguson police since Brown's death, local TV news {KMOV's Laura Hettiger}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/LauraKHettiger/status/499581876668227584/photo/1""> says.

The protests turned violent Sunday night, with looters breaking into shops and burning down a convenience store. The controversy has also {heightened racial tensions}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/12/339850929/in-ferguson-calls-for-calm-and-justice-after-teen-s-death""> in a town with a population that is two-thirds black and whose police force reportedly has three black members.

Tuesday night, dozens of protesters chanted what has become a familiar phrase in Ferguson: ""Hands up; don't shoot"" — a reference to witnesses' statements that Brown had his hands up when the fatal shots were fired.

As NPR's David Schaper reports from St. Louis, last night's demonstrations were met with police in riot gear and armored vehicles who urged them to disperse.

""Everybody's peaceful at this point, nobody's bothering anybody. What do they do? They come out here with guns,"" Rashawn Peterson, 31, tells David in a report for today's {Morning Edition}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/"">. ""And they looked like they were going to shoot somebody. And we've got children over here. Children. Women. Innocent people bothering nobody.""

David says, ""The crowd did peacefully move on to another location, though the racially charged tension remained thick.""

Many of the protesters gathered outside St. Mark Family Church, where Brown's parents and the Rev. Al Sharpton spoke about his death and attended a church service.

""Respect the family!"" Sharpton told those present. ""They haven't even buried their son — don't go out there and start stuff in his name.""

Earlier Tuesday, Michael Brown Sr. spoke about his son in downtown St. Louis, saying he knew that the community in Ferguson was in pain.

""But I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,"" he said, ""so we can get something done about this. No violence.""",747,NA,NA,NA

Shooting Aftermath,Steve Inskeep (host),08/14/2014,01/20/2016,"When police officers gathered up everyone at a Ferguson McDonald's, 2 reporters were also picked up. Steve Inskeep talks to Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post, who was one of the reporters arrested.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Police in Ferguson took two reporters into custody last night. One was Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post. He says he was in a McDonald's, charging his phone and working along with a reporter from The Huffington Post, and police came in to clear the restaurant because of a protest down the street. Lowery took video of that moment, including video of police telling him to stop taking video.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)

UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Grab your stuff. Let's go.

WESLEY LOWERY: I'm working on it.

UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Stop videotaping. Let's grab our stuff and go.

LOWERY: (Unintelligible) I have a right to videotape you, sir?

UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Hurry up. Let's go.

LOWERY: Please don't wave your gun at me.

UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Let's go.

INSKEEP: Wesley Lowery says he was on his way out as ordered when there was confusion about which door he should use.

LOWERY: And then, as I turned to go to the door they were directing me, my backpack, which had only been hooked over one shoulder, started to slide off of my shoulder. I said, officers, I just need to adjust my backpack. Give me one second. And that's when they said, all right, let's take him. And they threw me up against the soda machine, put plastic restraints on the backs of my hand, told me I was resisting arrest and then eventually led me outside.

INSKEEP: You said resisting arrest. Does that mean you were formally arrested?

LOWERY: Well, in some ways it's a technicality. I was taken into custody. Officers on the scene told me I was under arrest. They told me that I was going to be charged with trespassing in the McDonald's where we were customers. But after we were in detention maybe 20 minutes, it got out there on social media that two reporters had just been forcibly removed and arrested from this McDonald's. Other reporters, friends and colleagues started calling in to the police station to inquire. And once word got to the police chief, he ordered our immediate release.

INSKEEP: I want to try to get into the shoes of the police officers to the extent that you can. Are they a little tense at this point, after one of their number was accused of killing an unarmed civilian, and others have faced violent protests?

LOWERY: They're extremely tense. And I think it's important to remember how long this has been going on. This has been going on since Saturday, Sunday night. We're doing five, six days - almost a week of this every single day, every single night. You have to remember, the police officers are facing some threats to their livelihood. I've been out here every night since Monday. And what I've seen often, while I've not seen what I would describe as riots, per se - I have not seen any looting - as we get into the late-night, there is some troublemaking going on. And so I understand. Police officers are - certainly seem to be on edge. Again, this was during daylight. This was not out on the street with hundreds or dozens of people. This was in a McDonald's with five people and maybe six officers. So it's hard to apply that to the situation.

INSKEEP: You know, I have a question about a detail, how the police are outfitted. We had an interview with a veteran law enforcement official some weeks ago on this program who pointed out his own experience that, as a police chief, when he sent cops into a crowd who were in soft gear, just looked like ordinary police officers on the street, they were able to talk with and interact with the crowd, and things were not so violent. But if he sent cops into an area in riot gear, ready for combat, it seemed somehow to encourage combat or lead to combat. How are the police outfitted in Ferguson right now?

LOWERY: You know, when I spoke with a resident earlier today, he said to me, when I go somewhere and see a cop in riot gear, first thing I think is, riot. When I see someone who's ready to fight and looks like they're ready to fight me, I'm going to put up my fists. The cops here are dressed in any number of ways, but many of them are in riot gear and SWAT gear, driving armored vehicles, carrying very heavy weapons and using, in fact, heavy - weather it be rubber bullets or teargas - the artillery these police officers are caring with them is very heavy. This is not standard issued stuff. This is the type of stuff you see National Guards employ, not what you expect to see from a police officer in suburban St. Louis.

INSKEEP: And have protesters provoked the police in any way?

LOWERY: At times, yes. There have been people who've thrown rocks. There have been people who've taunted them, people who have not complied. But I would say that's a - probably a small minority of the people. We're talking about hundreds of people protesting over the course of days. Most of the interactions I've seen on the behalf of the protesters have been nonviolent - frustrated, certainly, angry, certainly - as is all of their right. But I've seen, for the most part, respectful protests and certainly not violent protests other than, like I said, a few troublemakers well after the sun goes down each night. But for the most part, especially during the day, I think we're seeing emotional but reasonable protests.

INSKEEP: Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post, thanks very much.

LOWERY: Anytime.

INSKEEP: And by the way, we have reached out to the Ferguson police for comment - didn't hear back yet, but we're going to keep trying as we continue hearing many voices from Ferguson, Missouri.",46,NA,NA,NA

Community frustration has only escalated since the police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager on Saturday. Ferguson's police chief called for calm, while reiterating that he will not release the name of the officer who shot Brown. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon also spoke out for more peaceful relations between police and protesters.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

The tension on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, seems to have been reduced this evening. So far, protests have been peaceful. That's after four days of standoffs between police in riot gear and angry demonstrators shouting at them. Protests have turned violent each night since the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown last weekend. Tonight there is a different police presence on the streets, and that has prompted a different atmosphere in Ferguson. NPR's Cheryl Corley is there, and she joins us now. Cheryl, what's the police presence like there today?

CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: It's a lot lighter first of all, Robert, I must say. And the police that are here are not in any kind of riot gear at all. They are walking through the crowds. They are talking with people. They are interacting with folks much differently than they have been doing in the past few days or so. You still hear the chants from people here about hands up, don't shoot. But it's calmer. There's lots of horn honking and just people coming out and being outside. A man just rode by on a pony. So - entirely different here tonight.

SIEGEL: Well, explain who is now leading the police operation in Ferguson, Missouri.

CORLEY: Governor Nixon made an announcement at a press conference this afternoon that he was bringing in the highway patrol to lead the security here. And the man that he named is Captain Ronald Johnson. He has been part of the highway patrol for some time. And he's also been a part of this area. You know, a lot has been made, Robert, about the fact that - in the Ferguson police department, the majority of the officers there are white with only three African-Americans. Well, the captain is an African-American, and today he wanted to make sure that people just knew that he had a connection to the community, and here's what he said.

(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)

RONALD JOHNSON: I grew up here, and this is currently my community and my home. And therefore, it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence, diffuse the tension and build trust, showing the utmost respect for every interaction with every citizen.

CORLEY: And that, again, is Captain Ronald Johnson who is leading the security efforts here in Ferguson tonight.

SIEGEL: Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson spoke to the media this afternoon and he commented on why, before tonight, there had been such a heavy show of force by police in riot gear using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters.

CORLEY: You know, it was very interesting what he had to say. He talked about the fighting here and what seemed like a very military presence in Ferguson. And Chief Jackson said that the whole picture of what has been happening was just being painted sideways. He said the action that was being taken was being done by those in blue, mainly by the police and not the military. And when he was asked what went into that decision about firing tear gas or rubber bullets into a crowd, here's what he had to say.

(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)

THOMAS JACKSON: Those decisions were made by the tactical commanders on the ground, and it was based on the threat - the threat of violence. If individuals are in a crowd that's attacking the police, they need to get out of that crowd.

CORLEY: And the police chief is no longer in charge here tonight, and as you mentioned, it's just a totally different atmosphere.

SIEGEL: Cheryl, President Obama also addressed the nation earlier today from Martha's Vineyard. He spoke about two things - Iraq, but also what's happening in Ferguson.

CORLEY: Absolutely. He said he wanted everyone to take a step back and to think about how to move forward - that he had gotten an update from the attorney general and repeated that it was the Department of Justice - he had the Department of Justice and the FBI doing an independent look into the death of Michael. And he said it was just important to remember how this started out with the death of and 18-year-old. The president said there was really no excuse for violence against police - no excuse for police to use excessive force. And he knew that there was going to be differences of opinion, but here's what he had to say when he talked, again, just about moving forward.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Now's the time for healing. Now's the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now's the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

We're going to hear voices now from Ferguson, Missouri, a community still in distress over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, shot and killed last Saturday by a Ferguson police officer. The young African-American was unarmed. We begin with NPR's David Schaper, who reports on the fears of some parents for their boys and young men of color.

DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: The late afternoon protest march through the neighborhood in which Michael Brown was shot began peacefully under the watchful eyes of a heavy police presence.

(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Please continue down Canfield or West Florissant. Please continue moving peacefully, as you have been.

SCHAPER: The march ended in front of what's left of a convenience store that was torched by rioters Sunday night. It's the location where hundreds of protesters have been gathering every night since amid rising racial tensions here. But this time, at least initially, the atmosphere was not nearly as agitated.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

UNIDENTIFIED CHOIR: (Singing, unintelligible).

SCHAPER: A local church conducted a street revival of sorts from a flatbed trailer, and a group of young girls marched into the street with a serious message.

(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)

UNIDENTIFIED GIRLS: Mike Brown. Justice for Mike Brown. Justice for Mike Brown. Justice for Mike Brown.

SCHAPER: But the atmosphere began to change as the sun went down. The youngsters of the church groups left, and the crowd that remained took up angry chants.

(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Yelling) Hands up.

UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Yelling) Don't shoot.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Yelling) Hands up.

UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Yelling) Don't shoot.

SCHAPER: Police in riot gear surrounded the demonstration area with some officers in armored vehicles aiming their guns at the crowd while police helicopters hovered overhead. City officials have urged protesters to disperse after dark. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson stresses that the city is not imposing any kind of curfew.

THOMAS JACKSON: We're just asking that protests be peaceful. We understand the anger. We understand that people want answers. And we understand that we've got a problem.

SCHAPER: And Chief Jackson acknowledges that that problem is poor race relations.

ANTHONY ROSS: It's the constant pressure of every time a police officer soldiers get behind us, that we're gripping the steering wheel.

SCHAPER: Standing in protest outside of Ferguson's police department, 26-year-old Anthony Ross of neighboring Berkeley describes what it's like to be a young, black male in this area.

ROSS: Every time you see a cop, it's like, all right, am I going to get messed with? You feel that way every single time you get behind your car - every time.

SCHAPER: And Ross says as difficult as it is to cope with himself, he says it's a heartbreaking lesson to give to his children.

ROSS: As a father, I should not have to teach my kids how to be arrested. I should not have to teach my son to do everything possible to make sure that you are not killed out here in these streets when a police officer pulls you over.

SCHAPER: It's difficult for mothers of black boys, too, as Amy Hunter told an overflowing crowd at an area community forum on the Michael Brown shooting earlier this week.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

AMY HUNTER: There is no other people on earth that I love more than my children. And I would really like to stop being afraid every time they leave my house.

(APPLAUSE)

SCHAPER: Hunter says one of her sons was stopped and patted down by an officer while walking home when he was just 12.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HUNTER: And then he looked at me, and he said, Mom, how long will this happen to me? And I said, for the rest of your life.

SCHAPER: It is with the searing memories of those kinds of experiences that protesters such as 20-year-old Marcus Mopkins of Ferguson says make him just fed up. He says he will continue to demonstrate every night, even if there's violence.

MARCUS MOPKINS: From the looks of it, I don't think that this will never end - from the looks of it. I don't think they'll ever stop.

""For the past several days, we've all been deeply troubled by this crisis,"" Nixon said, ""as the pain of last weekend's tragedy has been compounded by days of grief, and nights of conflict and fear.""

He added that this ""is not what Missouri's about,"" and that the diverse community has looked ""a little bit more like a war zone,"" which he said was unacceptable.

The police response to days of protests in the St. Louis suburb so far has drawn criticism.

On Wednesday, police used helicopters, armored vehicles and the threat of arrests to try to control an area that's been torn by racial tension and outrage over the shooting of Brown this past weekend.

Several high-profile arrests were made Wednesday, the fourth night of clashes since looting and other violence broke out Sunday. Among those taken into custody were St. Louis Alderman {Antonio French}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench"">, as well as reporters from {The Washington Post}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html?hpid=z1""> and {Huffington Post}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/huffington-post-reporter-arrested-ferguson_n_5676829.html"">.

The journalists were seized after they were told to leave a fast-food restaurant; they were also asked for their IDs and told to stop taking photos. On Wednesday, police in Ferguson asked protesters to not hold demonstrations after dark.

""This was during daylight. This was not out on the street with hundreds or dozens of people,"" Wesley Lowery of the Post said on today's {Morning Edition}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/"">. ""This was in a McDonald's, with five people, and maybe six officers.""

In his first-person account for the Post, Lowery writes that he and The Huffington Post's Ryan J. Reilly were rounded up as they worked (the Wi-Fi and power outlets at McDonald's have made it popular with journalists in Ferguson).

Lowery says the officers wouldn't identify themselves. He was taken into custody after he asked to adjust his backpack — ""and they threw me up against the soda machine, put plastic restraints on the backs of my hands, told me I was resisting arrest.""

The two journalists, who had tweeted photos of the confrontation, were quickly released after media contacted the Ferguson police chief seeking comment.

After his release, Lowery tweeted, ""I'm emotional, but need to note: Ryan and I are fine. Have seen people in Ferguson hurt by gas/rubber bullets. This wasn't that.""

Videos from Ferguson's streets Wednesday night show clouds of tear gas rolling through streets lit with klieg lights and helicopter spotlights, after multiple rounds of gas canisters were fired.

In video posted by {local TV news KSDK}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/videos/news/local/2014/08/14/14042891/"">, police fired a round of tear gas that landed at the feet of a reporting crew from Al Jazeera, which had been taping a report. After the crew ran to escape the fumes, a SWAT vehicle drove to where they had set up, and officers in gas masks dismantled the crew's equipment as another officer swept the nearby area with his rifle.

The military-style equipment and riot gear being used by police in Ferguson has attracted national attention — and the ire of many residents.

The Post's Lowery tells Steve that one man in Ferguson told him, ""When I go somewhere and see a cop in riot gear, first thing I think is, 'riot.' When I see someone that looks like they're ready to fight me, I'm going to put up my fists.""

He adds that while the police in Ferguson are dressed in a variety of uniforms, ""many of them are in riot gear, SWAT gear, carrying very heavy weapons."" He adds that the officers' weapons and munitions are ""not standard-issue stuff. This is the type of stuff that you see National Guards employ, not what you expect to see from a police officer in suburban St. Louis.""

The use of ""hardened"" gear by police came up in {a recent interview}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/2014/07/18/332286063/transcript-commissioner-kerlikowskes-full-interview""> between NPR's Steve Inskeep and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske, the former police chief of Seattle.

Discussing his efforts to cope with protests and rowdy crowds, Kerlikowske said, ""To tell you the truth, it makes it pretty difficult, when you're talking from behind a face shield with a gas mask, to engage with the public and say, 'Look, let's, let's tone this down. Let's calm things down. ... It's pretty hard to engage in those discussions when you're hardened up.""

But, Kerlikowske said, he also took into account the view of the police guild, which said, ""The officers would be in danger if they weren't in hardened gear.""

Missouri's Gov. Jay Nixon plans to visit the Ferguson area today.

""The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans. While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble, and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.""

He added, ""I ask that members of the community demonstrate patience and calm while the investigation continues, and I urge law enforcement agencies to keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press during this difficult time.""

Update at 4:55 p.m. ET.: The Governor Announces Security Changes

Gov. Nixon announced changes in the supervision of security in Ferguson at a news conference:

""Immediate security responsibilities will now be directed by Missouri State Highway Patrol, who have proven themselves time and again when Missourians have needed them the most,"" he said.

In charge of the highway patrol is Capt. Ronald Johnson, who grew up in — and currently lives in — the community.

""I appreciate the significance of this responsibility, and the fact that this community and state and the nation are looking for law enforcement leadership that protects and serves our citizens,"" he said.

Johnson added that it ""means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence, defuse tension and build trust, showing the utmost respect for every interaction with every citizen.""

Of the criticisms that have been leveled at police for their efforts to control crowds and their military-style gear, Jackson said, ""We're going to talk about not only the tactics, but the appearance.""

Jackson also said any protesters who are in a crowd from which objects are being thrown at police should get themselves out of that crowd. And Jackson denied that journalists had been intentionally singled out.

""The media is not a target,"" he said.

Jackson also refuted a claim by the hacker group Anonymous, which earlier today claimed to release the name of the officer who shot Michael Brown. He has stated that the name wouldn't be released, due to death threats against the officer.

NPR's Cheryl Corley, reporting for our Newscast unit, said that it was an entirely different atmosphere on the streets of Ferguson Thursday night compared to the past several days of protests.

""There's no riot gear, nobody with guns [or] rubber bullets,"" Corley says. ""In fact we hardly see police around this evening.""

She said the few officers who were around walked through the crowds and were even talking with people gathered.

""I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,"" Obama said. ""But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.""

The president said that regardless of the circumstances of Brown's death, there is no excuse for the police to use excessive force and there is ""never an excuse for violence against police, nor for anyone to use this as a cover for vandalizing or looting.

""Now is the time of healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,"" he said.

""It is clear that the scenes playing out in the streets of Ferguson over the last several nights cannot continue,"" Holder said.

In his first, detailed remarks since the police-involved shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown last Saturday, the attorney general described the burgeoning federal response.

A civil rights investigation into Brown's death — led by federal prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in Missouri, civil rights lawyers in Washington, and the FBI — has been announced. Holder spoke by phone Thursday with Brown's family, a law enforcement source said, and promised that the investigation would be thorough and independent.

The Justice Department is taking two additional steps, Holder said.

First, the Community Relations Service, a peacemaking and reconciliation unit set up to mediate civil rights struggles in the 1960s in the American South, has dispatched officials to Missouri to meet with law enforcement, civic, and faith leaders to try to reduce tensions.

""Over time, these conversations should consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities,"" Holder said, nodding to local concerns that the Ferguson police force is overwhelmingly white and male.

Missouri's attorney general has cited the force in a report for stopping African-Americans twice as often as whites, and the local NAACP has complained about similar practices by the St. Louis County police.

Holder also said local authorities have accepted his offer of technical assistance from other parts of the Justice Department ""in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessary and extreme displays of force.""

Protesters say they've been hit by wooden and rubber bullets from SWAT teams in riot gear, who have filled the streets with armored vehicles and tear gas.

""This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution,"" said U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who spoke with Holder by phone Thursday.

The attorney general said in his statement that he wants to reduce tension, not heighten it.

""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" he added.

Holder denounced episodes of looting and attempts to ""antagonize"" the heavily armed local police, but he urged authorities in the St. Louis suburb to do more to respect the rights of protesters and reporters covering the unrest.

Holder offered no deadline for the federal civil rights investigation. But one person familiar with the investigation who requested anonymity because the matter is pending said U.S. authorities had already interviewed Dorian Johnson, who told reporters he was standing nearby when a policeman shot his friend Michael Brown.

Prominent civil and human rights advocates are calling on the Justice Department to do even more. Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, urged the attorney general ""to undertake a comprehensive federal review of each instance of police violence against African-Americans.""

Ifill's letter mentioned several recent police-involved deaths of unarmed black men that have undermined public confidence in the justice system. She said racial bias training and body cameras for police could help restore trust.

""Violent deaths like Michael Brown's happen all too frequently and will continue to occur without meaningful accountability,"" Ifill wrote. ""The DOJ must utilize its substantial resources to take significant, proactive steps to curb police violence on communities of color.""",387,NA,NA,NA

Tracie Keesee, co-founder of the Center for Policing Equity at UCLA, about efforts to diversify police forces nationwide, the impact that diversity has on communities and the challenges in recruiting minorities to the profession.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

And I'm Melissa Block. The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the subsequent protests have brought to light a common disparity. The population of Ferguson is about two thirds black. Of the 53 members of its police force just three are black. While diversification of Police Departments has been a goal since the early 1970s, smaller forces in particular remain largely white and male. For more on the challenges of recruiting a diverse police force, we called on Tracie Keesee. She's cofounder of the Center for Policing Equity at UCLA and also a 25 year veteran of the Denver Police Department. Her views expressed here are her own, not those of the Denver Police.

TRACIE KEESEE: One of the things that you have to look at when you talk about diversifying police organizations is that you have qualifications for folks and the last thing you want to do is to start to change or lower, which has always been a topic of discussion - those types of requirements. Another level that has to be examined as well is the relationship - the historical relationship between communities of color and Police Departments. I can speak from my own experience as, you know, an African-American police officer. When I told my parents that this is something that I wanted to do they were very concerned.

BLOCK: Really? What did they say?

KEESEE: You know, my mother being from the South - the historical issues in the South with the police and during the civil rights movement, there was a true concern for my safety. And the belief that something may happen to me - not necessarily from someone from my own community but from something or someone inside of the police department. Those types of sentiments really still exist in the communities of color.

BLOCK: I want to play some tape for you. This is from our reporter who was in Ferguson, Missouri, last night. And police from elsewhere in the county were facing off with protesters. And there were three black police officers among a couple of dozen white police officers and let's listen to what one of the protesters yelled at them.

(SOUNDBITE OF PROTESTERS)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: You all better wake up and see what's going on, man. It's hurting us, man, when we see her own kind against our own kind.

BLOCK: So he's saying it's hurting us when we see our own kind against our own kind. I'd be curious to hear your reaction as you listen to that.

KEESEE: Well, absolutely. This is what the officers experiencing of what we call a double-bind. And I can tell you I've been in that position. And what happens is that you've chosen a profession that you are trying to serve honorably but you are very aware of the historical relationships that have occurred between law enforcement or your chosen profession and the community in which you grew up in. And it's a very stressful time for those officers and I'm telling you it's hurtful. It's hurtful for those officers. But it's also a reality that it's being spoken from the community. And I can probably tell you without even seeing the tape that those officers are doing exactly what they were assigned to do. And that is to hold the line, to make sure that violence hopefully doesn't escalate. But it is a very difficult situation and I think it highlights the reason why Chiefs have a problem recruiting from different communities of colors because of those types of things as well.

BLOCK: Is there any evidence that having a more racially diverse police force correlates with fewer complaints - complaints about police brutality or harassment?

KEESEE: You know, the research on that is very spotty. What the research tells us is that, you know, does diversity help? Of course it does. It always helps psychologically and it helps from a sometimes - a communication standpoint. But a lot of times if you have someone that is not prepared to do that job there's also a tendency for overcompensation in that job. And what I mean is that you have folks that can reflect the community that at that at times happen to be even more violent than the larger group that most folks are angry at. So does it help reduce things? I think in some cases it may. I think that's an area in which it still needs to be researched. But I think that you cannot just for the sake of having a face that looks like yours have someone in an organization that's not prepared to be able to communicate and understand what the community concerns to help try to make those things better.

BLOCK: Tracy Keesee, when you look at what's been going on in Ferguson, Missouri, and the escalation of violence and tension do you get any sense, based on your experience with policing and diversity, that things would be different if there were more black police officers on the force there?

KEESEE: You know, you can't really say that. You don't know. That's the unknown. We certainly need to take a greater look at that. I don't think any one thing can say, if you had more of one would this make that go away? I just don't think that would be the right approach.

BLOCK: Not that simple.

KEESEE: No, it's not that simple.

BLOCK: Tracy Keesee is cofounder of the Center for Policing Equity at UCLA. She's also a captain with the Denver Police Department. Thank you so much.

KEESEE: And thank you.",19,NA,NA,NA

After two nights of violent clashes this week, neighboring Jennings School District is out of class, too.

So this morning, instead of being in the classroom, 150 area teachers took part in some unusual professional development: picking up broken glass, water bottles and tear gas canisters from the street.

""It says 'Defense Technology' on it,"" says social studies teacher Arthur Vambaketes, showing off a busted canister from his trash bag.

The unrest in this St. Louis-area town straddles two school districts — Ferguson and Jennings. Jennings had already started school last week, but since some of the district's schools border parts of a hub for nightly street clashes, officials called off classes early Tuesday morning and notified parents with phone calls and text messages.

""Our students have no buses in the district — we walk to school — so as a safety concern, our children come first,"" says special education teacher Miya Moore.

Jennings is also a district where a majority of students live below the poverty line. So many Jennings kids rely on free and reduced lunch that, even though classes are canceled, the meals are not.

""We're building up the community,"" says Tiffany Anderson, the Jennings School District superintendent. She has organized the teachers helping with cleanup, is offering meal deliveries for students with special needs, and has mental health services at the ready.

""Kids are facing challenges. This is unusual, but violence, when you have over 90 percent free and reduced lunch, is not unusual,"" Anderson says. ""Last week, I met with several high school students, some of whom who are out here helping clean up. And we talked a little bit about how you express and have a voice in positive ways.""

Around town, young people are expressing themselves. Over the weekend, Jennings District student Leslie Adams, 12, decorated a handmade sign with pink glitter. It reads ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot,"" a reference to Michael Brown, the slain teen whose still-unexplained killing at the hands of police started the unrest.

The nightly police clashes happen around the corner from where Adams and her friends play. ""At first I was absolutely, absolutely scared,"" she says. ""But then, since I was watching the news, I understood that it was history that was going on.""

Social studies teacher Arthur Vambaketes says he's going to be talking through this still-unfolding civic event with his students.

""I don't know what the answers are,"" he says. ""There's definitely a class issue here, just as much as there is a race issue. There has to be some kind of legislative action taken.""

The calls for action range widely in this community; demands for justice can mean so many things. Some locals want the county prosecutor replaced. Others call for the arrest of Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown.

For their part, the educators want to provide support during a difficult time.

""We like to tell kids we're a lifeline. And that's really the message that we're giving today. We're a lifeline. And everyone in this community is a lifeline,"" superintendent Anderson says.

This school year is not starting out like the rest — but teachers hope some lasting lessons will come out of it.",136,NA,NA,NA

Protests erupted after the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer Saturday. For many, the fear and frustration is familiar.

Amid the demonstrations Wednesday, the Rev. Willis Johnson tried to talk down 18-year-old Joshua Wilson. A photo in the Washington Post showed the two in a powerful moment.

Johnson says police were ordering protesters to move aside as police advanced, and that he was trying to keep Wilson out of harm's way.

He says he was not attempting to discourage protest.

""If anything it was to affirm him — and to affirm both of us — because in that moment, we were being disaffirmed,"" Johnson tells NPR's Melissa Block. ""We were being told ... that what we were doing was wrong, and it was not wrong.""

Johnson, the father of a teenager and pastor of Wellspring Church in Ferguson, had never met Joshua Wilson personally. But, he says, ""I've met 'Joshuas.' "" In fact, he says, he's been Joshua.

Interview Highlights

On why he was trying to get Wilson out of the way

I just embraced him. Because he was so angry, and you could feel it in his body, you could feel it in his speech. ... Something just said, ""Grab him. Hold him."" Maybe initially to keep him back, but ultimately to become what really is symbolic of the situation ... at hand.

People who are hurting need to be affirmed in their hurt; people who are angry need to be affirmed in their anger. Let me say it like this: I needed that as much as he needed that. We kept each other from harm's way and from doing something that we would need not to do. ...

If you're going to fuss and cuss and be mad, I want you to do it with me. Do it in my ear. And at the same time, I just begin to pray with him and to say, ""Give him the strength — give us the strength — to be courageous enough not to do what they expect us to do.""

On knowing many ""Joshuas""

I had not met [Joshua Willis] personally, but I've met Joshuas. I was 18 once, and a young black male. I have a young man that I'm trying to grow. ... People may not understand, but many of us look to the eyes of young people — doesn't matter about color, doesn't matter about the things people assume. This is not a race issue, in and of itself. This is a human issue. ...

And if you're honest and you're true, you can't help but look at other people and look at situations and say, ""But by the grace of God go you — and me."" That's what I saw. ... I've met too many men in the last four days, five days, of every age. And no matter how old we are, we all remember and know that that is us, in some shape, form or fashion.

Because when I get pulled over, even with my credentialed and degreed ... self, I revert back to that 18-year-old and the things that my father told me about what to do when the police stop you.

On events in Ferguson touching a nerve

I am not alone. It's that way for all of us, because that is the human nature that we live. That is us. If it's not touching you, if it's not personal, that's where there's a problem.

On Johnson's father's concern for his safety

It's an intergenerational thing: to know that my father fears for me at 39 the same way he feared for me at 18 today. He texts me every morning and says, ""I'm praying for you. Do what you've got to do, but be careful."" He shouldn't have to say that, and I shouldn't have to say that and feel that way for my son or my daughter — or anyone's son or daughter. We want the cycle to stop.",170,NA,NA,NA

Some black residents say that long before Brown's death, they saw the police as a potential threat.

""It's the constant pressure of every time a police officer gets behind us, we're gripping the steering wheel,"" Anthony Ross, 26, of neighboring Berkeley tells NPR's David Schaper. He added, ""Everything on the car is right.""

""Every time you see a cop, it's like, 'Am I going to get messed with?' You feel that way every single time you get behind [the wheel]. Every time.""

Ross, who spoke to David at a daytime protest outside Ferguson's police department, said he wanted to add one more point, about his fears for his children:

""As a father of two girls and one son, I should not have to teach my kids how to be arrested. I can teach my kids about how to avoid ignorant people. I can't teach my kids on how to avoid ignorant police officers. I should not have to teach my son to do everything possible to make sure that you're not killed out here on these streets when a police officer pulls you over.""

Speaking about the police in a church forum earlier this week, resident Amy Hunter told an overflowing crowd, ""There is no other people on Earth that I love more than my children. And I would really like to stop being afraid every time they leave my house.""

She told the story of her son being stopped while walking home, so he could be patted down and questioned by a police officer. The incident left the boy, who was 12 at the time, in tears.

""And then he looked at me and he said, 'Mom, how long will this happen to me?' "" Hunter told the audience. ""And I said, 'For the rest of your life.' ""

Another element that's come into play during the protests and outbursts of violence since Brown's death is the increasingly militarized and ""hardened"" appearance of the police. This week, people who live in Ferguson are seeing police in tactical gear at barricades, and men armed with heavy weapons sitting atop armored vehicles.

""America has been quietly arming its police for battle since the early 1990s,"" reports {Newsweek}<hyperlink=""http://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537"">, which explains a federal program that lets many state and federal police agencies receive weapons, ammunition and other gear from the Department of Defense, in a move that was initially made as part of the U.S. war on drugs.

The subject of how municipal police departments receive military-grade equipment was the subject of a {New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=0""> article earlier this summer. Here's a sentence that sums it up:

""During the Obama administration, according to Pentagon data, police departments have received tens of thousands of machine guns; nearly 200,000 ammunition magazines; thousands of pieces of camouflage and night-vision equipment; and hundreds of silencers, armored cars and aircraft.""

As we noted in our {earlier post on the day's news in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/14/340315497/tear-gas-and-arrests-ferguson-police-and-protesters-face-off"">, a former police chief — who's the current head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection — says there are conflicting impulses over whether to deploy police in ""soft"" or ""hardened"" gear.

On one hand are concerns for officers' safety, Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske told NPR's Steve Inskeep. On the other, he said, is the idea that it's difficult to defuse tension in the streets ""when you're hardened up.""

That same idea came up in a {Morning Edition}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/""> interview today. Comparing the police in Ferguson to the National Guard, Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery quotes one man there who told him, ""When I go somewhere and see a cop in riot gear, first thing I think is, 'Riot.' When I see someone that looks like they're ready to fight me, I'm going to put up my fists.""

Update at 1:35 p.m. ET: Police Chief Discusses Shift In Tactics

The head of Ferguson's police department says his officers will try to ease the tensions that have risen during recent protests, by ""facilitating"" the demonstrations rather than restricting them.

""With the chaos that's going on right now, I'm at least happy that nobody's gotten seriously injured,"" Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said at a news conference this afternoon.

Of the criticisms that have been leveled at police for their efforts to control crowds and their military-style gear, Jackson said, ""We're going to talk about not only the tactics, but the appearance.""",747,NA,NA,NA

The 18-year-old's death Saturday — and the circumstances surrounding it — have laid bare the intersections of race and class and social justice, not just in the 70 percent black suburb, but in the national response to it.

""What happened to Mike Brown — what is happening in Ferguson right now — will enter into our classrooms when the students come back one way or another,"" says Chris Lehmann, the founding principal of the {Science Leadership Academy}<hyperlink=""http://www.scienceleadership.org/""> in Philadelphia.

But how do parents and educators talk about what happened there, and if you do, how do they do it well?

""If we are intentional and thoughtful in our own planning and work,"" Lehmann says, ""we have a better chance of being the adults our kids need us to be to help them deal with their own thoughts.""

Ignoring the shooting and sticking to the syllabus, {Lehmann wrote in a blog post}<hyperlink=""http://practicaltheory.org/blog/2014/08/13/what-do-we-teach-when-kids-are-dying-michaelbrown/"">, isn't an option.

On the parent side, of course there's ""the talk."" Not about the birds and the bees or where babies come from, but the conversation many black parents have with their kids about what it means to be black in America, and how to get out of the experience alive. It's the kitchen-table, real talk about what to do when you're confronted by police.

But in many places in America, the conversation about Michael Brown might be more likely to happen in the classroom than around the dinner table.

And teachers need to be ready for that, says Lehmann. ""To pretend that this does not enter our classrooms, our schools, is to run the risk of allowing ourselves to be complicit in the system that left Mike Brown's body in the street for hours,"" he wrote.

Erin Stevenson, a high school history and law teacher in Rhode Island, said she's excited to hear what her students are thinking about the events in Ferguson.

""One of the things that struck me when I started reading about Ferguson via Twitter was protesters using 'I Am a Man' signs,"" she said, noting that it's a phrase that grew out of the Memphis Sanitation Strike during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. ""I wondered how many younger people — my students especially — know the historical significance of that phrase.""

Stevenson says this will definitely come up in her law classes when school begins in September.

""When students can compare and contrast a social issue today to the text of the First Amendment, that's when they actually understand it, and it's applicable to their lives,"" she says.

What Does The Conversation Look Like?

Part of knowing how to talk with students about killings like Brown's is a willingness on the part of educators to engage in a dialogue that might make them uncomfortable.

""It highlights one of the crises that schools are facing right now where we're seeing the changing demographics of students in the classroom, and the teaching population remains overwhelmingly white,"" says Audrey Watters, a former college teacher who now writes about education. ""Many educators are unfortunately deeply uncomfortable, and perhaps even unwilling to address their white privilege, and have a hard time addressing the lived reality of their students.""

She concedes that talking to students about violence and racial issues is never easy.

""It can be really hard to create a safe space where you want people to feel comfortable,"" Watters says. ""One of the jobs of a teacher is to push students to think more critically, to challenge them to evaluate themselves and the world around them. But you don't want to double the trauma.""

Brown's death certainly isn't the only time educators have had to confront questions from kids that speak to the intersection of race, class, law and justice.

Think back to the 2012 killing in Florida of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, who was later acquitted in Martin's death. Or the outrage later that same year over the murder of Jordan Davis, an unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed near a Florida gas station after an encounter in which the shooter, Michael Dunn, felt his life was threatened.

Davis' death spurred more than a dozen teachers from across the country to organize and {create a syllabus}<hyperlink=""http://practicaltheory.org/blog/2014/02/17/teaching-about-the-jordan-davis-murder/""> for helping ""young people grapple with and address the messiness of the world around them.""

Melinda Anderson, a self-described ""parent activist"" and education writer, was among the group. After Davis' death, Anderson recalls, many teachers said they wanted to have meaningful conversations with students but didn't know where to start.

""We said, let's give them a resource. Let's break down the resistance or the lack of information,"" she says. ""Students should have the opportunity to express and to wrestle with what they are seeing. Teachers have a responsibility to help kids find their own voice and to really empower them with strategies for changing this messed-up world we inhabit.""

Who's In The Room?

One thing the curriculum suggests — which isn't unique to Davis' death — is that teachers should pay attention to who's in the room, and tackle the conversation accordingly.

""If it is a predominately white classroom, please don't use the minority student as the 'expert informant' whose job it is to 'tell it like it is,' "" they write. ""That's a whole lot of pressure to put on a kid. On the same note, if you teach in a school where students are mostly African-American (or students of color in general), share how you feel about it, how it makes you angry and sad. Then give them space to talk about it.""

Anderson is a parent too, and she says she expects to hear her son's teacher address Brown's killing when school begins in less than two weeks.

""To me, one of his teachers can't walk into his classroom with the lesson plan that was developed August 1 and not talk about Mike Brown in Ferguson,"" she says.

Of course, that's not always so easy. Teachers and schools at the start of the school year face all kinds of demands on the limited class time they have with students.

Erin Stevenson says even so, it's a conversation that needs to happen.

""Ultimately, I care more that my students are informed, engaged, active citizens of the world,"" she says. ""If they don't care to pay attention or don't feel it affects them, then I haven't done my job.""",77,NA,NA,NA

The equipment is passed on with the intent to fight drugs and terrorism, but it was on display in Ferguson, Mo., where it was used for crowd control during protests there.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

In Ferguson, Missouri, this week, police have been more than well-armed. They were equipped with military-style weapons. This show of force to control crowds has drawn angry criticism from protesters. But the use of military equipment by police isn't unique to Ferguson. It reflects a broader trend nationwide.

Many call it the militarization of law enforcement and a lot of that equipment comes from the Pentagon. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth every year is sent to police and sheriff's departments, all in the name of fighting drugs and terrorism.

NPR national security correspondent David Welna joins me now to talk more about this. And, David, why is the Pentagon providing state and local police departments with the equipment that was originally purchased for fighting wars?

DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Well, Melissa, this is actually something that's been going on since the end of the Reagan administration. That was when Congress first authorized the Defense Department to transfer surplus equipment to law enforcement agencies.

And it was all done as part of the so-called war on drugs. And then Congress expanded the scope of the program in 1996 to include counter-terrorism. And it's gone from initially transferring about a million dollars worth of equipment annually to, last year, giving law enforcement agencies $450 million worth of materials.

BLOCK: And we've seen the images from Ferguson, David - armored tactical vehicles out in the streets. What other kinds of things are police and sheriff's departments getting through this program?

WELNA: Well, it's a wide range of things. They have everything from file cabinets and photocopiers to handcuffs, riot shields and bayonets to weapons of war, such as M-16 and M-14 assault rifles.

They're also transferring a lot of military vehicles, ranging from Humvees to armored tactical vehicles, including some 600 mine-resistant ambush protected, or MRAP, vehicles. These were used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they were meant to protect them from IEDs. We're talking about vehicles worth about half a million dollars when new. And in fact, more than a third of everything that gets transferred, according to the Pentagon, has never even been used.

BLOCK: And as you say, David, $450 million worth of equipment in the last year alone. How many police departments are getting it?

WELNA: Well, it's very widespread. The Defense Logistics Agency, which administers the program, says that in the last 17 years, it's transferred more than $5 billion worth of equipment to more than 8,000 agencies, though outside estimates, including one from ACLU, say, it's more than 17,000 agencies actually getting this material.

This is all considered surplus. All that those who receive that have to do is just pay for the shipping and maintenance. Interestingly, the logo of the Law Enforcement Support Office, which takes requests for these transfers, is from warfighters to crimefighters.

BLOCK: David, I have been reading about some local law enforcement agencies who've said, look ,we don't want this stuff. We do not want to militarize our police force.

WELNA: Yes. In fact, just in the last month, a plan for the sheriff's department in Bergen County, New Jersey, to receive two MRAPs got scotched after county executives complained the people there were losing their way if they were talking about putting combat vehicles on the streets.

The sheriff defended getting the vehicles, saying, the county police had already gotten two of them, so his force should get them, as well. And in Utah, which is one of the major recipients of military surplus, the police chief in Salt Lake City has spoken out against militarizing his force.

BLOCK: And, David, you mentioned that the original purpose of this program goes back to the Reagan administration and the war on drugs. Has the program got grown well beyond that original intent?

WELNA: It definitely appears to go beyond just drug enforcement, though a lot of it is used for that, as well. One of the stipulations for getting this equipment transferred is that it'd be used within a year of receipt. It's a kind of use it or lose it policy. And that gives law enforcement agencies a real incentive to put these military weapons and vehicles to use in things such as crowd control, as we saw in Ferguson. There are a lot of questions from civil liberties advocates about accountability for the use of this military surplus equipment. There's very limited information about what exactly it's all being used for and why.

BLOCK: That's NPR national security correspondent David Welna. David, thanks so much.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Here's the latest from Ferguson, Missouri, where officials have named the police officer who shot an unarmed black teenager. That shooting set off days of angry protests. The officer's name is Darren Wilson. And we learned his name today after some delay. Authorities had been expressing concern about his safety.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

And we'll certainly be monitoring community reaction to that. Now, the mood in Ferguson was much different last night. Police who had been confronting protesters were put under new command. And the new commander took a different approach. The new commander, state police Captain Ronald Johnson is African-American.

INSKEEP: And as notable as his race was, the approach he took - police put away their riot gear and military-style weapons. Now, to gain some insight into police work and situations like this, we spoke with Daniel Isom, who was police chief in the city of St. Louis for five years. We asked if he faced anything like the protests in Ferguson.

DANIEL ISOM: We had the Occupy protests in St. Louis. And there is a fine balance between keeping the peace and allowing people to exercise their First Amendment right to free speech and protest. And so we met with some of the leaders of the group and were able to come to an agreement with very little force. Now, we did have arrest in our case. Everyone wasn't pleased with everything that was done. But we didn't have any acts of violence. We were, in a reasonable way, able to allow people to protest and get both of our goals accomplished.

INSKEEP: The police department in Ferguson found itself under criticism for its lack of diversity. You have what's described as a two-thirds black community with three officers on a police force of 52. What have you thought of the police department's efforts to answer those criticisms under fire?

ISOM: Well, I'm not privy to the work that they've done to try to make their police department more diverse. But what I can say is that I do believe in law enforcement diversity - is important. I don't know that simply having a more diverse police department would have resolved this issue because there are many police departments that continue to have problems with the African-American community, minority communities. And it's not necessarily just a Ferguson issue. It's an issue that many cities, small and large, are dealing with in America. And it's really more of a symptom of a deeper problem that we haven't been able to resolve in terms of, how do we interact with law enforcement officials where we foster a partnership and a relationship of trust?

INSKEEP: You're thinking about this as someone from St. Louis who is a cop and is also African-American. How, if at all, does that affect the way you think about this situation?

ISOM: I do have a perspective of both sides. I understand the difficulty and the complexity of trying to maintain order in communities that are suffering. But I also recognize, as an African-American, both the situation in the community - meaning the social environment creates stress - and also the police presence creates stress in the community. And what I find is that both sides become entrenched in their paradigm. And that's difficult. How do we - both sides - look in the mirror and say, OK, what can we do to make this better?

INSKEEP: Chief Isom, thanks very much.

ISOM: Thank you.

Depending on their race, people may have different relationships with police.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

And let's bring another voice into this conversation now. Gene Demby is with NPR's Code Switch team. And he's here to talk about what's happened in Ferguson and how this has really become a flashpoint in an ongoing national conversation about race and police tactics. Hey, Gene.

GENE DEMBY, BYLINE: Good morning, David.

GREENE: You know, one thing we heard about near the end of that conversation was how people have different perspectives, different assumptions that they bring to an incident like this.

DEMBY: Yeah, and part of the reason it's so hard to talk about stuff like this is that we're metabolizing these experiences with the police so much differently. Last year, the Pew Research Center did some polling about attitudes on police and they found that 70 percent of black people said that they believed that black people were treated less fairly by the police. But white people - only about 37 percent felt that black people were treated less fairly than white people were. And so there's this big disconnect.

And, you know, for lots of white people the police are, you know, they're public servants - they help out when something goes wrong; they put things right. But for lots of communities of color, police are agents of chaos, right? I mean, they are omnipresent in many places. And there's almost constant contact with the police, and a lot of it is very tense contact. And because of this frequent contact with police, there's all this chance for kind of disruption of your life - being stopped, being searched, being arrested. And obviously there's the specter of deadly force being introduced.

GREENE: You know, just listening to you describe this, Gene, I think about when I was in Russia, where there were a lot of communities and a lot of people who felt that whenever they had any contact with the police, it was negative. And they just absolutely sort of gave up. Like, even if there were crimes committed, they just wouldn't want to have anything to do to with the police. Is that what you see in a lot of African-American communities?

DEMBY: Well, right. You'll see those perceptions drive this idea that police involvement just makes situations worse, that they escalate kind of the danger of a situation. We spoke to David Kennedy, who's a criminologist at John Jay College, who talked a little bit about the disconnect between communities and police.

DAVID KENNEDY: What I've been seeing for decades now are communities who feel so completely alienated from their country and their government that they do not organize. They don't march. They don't pull out their cell phones; they just withdraw. And that is the mark of a community that does not feel any longer like they are part of America. They don't feel like citizens.

GREENE: It sounds like he would say that what we saw in Ferguson this week was a positive thing, that people did come out on the streets protesting, calling for change. They didn't totally withdraw after this incident.

DEMBY: Right. What Kennedy was saying was that this is a sign of a desire to be engaged in a larger way in part of the civic fabric of the community. But there's also this tension about being left out or been pushed out of it.

GREENE: Now, there are some, I could imagine, watching the events in Ferguson, and they would say, you know, that those were protests - some of them turned violent, and the police in Ferguson, you know, had to do something. They had to act aggressively to keep order.

DEMBY: Right, and I guess the question is also sort of how much these perceptions of police and the way that police interact with communities sort of escalate the situation, right? We saw that change a little bit last night in the different kind of posture the police took towards the protesters. And beyond that, there are communities around the country where police are generally seen as the people who are escalating these situations.

Just take the case Eric Garner, the New York City man who died after an encounter with the police. This video of him being put in a choke hold went viral. He died shortly thereafter, and there was some outrage. And so Monica Potts, who is a journalist here in D.C. who used to be an investigator of police misconduct in New York City, wrote an essay for us on Code Switch on our blog about sort of the questions we should ask about this. The questions tend to be the about the individual behavior of police officers when something like this happens. But instead she wanted to kind of reframe that. She wanted us to ask, you know, is this the price we're willing to pay for kind of zero-tolerance policing?

GREENE: OK, I see the one argument there, Gene - that zero- tolerance can actually make police more aggressive and that can lead to problems. But some would say there are communities with very high crime rates where you would want a zero-tolerance policy, right?

DEMBY: Right, absolutely. I mean, even in communities with really high crime rates, very few people in the community are actually committing crimes, right? There are people in those communities who actually do want to call the police, who do want help with, you know, issues in their neighborhood. But they don't feel like involving the police solves anything.

GREENE: So it sounds like essentially, the real question is how to build trust. Are there ways that you've heard about for communities that they can try and do that?

DEMBY: Yeah, Kennedy said there are some police departments who are really looking at it, trying to fix that and who are trying to find a way to change these things and engender trust.

KENNEDY: Law enforcement is recognizing this reality and increasingly is willing to say to these communities, we've done wrong; we have not protected you; we have made mistakes. We are not racists, but we have played into a racist history. And we are going to acknowledge that, and we are going to do everything we can to step away from it.

GREENE: I hear that, and I think about what we saw last night - Captain Ronald Johnson from Missouri State Highway Patrol being out there in the community, hugging people and greeting them. Is that the kind of thing that Kennedy's talking about?

DEMBY: Yeah, I think that's the kind of outreach he's sort of talking about - about kind of mutual respect. I mean, they took off their gas masks. They put the armored vehicles away, right? And so his idea is that this new approach comes before there's a crisis. It's reaching out to members of the community like teachers and pastors to just - you know, to help identify who the problem actors are. So it unites the police and the people in the community against the bad guys, as opposed to the police kind of going after every one.

GREENE: We've been chatting with Gene Demby from NPR's Code Switch team. Gene, thank you.

DEMBY: Thank you so much, David.

The police chief finally released the name of the officer who shot Michael Brown and an incident report listing Brown as a suspect in a recent convenience store robbery. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon is promising a full investigation.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

In Ferguson, Missouri, today we have now learned the identity of the officer who shot Michael Brown nearly a week after the killing. The officer's name is Darren Wilson. He's been on the police force for six years.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

And there was this today from Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

THOMAS JACKSON: What we're making available today are the dispatch records and the video footage of a robbery - a strong-armed robbery with use of force that occurred at a local convenience mart.

SIEGEL: It turns out minutes before he was killed, Michael Brown may have robbed a convenience store. Brown family lawyers acknowledge that it is Brown on a store surveillance video that the police released today.

BLOCK: Still, Officer Wilson's motives in shooting Brown remain murky. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports from Ferguson.

CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: The internet report that police released today includes photographs and video footage which shows a large black man grabbing a small store clerk by the neck of his shirt. The report says a suspect who resembles Brown stole cigars. According to Ferguson Police Chief Jackson, soon after the robbery a call went out over the police radio describing the suspect. Officer Wilson didn't know the 18-year-old was a robbery suspect during their initial encounter - at least that's how Jackson first described the situation during a press conference this afternoon when he said Officer Wilson stopped Brown and another man...

(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)

THOMAS JACKSON: Because they were walking down the middle of the street, blocking traffic. That was it.

CORLEY: But hours later, the chief told the St. Louis Post Dispatch that Officer Wilson did think that Brown was the robbery suspect because he saw cigars in the teenager's hands. Jackson had long refused to release any information about the officer, but he said he felt he had to because of constant request from the media and others. In an appearance on CNN today, Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Michael Brown's family, acknowledged that it appears to be Michael Brown on the video from the convenience store. But he says that's irrelevant to his shooting death and the investigation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BENJAMIN CRUMP: Just nothing but police 101 when it comes to police shootings, when they shoot innocent people. Attack the victim, assassinate their character and try to justify the actions.

CROWD: No justice. No peace. No justice. No peace.

CORLEY: Out in front of the burned-out convenience store where nightly protests have been held, Roger Hooks (ph) said the information from the Ferguson Police is hard to believe.

ROGER HOOKS: You know, I believe that they're just making excuses and covers for their actions. It still doesn't justify him being dead or him getting killed. If that was the case and he was the suspect, he should have been taken to jail and not killed.

CORLEY: The concern now, is that after a peaceful night of protest in Ferguson, the violence that erupted earlier in the week will return. Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson who's heading up the security efforts replaced local police who had patrolled in riot gear. Johnson who is from Ferguson walked through the crowd last night and says it's a practice he will continue. He added that he doesn't believe the tense situation in Ferguson is a racial one.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

RONALD JOHNSON: I agree that this is not a black and white issue 'cause we all have sons and daughters. The governor talked about old wounds. This is an old wound. It's time to stop saying it's an old wound and close it for good.

CORLEY: Last night, no arrests were made during the demonstrations in Ferguson. Captain Johnson called it a great night and said people were allowed to speak without fear of retaliation. He also had a message for anyone angry about new details released today.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHNSON: We have to make sure that we don't burn down our own house - that we don't go down there and vandalize our own building.

CORLEY: There are two parallel investigations into the death of Michael Brown underway. The Department of Justice is handling one and St. Louis County officials the other. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon says there will be a lot of steps between now and any resolution of a case which has infuriated so many here. And he expects there will be a lot of tension at various times, but the governor wanted to make one thing clear.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GOVERNOR JAY NIXON: Nothing should deter figuring out how and why Michael Brown was killed.

CORLEY: And Nixon said before anyone reaches any conclusions, the investigations that are underway should be complete. Cheryl Corley, NPR News, Ferguson, Missouri.",70,NA,NA,NA

Protesters were demonstrating Saturday's shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Let's sort through what we've learned today as police in Ferguson, Missouri have held a news conference about the shooting of an African-American teenager and the aftermath. NPR's Cheryl Corley is in Ferguson, Missouri. And, Cheryl, what are you learning?

CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: We're learning the name of the police officer involved in the shooting. Police Chief Thomas Jackson announced today that it was Darren Wilson. He is a 6-year veteran of the department. Don't know much more beyond that, but the name was released today.

INSKEEP: Now, what about the actual shooting incident itself? Is there any more information available now about how it came to be that this young man was walking down the street, got into an altercation with the officer and was shot?

CORLEY: The police released a timeline today and an incident report, which shows that at about noon, the police department received a 911 emergency call from a QuikTrip convenience store. The officer went there, he was on another call, went there and was told by the clerk that two men had come into the store and had pretty aggressively stolen some cigars from the store, that they had attempted to stop them, that didn't happen. So he gave a description about who came into the store. The police officer didn't see anybody matching that, went to canvas the neighborhood, came back to talk to the clerk again and then went out to canvas the neighborhood again. Presumably, he found Michael Brown, whom he thought matched that description when the incident occurred, when the shooting incident occurred.

INSKEEP: So the police are asserting there was an actual crime here and perhaps some reason for a police officer to be on alert. Is that the import in their minds at least, of this information?

CORLEY: Absolutely. The incident report calls it a strong-armed robbery. So there's some suggestion that, you know, they were in search of a robbery suspect.

INSKEEP: And are they asserting that Michael Brown in fact was the person who robbed the convenience store of some cigars?

CORLEY: Well, in the incident report they do name him. They name another suspect who they say was with Michael Brown at the time. So, yes, they are saying that it was indeed Michael Brown.

INSKEEP: OK, so more information available now in Ferguson, Missouri. That's NPR's Cheryl Corley. Cheryl, thanks.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

The issues raised by the events in Ferguson are also the starting point for our Friday political commentators. Joining me are columnist David Brooks of the New York Times and sitting in for E.J, Dionne this week Jonathan Capehart who's on the editorial board of the Washington Post. Welcome to both of you.

DAVID BROOKS: Good to be here.

JONATHAN CAPEHART: Good to be here.

SIEGEL: David let's start with you. This Ferguson story is about race relations, it's about allegations of lethal police brutality, it's about police tactics. The President, the Attorney General, the governor of Missouri have all weighed in. What do you take away from all this so far?

BROOKS: Well, I'm part of the bipartisan chorus that the police over reacted. I guess I start from a communitarian perspective. You know, conservatives do believe in law and order but the police force is supposed to emerge out of the community and be part of the community. And what happened in Ferguson was that it used to be a largely white community and now it's a - there was a demographic shift and it became a largely African-American community and the police force didn't reflect the shift - the city that they were actually policing. So, that was the core of the problem. That you had this cultural distinction between the police force and the community and that's bound to be touchy in the first place. So, the first problem was not having a police force that reflected the community. And then the idea of adopting tactics, you know, the police should be really close to people, especially in times of turmoil, not erecting basically military barriers. And so it was not only a violation of basic community policing it was a basic, how you do law and order.

SIEGEL: Jonathan Capehart, what did you make of all this?

CAPEHART: Well, I would say in addition to the police not reflecting the community, the police didn't reflect America in its ideals. What we saw in our living rooms or on our tablets or on computers, was we saw freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom to hold public officials accountable under attack. And I think for a lot of people to see what was happening in Ferguson - Ferguson, Missouri was something that was deeply disturbing and that the silence from elected officials at that moment, Wednesday night, from the governor on down was also something that I think people found disturbing.

SIEGEL: Well, you know, David talked about how the police must reflect the community and given demographic shifts, in practice, that means there have to be recruitment campaigns, affirmative action and these are not always - they're not noncontroversial things.

CAPEHART: Right, they're not noncontroversial but we see the result of not doing something proactively to have police forces reflect the community that they serve. What's happening in Ferguson is a result of that.

SIEGEL: David...

BROOKS: Also just the issue of petty power. We've all been on the wrong side of somebody in uniform who uses petty power in an obnoxious way. And this was that on massive scale. And there's a reason...

SIEGEL: And we're not even talking of killing a Michael Brown now, you're talking about the...

BROOKS: Well, I don't know. I don't know.

SIEGEL: ... you're talking about what happened to the...

BROOKS: I suspect there was probably a little of that and a little much when the killing too. But there is just, when you have some petty authority over people there's a tendency in somehow the human breast to be a oppressive. And I think that may be a theme in this story from start to finish.

SIEGEL: OK, let's move onto another big political story this week. Hillary Clinton gave an interview to Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic and by the end of it she'd left some daylight between herself and President Obama on intervention in Syria. A little on Gaza, on the nuclear talks with Iran and on articulating a principle of foreign policy. Jonathan do you hear the - all that is preparation for 2016 and Hillary Clinton saying if I'm President it won't be the third Obama administration?

CAPEHART: Well, look whether the former senator, former Secretary of State runs is a question she'll have to answer by the end of this year but it's not out of the ordinary for her to make known in her book and in interviews that she and the president differed on policy. That's to be expect. I think the controversy that's blown up of late is part of what happens when your hawking a book and you want people to read the book and if you're reading the book you won't be surprised that there are differences between the two. Remember the 2008 campaign, their worldviews were very different in how they would go about things. So anyone who's surprised by what she's saying now really shouldn't be.

SIEGEL: David, Jonathan's seeing this as a largely literary problem. You see it as a little bit more political than that.

BROOKS: Yeah, no, I'm in favor of seeing everything as a literary problem. We're all prisoners of our prose style. But what I do think is more of an intellectual problem. As Jonathan said, these were - these two people when they were in the Senate had very different views. Hillary Clinton emerges really from a Truman, Kennedy - John F. Kennedy school of Democratic foreign-policy. That as long as America exists and history's ongoing there are going to be ideological enemies. And military force is often useful in that. President Obama's much more cautious. It's not only Hillary, it's the people around Hillary, who had dinner parties for the past months have been quite dismissive of the Obama foreign policy. And so this is a broader intellectual fight and it was exacerbated by the Syria dispute. I think Hillary's decision or at least advocating for the idea of arming Syrian moderates has been fully vindicated by events. And she has a right to feel that if her council had been taken, we'd be in a much better place in Syria and Iraq.

SIEGEL: You agree with that Jonathan?

CAPEHART: I have no argument with Mr. Brooks on that.

SIEGEL: But, you know, we've spent so much time here over the years - over the past couple of years talking about divisions within the Republican Party. Are there still these deep divisions within the Democratic Party. Between people who are old-fashioned Democratic leadership Council, don't think all Democrats are doves kind of Democrat and people who are not just of different policies, like President Obama, but younger than that?

CAPEHART: Well, I mean as we saw in the last campaign, remember it was Senator - then Senator Clinton who voted to authorize the Iraq war and that was a big...

SIEGEL: As David Axelrod reminded her of.

CAPEHART: Yes, on Twitter. That was a big wedge within the Democratic Party and it's something that gave then Senator Obama an edge over Clinton. It'll be interesting to see in 2016, if indeed she runs, how she - how she'll finesse what happened with the Iraq war vote. But also that interventionist style, how are you going to lead a country that doesn't want to get involved anywhere, get them to support some - support a candidate who really believes in an interventionist

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon — a two-term Democrat — ordered an overnight change in police tactics. He brought in state troopers, who walked side-by-side with demonstrators.

""This is a place where people work, go to school, raise their families and go to church. A diverse community. A Missouri community. But lately it's looked more like a war zone, and that's unacceptable,"" he said at a press conference Thursday.

Missouri's Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill also complained about the police posture in Ferguson earlier this week. There's a history of mistrust between the mostly African-American residents of the St. Louis suburb and its nearly all-white police force. McCaskill says it didn't help when officers responded to protests in camouflage and armored vehicles.

""When police come out and take a stand and wear and have equipment that makes it feel like somehow the people who are protesting are assumed to be the bad guys, I don't think it helps take the tension out of the situation. I think it puts more tension in it,"" she said.

Some conservatives were also alarmed to see local police departments adopting tactics and tools traditionally used by the military. Since the 1960s, Republicans have been known as the party of law and order. But GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky {argued}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> in an essay for Time magazine's website, ""there should be a difference between a police response and a military response."" His point was {echoed}<hyperlink=""http://www.redstate.com/2014/08/15/must-we-have-a-dead-white-kid/""> by conservative blogger Erick Erickson of RedState.com.

""No one is denying we need strong police forces. But the police force isn't supposed to be a para-military organization,"" Erickson says.

Missouri State Troopers seemed to take that to heart last night as they marched alongside the protesters rather than ordering them off the streets. Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who's African-American and grew up near Ferguson, steered the new approach, saying the change in tactics is just the beginning.

""There's things that have to happen after this is over to make us all better: training, diversity, having more minority officers in our communities, more women on our police departments. So all of that needs to happen,"" he said at a press conference Friday.

Some conservatives, on the other hand, suggest a different fix. Erickson, the RedState blogger, sees paramilitary policing as just another symptom of big government run amok.

""Conservatives are concerned with what happened with the IRS and the EPA going after small businesses. They should I think also necessarily be concerned about small government in local communities feeling emboldened to behave badly,"" he says.

Nixon says his immediate concern is maintaining peace on the streets of Ferguson. Ultimately, though, he says both Missouri and the U.S. will be judged on whether the events this week that touched such a nerve lead to any lasting changes.",76,NA,NA,NA

Ferguson, Mo., saw more protests last night — but instead of meeting demonstrators with tear gas and armored vehicles, police walked with them, and posed for photos. The shift came after days of clashes sparked by the police killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

From {St. Louis Public Radio}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/"">, Rachel Lippmann reports:

""There was no line of armored trucks or police in riot gear blocking traffic Thursday night. The few police officers spotted in the crowd were wearing regular uniforms.

""Gov. Jay Nixon placed Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson in charge on Thursday afternoon, instead of the St. Louis County police. The result was an atmosphere that felt more like a party.

""Protester Dante Kelly hoped the night was a tipping point.

"" 'But it's only a start,' he said. 'Captain Johnson is not going to be here forever, so, ain't no telling.' 

""Other protesters shared Kelly's skepticism that the change would be permanent. And many expressed their frustration that the police had not yet released the name of the shooter.""

Update at 12 p.m. ET: No Arrests Made Thursday

The Missouri Highway Patrol, which has taken over security in Ferguson, says that no arrests of demonstrators were made Thursday, confirming reports of a peaceful protest. Capt. Ron Johnson said people, and the police, need to continue that trend.

""In our anger, we have to make sure we don't burn down our own house,"" Johnson said. He also said he welcomed the use of cameras to record police work, saying that they ""don't change our jobs.""

Johnson also acknowledged criticism of the way in which Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson {released the name of Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/15/340594634/ferguson-police-release-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown"">, the officer who shot and killed Brown, 18. The chief did not take questions, and he added new information about last Saturday, including the news that Brown was suspected of stealing cigars from a convenience store about 10 minutes before he was stopped.

Our original post continues:

The investigation into Brown's death is continuing, and on several fronts. Soon after the shooting, Jackson asked the St. Louis County police to handle the inquiry; the FBI and Justice Department are also conducting their own investigation.

But the key difference in Ferguson on Thursday was that police had changed their approach to trying to prevent a repeat of the violence and property damage that occurred Sunday. Police were heavily criticized for using tear gas, deploying heavy weapons and arresting journalists.

""They made it look like they were over in Iraq, ready to attack us,"" protester Marquess Mull tells NPR's Cheryl Corley. But Thursday was different, he said: ""They're talking to people.""

The new commander, Johnson, is a Ferguson native who is also black. He and Jackson had both said police would change both their tactics and their appearance in an effort to avoid provoking protesters. The military-style gear and the gas masks would be stowed, they said.

""When we talk about boots on the ground,"" Johnson said at a news conference Thursday, ""my boots are going to be on the ground. And so we are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we are in this together.""

Johnson kept that promise last night, walking with demonstrators, hugging people, and representing authority in a way that's been absent this week. The community responded with a spirited demonstration that was marked by cheers and the honking horns of passing cars.

One woman told Johnson, ""Thank you so much for coming out here tonight,"" according to The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery.

This week, scenes of grief and confrontation in Ferguson have further stoked racial tensions in the town that's two-thirds black, and the images and stories have resonated far beyond the town.

In a show of solidarity, thousands of protesters in New York, Washington and other cities held their own demonstrations last night, chanting the phrase that has rung through Ferguson's streets this week: ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" a reference to witnesses' claims that Brown had his hands up when he was fatally shot Saturday.

In Ferguson, the new tone was indicated most simply, and perhaps most adorably, by a Thomas the Train parade vehicle that plied the same streets where armored vehicles had recently roamed. It carried a group of smiling young men.

The release of Wilson's name comes after Jackson said he wouldn't identify the man out of concerns for his safety, citing death threats made to Ferguson police and on social media. Jackson said that Wilson was treated for injuries he sustained Saturday.

Before he released the name, Jackson discussed a robbery that had occurred shortly before Brown's death on Aug. 9.

Update at 8:50 pm. ET: Justice Department Investigation Conducts Interviews

In a press release, FBI Special Agent in Charge William P. Woods said that his agents and Justice Department attorneys had several interviews with people who witnessed the shooting, and that they will be canvassing the neighborhood to find anyone else who might know about what happened.

Update at 4:50 p.m. ET: Family Attorney: Man In Video Appears To Be Brown

Relatives of Michael Brown and attorneys representing the family held a news conference this afternoon, reiterating their charge that the release of the video purporting to show a robbery ""was strategic and aimed at destroying the character"" of the victim.

Anthony Gray, an attorney for the family, said the video was part of a ""sideshow"" to distract from the circumstances of the shooting.

He said the family's message was ""do not take the bait.""

""Don't take that to riot; don't take that to loot. The family has made clear that it doesn't want that,"" he said.

Eric Davis, a cousin of Brown's, questioned whether the man in the robbery video was indeed his relative, but Daryl Parks, another attorney for the family, acknowledged that it appears to be him.

""I wouldn't say that he robbed the store, but it does look like him,"" Parks said.

Despite the distractions, he said, ""We continue to believe that the most important thing that happened that day in the middle of the street was that officers killed Mike.""

Update at 3:20 p.m. ET: Police Chief: Officer In Shooting Was Unaware Of Robbery

Jackson, speaking at an afternoon news conference, said he wanted to respond to questions raised about the timing of the release of the tape.

""This robbery does not relate to the initial contact between the officer and Michael Brown,"" he said, adding that the ""strong-arm"" (unarmed) robbery occurred about 10 minutes before the stop that led to the fatal shooting.

""It had nothing to do with the stop,"" Jackson said.

Asked why Wilson stopped Brown, the police chief said because Brown and his friend ""were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.""

Jackson said he had gotten numerous Freedom of Information Act requests from the media to release the video. ""I had to release it,"" he said.

""I had been sitting on it and too many people put in FOIA requests for it and I had to release it,"" he said.

""We needed to release that at the same time we released the name of the officer,"" he said.

Update at 1 p.m. ET: 'Michael Brown's Family Is Beyond Outraged'

Saying that the Ferguson Police Department is trying to ""assassinate the character of their son,"" the family of Michael Brown {issued a statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s44se5""> Friday afternoon, saying it is ""beyond outraged.""

""The prolonged release of the officer's name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies,"" the family said.

The family and its attorneys also complain that while images were released that are alleged to be of Michael Brown, police officials have still not released a photograph of Wilson.

The release of the robbery allegations seems to have surprised Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson, who {gave an update on the security situation}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/15/340585038/theyre-talking-to-people-tensions-ease-in-ferguson-as-police-change-tactics""> in Ferguson. At a midday news conference, Johnson said he hadn't seen the material before it was given to the media this morning, and he said he would talk to Chief Jackson about how the information was handled.

""I guarantee it's going to be a conversation — it's not going to be a conversation I'm going to have over the phone,"" he said.

Update at 12:45 p.m. ET: ACLU Files Lawsuits In Ferguson

The ACLU of Missouri has filed two lawsuits: one ""sunshine"" request seeking the release of the police incident report about Michael Brown's death, and another that seeks to protect the rights of citizens and journalists to videotape police activity.

The {sunshine petition}<hyperlink=""http://www.aclu-mo.org/files/3914/0803/3020/2014_08_14_Sunshine_Petition.pdf""> was filed in a state court; the {videotaping complaint}<hyperlink=""http://www.aclu-mo.org/files/3414/0804/0291/08-14-14_Videotaping_Complaint.pdf""> was filed in a U.S. district court for eastern Missouri.

Update at 10:45 p.m. ET: The Robbery Report

While Chief Jackson didn't directly link Brown to the robbery at a convenience store, the police materials released Friday mention Brown by name, along with another man named Dorian Johnson.

The report of a strong-arm robbery is in a packet of materials police released today. It includes an incident report that transcribes surveillance video in which Brown and Johnson are described entering the store and picking up a box of Swisher Sweet cigars.

{From the report}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jrosenbaum/status/500290750949490690/"">:

""Brown hands a box of Swisher Sweets to Johnson. An apparent struggle or confrontation seems to take place with Brown, however it is obscured by a display case on the counter. Meanwhile, Johnson sets the box he was handed back on the counter. Brown turns away from the counter with another box of Swisher Sweet cigars and walks toward the exit door.""

The names of the people who were working at the store are whited-out of the report. But the report says one of them attempted to stop the men from leaving the store without paying — and that Brown grabbed the worker and pushed him away before leaving with the cigars.

Images from the materials, which police say were taken by the store's surveillance cameras, show a large man grabbing a smaller man by the shirt and forcing the man away.

The police report states that the two incidents — the robbery and Brown's shooting — are related. It was written by an officer who said:

""I responded to that scene and observed Brown. After viewing Brown and reviewing this video, I was able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect in this incident. A second person, also at that scene, identified himself as being with Brown. That person was later identified as Dorian Johnson. After observing Johnson and reviewing the video, I confirmed he is the second suspect in this incident.""

We'll note that Dorian Johnson was the witness {who spoke to MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> earlier this week, giving a vivid description of Saturday's shooting and saying he was only an arm's length away when the first shots were fired.

On the top-right corner of the robbery report, its case status is listed as ""exceptionally cleared.""

Update at 9:55 a.m. ET: Anger Over Mention Of Robbery

Jackson did not directly connect Saturday's robbery report with Brown's death. But he did lay out a timeline of events that puts the altercation with Brown occurring less than 10 minutes after a description of a suspect in the robbery had gone out.

That call about a Ferguson store came at 11:51 a.m., Jackson said; a description went out on the police dispatch at 11:52. And at 12:01, Wilson ""encountered Michael Brown on Canfield Drive,"" the police chief said.

Jackson also said that two other officers, along with an ambulance that had been on a call nearby, responded to the scene where Brown was killed.

Jackson did not take any questions, saying he would speak to the media again this afternoon.

As soon as the police chief's news conference was over, yelling could be heard from people who had gathered nearby to listen. One woman was heard criticizing Jackson, saying he had implied that Brown might have been involved in the robbery — and questioning why the information about a robbery was only now coming out.

""That was no robbery; it was murder,"" one man said.

Our original post continues:

Jackson released Wilson's name during a news conference outside the QuikTrip convenience store that was set on fire Sunday, the first night of violent protests in Ferguson. In the background over his shoulder, ""Mike Mike"" — Brown's nickname — had been written on a gas pump.

The death of Brown, 18, remains under investigation, and the details are in dispute. Police say he was killed after a struggle over the officer's gun. Witnesses say Brown died after running away from the officer and raising his hands.

As we reported earlier this week, {a witness who says he was walking with Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/12/339850929/in-ferguson-calls-for-calm-and-justice-after-teen-s-death""> just before the altercation says the officer had told them to get out of the street and onto a sidewalk. The situation quickly escalated, he said, and Brown was shot several times.

Soon after the shooting, Jackson asked the St. Louis County police to handle the inquiry. The FBI and the Justice Department are also investigating.

As {we reported earlier today}<http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/15/340585038/theyre-talking-to-people-tensions-ease-in-ferguson-as-police-change-tactics"">, the atmosphere in Ferguson changed considerably Thursday, as protesters welcomed a new police approach of toning down the military-style response that had ratcheted up tensions in the town.",2101,NA,NA,NA

""Actually, what I remember is me standing about 5 feet away from him, calling 911, seeing him lying on the ground — shot dead, handcuffed, on his stomach,"" Smalls says.

Smalls, a claims specialist at Honda's corporate headquarters, is heartbroken, and she doesn't believe the LAPD's claim that Ford tried to grab an officer's gun. ""Ezell was killed for no reason — and shot in his back,"" Smalls says.

The killing has angered many black residents of the Florence neighborhood of Los Angeles, where the incident took place — but it hasn't led to the unrest seen in Ferguson, Mo. Many folks here believe that no matter where the police work — Los Angeles, Ferguson — cops pull the trigger too fast when it comes to black men.

But residents here have not faced off with police in the same way as those in Ferguson have this past week, and LAPD Assistant Chief Earl Paysinger thinks he knows why.

""The difference between this instance and what we see back East I think has to do with the confidence that the public has in the police department to conduct an immediate, a thorough, a thoughtful investigation,"" Paysinger says.

The department has not released the officers' names or reason for stopping Ford, but they have given more information than Ferguson police, saying officers shot him after he grabbed one of their weapons during a struggle.

Important, they've also kept a low profile during protests.

This is a police department that faced riots of its own two decades ago, when pent-up anger about police harassment boiled over after {the Rodney King beating}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/06/18/155270776/rodney-king-what-i-had-to-do-was-make-it-better"">. But federally mandated reforms, a more diverse department and {community policing}<hyperlink=""http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/Publications/e030917193-CP-Defined.pdf""> have changed the LAPD, says civil rights attorney Connie Rice.

""Now we have a lot of officers who have relationships not just with community leaders, but with everyday folks in South LA,"" Rice says.

But Rice, who at one time was hired by the city to assist with police reform, says some within the LAPD hold on to the old ways.

""Then there are gang units that, as far as I'm concerned, they haven't gotten the memo, and they haven't changed a thing,"" Rice says. She says she can't say whether the gang officers who shot Ford were among those who ""got the memo.""

'My Heart Is Hurt'

An LAPD helicopter hovered over 65th Street as young African-American men and women lit dozens of candles that are lined up to spell Ezell's name on the sidewalk where he fell. His mother, Tritobia Ford, stood nearby. Ezell was her oldest child.

""My heart is hurt. I feel great pain for the death that my son suffered for no reason,"" she says, adding that her son had ""mental challenges.""

Ezell Ford's cousin Lacrisha White, 32, echoes a familiar sentiment in this neighborhood.

""Just from walking down the street, we're considered thugs, drug dealers, gang members — and not all of us are,"" she says.

White, a single mother, worries about her three boys joining gangs or getting shot by police. Her oldest is Reginald Parker, 10.

""It was the police fault. I thought they supposed to be protecting, but they kill him. They kill my cousin,"" he says.

In addition to the LAPD, the LA district attorney is investigating Ford's shooting.",49,NA,NA,NA

(Us.)

The hashtag started trending on Twitter after media outlets began circulating images of Michael Brown, {who had been shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/15/340594634/ferguson-police-release-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown""> Many of the tweets containing the hashtag juxtapose two images of the same person in very different contexts — reading a book in one, say, while blowing smoke and flashing a hand gesture in the other. The paired images effectively but implicitly present many questions about how we choose the images that come to represent the individuals we cover, and the effects of those choices.

Most of the coverage of the hashtag was about those (very good) questions. But we were still curious about the photos themselves, and the individuals behind them. So we reached out to a few of the tweeters, and here's what they told us.

[tweetbegin 498537843170353152 tweetend]

C.J. Lawrence, 33: ""The first picture was from Tougaloo College, I was the student government association president at the time. I was the speaker at the commencement, and President Clinton was speaking after me. The reason he was laughing so hard because I had just told a joke. ... The second picture was me for Halloween dressed up as Kanye, with the Hennessy bottle and the microphone that he took from Taylor Swift. The Hennessy bottle does not really have Hennessy in it, it's Coca-Cola.""

We asked which image the tweeters felt represented them more accurately. Almost to a person, our respondents said both images were representative. ""They say never judge a book by its cover,"" said Darien Williams. ""For me I'm both of those. I left an impoverished environment to do something better for my life. Now when I return to that environment, I'm what people look up to.""

{#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/IfTheyGunnedMeDown?src=hash""> what picture would they use {pic.twitter.com/lJ3k3tT63n}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/__TrillClinton?protected_redirect=true"">
— Land Lord Brasi (@King_Ghidorah5) {August 11, 2014}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/King_Ghidorah5?protected_redirect=true"">
Darien Williams, 19: Williams has served in the Air Force for more than a year. The image on the left, depicting him out of uniform, was taken this past March. The image of him reading to kids was taken in June. ""In the left I was hanging out, just hanging out being me,"" he said. The other one ""was me volunteering, reading to kids — being me — bringing joy to their day.""

There's that ambiguous ""they"" in the hashtag, and we asked the tweeters who, in their minds, it referred to. Generally they said it referred to those with power and authority — in particular, the police and the media. ""But it could have been directed to anyone who is small-minded enough to fear a young black person automatically if it's nighttime, if he's wearing a hoodie, if his music is too loud, or if he's reaching for his wallet,"" said Brianna Chevonne. ""It can apply to anyone of any race who is ignorant enough to be fearful of young black people to the point they would take their lives.""

[tweetbegin 498686132474114050 tweetend]

Brianna Chevonne: ""The photo [at left] was taken a week or two ago. I was in the car with my younger brother, and we were just joking around taking pictures. It's like the e-side hand sign — because I live on the East Coast. The photo [on the right] is a recent graduation photo of me. I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a bachelor of arts degree.""

The nuanced message of the hashtag is easily flattened, our respondents reminded us. These shorthands we wield — college student, Air Force officer, attorney, unarmed teenager, robbery suspect — carry with them many subtle and not-so-subtle shadings. The effects of those shadings can be significant. ""The true purpose of placing the two pictures together juxtaposed,"" said C.J. Lawrence, ""was to show that [neither] our appearance nor class nor academic achievement should be the determining factors for whether we live or die.""

KAI WRIGHT: Thanks for having me.

SIMON: Recognizing that this is ongoing, what do you think we might learn from the shooting of Michael Brown and the reaction to it?

WRIGHT: Well, you know, it is becoming something of a macabre ritual this morning of unarmed black teenagers who die in interactions with police. And I think what's important here is as we look at Michael Brown and others before it is they're all best understood as the most dramatic example of what happens when we have an overaggressive policing of black neighborhoods. And, you know, and we heard a lot this week about the militarization of the police force in Ferguson as it's responded to the protest. But there are examples that stretch beyond that - the special units for gangs that operate without accountability, it's the stats-driven policing that leads to arrests for crimes like marijuana possession. And all of those things create a hostile climate that leads to this stuff. And at some point, we have to ask, you know, is this about individual things or is this about a larger understanding of policing that needs to change?

SIMON: Are social media platforms adding something to public reaction, or at least reaction time these days too?

WRIGHT: Absolutely. I mean that - I think we've seen that on any number of issues and stories across the globe, frankly. And it's certainly been the case with Michael Brown. But I think what is also important to point out is that while the medium of social media has been very powerful, what's really been at the courts is something very old-school, which was citizens behaving as citizen journalists, who just refuse to be bullied out of the streets. And we're documenting what was going on around them in a way that reminds us more of the civil rights movement and things decades ago than they do anything new.

SIMON: The governor of Missouri and President Obama, among many others, have obviously both spoken out publicly. Does the president, for a lot of different reasons, have a hard time broaching race in this situation?

WRIGHT: Well, he certainly thinks he does, or that's been the White House's strategy on race in general. They've been very reluctant to name it in all kinds of circumstances. I think that is wearing thin in many communities. But I think what is notable is that he did turn to accountability in his statement. And I think that's an important point here is that this kind of policing ultimately is what elected officials need to be held accountable for. And I think that's what you're seeing folks on the street of Ferguson saying.

SIMON: Kai, do you see what's been happening in Ferguson as an incident that stands alone or linked to other things? And what might prevent this in other places?

WRIGHT: Well, I think you're seeing in Capt. Ronald Johnson a good example of what could prevent it, which is the kind of policing that takes the community seriously and that sees them as partners and folks that you're there to serve as opposed to harass. And I think what links this event and many of the others we've seen before it is that it's a mundane interaction - walking in the middle of the street in this case - that leads to a fatal action. And that is, again, the tip of the iceberg for a kind of policing that creates a hostile climate in these communities and has been doing it since at least the beginning of the war on drugs. And that's the thing that has to be remedied.

NPR's Cheryl Corley is in Ferguson, Mo., where the shooting occurred and days of unrest followed.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. Emotions grew heated last night again in Ferguson, Missouri. It is now one full week since a police officer shot Michael Brown - unarmed black teenager there. Yesterday, police released the name of the officer, Darren Wilson, which demonstrators had been demanding for days.

Frank Morris of member station KCUR has been following the story in Ferguson. When we spoke with him earlier today, he described last night's protests, which began at the QuikTrip convenience store.

FRANK MORRIS: Well, you know, it started out pretty peacefully. It was raining and there were people clogging the street in front of this QuikTrip - the burned out QuikTrip that's been kind of the nexus of the protest. It was almost like the home team had won the national championship. There were people, high-fives, lots of honking. In fact, one of the fellows I spoke with, Corey Williams (ph), said he'd never seen anything quite as heartwarming in his entire life.

COREY WILLIAMS: I see all unity. I've never seen it like this in St. Louis in my 45 years, where this many African-Americans have gotten together and united for a cause. I love it. I love it. I never thought I would see this.

SIMON: But things got ugly last night too, didn't they?

MORRIS: Well, yeah, that's right. Mr. Williams had not seen any police at all. And not long after we spoke, they started to show up. Eventually, there was some looting, broken windows. Now this really sharply divides the protesters. I walked into the neighborhood around the protests yesterday afternoon, which is a neighborhood full of tidy brick houses and neat lawns. I spoke with a guy who was out waxing his car - 71-year-old Carter Sigh (ph). And for Mr. Sigh, the violence and the destruction of property just makes him mad.

CARTER SIGH: This wasn't about no Mike Brown. This is about a whole bunch of thieves and thugs that wanted to get out here and show themselves - you know, let themselves known. That's all it was, you know.

SIMON: Frank, yesterday, also police released a store video that was taken earlier in the day that Michael Brown was killed - just actually a few minutes before - apparently stealing cigarillos. There have been some mixed messages from the police chief about whether that theft had anything to do with Michael Brown being stopped. Was the release of this video a kind of spark in the tinderbox?

MORRIS: Well, it certainly made people angry. It was seen as - pretty widely seen as an effort to besmirch Michael Brown's character. And so people like Avian Seeley (ph) who was out at the QuikTrip protesting yesterday afternoon - that hit them very close to home.

AVIAN SEELEY: This could have been my cousin. This could have been me. This could have been my brother, my father. Like, this is really, really upsetting.

SIMON: What do we know about the progress of the investigation?

MORRIS: Not a whole lot. We're not getting very much from the St. Louis County Police Department. The FBI and the Justice Department - they're canvassing the neighborhood looking for more witnesses for their civil rights investigation.

SIMON: Reporter Frank Morris in Ferguson, Missouri. Thanks very much for being with us.

Hundreds of demonstrators went home peacefully as a midnight curfew approached in Ferguson, Mo., but ""a couple hundred defiant protesters remained,"" reports the Associated Press.

The crowd was gathered in the St. Louis suburb at the site where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a white police officer.

""Remaining protesters mingled, chanted and taunted police, some shouting that they would not abide the curfew,"" AP reports. ""Police dressed in riot gear were keeping their distance.""

Updated at 4:50 p.m. ET.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon says he's ordered a state of emergency and implemented a curfew in the city of Ferguson to curb incidents of violence and looting in the wake of the police shooting of an unarmed teenager a week ago.

""We can't let the ill will of the few to undermine the goodwill of the many,"" Nixon said, speaking at a church in the St. Louis suburb.

The order for a citywide state of emergency and a curfew come after the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of Michael Brown.

Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who was appointed earlier this week to take over security from the local authorities, said the curfew would go into effect from midnight Saturday and would run until 5 a.m. CT (1 a.m. to 6 a.m. ET).

Johnson said a decision would be made on a day-by-day basis as to whether the curfew and other security measures would continue.

The order follows a {standoff overnight between police and authorities}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/16/340816212/fresh-tensions-flare-in-ferguson-mo-with-more-tear-gas-looting""> and the looting of several shops in Ferguson.

As Nixon announced the security measures, he was heckled, with an unidentified person demanding the arrest of Darren Wilson, the officer identified as having shot Brown.

""The task that I have at hand, the task of which I have to lead, is to provide peace and security,"" Nixon said.

""Last night, except for a very few, the folks out on the streets of Ferguson were peaceful protesters,"" the governor acknowledged.

As the news conference began to devolve into a free-for-all of heckling, Johnson said: ""What we are doing now is not who we are.

""Yelling is not going to solve things,"" he said. ""The frustration I hear is in my home, too.

""Tonight we will enforce that curfew,"" Johnson said. ""We won't enforce it with trucks. We won't enforce it with arms. We will communicate.

""We will survive this,"" he said. ""We will make a change.""

Johnson said 40 FBI agents were going door to door talking to people in the community who might have information about the shooting.",539,NA,NA,NA

Governor Institutes Curfew",Tess Vigeland; Cheryl Korley,08/16/2014,01/27/2016,"A week after the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, the situation in Ferguson, Mo., remains tense. Protesters took to the streets again overnight, and there were reports of looting.

TESS VIGELAND, HOST:

It has been one week since a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri shot an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, to death. Since then, there have been nightly protests - some turned violent. Last night, violence erupted again after the police released the name of the officer along with a video that indicated Brown might have been a robbery suspect. Today, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency in Ferguson, and he imposed a citywide curfew.

(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)

GOVERNOR JAY NIXON: We're going to achieve justice. We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching.

VIGELAND: NPR's Cheryl Corley joins us now from Ferguson. And, Cheryl, can you tell us a little bit more about this curfew that the governor has imposed on the city of Ferguson and at the tenor of the news conference at which it was announced.

CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: This was a very testy news conference. It was testy because it not - it included not only the media, but lots of very angry community folks and activists who were taking part in the event. But what the governor announced was that this curfew will run from midnight until 5 a.m. And, at this point, it's an open-ended curfew. And as you mentioned, the governor said it is a test, as we heard him in his cut. He said it is a test of whether this community can break the cycle of violence. And they needed to have some peace and no looting, and they're hoping that that is what happens with this curfew that runs from midnight until 5 a.m.

VIGELAND: And remind us about some of the developments that happened today, including what was happening this morning.

CORLEY: Well, a lot of cleanup was going on on one of the main strips of Ferguson because of the looting that had occurred. The businesses were boarding up windows that had been broken and, you know, seeing what happened to the supplies they had. There were also a lot of community folks who came out to help them. People were bringing in coffee and food, and it was a big community effort, not something that was just being done by the businesses themselves. Earlier, there was also a huge march with people chanting, hands up, don't shoot - that's become the mantra of sorts here after the shooting of Michael Brown. And a lot of people have questioned why the Ferguson police released a tape of robbery which indicated that Brown was a suspect the same day they revealed that it was a six-year veteran of the police force, Darren Wilson, who was involved in the shooting. And they believe that that helped precipitate some of the activity that took place last night.

VIGELAND: Cheryl, as I noted, we are now one week into this. Can you describe for us what the general mood is there, not just in Ferguson, but in Missouri?

CORLEY: Well, I would say that it's - it's very tense and continues to be, even though you see some effort to change that. When you had the changing of the guard with security, that - it seemed to tamp down some of the anger and frustration that people had here - but you know, we'll see what happens. There are two investigations that are ongoing, and people want to see just some sort of resolution with that. And we have FBI agents here today who are helping to continue that investigation.

VIGELAND: That's NPR's Cheryl Corley on the line from Ferguson. Cheryl, thank you.

McCaskill On Ferguson: 'We're Going To Get All The Facts',Tess Vigeland(host),08/16/2014,01/27/2016,"Tess Vigeland speaks with Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill about the week of violence and tension in Ferguson, discussing the way forward for the community.

TESS VIGELAND, HOST:

Earlier, I spoke with U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill. She's a Democrat from Missouri, and she's been in Ferguson this week meeting with community leaders. And she's also been speaking with the Justice Department about federal investigations into what happened this week. I asked the senator whether she has confidence in the local police authorities in Ferguson.

SENATOR CLAIRE MCCASKILL: I think there have obviously been some stumbles and some problems, but I think what is reassuring to me is that in my conversations with the Department of Justice officials, both in Washington and here and in St. Louis and with the local law enforcement, there really is all eyes and ears on this investigation. Two different agencies are doing the investigation, but each one of them is doing all of the investigation. And then they're sharing all the information back and forth. And certainly witnesses are being encouraged, if they are uncomfortable talking to local police, to call the FBI. So my sense is we're going to get all the facts. We're going to try to find all the witnesses. And then it will be up to the Justice Department, in a separate consideration, to determine if federal charges are appropriate. And then the local law enforcement will determine whether or not there are state criminal charges that are appropriate.

VIGELAND: There is a sense of shock throughout the country, I think, when people see all of these images of police officers wearing gas masks, camouflage, driving armored vehicles. And much of that equipment comes directly from or is funded by the federal government. And you have now said that this kind of response may be the problem instead of the solution. What changes, if any, do you think Congress could make to this program?

MCCASKILL: Well, I think we take a hard look at what is the equipment that we are passing on to local law enforcement. Some of this coming from Department of Defense and some of it is coming under grants that are given to the federal government under the aegis of Homeland Security. We've been working on this, by the way, for several months in my subcommittee on contracting oversight and government oversight, and we're going to take a hard look at both of these programs. Of course, I think it's good that you would want to share equipment you no longer have the necessity for, but let's make sure it's equipment that's really needed. What we saw the other night was a militarization that was escalating the problem rather than helping with the solution of the problem.

VIGELAND: Well, as noted that you sit on the Homeland Security committee, which of course is a major source of grants for some of this equipment, I wonder, before now, was this question of local police militarization - was it even up for debate?

MCCASKILL: Well, there was certainly a debate about these funds. There has been an effort over the previous few years to cut back on these funds. This was originally as - a lot of this money came as a result of 9-11, and a great deal of it has gone to major metropolitan areas like New York and Washington, D.C. And a lot of other communities have participated in this - these funds also. And it's just time to do a whole gut check on this entire idea of military equipment being used by police officers here in America.

VIGELAND: Senator McCaskill, you are a daughter of Missouri - a resident - how troubling is it for you personally that this is now the image of your state that the world is seeing?

MCCASKILL: Well, it's frustrating because we did have that kind of equipment on the streets for a couple of days and nights. By and large, that has been removed. But those images - because of the image the media being what it is, a picture is a powerful thing. And we haven't seen the pictures that I've seen - standing room only at every church in the Ferguson area, the rooms full of people hugging and loving one another and trying to find solutions, and the young adolescents that are peacefully demonstrating, exercising their rights in America. There are many positive pictures.

VIGELAND: That's U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. Senator McCaskill, thank you so much for your time.

MCCASKILL: Thank you.",37,NA,NA,NA

But a standoff developed around midnight, writes Koran Addo of the Post-Dispatch. ""The groups stood about 20 feet away from one another, some police officers pointing guns at the crowd, some protesters pointing cameras at police. Police told the crowd over a loudspeaker to disperse immediately. Some in the crowd threw a few bottles at police, who didn't initially react.

""After several minutes, police turned and left, but as they retreated, they sprayed smoke bombs and threw sound cannons at the crowd. Some responded by throwing more bottles.""

About 1:30 a.m., another confrontation took place, with protesters screaming at police. Some in the crowd broke from the ranks and began looting the convenience store allegedly robbed by the teenager shortly before he was shot and killed, says Addo.

Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd but made no arrests, AP says.

""Other protesters eventually lined up in front of the market, keeping looters from returning,"" Addo continues. ""Car windows and the glass around at least one bus stop were smashed as a driving rain fell.""

The scene quieted with the arrival of St. Louis Alderman Antonio French and other civic leaders.

The tumultuous night stood in sharp contrast to Thursday, when police came to the protests without tear gas or armored vehicles and walked with demonstrators and posed for photographs.

Gov. Jay Nixon put the State Highway Patrol in charge Thursday, and ""the result was an atmosphere that felt {more like a party}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/2014/08/11/339610983/fbi-opens-probe-into-the-police-shooting-that-roiled-st-louis"">,"" reported Rachel Lippmann of St. Louis Public Radio.

The family of Michael Brown, the slain 18-year-old, questioned Friday why Ferguson police released a surveillance video purportedly showing Brown stealing a box of cigars shortly before he was shot to death. Protesters have called it an attempt to influence public opinion.

""They feel it was aimed at denigrating their son,"" Brown family lawyer Anthony Grey told reporters. ""It was a character assassination attempt.""

Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Friday that the officer who shot Brown is Darren Wilson, 28.

Like similar stories, the Michael Brown shooting has become a flashpoint for conversations about race and policing, and there have been heated, chaotic showdowns between the police there and protesters.

Here's some of what's been written about the shooting and the reaction to it in the week since.

FERGUSON AT A GLANCE

Ferguson, Mo., (pop. 21,000) is a mostly black town, although that's a fairly recent development. {The dramatic racial shift happened over the past few decades}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/14/ferguson-police-department-details/14064451/"">: The city was 85 percent white in 1980, but by 2010, after many white families moved to other suburbs, the town was about two-thirds African-American. Most of St. Louis County, where Ferguson is situated, is white.

But Ferguson's current demographics aren't reflected in its political and civic leadership. The mayor is white, as are five of the six City Council members and all but one member of Ferguson's school board.

{Jordan Weissman of Slate reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/08/14/ferguson_missouri_government_why_is_it_so_white.html""> that the contrast between the public and the political class is due to socioeconomics.

""The issue boils down to who votes. Ferguson is roughly two-thirds black, but compared with the city's whites, the community is younger, poorer (the city has a 22 percent poverty rate overall), and, as the New York Times recently wrote, {somewhat transient}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/opinion/racial-history-behind-the-ferguson-protests.html?_r=0&assetType=opinion"">, prone to moving 'from apartment to apartment.' All of these factors make black residents less likely to go to the polls, especially in low-turnout municipal elections. And so whites dominate politically. 'The entire mobilization side of it is what accounts for the difference,' Kimball said.""

Whites also dominate the town's law enforcement. Several outlets have reported that the town's 53-member police force has only three black officers. In 2013, Ferguson authorities {came under scrutiny from the state attorney general}<hyperlink=""http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/08/14/racial-tensions-in-ferguson-started-long-before-dontshoot""> because of allegations that it racially profiles its black residents; {approximately 9 in 10 people stopped by town police are African-American}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf"">.

USA Today reports that {the crime rate has significantly declined}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/14/ferguson-police-department-details/14064451/""> in Ferguson in recent years, while the New York Times reports that {crime there is much lower}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-missouri-town-under-siege-after-police-shooting.html""> than in one of its neighboring communities.

ON THE GROUND

Starting last Sunday, hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in Ferguson, demanding that the police release information about the shooting. Some incidents of looting were reported early in the protests, and the police came out in full force. (There was some looting on Friday night, as well, {but protesters intervened to block looters from stores}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/16/ferguson-protesters-guard-stores_n_5684042.html"">.) Authorities imposed {a curfew}<hyperlink=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bu7fEcHIUAExfKX.jpg""> — which many people flouted — with the stated aim of stemming the disorder.

Earlier this week, Slate's Jamelle Bouie, reporting from Ferguson, wrote that the heavy police presence was {ratcheting up tensions on both sides}<hyperlink=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2014/08/ferguson_police_attack_protestors_with_tear_gas_rubber_bullets_on_site_reporting.html"">.

""With the arrival of SWAT teams, the demonstration escalated into a standoff. And an hour after the teams' arrival, they began marching down the street and shouting orders. 'You must return to your vehicles, or your homes, in a peaceful manner,' they said, advancing down the street, 'Your right to assembly is not being denied.' ...

""When I returned to the standoff, an hour after SWAT teams arrived, streets were completely blocked off, helicopters were circling, and officers were pouring tear gas onto West Florissant and the surrounding neighborhood, launching flash bangs, shooting rubber bullets, and using noise-based weapons to force people inside.""

It wasn't clear who was responsible for firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters earlier this week, since {there were at least four different law enforcement agencies on the ground}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002291/ferguson-police-st-louis-county-in-charge-jay-nixon-tear-gas-officer-fired"">.

Many journalists covering the story compared Ferguson to a war zone, an impression {underscored by photos of snipers and armored personnel carriers}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/national/what-weapons-are-police-using-in-ferguson/2014/08/14/4acf0920-23e0-11e4-8b10-7db129976abb_video.html"">. Some military veterans were also surprised by the equipment available to Ferguson's police. ""We went through some pretty bad areas of Afghanistan, but we didn't wear that much gear,"" {one former security official for the State Department told the Washington Post}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/14/military-veterans-see-deeply-flawed-police-response-in-ferguson/"">.

For some, the scenes raised alarms about whether military hardware has become too accessible to civilian law enforcement. Counties and towns across the country {have been buying up body armor, armored vehicles, grenade launchers and assault rifles since 9/11}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-missouri-in-wake-of-clashes-calls-to-demilitarize-police.html?rref=us&module=Ribbon&version=context&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=U.S.&pgtype=Multimedia"">, initially in response to concerns about terrorism. That process has been facilitated by federal grants that help authorities procure such equipment with few restrictions and little training on its use. {Annie Lowrey at New York magazine}<hyperlink=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/militarized-police-a-less-violent-public.html""> says that the use of the heavy-duty equipment at a time when crime is falling nationally means it's being deployed to crack down on minor crimes like ""barbering without a license."" ({The NYT has a helpful infographic}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/15/us/surplus-military-equipment-map.html""> about the spread of this kind of equipment among law enforcement agencies across the country.)

Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, voiced concerns about what he saw as the militarization of police departments {in an op-ed for TIME}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/"">.

""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement. ...

""When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury — national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture — we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.

RECONSIDERING THE ROLE OF THE POLICE

This story reminds many Americans of other recent cases, {including the death of Eric Garner in New York}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/07/29/335847224/what-we-see-in-the-eric-garner-video-and-what-we-dont"">, in which an unarmed black man dies in an encounter with the police.

And just like those cases, Brown's death seems to invite a series of all-too-familiar questions: Was Brown a thug? Was Darren Wilson a racist? And, of course: What about black-on-black crime? Why isn't anyone ever upset about that?

""Once the wheels of the bureaucratic state start to turn, they can grind people up.""- Emily Bazelon, Slate

Journalist Monica Potts was once an investigator who probed police misconduct complaints in New York. {She wrote for Code Switch earlier this week}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/08/13/340076968/what-policing-looks-like-to-a-former-investigator-of-misconduct""> that these questions undercut a more necessary and serious conversation about the limits and risks of zero-tolerance policing.

""Is there anything else we can and should do to stop jaywalkers? The Garner video also starts out minor, but after he pulls his hands back away from the officers who are trying to handcuff him, it escalates quickly, with a swarm of officers and a chokehold that turns out to be deadly. Why was it so important to arrest him in the first place? Adding police officers to any situation is going to increase the likelihood of violence, and there's nothing we can do to change that except reconsider the conditions under which we add police. That's because, in any situation, we've given police officers extraordinary powers and wide latitude to 'stop criminals,' without spending a lot of time considering what we mean by 'criminals,' and how far we're willing to go to stop them. ...

""Perhaps, rather than investigating the actions of any one officer, it's time to rethink what lengths we as a society will go to in the name of law and order.""

The skepticism has cut across ideological lines. At the National Review, Charles C.W. Cooke {argued that raising concern over black-on-black crime}<hyperlink=""http://www.nationalreview.com/article/385162/rights-wrong-reaction-missouri-shooting-charles-c-w-cooke""> in the wake of the Brown shooting collapses two very different problems together, and runs the risk of trivializing state-authorized violence.

""The problems of black-on-black crime and the alleged miscarriage of justice in Ferguson are discrete issues per se. But they are philosophically separate, too. It remains the case that a life is a life, and a murder is a murder — after a point, one doesn't grieve more acutely if one's family is taken on purpose. Nevertheless, police shootings will always play a trickier role in society because, by definition, they are carried out under the imprimatur of the state. Even if the United States did not boast a history in which blacks were routinely disfavored, beaten, and even murdered by the governments that were ostensibly established to protect them, there would still be something distinct about being killed or hurt by a man in uniform. No, you are no less dead if your neighbor murders you. But you do enjoy a different relationship with him — and it matters. As a rule, your neighbor does not exist to protect you; he is not paid by the whole of the citizenry; he does not claim to act in your name, or to treat everybody equally. And, if he commits an illegal act, he will be charged by authorities and he will face a jury of his peers that will first pronounce upon his guilt and then decide upon his punishment. He, in other words, is subject to rules that are designed to help you if he steps out of line; the state, by contrast, has very little above it.""

Namely: When you come from a place where the police are a helpful and relatively rare presence, it's hard to think about the police through the prism through the very different frame of someone from a community that's constantly under police surveillance. It's easy to assume that being questioned by the police means that someone's up to no good and not just a normal occurrence in their neighborhood. (Some data points here: {Close to 90 percent of the 684,000 police stops under New York's old stop-and-frisk program}<hyperlink=""http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204795304577221770752633612""> in 2011 were of blacks and Latinos; {check out this New York Times story}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/nyregion/12frisk.html?pagewanted=all""> about life in a Brooklyn neighborhood where everyone was likely to be stopped by the police at some point.)

All that contact introduces lots of potential disruption to people's lives, delaying them from work or home for minutes or, if they're taken into custody for a minor violation, possibly even days — to say nothing about the potential use of force by officers.

{In a provocative piece at Slate}<hyperlink=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/08/michael_brown_eric_garner_debra_harrell_just_three_examples_of_why_i_don.2.html"">, Emily Bazelon wrote that these consequences have led her to avoid calling the police for small problems. She highlighted the case of Debra Harrell, the black single mom who was arrested after she left her 9-year-old daughter to play in the park while she went to work at McDonald's. That woman was subsequently fired from her job at the fast-food chain, where she worked for five years, and her daughter was temporarily placed in foster care. (The case got a lot of attention, and Harrell has since {gotten her job and daughter back}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/07/24/debra-harrell-back-on-her-job-at-mcdonalds-lawyer-says/"">.)

""This is the sharp edge of my explanation for why as a white person, if I have a choice about whether to involve the police in the life of a black person, I will try to choose not to. I'm not saying that I won't call 911 and pray as hard as I can for the police to come if someone, whatever race, breaks in to my house. But much of the time, our choices are made in a far hazier gray area. To go back to the story of Debra Harrell and her daughter, who wound up respectively, getting arrested and going into foster care: If I saw a 9-year-old black girl alone in the park, and she said her mom was at work, I would not call the police. I would ask that girl if she was OK and try to talk to her mom. Because, once the wheels of the bureaucratic state start to turn, they can grind people up.""

David Kennedy, a criminologist at John Jay College in New York, said that many communities subjected to this kind of policing often become further marginalized.

TESS VIGELAND, HOST:

Ferguson has been described as a powder keg in search of a match. The events of the past week are terribly sad, but perhaps not surprising given the town's history of white flight and increasing poverty. Earlier this week, I spoke to Jason Purnell of Washington University in St. Louis. He's lead author of a report on the health and well-being of African-Americans in and around St. Louis that showed ZIP code trumps genetic code in determining the quality and length of their lives.

JASON PURNELL: The largest difference we found between ZIP codes was between 63106, which is in North St. Louis City, and the 63105, which is in a suburb called Clayton. And there was an 18-year difference in life expectancy. And that's a difference, in terms of distance, of under 10 miles. 63106 would be predominately African-American, a high proportion of low income households, an unemployment rate that would be much higher. The suburb of Clayton is ranked among some of the wealthiest municipalities in the country - high home values, predominantly white, the level of access to resources like fresh fruits and vegetables. Just basic human needs are not evenly distributed.

VIGELAND: Well, and, in fact, I read an editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Michael Brown's life expectancy was 15 years less than it would've been had he lived just a ZIP code or two away. Is that true? And do you think that would be true of other urban areas as well?

PURNELL: It's definitely true of other urban areas. The ZIP code where Ferguson is located, 77 years was the life expectancy. Still a gap, still lower than some of the longer-lived ZIP codes in the region, but a better picture, which complicates this narrative that's been put out about Ferguson. It's certainly not the most distressed or disadvantaged portion of our region, but there are still those disparities there.

VIGELAND: This study was released earlier this year to coincide with the anniversaries of both Brown v. Board of Education and the Civil Rights Act. Can you tell us a little bit about the history of segregation in this area that you studied?

PURNELL: What we have in St. Louis is a history of exclusion of African-Americans by both practice and policy. Restrictive deep covenants were a practice in St. Louis where neighbors would come together and agreed not to sell property to African-Americans. Some of the rhetoric around African-Americans moving into neighborhoods as part of the great migration of African-Americans from the South to the North really had some frightening metaphors in terms of this contagion, this sickness that would overtake properties. Segregation has implications for the economic viability of St. Louis.

VIGELAND: Was there anything that surprised you in this study?

PURNELL: I think the surprise for me was more that we are still dealing with the issues as a country that many people thought we had overcome. The thing that troubles me is that so many children are growing up without opportunities and those resources. And that's what drives me in doing this research. I really want to change the paradigm in this region from viewing children in disinvested under-resourced areas as problems to viewing them as resources to be invested in. And every one of our recommendations is about steps that we can take to improve the health of the entire community.

VIGELAND: Jason Purnell is an assistant professor at Washington University in St. Louis and one of the authors of the report ""For The Sake Of All."" Thank you.

PURNELL: I appreciate it. Thank you.",5,NA,NA,NA

It was likely the last of bullets to hit him, he said.
Mr. Brown, 18, was also shot four times in the right arm, he said, adding that all the bullets were fired into his front.

The Justice Department has ordered a second autopsy of Michael Brown, the black teen who was fatally shot by police last week in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, sparking off a week of angry and frequently violent protests.

Justice, which is leading an independent investigation into the shooting of the unarmed black teen, issued a statement saying that due to ""the extraordinary circumstances involved in the case"" Attorney General Eric Holder had arranged for a second autopsy on the victim to be performed by a federal medical examiner.

""This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,"" the DOJ said. ""Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.""

The announcement followed another night of confrontations between protesters and law enforcement in Ferguson, Mo., when some people defied a state-imposed midnight to 5 a.m. curfew.

One person was also shot and critically wounded in the mayhem, and a suspect was being sought, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said. In an early morning news conference, he said a total of seven people had been arrested overnight, all for ""failure to disperse.""

{St. Louis Public Radio's Stephanie Lecci}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/night-one-ferguson-curfew-shots-fired-one-person-critical-condition""> says: ""The violence erupted after another night of peaceful protests that turned, once [the] curfew was broken.""

Many people, she reports, resented the curfew, {ordered Saturday by Gov. Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/16/340943120/mo-governor-orders-state-of-emergency-curfew-in-ferguson""> after {Friday night's violence and looting}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/16/340816212/fresh-tensions-flare-in-ferguson-mo-with-more-tear-gas-looting"">, but most protesters did leave before it went into effect.

However, ""a group of about 50 people made clear they weren't moving — despite the pleas of organizers. By 1 a.m., the scene had turned violent,"" Lecci reports.

Some of them chanted: ""No justice! No curfew!""

Police confronted the protesters, who gathered in the same neighborhood where Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9. Authorities ordered the crowd to disperse, and when they refused, the police fired smoke and tear gas.

Police said the protesters tossed at least one bottle rocket. The Associated Press, quoting Johnson, said authorities:

""Received a report that people broke into Red's Barbecue and some were on the roof — creating a potential danger for officers trying to disperse the protesters. Police were responding to that report — not the fact that protesters were still on the street after curfew, Johnson said.
""Things got worse when a man with a handgun went into the street as police were nearing the restaurant. He ran away, but there was plenty of violence.""
{The New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html?_r=1""> says the standoff between protesters and police began about 12:30 a.m. CT and ended about 45 minutes later.

But hundreds of protesters, such as Orie Hood of St. Louis, said they'd heed the warning to get off the streets.

""I'm going to obey the curfew,"" Hood told NPR's Cheryl Corley. ""I can't fight them. I don't have any bullets. I don't have any guns. I don't want to get shot. I have something to live for. But at the same time, I want to be heard.""

Nixon, appearing on CNN today, said the local community had asked for the curfew.

""When we saw that second night"" of looting and violence, ""we knew we had to protect people's property,"" the governor said.

He said he was pleased that in the first night of the curfew ""not a single shot was fired by law enforcement.""

Asked how long the curfew would go on, he said there would be a meeting with leaders today, but ""that will be judged by the people.""

Later, appearing on ABC's This Week, Nixon said he was unaware that the Ferguson police department planned to release a surveillance video showing Brown purportedly robbing a convenience store, which reportedly took place minutes before the fatal shooting.

""We were unaware they were going to release it,"" he said. ""We certainly were not happy with that being released, especially in the way that it was.

""It made emotions raw,"" he said.",792,NA,NA,NA

Former Mayor Brian Fletcher is passing out more.

""We're going to raise $5,000 by tomorrow at noon for yard signs,"" Fletcher says.

Overnight clashes led to one shooting and several injuries. The nightly protests started after last Saturday's shooting death of an unarmed black teen — Michael Brown — at the hands of a white police officer.

So many questions remain unanswered here, fueling anxiety that Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon tried to address on a number of national networks. He emphasized on ABC that his office was not happy with the release of a surveillance video showing Brown purportedly robbing a convenience store.

""It appeared to ... cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,"" Nixon said.

At the predominantly black Greater St. Mark Family Church, the Rev. Audrey Hollis says there's a real reason for raw emotions.

""The underlying current of racism is still very real in the city of St. Louis,"" Hollis says.

But sermons at both black and white congregations sounded similar messages — calling for the tough community conversations that haven't happened yet.

""The problems are deep and systemic,"" said pastor Mike Trautman, in his message to the overwhelmingly white First Presbyterian Church of Ferguson. ""Too many people have stood tall in this community over the years to allow this event to unravel all the good work that has happened.""

For more than a decade, Trautman has been working on community issues here with interfaith ministry volunteer and Ferguson native Toni Burrow. She's called this place home for 64 years.

""One of the things that hurt me so is that people come from outside of Ferguson to do for us,"" Burrow says. ""If you look around at the things that go on in Ferguson, the lives that we live, we don't need that kind of help.""

These longtime friends say they're seeing Ferguson come together during this tough time.

On the main drag where protests go on nightly, Ferguson residents have been showing up to help clean up. Volunteers have turned a parking lot into a place to drop off food and supplies. And community leaders see this moment as a pivot point.

""My fear is that it will be business as usual when this dies down,"" Burrow says. ""And it will die down. It always does.""

For now, the tensions wear on. Trautman is using his pulpit to push for changes.

""I am hoping that out of this we can renew the dialogue,"" Trautman says. ""But we have to have a different dialogue. We have to learn to talk to one another a little differently.""

But first, they're praying for peace. On Sunday night, the newly instituted citywide curfew gets its second test.",219,NA,NA,NA

Violence flared several hours before a midnight curfew was set to begin in the St. Louis-area town of Ferguson on Sunday, with police using tear gas and smoke to disperse protesters, turning off street lights and reportedly threatening journalists with arrest if they didn't clear the roads.

Demonstrators began marching down West Florissant Avenue around 8:30 p.m. CT but came into contact with a police line, which seems to have kicked off the dramatic clashes that unfolded.

The fast-moving situation was intensified with fireworks that were confused as gunshots, and what some witnesses say was actual exchanges of gunshots. It's unclear who was doing the firing. A number of locals have told NPR that they're increasingly frustrated that Ferguson residents are being represented by small handfuls of looters and rioters, who they suspect are from out of town.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

At the White House this afternoon, President Obama renewed his call for calm in Ferguson. He urged both the police and protesters to try and understand one another rather than simply, as he said, hollering at each other The president took time out from his summer vacation today to get an update on the situation from Attorney General Eric Holder. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now from the White House. And, Scott, you were there for the briefing. This is the second time in less than a week that the president has spoken about events in Ferguson. What did he have to say?

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Well, he noted, once again, that the Justice Department is conducting its own independent probe into the death of Michael Brown, and he announced that Attorney General Holder will travel to Ferguson on Wednesday of this week to meet with some of the FBI agents who are conducting that investigation as well as community leaders. Now, the president, himself, was very careful not to prejudge the investigation, but he did speak about the need to allow peaceful protesters to exercise their rights while also preventing a small group of lawbreakers from looting and making mischief.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown. Giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only deserves to raise tensions and stir chaos. It undermines rather than advancing justice.

CORNISH: You know, Scott, with the rapid escalation of tensions between protesters and the police, there's been a lot of criticism about the militarization of local police forces. What did the president have to say about that?

HORSLEY: Well, he kind of give us a little history lesson. He talked about the good intentions that were behind the push to put military hardware into the hands of police forces in the wake of the September 11th attacks when it was felt that, maybe, police forces weren't adequately prepared to defend against a real terror attacks. But now, Obama says, is a good time to re-examine some of that and look at the equipment that has gone from the Pentagon to local police forces - whether that equipment is appropriate - how Homeland Security grant money is being spent. And the president noted that this is a concern that is coming from both Democrats and from Republicans.

OBAMA: There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred.

CORNISH: And the president also spoke about international issues. He got a briefing at the White House today about developments in Iraq. And it sounds as if Kurdish and Iraqi government forces have been having some success with the help of U.S. warplanes, right?

HORSLEY: That's right. U.S. warplanes had been caring out airstrikes over the weekend, and today, they carried out more than a dozen airstrikes, using both fighter jets, bombers and unmanned drones. And the president said those strikes have made a difference and are paying off.

OBAMA: Today, with our support, Iraqi and Kurdish forces took a major step forward by recapturing the largest dam in Iraq near the city of Mosul.

HORSLEY: And that's important because, of course, had that dam been breached, the president said it could've been catastrophic both for Iraqi citizens and for U.S. personnel as far away as the embassy in Baghdad. The president also talked about progress that's been made on the political front in Iraq with movement towards a new and more inclusive government that could unite Iraqis in the face of militants from the Islamic State. But while the new prime minister designate Haider al-Abadi is saying the right things, Obama was cautious to say they're still a lot of work left to do.

Only one of those wounds — to the top of the teenager's head — was deemed not survivable by former New York City chief medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden.

Baden and another pathologist hired by Brown's family say they believe that the two bullets that struck Brown in the head ""were most likely the last two"" to hit him during {a confrontation on a street}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/tags/339509702/ferguson""> last Saturday.

His preliminary report also found no gunshot residue on Brown's skin, Baden said — but he cautioned that he didn't have access to clothing the teenager had been wearing.

Discussing the reasons for conducting a private autopsy, Baden said it came out of the family's concerns over a lack of transparency from local authorities.

A diagram released along with an overview of the report indicates wounds along the right side of Brown's body, arms and neck, along with the two head wounds.

Baden was aided in his examination by Shawn Parcells, a forensic pathologist assistant who said they had determined at least two of Brown's wounds were likely re-entry wounds. And he said that while some of the wounds could be from the man taking a defensive position, such as raising his hands, others, such as one to the top of his head, show that Brown had likely leaned over forward.

The details were discussed at a news conference Monday morning held by the Brown family's legal team, including Benjamin Crump, who also represented the family of Florida shooting victim Trayvon Martin.

Crump said the preliminary report ""verifies that the witness accounts were true: he was shot multiple times"" in broad daylight.

Saying that some wounds show that bullets went ""from a back to a front position,"" another attorney, Daryl Parks, said the findings prove that the teenager had been trying to run away from the scene. Parks said that as a result, ""we believe the officer should have been arrested.""

The police on Friday {identified that officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/15/340594634/ferguson-police-release-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown""> as Darren Wilson, a six-year veteran of the force.

Requested by the family, the autopsy finds that Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot six times by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo. This news follows the most violent night of protests there since the shooting.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

Residents are bracing for another night of demonstrations in Ferguson, Missouri. This morning Governor Jay Nixon says he's deploying the Missouri National Guard to secure the St. Louis suburb, and he lifted the midnight curfew imposed over the weekend.

Also today, Michael Brown's family released preliminary results from an independent autopsy. NPR's Elise Hu reports from Ferguson.

ELISE HU, BYLINE: After days of failing to get answers from St. Louis County investigators about their son's death, Michael Brown's family hired an independent pathologist to answer some key questions. The autopsy by former New York City medical examiner Michael Baden and his associate, Shawn Parcells, showed Brown was shot six times, twice in the head - an answer the Brown family wanted sooner.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BENJAMIN CRUMP: It could have been answered on day one if you were really trying to have transparency be the objective.

HU: Brown's family attorney, Benjamin Crump, says the victim's mother, like any other mom, wanted to know if her son suffered.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CRUMP: She had the lingering question, as any mother would have, was my child in pain? And Dr. Baden shared with her, in his opinion, he did not suffer.

HU: But even with this information, pathologist Shawn Parcells says there's plenty of open questions about the circumstances that led to Brown's death.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SHAWN PARCELLS: We still have to look at other aspects of this investigation before we can really start piecing things together.

HU: The announcement of the private autopsy results came just as the community was waking up after another night of mayhem. Calm and quiet protests during the day here mask an anxiety that creeps in each night. Police show up at every intersection. They begin blocking roads as the sun sets, and for at least the last three nights in a row, nightfall has meant chaos - cops in riot gear, tear gas sprayed at crowds, confusion on every corner.

RODERICK GRIFFITH: I see it everyday from the window.

HU: Roderick Griffith works as a barber at Prime Time Barber Shop. It's located at the central hub of protests and police activity. He describes two Ferguson's - during the day...

GRIFFITH: Calm.

HU: At night...

GRIFFITH: A war zone.

HU: When chaos broke out Sunday night, Griffith's barbershop filled with cops who were hit by the stray tear gas they used on crowds.

GRIFFITH: They all just came in here and just all piled in here - 60 metropolitan police in the barbershop. There was tear gas, snot running out of their nose - everything.

HU: By morning, Ferguson residents took part in what's become a new ritual - helping clean up shattered businesses. Looters hit the Dellwood Market, a convenience store, sometime Sunday night.

GERARD ADAMS: It's a mess. I'm talking about - you can't describe it. It's just messed up. They didn't have to do all this. Really, they didn't.

HU: Gerard Adams sweeps up broken glass that's soaked in liquor, spilled from store shelves. Like so many locals, he's sick of these scenes.

ADAMS: They're just doing something to be doing something - like, they're letting somebody know. Ain't nothing being known. It's just being a problem now.

HU: He doesn't want to be cleaning up. He, like barber Roderick Griffith, say they feel trapped by barricades in their own town. They're eager to get back to business.

GRIFFITH: I'm losing money. This is how we eat.

HU: But looking out on a main drag where cops are already converging, Griffith says he's not hopeful about peace tonight.

GRIFFITH: So how do you act when you're angry? You act out. You lash out. That's how they're acting.

HU: With so much uncertainty as night falls, getting back to normal may be days away. Elise Hu, NPR News, Ferguson, Missouri.",9,NA,NA,NA

Jay Nixon has signed an executive order sending the National Guard to Ferguson. And because of the unrest, schools are closed Monday. They were to have opened last week.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Good morning. Here is the latest from Ferguson, Missouri, the community still reeling after an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, was shot by police.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

There were more protests and more tear gas last night.

GREENE: Missouri's governor, Jay Nixon, has ordered the National Guard to help restore order. And the town is under a state of emergency and a midnight curfew.

MCEVERS: Also last night, an independent autopsy report revealed that Michael Brown was shot at least six times - twice in the head.

GREENE: Now, despite the escalating tension, the public schools in Ferguson were scheduled to open today for the fall semester. But they're remaining shut. Parents are hoping that getting back to the school routine soon will give Ferguson kids and perhaps their parents a breather from the tumultuous times gripping this town. Frank Morris from member station KCUR reports.

FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: Last night at 11, you could play kick-the-can with smoke and teargas canisters right in the middle of the busiest protest street in Ferguson. It was eerily quiet, but only because the nightly confrontation with police had exploded hours earlier than normal. Protesters, including small children, fled when police fired tear gas responding to pops they took to be gunfire. But some residents described it as fireworks. And one who would only give his nickname, Bubba, said they felt like they were being intentionally humiliated.

BUBBA: You know what happens when you back a dog in the corner. He's going to act out, and he's going to bite you aggressively. You can't treat people like animals. Treat people how you want to be treated. That's the golden rule, I thought. So if they don't want to honor the golden rule, well, then the result is going to be the actions that you see.

MORRIS: Looters torched a store just outside of Ferguson. But earlier in the evening, a mile from the tense, noisy standoffs and just down the street from the burned markets, something entirely different was going on.

MELISSA FITZGERALD: OK, guys, we're going to put our signs right over there, and Kyle's grabbing some sidewalk chalk.

MORRIS: Melissa Fitzgerald and about 20 volunteer parents and kids are decorating Griffith Elementary with hand-made signs in anticipation of school opening today. They've done the same thing for every school in the district this year.

FITZGERALD: You know, we just want our kids to have a good first day of school. Our first day of school is going to be special and exciting and really fun.

MORRIS: Because what's been going on Ferguson lately hasn't been.

FITZGERALD: It's scary. I mean, this is not a normal situation.

MORRIS: Psychologist Marva Robinson has been working with young people in the neighborhood where Michael Brown was shot and others living near the protests. She says it's the type of thing that can really shake a kid's world.

MARVA ROBINSON: If that is viewing a tornado take your home away or viewing military tanks roll into your town and pointing guns at you saying that you can't come outside, it's that same sort of gut-wrenching feeling that our children suffer from.

MORRIS: And there are a lot of kids living near the battleground in Ferguson.

DENNIS JETHROE: You want some water?

HARLEM: No. I want something to eat.

MORRIS: Dennis Jethroe is taking his 4-year-old son, Harlem, from their home here, a couple of blocks over, to see the burned-out convenience store where the boy's treats used to come from - important education for a young African-American boy, according to Jethroe.

JETHROE: It's like, I'm going to be protecting my family, going to be protected. But I just fear for him as he gets older. That's why I'm trying to show him these things. It can happen. It can be that fast. You could put on your shoes and clothes in the morning and don't even make it home at night. Yeah.

MORRIS: If that sounds a little grim, Jethroe's got plenty of company in Ferguson these days.

(SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHANTING)

MORRIS: Like a lot of people at this enormous and very peaceful rally featuring Reverend Al Sharpton yesterday. Angela Bradley tells the story of facing terror when one of the nightly protests turned bad.

ANGELA BRADLEY: I was running. I was praying for my life. I was - at first, I was running alongside a white journalist and we were, like, headed towards one side-street, and then he ended up across the street. I almost got hit by a car. So then I turned around the other way. The smoke was so thick where we were that I couldn't really see. So I'm coughing and gagging and putting my shirt over my head at the same time.

MORRIS: Bright lights flashed, and she says she was looking down police gun barrels.

BRADLEY: The immediate thought that came in my mind was my children were at home and I was just - I just turned around and just ran in the other direction, and it was chaos. It was chaotic.

ROBINSON: Definitely, that is a classic example of trauma.

Freeman Bosley, Johnson's attorney and a former mayor of St. Louis, speaks about the situation.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Freeman Bosley, former mayor of St. Louis, is the lawyer for Dorian Johnson, the 22-year-old man who was with Michael Brown on the night Brown was shot by police officer Darren Wilson. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: We describe Dorian Johnson as ""the man who was with Michael Brown on the night that [Brown] was shot and killed."" Brown was not shot at night but around noon, local time.] And he joins us now. And, Mr. Bosley, first, have the police or the FBI interviewed your client to take his account of the shooting?

FREEMAN BOSLEY: Yes, they did, and I'm glad that you asked that because sometimes people seem to think that we are just now releasing information or just now making statements. But my client, Dorian Johnson, last Wednesday - as late as last Wednesday we met with the FBI, Department of Justice, police officers investigating the case for the St. Louis County prosecutor's office. And Mr. Johnson gave an account of what he started out doing that morning when he woke up. Talked to them about the fact that he and Mr. Big Mike went to the Ferguson Market. He talked about the incident involving the cigarillos and talked about the walk on the way back leading up to the confrontation. Well, with the officers and then ultimately the shooting in which Big Mike was killed.

SIEGEL: Now, Dorian Johnson has been quoted as saying that officer Wilson shot, as you say Big Mike, Michael Brown, in the back. The autopsy that was performed at the Brown family's request by Michael Baden found no such wound. There's nothing consistent with that. Could Dorian Johnson be mistaken as eye witnesses sometimes are mistaken?

BOSLEY: Yeah, well, you know, here's what's all unfolded in a matter of seconds. He saw Big Mike run by, he saw the officer run by, he did see the officer firing at Big Mike. Now the autopsy - with his back to the officer. The autopsy does show that there was a shot to the arm that could be from the back. OK, so that wouldn't be inconsistent with what my client testified to, but what he shot him directly in the back - I guess we now know that was not the case.

SIEGEL: A self-described friend of Officer Darren Wilson went on a St. Louis talk radio show and related what she says was Wilson's account of the shooting. And by that account, Michael Brown punched him, wrestled for control of his gun and ultimately, after walking away, turned back and charged at the police officer. Does Dorian Johnson say that any of those things happened?

BOSLEY: Dorian Johnson's account does not involve a fight between Big Mike and the officer while they are at that car. It does describe a tussle in which the officer attempted to pull Big Mike by the - closer to the car. It's my understanding that a shot was fired at the car, that Big Mike was able to get away, and that he and Dorian began running.

SIEGEL: And at any point, did Mike Brown stop running and turn back and charge the police officer, according to your client?

BOSLEY: According to Dorian, he did stop running. He put his hands in the air and turned around, and that's when the officer fired on him. Big Mike did fall forward, OK, so people may be able to infer that the officer may have felt he was charging but Big Mike, according to Dorian, did not charge the officer. He turned around, put his hands up.

SIEGEL: So, he stopped running, did turn around, but you're saying not for the purpose of being aggressive - rather, surrendering to the officer is your client's account.

BOSLEY: Well, in most instances people that turnaround, put their hands up - they're not going to charge you. They've put their hands up as if that's an indication that, hey, I'm done. I'm surrendering.

SIEGEL: To what extent should we question his account of events, knowing that he had just been, if not a participant, an immediate witness to a - you know, a kind of a pretty thuggish moment there in that store when Michael Brown stole those cigars, and more to the point sort of shoved the sales clerk away in a rather aggressive way. Is Dorian Johnson - does he have a stake in his version of events?

BOSLEY: Well, of course everybody has a stake in their version of events. My dad told me that my grandmother, his mother, used to always tell him, son, every tulip has to sit on its own bottom. And that's the same case with Dorian Johnson. I mean, his story, his case is going to have to stand on him - him as a person, him as an individual, him as a character. Twelve people sitting in a box, a jury, will be able to observe him. They'll be able to listen to him. They'll be able to check into his demeanor and make their decision as to whether or not he'll be credible.

SIEGEL: Mayor Bosley, thank you very much for talking to us.

BOSLEY: I appreciate you. Thank you so much.

FBI agents are set to finish canvassing for witnesses to the shooting of Michael Brown, and more federal peacemakers will arrive to try to ease tensions.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

It's been nine days since an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown was shot and killed on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri by a white police officer. A private autopsy, conducted at the request of Brown's family, showed that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. A medical examiner working with the Justice Department will conduct another independent autopsy. At the White House today, President Obama met with Attorney General Eric Holder and outlined his next steps.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The attorney general, himself, will be traveling to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with the FBI agents and the DOJ personnel conducting the federal criminal investigation, and he will receive an update from them on their progress. He will also be meeting with other leaders in the community whose support is so critical to bringing about peace and calm in Ferguson.

CORNISH: Joining us to talk more about the federal investigation is NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson. And, Carrie, first what more do we know about the Justice Department probe?

CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: The Justice Department has a really limited role here, Audie. Murder is, generally, not prosecuted in the federal system, So the only jurisdictional hook the Justice Department has is whether the police officer violated Michael Brown's civil rights in this shooting. And in order to make that case, they have to prove the officer, Darren Wilson, intended to use more force than a reasonable person would. That's a really big challenge for federal prosecutors. They have to delve into details such as what the officer said and did at the time - what was in his brain. And now the Attorney General is going to go to Ferguson later this week and hear more about witness statements and where things stand with that probe.

CORNISH: So that's the challenge for federal prosecutors, but are there other steps the federal government can take short of going to court?

JOHNSON: Other steps and, in fact, many of those are now underway. Authorities have already sent community relations officials to Ferguson to try to sooth tensions. This is part of a unit that was started in 1964 during the civil rights struggles in the American South. And they're also offering locals advice about community policing - what strategies work for crowd control - which strategies don't. And the DOJ official in charge of community policing is also going down to Ferguson this week.

CORNISH: Crowd control has become such an issue here, given the criticisms of the way the local police have dealt with protesters, deploying tear gas and pointing weapons at unarmed people. What's the administration saying about that?

JOHNSON: The president says there's no excuse for excessive force by police and that there's a big difference between civilian and military law enforcement. That difference, he says, helps preserve American civil liberties. He sounded pretty open today to reviewing federal programs that send equipment in grant money to law enforcement. And that echoes what members of Congress have been saying for the last several days. The president does say it's important to protect the right to protest, but he said we shouldn't fall under the influence of a small group of people - many of them not from Ferguson - who are looting and raising tensions and undermining justice there.

CORNISH: Now, Carrie, at the White House today, President Obama also talked about a gulf of mistrust between police and African-Americans. Now, what, if anything, can the administration do about that?

JOHNSON: Well, on the level of the Justice Department - over the last few days, I've been speaking to civil rights lawyers who used to work there. They expect, at some point, the DOJ is going to launch another investigation in Ferguson. This one would look at the conduct of local and county police - how they've handled crowd control and reporters and how the force has about 50 officers but only three of them are African-American. That's what's known as a pattern or practice of discriminatory action investigation. And it's a conversation not just in Ferguson, the Attorney General says, but also in many other places around the country.

CORNISH: That's NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson. Carrie, thank you.

Updated at 7:10 p.m. ET — Obama Press Conference

Asked if he could be doing more himself — including going to the St. Louis suburb — Obama said he did not want to appear to be tipping the scale of justice one way or the other.

""I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed,"" he said.

Obama also discussed his efforts to work with communities ""that feel left behind,"" including the {My Brother's Keeper initiative}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2014/05/30/317428231/is-the-deck-stacked-against-black-boys-in-america"">.

""Part of the ongoing challenge of perfecting our union has involved dealing with communities that feel left behind, who as a consequence of tragic histories often find themselves isolated, often find themselves without hope, without economic prospects,"" the president said. ""Part of my job that I can do, I think without any potential conflict, is to get at those root causes.""

Obama noted that getting to those roots has been a challenge for centuries, but in the short term, he said he wanted to ensure that justice was carried out fairly in Ferguson.

""It's clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting,"" he said. ""What's also clear is that a small minority of people are not."" But he said there is ""no excuse for excessive force by police"" or action that denies people's right to freedom of speech or assembly.

In regards to Gov. Jay Nixon's decision to call in the National Guard (which will be overseen by the state Highway Patrol), Obama said that he would be watching in the next several days ""to assess whether in fact it's helping rather than hindering progress.""

As {NPR's Carrie Johnson reported last week}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2014/08/14/340421047/attorney-general-holder-ferguson-scenes-cannot-continue"">, the attorney general has also condemned ""extreme displays of force"" by local police.

Civil rights lawyers who used to work for the Justice Department tell Johnson that at some point Justice may announce a bigger civil investigation of local police behavior and the relatively low number of African-Americans in the force. ""Those are ripe targets for investigation by DOJ moving forward,"" Johnson says on All Things Considered.

But with Brown's case, Johnson reports, the Justice Department has a ""limited role"" because murder is not generally prosecuted in the federal system.

""So the only jurisdictional hope that the attorney general has here is to find out whether the police officer who shot Michael Brown violated his civil rights,"" Johnson tells NPR's Audie Cornish. ""In order to make that case, federal prosecutors would have to prove the officer, Darren Wilson, intended to use way more force than a reasonable person would in the same situation.""

Meanwhile, protests continue in Ferguson. And Obama has called for calm once again.

""Let's seek to heal rather than wound each other,"" he said.",770,NA,NA,NA

Two of those bullets hit Brown in the head. The autopsy was conducted at the request of Brown's family by former New York City chief medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden.

Before those developments, Sunday night had already brought fresh violence to Ferguson, as at least two people were reportedly shot in what police say was gunfire coming from within the crowd of demonstrators.

After that incident around 8:30 p.m., police then used tear gas to try to disperse the crowd and reach the victims. But some families were caught in the middle.

From {St. Louis Public Radio's}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/national-guard-called-after-ferguson-shatters-night-rolling-confrontation""> Durrie Bouscaren:

""A peaceful march down West Florissant Avenue turned violent after a woman was shot — to reach the victim, police began advancing with armored trucks, throwing tear gas, and later shooting rubber bullets.
""Cars filled the road as demonstrators tried to leave, others moved forward towards police, placing bricks and broken glass in the street.
""At a press conference around 1 a.m., State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said police had received a report of eight people with guns in the area. According to police, officers were shot at but sustained no injuries.""

Also Sunday, three journalists — from Sports Illustrated, the Financial Times, and The Telegraph — {were briefly arrested}<hyperlink=""http://www.poynter.org/2014/more-journalists-arrested-in-ferguson/263931/""> before being released.

The governor's move to call in the National Guard came after a midnight-5 a.m. curfew failed to calm crowds angered by Brown's death — and upset by how police have handled the case. Nixon issued a statement after 1 a.m. today, in which he said in part:

""I join the people of Ferguson, and all Missourians, in strongly condemning this criminal activity that included firing upon law enforcement officers, shooting a civilian, throwing Molotov cocktails, looting and a coordinated attempt to block roads and overrun the Unified Command Center. These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory, and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served, and to feel safe in their own homes.""

Later in the day, he also said there there would be no curfew Monday night.

All schools in the {Ferguson-Florissant School District}<hyperlink=""http://www.fergflor.org/pages/Ferguson-Florissant_SD""> have canceled classes for Monday, throwing the start of the school year further into disarray one week after it was originally planned to begin. At least two neighboring districts followed suit. As {we reported earlier}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/18/341233889/more-mayhem-in-ferguson-tear-gas-looting-gunshots"">, in announcing the move, the district said, ""We are planning to receive and support our students as soon as possible.""

Anticipating the start of classes, some parents and kids have been decorating their schools, trying to get kids excited about a return to normalcy. And some parents are using the chaos as a learning opportunity, as member station KCUR's Frank Morris reports for Morning Edition:

""Dennis Jethroe has taken his 4-year-old son, Harlem, from their home here, a couple of blocks over, to see the burned-out convenience store where the boy's treats used to come from. It's an important education for a young African-American boy, according to Jethroe.""

""I just fear for him as he gets older,"" Jethroe says. ""That's why I'm trying to show him these things. It can happen, it can be that fast. You can put on your shoes and clothes in the morning, and don't even make it home that night.""

The National Guard is deploying to Ferguson a week after {a human rights delegation from Amnesty International}<hyperlink=""http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/amnesty-international-sends-human-rights-delegation-to-ferguson-missouri""> arrived in the town.",517,NA,NA,NA

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

So if you've been on the Internet at all in the past few weeks, you have seen these things - videos of people dumping buckets of ice on their heads. It's all for a good cause. A grassroots fundraising effort to benefit the ALS Association and awareness of ALS - it's a neurodegenerative illness also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. If you haven't seen it, here's how it works - a person makes a video of him or herself dumping a bucket of ice over their head and challenges three other people to do the same - or donate. Dozens of celebrities have accepted the challenge. Here's singer Demi Lovato.

DEMI LOVATO: (Screaming).

MCEVERS: Basketball star LeBron James.

OPRAH WINFREY: (Screaming).

MCEVERS: To hear more about this kind of online social media fundraising, we're joined by Beth Kanter. She's the author of ""Measuring The Networked Nonprofit."" I wonder if you could help me out here. I'm a little confused about the ALS challenge because it seems like the idea is either donate $100 to the ALS Association or dump a bucket of ice water on your head. So you're basically giving people the choice to opt out of donating the money. I mean, that seems counterintuitive. Is that a good strategy?

BETH KANTER: Well, actually the strategy is working. The ALS Association is reporting that they've raised over $15 million compared to last year's slightly $1 million during the same period. And the donations have come from existing donors and over 300,000 new donors. I think part of the success is that really it appeals to kind of the way that we're using social media. We're always taking selfies, we're sharing details about our lives. So why not, you know, do a little social narcissism for a good cause?

MCEVERS: I mean, is there any other reason that this ALS challenge has taken off do you think?

KANTER: Well, you know, we've had a summer of downer news, you know, Iraq, conflict in the Middle East, Ferguson, the death of Robin Williams - you know, something that's positive and makes us feel good, I think people are ready for that.

MCEVERS: I mean, like everything on the Internet, there must be some backlash to this. What has been the backlash that you're aware of?

KANTER: You know, it's slacktivism - people are just dumping water over their heads, but they're not donating. It's a substitute for real long-term involvement and engagement with the charity. And all well and good, it won't change a thing or cure ALS or ease the suffering with those with the disease, on and on and on (laughter).

MCEVERS: OK, so that's all the criticism. But, I mean, you're saying it's something that works. Is this a tactic we're seeing other people use in fundraising on the Internet?

KANTER: Well, this whole idea of anybody can be a donor and raise money for a good cause, you don't have to be John D. Rockefeller. You can raise money from your network and your friends to support a good cause. And one of the key ways these campaigns become successful is the social proofing that's involved. And what I mean by social proofing is you're observing other people in your network doing something and you want to participate as well. In this particular challenge, I first heard about this not from the charity and not from colleagues writing about it, but actually one of my husband's friends on Facebook did it and he turned around and said what is this ALS challenge? Should I do this? My friend Paul's doing it.

MCEVERS: So it's peer pressure.

KANTER: Peer pressure, right. Social proofing is peer pressure.

MCEVERS: Another trait you've written about is you are seeing the age of philanthropists dropping. You call them philanthrokids - tell us a little bit about that.

KANTER: This is generation Z, you know, sort of 12 to 18 year olds. And they're very facile and savvy with online social networks and also cell phones. And they're putting those technology tools to use for good causes. And this is different than school fundraising projects where we all brought our box tops in or we went around begging people to donate their lunch money. This is, you know, individuals, kids, going out there and doing fundraisers. An example - I came across one a couple of weeks ago - his name was Braden (ph). He's 10 years old. He started his own nonprofit to address food scarcity in his community in Delaware. And he's raising money so he can purchase bags of food for families in his community and he has gotten recognized. He was invited to the White House by Michelle Obama. So I'm seeing more of this, sort of the ages dropping.

MCEVERS: All right, that's Beth Kanter. Thank you so much.

KANTER: Thank you.

NPR,npr60,http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2014/08/19/341341699/top-40-in-a-summer-of-discontent,Top 40 In A Summer Of Discontent,Ann Powers,08/19/2014,01/28/2016,"Those of us who are lucky enough to be technologically interconnected are currently enduring an overwhelming summer of discontent. To say so is to wring the obvious from a cliché. The information so easily available now, jumping onto mobile screens in pulsing letters, makes age-old problems immediate. Racism. Conflicts over land and human rights. Spreading disease. Environmental perils. Famous lives lost; obscure lives made famous through grotesque endings. All of it has happened countless times before. What might be new in our own time is the disconcerting mix of urgency and helplessness that overcomes everyone as we recline in our separate rooms, scrolling through the horrors on machines that only virtually connect us, thinking, this is happening right in front of me. I have to do something. Yet I'm so far away.

Many people I know reached some kind of breaking point last week, during the unfolding conflict between police and citizens in Ferguson, Mo., following the shooting death of Mike Brown. Twitter and live-streaming independent media sources brought this violence close — as other demonstrators said in a different era, {the whole world was watching}<hyperlink=""http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520239326"">. The lack of an interpretive context around what social media exposed made events seem both more palpable and more shocking. How to respond? Music-minded person that I am, I sought songs to share, not as any kind of solution, but simply as a way of witnessing. I chose {Marvin Gaye}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/artists/15669282/marvin-gaye""> and the gospel exhortations of Dorothy Love Coates. These were old, reliable semaphores. Would there be new ones soon, I wondered, to suit today's particular mood of time-lapsed urgency?

During times of social crisis, music is a motivator and a comfort. Sometimes, artists address issues head-on, in protest or to cultivate compassion. More often, though, songs take on new meanings because of the times. Well-worn examples: ""{Respect,}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FOUqQt3Kg0"">"" owned by {Aretha Franklin}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/artists/15662553/aretha-franklin"">, transformed from a lover's backtalk to an anthem of both feminist and racial pride. {Stephen Stills}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/artists/15399328/stephen-stills""> wrote ""{For What It's Worth}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5JCrSXkJY"">"" about the trouble that arose upon the closing of a Sunset Strip nightclub, but it resonated differently in light of protests against the war in Vietnam. Alan Jackson found an audience directly addressing the 9/11 attacks in ""{Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2NXDJ4FabE"">,"" but so did {Bruce Springsteen}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/artists/14837922/bruce-springsteen""> with ""{My City of Ruins}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi_Tm_g6KdA"">"" — actually written about Asbury Park, not New York, two years before the towers fell.

Perusal of today's Top 40, however, seems to offer little that could be repurposed to express the summer's anxiety, fear and rage. The one song that resonated on social media during last week's Ferguson protests was ""{Turn Down For What?}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMUDVMiITOU"">"" the frantically commanding song by DJ Snake with the rapper Lil Jon. Its brief lyric about drinking in a club — fire up that loud, another round of shots — takes on ominous power in light of the role bullets (lead and rubber) have played in current events.

People on Twitter were more attracted to the song's title — reinterpreted as a refusal to step down rather than a party cry to ramp up, it became a 21st-century equivalent of ""we shall not be moved."" In the moment, it proved effective, but there are limits of ""Turn Down for What?"" as a protest song, or even one that captures this summer's uneasiness. It's glib — {best as a hashtag}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23turndownforwhat%20%23ferguson&src=typd"">. And though the song's energy feels cathartic, it's actually contained within the ordered pulse of EDM.

A genuine protest song soon surfaced, but it was not built to be a radio hit. J. Cole's ""{Be Free,}<hyperlink=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/j-cole-mourns-michael-brown-in-somber-new-song-be-free-20140815"">"" posted to the North Carolina rapper's blog on Friday, quickly reached the No. 1 spot on Billboard's {Trending 140}<hyperlink=""http://realtime.billboard.com/?chart=trending140""> chart, which notes the fastest-moving songs on Twitter. The track is minimalist, based around a keyboard loop that recalls the dystopian trip-hop of {Massive Attack}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/artists/17093791/massive-attack""> and Tricky; that musical bed embodies a feeling of futility. Over it, Cole sings instead of raps. He might be crying. He sounds like he's thinking of {Nina Simone}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/artists/15396720/nina-simone""> singing ""{Mississippi Goddam}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQjGGJVSXc"">,"" but he can't seem to muster her freeing rage; instead, he sounds exhausted. ""Don't just stand around,"" he sings, exhorting protesters but also, perhaps, warning others who could face Brown's fate. Eventually Cole's voice gives way to a recording of Dorian Johnson, Brown's friend, who was with him when he died. Cole's beloved hip-hop, able to incorporate the sounds of real life, uneasily suggests that such sounds, now, are more powerful than what an artist can create on his own. Cole can only do so much to frame the sorrow audible in Johnson's voice. This makes the song almost unbearably painful for listeners, too.

The sparseness and bald intensity of ""Be Free"" markedly contrasts with what dominates radio, in any decade, and particularly this year. It's not {a song of the summer}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/the-real-song-of-the-summer.html?_r=0"">, though it will be an enduring artifact of this summer. And for some reason, in recent months the Top 40 has given anyone seeking succor or inspiration of a deeper kind little to work with.

It's striking how little current hits reflect the angst that has become the dominant mood on social media, if not everywhere. Instead, summer 2014's songs are breezily confident, brushing away conflict with cheery melodies and slap-happy rhythms. It's not that these hits don't address problems; one of Ariana Grande's hits is even called ""{Problem}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS1g8G_njx8"">."" But no threat is so consequential that these overconfident millennials can't quickly dismiss it. Their queen is {Iggy Azalea}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-zpOMYRi0w"">, whose sneer seeks to be as winning as her smile; their king is Nasri, singer for the reggae revivalists {Magic!}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIh2xe4jnpk"">, who defangs that music of resistance with a tale about so-called forbidden love that's really both instantly accessible and totally conventional: His girl will follow him anywhere, and, ""I'm gonna marry her anyway.""

This may feel both depressing and typical to those who find Top 40 pop vapid compared to ""real"" music emerging from the street or the underground (or the boutique industry of indie rock). It's arguable that pop's party mood has even been intensified by the uncertainties of everyday life: It's a heating pad, a palliative treatment for our spasms of fear and despair. Yet some musicians in the mainstream are expressing those less acceptable emotions, within songs that might seem to fit in with the escapist mood on the charts, but subtly move against it.

Sam Smith's is the most obvious young voice with the potential to move people in emotionally necessary ways. He's had a pair of Top 10 hits in the last few weeks, under his own name and as a featured singer on a dance track. People want to hear this 23-year-old Londoner's lush, androgynous voice: It pours out of radios, restaurants, gyms, nail salons. In part Smith's rise is a coincidence, but there's relevance in the way his singing travels between signifiers of identity: male and female, youthful and worn and, yes, black and white.

Perhaps it seems unfair to note that, at a time when this nation's fundamental racial inequalities have once again become centrally visible, mainstream radio has latched on to a voice that often sounds African-American, but isn't. Smith is who he is, and unlike Azalea, who utterly buries her Australian accent, he communicates his Englishness in frequently genteel phrasing. Still, uplift is something Smith does very well, and uplift — that healing feeling, made more resonant through a tinge of sorrow, but rarely tipping into rage — is often what the mainstream provides in times of social unrest. The 1960s civil rights movement had its furies, like Simone, but Franklin became its musical voice not only because of her greatness, but because her gospel-based music always aimed for uplift's temporary resolutions. Something similar comes through in hits by Smith, like the pointedly gospel-inflected ""Stay With Me.""

The scarcity of artists of color on this summer's Top 40 is part of a disturbingly tenacious {music-industry trend}<hyperlink=""http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_music_club/features/2013/music_club_2013/the_rock_hall_of_fame_and_the_billboard_hot_100_where_were_the_black_acts.html"">, despite the dominance of {Jay-Z}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/artists/16318474/jay-z""> and {Beyonce}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/artists/19230778/beyonce""> as a touring venture and celebrity couple. Magic! has a non-white, Canadian lead singer, but though Nasri's Palestinian heritage is interesting to note, he hasn't yet shown how it might be relevant to his music. (No {tweets}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/search?q=nasriworld&src=typd""> on Gaza that I've seen, for example.) Yet amidst all the sounds being polished and put forth by the party girls of Hollywood, one song of this summer does feature voices that are not only non-white, but also distinctly African. It sounds like a trifle, it's so buoyant and accessible. Yet 
""Am I Wrong"" is that special kind of singalong, floating through the air on dance floors or in beach parking lots, that could hit listeners in a deeper way and become an accidental anthem.

""Am I Wrong"" is a song of uplift by two singers and songwriters, Nico Sereba and Vincent Dery, who record as Nico & Vinz. Sereba and Dery grew up the children of African immigrants in Oslo. The duo smartly recasts the sounds of their native Ivory Coast and Ghana within the radio-friendly structure of Scandinavian pop. Its staying power in America, however, probably has to do with its soulfulness. The song may not reach the levels of genius attained by Marvin Gaye or {Sam Cooke}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/artists/15402012/sam-cooke"">, but in its singers' plaintive voices, and in the way it swells and ebbs, accommodating both hope and hesitation, it connects with the spirit of those great crowd-movers.

The lyrics of ""Am I Wrong"" add up to a string of inspirational non-sequiturs. ""Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?"" Dery wonders. ""Am I trippin', for having a vision,"" Sereba counters in his own verse. The message is generic — believe in yourself — but built around the spiraling self-doubt of the title, it's right for unsettled times. A slow riptide of doubt keeps pulling the song somewhere deeper, and the singers, with their declarations, pull back. When Nico or Vinz — they share the vocal — intone, ""That's just how I feel,"" it's reassuring, but also sad and a little unsteady. The volatile elements of ""Am I Wrong"" come together to form a whole that sustains, but also acknowledges instability; the song offers hope, but acknowledges how difficult perseverance can be.

""Am I Wrong"" also recalls a soul classic from the dawn of the 1970s: ""{O-o-h Child}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrotsEzgEpg"">"" by the Five Stairsteps. That song is one long journey up the hill toward the sun, a lullaby leading to the morning, its mood of joy established through a swelling melodic build like few others in pop. Currently back in our ears as a fun feature on the soundtrack to Guardians of the Galaxy, ""O-o-h Child"" was never a protest song. Yet it's found a fascinating place in the culture, as an exhortation to keep going even in times of unrest. Director John Singleton milked it for painful irony in a key scene in {Boyz n the Hood}<hyperlink=""http://fingersonblast.com/blog/tag/the-five-stairsteps"">, when the child Tre watches two of his friends carted off by police for shoplifting as the song plays on his father's car radio. Spike Lee used it too, in Crooklyn, during the funeral of the film's family matriarch. Tupac sampled it in ""{Keep Ya Head Up}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBhm7GcEk6E"">,"" his ode to inner-city survival. Janet Jackson tapped into it in ""{Truth}<hyperlink=""http://www.zapkolik.com/video/janet-jackson-truth-561268"">,"" her ballad about living past a bad romance.

It's doubtful that ""Am I Wrong"" will have the deep afterlife of ""O-o-h Child"" — it doesn't have that song's captivating integrity. But like so many hits whose meanings seem to adapt to fit their moment, it's here now, for the many different listeners who might need it. Protest takes courage and focus. Pop is all about commodification: the soft center of what adapts. But sometimes, when history collides with it, a simple song gains dimension. To paraphrase Nico & Vinz, that's just how listeners feel.",66,NA,NA,NA

The knife-wielding 23-year-old was ""acting erratically,"" Police Chief Sam Dotson said in a news conference. He said two officers drew their weapons and ""gave verbal commands,"" and that the man approached police ""in a threatening manner with a knife in an overhand posture.""

Stephanie Lecci of St. Louis Public Radio says this appears to be an ""isolated incident,"" not connected to the protests in neighboring Ferguson.

Here's a summary of the events, according to Dotson (and reported by Lecci on All Things Considered):

— Two calls were made: one by a convenience store owner who said a man had stolen items from his store and was then pacing up and down the street with a knife; another by a St. Louis alderwoman who described a man talking to himself, walking in the street, armed.
— Two officers responded to the calls, initially approaching the suspect without drawing their weapons.
— Then the suspect grabbed a knife from his waistband and told the officers, ""Shoot me now. Kill me now."" The officers gave verbal warnings and drew their weapons when they saw the knife.
— The man did not comply with orders to drop the weapon and move back. When he came within 3 to 4 feet of one of the officers, both officers fired and killed the suspect.

Dotson defended the officers' actions, saying they have a right to defend themselves and that 3 to 4 feet is within lethal range.

Lecci says witnesses are still being interviewed by police.

The real question, is whether police have become militarized in their attitude toward the public.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Now, the images from Ferguson - images of heavily armed police - have triggered a national debate about whether American cops have become too militarized. President Obama pointed to that concern yesterday.

(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement and we don't want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions.

GREENE: But policing experts have been sounding the alarm about so-called militarization for years now. And many of them say the gear itself is not the real problem. NPR's Martin Kaste reports.

MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Sue Rahr was once the sheriff of Seattle's King County. Now she's the director of Washington state's police academy. She's one of the few people who wasn't surprised to see police militarization become a hot topic nationally.

SUE RAHR: This is something that has bothered me for the last couple of years.

KASTE: She says it really hit her about two years ago when she took over at the Academy.

RAHR: After 33 years in law enforcement, I was surprised at how militaristic the training regiment had become.

KASTE: The Academy had become a kind of boot camp, and aspiring police officers were expected to snap to attention - their eyes front like soldiers. She says the Academy was teaching these new cops to be cold and distant, instead of being friendly communicators. And she thinks there's been a nationwide evolution in the mindset of police - that it's gone from beat cop to Robocop, from guardian to warrior.

RAHR: The mindset of a guardian is I am here to protect. The mindset of a warrior is I'm here to conquer. We're not sending police officers into communities to conquer them.

KASTE: Assuming Rahr's analysis is correct, why did it happen? She thinks it started in the late '70s, when SWAT teams were invented and cops moved away from regular beats. Others blame militarization on the war on drugs, or on the Pentagon, which started giving its surplus gear to the police in the 1990s. Or maybe American police have just always had a military streak.

BRIAN BUCHNER: I mean, I think in some ways, I think there are elements of fear.

KASTE: Brian Buchner is the president of the National Association for Civil Oversight of Law Enforcement. He says the reality for cops in America is just different than it is in other developed countries.

BUCHNER: Police officers in this country have a greater level of fear that circumstances or persons that they encounter can cause them harm.

KASTE: To be blunt, American cops have an entirely rational fear of getting shot. And increasingly, they're afraid of being outgunned. Tom Nolan is a former Boston cop who's now a professor of criminal justice. He says you do need heavy weapons for some situations. The danger, though, is when the cops start to see every situation that way.

TOM NOLAN: In practice, what could happen is anytime a police officer believes that someone might be armed, it could justify taking out the semi-automatic rifle. And that's my concern.

KASTE: But does it make sense to blame the gear? Despite her intense criticism of militarization, Sue Rahr says no.

RAHR: I think the gear is a visible symptom. But I don't think the gear is driving the culture.

KASTE: She knows that people are focusing on the gear right now, that the late-night comedians are mocking the small-town police departments with their armored personnel carriers. But she says those armored vehicles sure came in handy for her when she had officers who were pinned down by automatic gunfire. Rahr says the military gear should be kept out of sight until there's a real need for it. But she also thinks Americans should ask themselves why they ever became so tolerant of the site of police acting like soldiers. Martin Kaste, NPR News, Seattle.",51,NA,NA,NA

Officers also received another call from a St. Louis alderwoman reporting also that the individual was in the street, again, pacing erratically, armed and talking to himself. At that point, the two officers in one car responded to these calls and approached the suspect. They exited their vehicles. Chief Dotson says that at that point they did not have their weapons drawn and were trying to speak with the individual when he grabbed at his waistband and then pulled out a knife in what Dotson described as an overhand grip.

He began telling the officers, shoot me now. Kill me now. And the officers then began giving him verbal warnings. When they saw the knife they had drawn their weapons he said they began telling the man get back, drop the weapon, stop. The man did not comply, and when he came within three to four feet of one of the officers, Dotson says, it was at that point that both officers fired, killing the suspect.

SIEGEL: Well, has there been any criticism of the use of lethal force - for example for not using a Taser or something like that to subdue the man?

LECCI: Chief Dotson says officers do have tasers, but he defended their actions saying that, you know, at the end of the day, an officer should be able to go home. And if a person is charging you with a knife, and they're within three to four feet, that's within lethal range. He also said that one witness to the events described it as a suicide-by-cop situation.

SIEGEL: This happened in broad daylight. I assume there were multiple witnesses of the entire event.

LECCI: Yes, and they're still being interviewed by police.

SIEGEL: OK, thank you, Stephanie.

LECCI: Thank you, Robert.

Audie Cornish talks to Carroll Doherty, director of political research at Pew, for more.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

The fatal shooting of Michael Brown and what's happened since have Americans sharply divided in their reactions according to a new study by the Pew Research Center. Among the findings, 80 percent of African-Americans believe the case raises important issues about race compared to only 37 percent of whites. Nearly half of whites surveyed said race is getting more attention than it deserves. For more on this study, we're joined by Carroll Doherty, director of political research at Pew. Welcome to the program.

CARROLL DOHERTY: Nice to be here.

CORNISH: So let's begin with that wide racial gap we just mentioned. More than twice as many African Americans as whites believe this case raises important questions about race. And that disparity continues when you ask about people's views on the police response in Ferguson, as well?

DOHERTY: Absolutely, African Americans as are twice as likely as whites to say the police response has been excessive - 65 percent of blacks versus just 33 percent of whites. And you see in other attitudes, as well, about the investigation into Michael Brown's death.

CORNISH: Talk about those investigation numbers. What are people's views there?

DOHERTY: Seventy-six percent of blacks have very little or no confidence at all in the investigations. And 45 percent of blacks say they have no confidence at all. Among whites, you get a narrow majority saying they do have confidence - 52 percent. And just 33 percent say they have little or no confidence - so starkly different attitudes about this case along racial lines.

CORNISH: You know, people might be hearing this and think well this is pretty obvious, right? They may see that they have a very different opinion or interest from their neighbors. What's striking here?

DOHERTY: Well, I mean it's - first off, it's very similar to reactions to, you know, probably the most recent high-profile case that people remember, which is the death of Trayvon Martin. Again, blacks thought that case raised important issues about race that needed to be discussed. Whites, by and large, didn't. And it goes with some other attitudes. When we surveyed last year on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech, we found that dealing with the police and dealing with the courts are the top areas where blacks feel like they're being treated unfairly. Seventy percent of blacks say blacks in their community are treated less fairly than whites by police. Sixty-eight percent say the same thing about the criminal justice system. Those are pretty powerful numbers. And while blacks see discrimination in a lot of areas, those are the ones that really stand out.

CORNISH: What, if anything, are you seeing that's striking in the numbers here when it comes to white Americans?

DOHERTY: Well, I think white Americans are conflicted about this. I mean, one of the interesting things here is reactions to the police response. Whites are divided about whether it's appropriate or inappropriate. You know, about the same percentage say it's OK - say it has gone too far.

CORNISH: This is response to protesters.

DOHERTY: Response to how the police have dealt with the protesters, correct. And a very large percentage of whites offer no opinion to this. Now, that may be because it's been - kind of been a moving target, you know? The police response has changed over the past few days. But it's also, I think, you know - maybe, people are somewhat uncomfortable about expressing their opinion about this.

CORNISH: You know, besides breaking this down along racial lines, you also looked at differences in reaction from Democrats and Republicans. And what did you find there?

DOHERTY: Well, the very interesting thing is that partisanship is as big factors races in some of these attitudes. I mean, for Republicans, this is not about race - 61 percent say race is getting too much attention in the Brown case. Democrats - almost - take the opposite view - 68 percent say more attention is needed to discuss racial issues in this case.

CORNISH: Obviously, there has been many stories in the past that have had this kind of racial divide - whether it's something as serious as the killings of Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown - but also the Harvard issue with Henry Gates and other kind of race stories that came to the forefront. What does the data show about that?

DOHERTY: Well, there's been a series of these stories all the way back to Rodney King and even the O.J. Simpson, which are, you know, kind of divided along racial lines both in terms of the interest in those stories and opinions about the cases involved. And so, you know, what may be surprising is how little things change over time. I mean, in some ways, this is something of a predictable response, to a degree, and we've seen it before and likely to see it again.

CORNISH: That's Carroll Doherty. He's director of political research at the Pew Research Center. Thank you so much for speaking with us.

DOHERTY: Thank you.",31,NA,NA,NA

We learn how one family copes with the chaos.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

This morning we're hearing about people in Ferguson, Missouri, are dealing with the nightly clashes between protesters and police. When tensions on the street escalated on Sunday night, St. Louis public radio reporters Stephanie Lecci and Durrie Bouscaren hid out in one family's house and learned how that family is coping. Here's Durrie Bouscaren.

BOUSCAREN: We met the Moore family in the middle of the night, after running from tear gas and gunfire during Sunday night's clash between police and protesters. With nowhere to go, we knocked on the door of a house with the lights still on. Irma Moore let us in. Moore's five children were snuggled into blankets on the living-room couch, watching the local news station broadcasting the violence just a block away.

That's at the gas station, right? This is at the gas station?

IRMA MOORE: Now I just want it all to end because this is day nine of being up all night and, you know, somebody on watch, whether it be my son, my husband, something.

BOUSCAREN: Moore is an assistant principal at the Dewey International Studies School in St. Louis. She moved to the neighborhood in 2007 because it was quiet. It's down the street from a police station and walking distance to the local high school. Most of the Moore's neighbors are elderly. She says many of them left earlier in the week, checking into hotels to wait out the violence. The Moore's stayed, worried their home would be broken into. But the family is paying a price for that decision.

MOORE: And they, you know, sprayed all of that tear gas up there by Save-A-Lot. You could just (groans) woke up with your face itching. Every time they spray something, we all are like turn the air off because you can - it's like our house gets filled with not necessarily smoke, but you know how, like, you have a gas leak somewhere? It comes right through.

BOUSCAREN: Moore's youngest child is three. Her oldest is 16. Ten-year-old Breadora says it's been a sad week.

DURRIE BREADORA: I can't go to sleep. I just hear shots and stuff. I can't go to, like, soccer practice and I can't go outside and play and go to bed at night.

BOUSCAREN: Moore says the shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer resonated with her.

MOORE: You know, the very person or individual that should be protecting him took his life. I think back about my own son.

BOUSCAREN: That's 15-year-old Marcus, who's sitting in the corner.

MOORE: You know, he's been arrested by Ferguson since we've lived here, for skateboarding with his friends on this lot back before that little chicken place was there. They put him in handcuffs, threw him in the back of the car. And my son is an honor roll student who's never been in trouble at school ever.

BOUSCAREN: But tonight, Marcus sits with a baseball bat by his side. He and his father take turns staying awake through the night, watching the front door. He says he's given thought to why some protesters have turned to violence and looting.

MARCUS: I understand that they're trying to make it for a cause, but it really isn't. It's just, like, scattered ignorance. All our places are ruined because they've been rioting and everything. There's innocent people out there that they're firing at.

BOUSCAREN: With that, Marcus turns his attention back to the television, which shows a man fall to the ground, apparently shot by a rubber bullet - less than a mile away.

MARCUS: That's crazy. Just, why?

BOUSCAREN: After things quieted down, Moore's husband drove me back to our cars so we could get home safely. But for many who live here, daily life won't be safe for quite some time. For NPR News, I'm Durrie Bouscaren in Ferguson.",1,NA,NA,NA

— The Pentagon defended a program that gives local law enforcement agencies surplus military equipment, NPR's Tom Bowman reports. The program, which dates back to 1988, has come under criticism because of what some have called the military-style police response in Ferguson. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said the program has helped in counterdrug and other operations. He also said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has asked for more information on the program, though he has not ordered an official review.

A black man is shot by a white policeman. And the effect on the community is of ""a lit match in a tin of gasoline.""

No, this is not Ferguson, Mo. This was Harlem in August 1943, a period that James Baldwin writes about in the essay that gives its title to his seminal collection, Notes of a Native Son.

The story begins with the death of Baldwin's father, a proud, severe preacher who viewed all white people with suspicion, even the kindly schoolteacher who encouraged his son's writings.

But after the young Baldwin left home to work in New Jersey, after he was refused service in bars, restaurants, or bowling alleys because of the color of his skin, he came to understand why his father carried, as he put it, ""the weight of white people in the world."" Baldwin realized that, all along, his father had tried to prepare him for the ""day when [he] would be despised"" and to give him a stronger antidote for it than he had found for himself.

The trouble in Harlem that summer started because a white man had shot a black man, and while the facts of the case were murky, the rumors were not. Those rumors flew through Harlem easily because, Baldwin tells us, they ""corroborated [people's] hates and fears so perfectly."" And then, ""Harlem exploded.""

The people smashed ""stores, pawnshops, restaurants,"" all the establishments that symbolized white power in a black neighborhood. On the day of his father's burial, Baldwin drove through Harlem in a ""wilderness of smashed plate glass.""

The shooting, the funeral and the riot, taking place so close together, led Baldwin to realize that we must always hold in our minds two opposite ideas. The first is that ""injustice is commonplace"" in our world. But the second is that we cannot be complacent. We ""must never ... accept these injustices as commonplace but must fight them with all [our] strength. This fight begins ... in the heart.""",38,NA,NA,NA

National Guard troops deployed by Gov. Jay Nixon didn't get involved, and the officer in charge of security in Ferguson said police came under fire and were targeted by Molotov cocktails.

The family of Michael Brown says they'll hold a public memorial for the slain teenager on Monday, reports {The Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-protests-michael-brown-020140819-story.html#page=1"">, which adds that the family hopes his body is released to them in the next two days.

While early reports Tuesday stated ""31 people had been arrested, some of whom came as far away as New York and California,"" {NBC News}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/78-arrested-overnight-most-missouri-arrest-records-show-n184036""> says it has more recent police data showing 78 arrests — and of those arrested, the ""overwhelming majority of them were from Missouri.""

An online memorial fund for Brown set up by the family's attorneys has now reached nearly $90,000. The firm says the family will use the money to pay for Brown's funeral expenses, as well as travel and living expenses as they advocate for justice on his behalf.

Residents of Ferguson and St. Louis say they're surprised to find themselves in the middle of a national discussion about race and police use of force. {NPR's Gene Demby says}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/08/19/341608860/reality-meets-celebrity-in-ferguson-mo""> that despite St. Louis not having a history of civil disobedience, the times have changed.

A voter registration push is underway in the neighborhood where Brown was shot, as activists urge demonstrators to vote. ""In Ferguson, only 6 percent of registered African-American voters cast ballots in last year's municipal elections,"" NPR's Shereen Marisol Meraji reports. ""The mayor is white, as are five of the six City Council members.""

Protesters took to the streets Monday night after Nixon said there would be no midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew. But police told them they had to keep moving and couldn't congregate in one spot. The Associated Press reports: [O]fficers trying to enforce tighter restrictions at times used bullhorns to order them to disperse. Police deployed noisemakers and armored vehicles to push demonstrators back. Officers fired tear gas and flash grenades.""

[tweetbegin 501582685551493120 tweetend]

NPR's Elise Hu, who is at the scene, told our Newscast unit that the situation deteriorated rapidly.

""What had begun as a calm evening and a standoff between cops and some demonstrators ... turned in a flash, and smoke bombs and tear gas were thrown at the crowds to disperse the crowd,"" she said. ""The crowd started rushing back. I happened to see the smoke bombs or tear gas being thrown in both directions because some of the demonstrators actually picked up what was thrown at them and threw them back at police.""

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said officers didn't fire a single bullet ""despite coming under heavy attack."" He said four St. Louis County police officers were hit by rocks and bottles, and sustained injury. He said ""criminals"" in the crowd fired shots and threw Molotov cocktails at officers.

""These criminal acts came from a tiny minority of lawbreakers,"" Johnson said. ""But anyone who has been at these protests understands that there is a dangerous dynamic in the night. It allows a small number of violent agitators to hide in the crowd and then attempt to create chaos.""

As of 2 a.m. Tuesday, 31 people had been arrested, some of whom came as far away as New York and California, Johnson said (Update at 1:25 p.m.: NBC News says a total of 78 people have been arrested). Police also said two people were shot, but police officers weren't involved in those incidents, the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/the-night-s-tense-tally-shot-fires-arrested/article_f794b446-1ee7-56f1-b4f5-03c5663b596f.html"">.

Several members of the media were arrested briefly, too. Scott Olson of Getty Images was covering the demonstrations; two German reporters — Ansgar Graw and Frank Herrmann — allegedly failed to follow police instructions, a claim they denied. All were later released.

NPR's Hu tweeted:

But the AP quoted Johnson as saying journalists had to be asked ""repeatedly to return to the sidewalks and that it was a matter of safety."" And in some cases, he said, it wasn't immediately clear who was a reporter.

The unrest is having an impact on the community at large. Schools in Ferguson will be closed until the end of the week.

Lisa Chabot, who lives about a mile from where protests erupted, told St. Louis Public Radio's Tim Lloyd that parents are exhausted.

""I want our kids to get back to normal,"" she said. ""This is tearing our community up. We have a beautiful community, and it's very frustrating for all the parents in the area.""

The clashes came a day after several significant developments:

— {A private autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/18/341345834/forensic-experts-discuss-six-bullets-that-hit-michael-brown""> conducted at the behest of Brown's family found that the 18-year-old was hit by at least six bullets, including twice in the head.

MCEVERS: In a press conference after midnight, an emotional Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol pleaded with people to stay off the streets at night.

(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)

CAPTAIN RON JOHNSON: I'm asking them for their safety, the safety of the kids that they bring out and for our attempt to put this neighborhood back together - back together. Come during the day. And let us deal with those that are bent on ruining our community and not let them mask themselves behind you.

MCEVERS: NPR's Shereen Marisol Meraji from our Code Switch team is on the ground in Ferguson. She found that many residents of the community share that wish to end the nightly chaos that has disrupted their lives since the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by police more than a week ago.

SHEREEN MARISOL MERAJI, BYLINE: Michael Brown was shot and killed in a neighborhood filled with sprawling apartment complexes that the world now thinks of as a war zone. But residents say before all of this, life was pretty uneventful.

CHERETHIA SAULSBERRY: We were like a family.

MERAJI: Cherethia Saulsberry said she moved to this area couple of years ago because of the manicured lawns and community feel.

SAULSBERRY: You know, you go through, you wave, you blow your horn at everybody, everybody's outside, saying hello, goodbye, have a good evening. Now everybody is closed off. They're, you know, hurrying along. It's frightening.

MERAJI: Saulsberry adds what's most frightening is the unpredictability at night - tear gas, looting, police checkpoints and now the National Guard. Neighbor Charlotte Knight says it's hard to run a basic errand.

CHARLOTTE KNIGHT: We don't have any store--Schnucks closes at 5:00 p.m., no banks stay open past 3:00 p.m. Where are you going to go? Some of us don't have direct deposit. Some of us don't even have places to go cash our checks

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Or cars to get to it.

KNIGHT: Or cars to get to it. The majority of these people over here are low-income people. They really don't have anywhere to go.

MERAJI: Knight says add to that stopped traffic from blocked roads in and out of her neighborhood and checkpoints.

KNIGHT: So they need to help these people give them some answers or something so us other people that are trying to make an honest living can get to and from work. My mama have cancer. She lives over there on the other side in these same complexes. But it's hard to get to her because we can't.

DWAYNE WICKERSON: The traffic has been - has been stopped up. But it's been better.

MERAJI: Dwayne Wickerson lives in the neighborhood too.

WICKERSON: Everybody coming together, everybody is family, everybody is looking out for one another.

MERAJI: He says the demonstrators are like a community now, and he's not stopping anytime soon.

WICKERSON: I've got blankets. I've got pillows. We're going to make pellets out here baby. I got candles when it dark - forever, until we got - it's been going on for too long. We want it. We need it. We're hungry, we're starving for it.

MERAJI: For what, exactly?

WICKERSON: Justice.

MERAJI: For Wickerson, justice means getting rid of the Ferguson Police Department altogether. He's standing with a couple dozen young African-American men and women, right near the makeshift memorial for Brown that's in the middle of the street. Life has become so surreal in this neighborhood that perhaps it's no surprise that the Reverend Jesse Jackson, seemingly out of nowhere, walks up to the group to offer some advice.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Hey y'all, let Jesse Jackson talk.

MERAJI: Jackson says the key to making things better is political power.

REVEREND JESSE JACKSON: In Ferguson, if we go door-to-door - hear me now - and register 5,000 voters, you can take the whole town.

MERAJI: Only 6 percent of eligible black voters in Ferguson turned out for the 2013 municipal elections. The mayor is white. One of six City Council members is black. But Ferguson is two-thirds African-American. And while she thinks diversify the government matters, Mya Canty, a recent college grad who lives just down the street from where Michael Brown was shot, says life will not return to normal until the cop who shot him is arrested.

MYA CANTY: People are going to be out here. The curfew hasn't stopped us, the police acting a fool towards us, disrespecting us hasn't stopped us. And I want them to know that, like, we're not going to stop. Sorry, we apologize. Sorry not sorry (laughter).

MERAJI: Canty says she's been late every day for work because of the traffic. It's been hard to run basic errands and even get back into her neighborhood when she gets off work. But she adds it's all been worth it. Shereen Marisol Meraji, NPR News, Ferguson, Missouri.",1,NA,NA,NA

We're sitting in the offices of Better Family Life, an organization that provides social services to people in the area. Umana chairs its board and lives in Ferguson.

It's not that the municipality of Ferguson doesn't exist — it has a mayor, a school board, and what is now a nationally scrutinized police force. But to a lot of the folks who live in Ferguson, it may as well just be St. Louis, the city that abuts them and that gives their county its name. Ferguson is so small, and St. Louis so close, that you might drive into the city and not even know you'd crossed a border.

So struck Umana as odd that the story of the shooting of Michael Brown, and the subsequent confrontations between police, had mobilized so much activist energy; indeed, over and over, folks have told me that St. Louis doesn't have a history of civil disobedience, especially around issues of race.

""I think the fact that St. Louis is the catalyst for a nationwide conversation is highly ironic,"" Umana says. ""It's not where St. Louis typically is.""

The same day I spoke to him, {an editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/the-platform/editorial-a-generational-event-demands-a-generational-change-from-complacency/article_76e2a100-7b4d-5456-8a68-03ce5dca9a11.html""> about the relative inactivity around racial issues in the region — it's one of the most segregated metro areas in the country — made pretty much the same claim. ""We are the descendants of those who stayed behind when bolder people opened the West,"" it reads, echoing the local columnist Bill McClellan. ""Complacency is in our marrow.""

But the hullabaloo — international media, National Guard, federal agents — has upended the lives of Ferguson's residents. As Umana and I talk, word comes from his wife that the police are starting to shut down the streets near their house, and that he should head home soon.

His son, also named Etefia, is back home from college for the summer. He says they would need valid identification, with an address that shows they live in the area, to get past the checkpoints after a certain hour.

And what if you don't have it? I ask.

""Then you're S.O.L,"" the younger Etefia says.

Over on Canfield Drive, the street where Michael Brown was shot, Cherethia Saulsberry says it usually takes her about five minutes to get out of the subdivision to get on the road to work. Now, because of the checkpoints and the traffic, it takes her a half-hour. She's been sitting outside on a chair on the sidewalk, near a makeshift memorial for Michael Brown in the middle of the street. The memorial rests on the spot where he died.

""One dude walks up to Jesse Jackson and daps him up. 'Reverend Al!' he says. 'What up!' Everyone snickers. Jackson does not correct him.""

There isn't a lot of street traffic when my colleague Shereen Marisol Meraji and I are there. The cars that roll by have to slow down and hug the curb to get around the shrine, and many honk in solidarity. There are a few dozen folks milling around on this absurdly humid day. Members of Alpha Phi Alpha, a black fraternity, are chatting folks up, registering people to vote. And there's Jesse Jackson.

One dude walks up to Jackson and daps him up. ""Reverend Al!"" he says. ""What up!"" Everyone snickers. Jackson does not correct him.

There are some tables with Better Family Life workers handing out water and food and, offering counseling services. ""The people here saw a man's body lying in the street for four hours,"" one worker who identified himself as Bishop V-Luv tells me. I don't care who you are, he says. That does something to you.

Saulsberry agrees with what other folks say: This is not the kind of place where people protest. I ask her what it's like, then, to have all this activist energy suddenly cohere in her neighborhood.

""It makes me scared"" — because of the tear gas and rubber bullets — ""but also proud,"" she says.

As we talk, more people begin to trickle onto Canfield. Some of them take pictures of the makeshift memorial. They are mostly under 30, it seems.

Saulsberry tells me about her daughter Mya Canty, who just graduated from Missouri's Culver-Stockton College and who spent part of the last semester in California with Angela Davis. The tragedy in Ferguson has activated young people like her, Saulsberry says.

On cue, Mya materializes, holding a sign. ""I never thought I'd have to practice civil disobedience so soon,"" she says. She's been at most of the rallies and protests. ""If I'm not at work, I'm out here in these Ferguson streets.""

Though everyone is exceedingly polite on Canfield, folks say there are some tensions. ""There's a generational divide,"" says Demetrius Upchurch, a high school teacher from a few towns over who's here with his 4-year-old son, Aiden. He's visiting some family; his 85-year-old grandfather lives near the street where Michael Brown was killed. Upchurch says his grandfather is scared by the unrest. ""Old people don't understand younger people, and younger people don't understand older people."" And there weren't a lot of older people on the streets.

Upchurch says he tries to keep it real with his students about the police, and lets them know they can talk to him. He tells us a story from a few months back about how his son and fianceé saw him roughed up and thrown on the ground by some local police officers. His son was crying throughout the encounter. After that, he told his son there are good cops and bad cops, and he lets him know that despite stuff like this, he can grow up and be whatever he wants to be. He asks Aiden what he wants to be when he grows up. Aiden, who had seconds ago been jumping around, suddenly looks embarrassed to be on the spot. ""A good police,"" Aiden says softly, before burying his face in his dad's leg.

It seems a lot of people here have stories about the police. Uphchurch says it's important for civic leadership to come from the generations raised on hip-hop, ""not just some old Christian pastor who was around when Martin Luther King was around."" The allusion to Jackson is not missed.

But the hip-hop generation is here, too, of course. J. Cole, whose song ""{Be Free}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEQYn4qHqBE"">"" — a response to Michael Brown's killing — has been getting passed around since he posted it on his blog. He shows up a little later on Canfield in a spiffy custom van with a black Navigator up front, probably for security. A crowd gathers around him. Cole has gotten some props for being present but not courting the spotlight, and here he's mostly chatting folks up and talking. (Cole happens to be Mya's favorite rapper, and she freaked out when she got to meet him a few days before. ""That made your superficial love for him more real?"" Saulsberry asks her daughter. ""Um, my love is not superficial,"" Mya says.)

Everyone on Canfield is exceedingly friendly. But people say the vibe in Ferguson changes completely after dark now, when the police are out in more force, and tensions start to flare up. Bishop V-Luv tells me that after those standoffs between the police and the people who are out marching, the folks in the neighborhood clean up the next morning.

""Eventually the television cameras and news reporters left Dallas and New Orleans,"" {the Post-Dispatch editorial says}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/the-platform/editorial-a-generational-event-demands-a-generational-change-from-complacency/article_76e2a100-7b4d-5456-8a68-03ce5dca9a11.html"">. ""They will leave St. Louis, too, along with the visiting civil rights firemen, the outside hell-raisers and the self-anointed experts. The ubiquitous #Ferguson hashtag will fade. We will be left to work this out on our own.""

Brian Williams of NBC News shows up, boom mic and camera crew in tow. People gather around to take pictures. As Jackson and Williams talk — Jackson explicating, using his hands, Williams head down, listening, brow furrowed — I snap a photo of them talking.

It wasn't until later that I noticed the cameraman was stepping on the memorial for Michael Brown.",102,NA,NA,NA
