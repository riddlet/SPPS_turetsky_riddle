Eerily, that sentiment is nearly identical to one put forth by Will's best friend Jazz in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. In the second season episode ""Cased Up,"" Jazz (played by DJ Jazzy Jeff) appears in court following a car accident with Uncle Phil's protege Eric. The whole episode is, in typical Fresh Prince style, relatively humorous, but this bit (posted by Tumblr user {Marvin}<hyperlink=“http://mvgl.tumblr.com/about”>) is eerily familiar in light of the ongoing unrest in Ferguson.

Obviously, pop culture ephemera is often an inefficient (and, in some cases, {grossly inappropriate}=hyperlink<“http://www.buzzfeed.com/bennyjohnson/the-story-of-egypts-revolution-in-jurassic-park-gifs#.um5Q4Q6KE”>) medium for explaining the intricacies of complex sociopolitical conflicts. But this episode, which was first broadcast on Nov. 11, 1991, resonates deeply in the wake of Ferguson (Jazz was worried about being shot six times; according to an autopsy reports, Michael Brown {actually was}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html”>). The sad fact is that Fresh Prince captured what remains, 23 years later, a disturbing truth for black Americans: They're constantly in jeopardy for no other reason than “{walking while black}<hyperlink=“http://gawker.com/florida-man-literally-arrested-for-walking-while-black-1303208765”>.” 

And this was true well before the death of Michael Brown. Consider Jordan Davis, shot and killed for {listening to loud music}<hypothesis=“http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/07/trayvon-martin-jordan-davis-stand-your-ground”>. Or Bobby Wingate, tasered and arrested for {walking on the wrong side of the street}<hyperlink=“http://gawker.com/florida-man-literally-arrested-for-walking-while-black-1303208765”>. Or Chris Beatty, arrested for ""trespassing"" while {drinking iced tea}<hyperlink=“http://gawker.com/florida-man-literally-arrested-for-walking-while-black-1303208765”>. Or Earl Sampson, arrested simply for {showing up to work}<hyperlink=“http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article1957716.html”>.

Why does this happen? Because, despite {ridiculous claims}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96144/11-things-white-people-should-stop-saying-to-black-people-immediately#.yfI3kG3Cu”> that racism ""ended in the '60s,"" black men in America are continually forced to grapple with the fact that their lives are essentially valueless to law enforcement. Judging by the violence they've faced under the most asinine circumstances, you'd think a black person's life in America was worth less than a {box of cigars}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96378/7-things-worth-more-than-a-black-person-s-life-in-america#.YB6l8WJaL”>, a {carton of cigarettes}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96378/7-things-worth-more-than-a-black-person-s-life-in-america#.YB6l8WJaL”>, a {phone call}<http://mic.com/articles/96378/7-things-worth-more-than-a-black-person-s-life-in-america#.4IvkBxS0A”>, a {laptop}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96378/7-things-worth-more-than-a-black-person-s-life-in-america#.4IvkBxS0A”>, a {tube of toothpaste}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96378/7-things-worth-more-than-a-black-person-s-life-in-america#.4IvkBxS0A”>, {a hoodie}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96378/7-things-worth-more-than-a-black-person-s-life-in-america#.wWRRBHSS7”> and {a bottle of orange juice}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96378/7-things-worth-more-than-a-black-person-s-life-in-america#.geFnBErAo”>. Mic's Zak Cheney-Rice sums this up {powerfully}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96378/7-things-worth-more-than-a-black-person-s-life-in-america#.RfLx9neZE”>: ""When a black person is killed under dubious circumstances, the conversation inevitably turns to what the victim did to precipitate — if not outright deserve — such an abrupt and violent demise.""

And this is the fundamental problem expressed in Fresh Prince, which was one of the highest-rated television shows among black audiences in 1991, {according to Nielsen}<hyperlink=“https://library.uoregon.edu/sites/default/files/data/guides/english/nielsen_ratings.pdf”>. To the average NBC viewer of the time, Jazz is the trouble-making counterpart to Will, a black Jughead to Smith's updated Archie. But in reality, Jazz in ""Cased Up"" is a sad reminder of the oppressive truth of life as a black man in America.

Our television sets and social media feeds may be flooded in images of aggression and violence, but fully understanding what's actually happening outside St. Louis requires context. 

The events of Ferguson took a horrendous turn Sunday night as police fired tear gas at protesters, including children, three hours before the imposed curfew. One man {was shot}<hyperlink=“http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-curfew-20140816-story.html”> by an unidentified gunman and seven were arrested, while members of the media were {threatened}<hyperlink”http://gawker.com/ferguson-police-threaten-to-shoot-reporter-and-mace-chr-1623125660?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+gawker%2Ffull+%28Gawker%29”> with guns and mace. One {image}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/paleofuture/status/501211605909000192”> captured a woman being treated at a nearby McDonald's for tear gas, while a {Vine}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/501192051304972289”> clip shows an 8-year-old boy dealing with the aftermath of tear gas thrown by police.

The continuing unrest in Ferguson proves that the issues playing out in front of a national audience reach far deeper than this particular shooting. Racial tensions, mixed with a growing militarization of our police force, have reached a boiling point, which John Oliver flawlessly addressed Sunday on Last Week Tonight

Oliver begins by dismantling the Ferguson mayor's laughable defense that race has never been an issue in his town, a town where two-thirds of its population is African-American, while only three members of its police force are. ""As a general rule, no one should ever be allowed to say there is no history of racial tension here, because that sentence has never been true anywhere on Earth,"" Oliver points out.

He then uses data from MSNBC to highlight the striking racial makeup of arrests in Ferguson, 93% of which are of African-Americans: ""If you are white in Ferguson, you would need to be snorting cocaine directly on your dashboard to be stopped by the police.""

On the issue of police militarization, Oliver points to the influx of Department of Defense money funneled to police departments since 9/11. ""The number of SWAT rates has gone up by 1,400% since the 1980s,"" he notes. But there's more to this picture: Roughly 79% of SWAT operations involve search warrants for drugs, allegations that have been shown to “disproportionately target”<hyperlink=“http://www.vox.com/2014/7/1/5850830/war-on-drugs-racist-minorities”> minority suspects. Clearly, these SWAT teams are not being deployed in white college dorm rooms. Meanwhile, the coded, racialized language being used in Ferguson would be ""barely acceptable"" for a ""zoo escape.""  

Ultimately, police are not soldiers, as Oliver points out that police officers in the U.S. would be wise to ""dress for the job [they] have, not the job [they] want.""

While humorous as always, Oliver's segment delivers important context missing from much of the mainstream media's coverage of the story. We can't look at these protests in isolation; they exist within the larger structures of institutional racism, not just in Ferguson but in the rest of the country as well. As Melissa Harris-Perry {indicated}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/16/melissa-harris-perry-black-men-killed-by-police_n_5684588.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000047&ir=Black+Voices”> on Saturday, a black person has been killed at least twice a week by a white police officer between 2006 and 2012. When it comes to the violence in Ferguson, we need to address the cause of the problem, not just the symptoms.

But while national coverage has focused on the indisputably counterproductive violence and destruction committed by Ferguson residents during a moment of anguish, videos and photos taken from the scene show local police aggravating the situation as well.

Monday's riots didn't happen in a vacuum. The Los Angeles Times {reports}<hyperlink=“http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-shooting-20140811-story.html”> that 48 of the department's 53 officers are white, while 65% of Ferguson is black. {Racial profiling statistics}<hyperlink=“http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf” from the Missouri Attorney General's office reveal the community is subject to disproportionate police action on everything from traffic stops and searches to contraband seizures and arrests.

The conflict on Monday wasn't just about Brown, but also the result of years of racial tension given a sudden shove. Likewise, tweets, videos and images from the scene on the ground demonstrate that the authorities in Ferguson did their part maintaining an atmosphere of mutual hostility.

This video caught by CNN shows a white officer telling Ferguson residents to ""bring it, all you fucking animals"":

Other tweets by locals demonstrate how Ferguson police resorted to heavy-handed tactics that helped escalate peaceful protests into a full-blown riot:

There's no denying that something turned ugly in Ferguson on Sunday. But what's absolutely clear is the authorities played a role in making that happen, both on the night itself and through years of racially-tinged policing.",NA,NA,NA,NA
Mic,mic4,http://mic.com/articles/96276/the-disturbing-reason-ferguson-police-look-like-soldiers-from-call-of-duty#.qwAEBN185,The Disturbing Reason Ferguson Police Look Like Soldiers From 'Call of Duty',Zak Cheney-Rice,08/14/14,04/06/16,"The news: If you're following the {events in Ferguson}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96242/this-is-what-happens-when-the-police-become-the-military#.hVvUM7luG”>, you may be wondering why a group of suburban St. Louis police look like something out of ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.""

The answer is simple and more than a little disturbing: The Pentagon is {giving them weapons}<hyperlink=“http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-michael-brown-militarization-column/14006383/“>.

USA Today reports that the Ferguson police are part of a federal program called ""1033."" Established in the early 1990s, 1033 lets the U.S. government distribute ""hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus military equipment"" to ""civilian police forces"" across the country.

What does this mean? Instead of the traditional gun-and-badge combo, local cops look increasingly like they're ready to storm the beach at Normandy.

It's unclear what war they imagine they'll be waging anytime soon. But it's bad news: Their equipment ranges from handguns and automatic rifles to camouflage gear and armored vehicles, all of which they've prominently displayed at protests throughout the week.

In 2013 alone, USA Today {reports}<hyperlink=“http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-michael-brown-militarization-column/14006383/“> the Pentagon transferred $449,309,003.71 worth of equipment to police departments nationwide. Cops have received $4.3 billion in ex-military swag since the program launched.

More: The Pentagon does not disclose what equipment it gives which departments. But it does share the county figures, and between 2012 and 2014, police forces in the same county as Ferguson received at least ""advanced rifle sights and night vision equipment.""

Michelle McCaskill of the Defense Logistics Fund tells USA Today that Ferguson received its latest transfer in November. That shipment included ""two vehicles ... a trailer and a generator.""

Background: While no one has explicitly confirmed that Pentagon equipment is being used in Ferguson, the militarization of police arms and tactics there is undeniable.

There's a clear and visible reason why media outlets are comfortable calling the city a “{war zone},hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/95998/days-after-michael-brown-s-death-ferguson-looks-like-a-war-zone#.lVOMOv8iW”>” and comparing it to places like Egypt and Iraq:

Additional case in point: {The Wire}<hyperlink=“http://www.thewire.com/national/2014/08/the-pentagon-gave-the-ferguson-police-department-military-grade-weapons/376033/“> quotes an NBC interview where Washington Post reporter Radley Balko says, ""The militarization itself is part of a larger trend ... a willingness or a policy among domestic police"" to use ""more force more often for, you know, petty offenses.""

He adds: ""It is a mentality that sees the people they are supposed to be serving not as citizens with rights but as potential threats.""

Or as Ferguson police might say, “{fucking animals}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/michael-brown-protests_n_5672163.html”>.”

Takeaway: That the murder of 18-year-old Michael Brown sparked protests is reasonable. That local police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets, combat vehicles and the prominent display of military-grade assault rifles is not.

Fortunately, they won't be doing so much longer: Bloomberg {reports}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/michael-brown-protests_n_5672163.html”> Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon is relieving St. Louis County law enforcement of their duties in Ferguson today.

It also contains a {warning}<hyperlink=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSRQ-c1XW0#t=56”> to local police: ""We are watching you very closely ... If you abuse, harass or harm in any way the protesters in Ferguson we will take every web-based asset of your departments and governments offline. That is not a threat. It is a promise.""

And finally: An {outline}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSRQ-c1XW0#t=56”> of more individualized retribution tactics: ""Attacking the protesters will result in the release of personal information on every single member of the Ferguson police department,"" the voice states.

Just 37% of whites said that they thought the ""case raises important issues about race,"" while an overwhelming 80% of black people said they thought the focus on Brown's ethnicity was warranted.

It gets worse: Pew found whites were also much less likely to think the police response to Brown's death — which has involved crackdowns on protesters, arresting and harassment of reporters and a calculated attempt to smear Brown by releasing CCTV footage of his involvement in a shoplifting incident — ""has gone too far."" Sixty-five percent of black people were critical of the authorities' response, while as many whites thought it has ""been about right"" or excessive. The largest group of white respondents, 35%, didn't know — either because they haven't been paying attention or haven't given it much thought thereafter.

Whites are also far more confident than black people in the authorities' ability to reach a fair conclusion from their investigation:

Mic,mic7 ,http://mic.com/articles/96242/this-is-what-happens-when-the-police-become-the-military#.cFWkAAhaH,This Is What Happens When The Police Become The Military,Tom McKay,08/14/14,04/06/16," The news: Civil unrest in response to the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has received the lion's share of media coverage. But as protests continue, the authorities' response has increasingly looked less like police action and more like a crackdown in a war zone.

This is partially because American police forces are now equipped to operate in war zones. As U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have gradually come down, {military equipment}<hyperlink=“http://www.wired.com/2012/06/cops-military-gear/all/#slideid-192270”> — armored personnel carriers, weapons, tactical uniforms and drones — have become available to virtually every local police force across the country.

""Police SWAT teams are now deployed tens of thousands of times each year, increasingly for routine jobs.""

The result? As Mashable {put it}<hyperlink=“http://mashable.com/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-protests-vs-iraq/#Z_760wjHXgq6”>: It's hard to tell whether this is Ferguson or Iraq.

It's not just the equipment: In one of the most troubling escalations to date, a SWAT team stormed a local McDonald's and physically struck reporters from the Huffington Post and the Washington Post before arresting them without charges.

Politico {reports}<hyperlink=”http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/reporters-arrested-in-ferguson-193914”> that HuffPo's Ryan Reilly and WaPo's Wesley Lowery were present in a local McDonald's at around 8 p.m. before a SWAT team in full riot gear entered and ordered patrons to vacate. According to both reporters, they were arrested by the police after not clearing out quickly enough — and Lowery claims to have been assaulted by one of the officers, who refused to provide their names.

This was what happened to two reporters from seriously established media organizations — had Lowery and Reilly been everyday citizens, they'd likely still be in custody simply for exercising their right to film police in public.

Meanwhile: Riots and protests continued in parts of Ferguson on Wednesday night, but heavy-handed police tactics are quickly overshadowing the violence that spurred them. The name of Brown's killer has not been released to the public, while officers in armored vehicles have fired tear gas at protesters and rioters alike. An Al Jazeera America crew {reports}<hyperlink=“http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/08/us-police-fire-tear-gas-at-protesters-201481423942289865.html”> that they were engulfed in tear gas, while locals told them authorities had opened fire with rubber bullets.

Locals have reported that police are pointing guns at them without provocation and dispersing media teams as well.

Back in 2009, according to the {Daily Beast}<hyperlink=“http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html”>, police in Ferguson approached a 52-year-old man named Henry Davis in his car after running his license plate, saying there was a warrant out for his arrest. The warrant was for a different Henry Davis, but that didn’t stop the cops from tossing him in jail for the night.

In the cell, Davis later testified, police officers beat him until he was bleeding so much he had to be taken to the hospital by paramedics:

After the hospital stay, he was brought back to jail for four counts of ""property damage"" — the officers involved had charged him for bleeding on their uniforms.

It gets worse: You might be thinking that it doesn't get much lower than allegedly beating an innocent man and charging him for getting blood on your clothes. Unfortunately, you'd be wrong again.

As the Daily Beast investigation {notes}<hyperlink=“http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html”>, the officers in question were deposed when Davis filed a lawsuit over the beating.

This Missouri Republican Thinks Registering People to Vote in Ferguson is 'Disgusting'",Matt Connolly,08/19/14,04/08/16,"This just in: Democracy is ""disgusting,"" and participating in it is ""completely inappropriate."" At least according to the Missouri Republican National Committee.



That's taken out of context, but only slightly. Activists in Ferguson set up a voter registration table so that protesters could make their voices heard in upcoming elections as well as on the street, but that didn't sit well with Matt Wills, executive director of the Missouri RNC, who expressed his outrage over people registering to vote in an {interview with Breitbart}<hyperlink=“http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/18/missouri-gop-michael-brown-voting-registration-booths-disgusting/“>.



""If that's not fanning the political flames, I don't know what is,"" he said. ""I think it's not only disgusting but completely inappropriate.""



Wills was also huffy that activists would somehow make a white police officer shooting an unarmed black teenager about race somehow, {telling Breitbart}<hyperlink=“http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/18/missouri-gop-michael-brown-voting-registration-booths-disgusting/“>, ""Injecting race into this conversation and into this tragedy, not only is not helpful, but it doesn't help a continued conversation of justice and peace.""



The background: One registration tent was set up right near the spot where Brown was shot. Debra Reed, a resident of nearby University City, {told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=“http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-gop-official-ferguson-voter-registration-efforts-disgusting/article_ae80a586-cfa3-5a67-a6dc-c48dd4681f8a.html”> that she and her daughter set it up.

It's not just about electing different leaders, as Center for Constitutional Rights fellow Jessica Lee notes there. Juries are taken from the voter rolls, meaning registration could help you affect the judicial process as well.

During those hours of solidarity, which included rallies, marches, protests and pauses for reflection, the grief and frustration found new life in the many signs created to share messages with the greater community and indeed the world.

There has been a literal changing of the guard in Ferguson, Mo., as Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, a Ferguson native, has taken over command of the police operation. Appearing at a press conference Friday with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, Johnson {addressed}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/NYDailyNews/status/500317051932905473”> the change in tone in Ferguson: ""Yesterday, we saw what it could be, we saw what it should be, we saw what it will be.""

Johnson, who is black, pledged yesterday to avoid infringing on protests. ""When I see a young lady cry because of fear of this uniform, that’s a problem."" Johnson {said to the Washington Post.}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/14/with-highway-patrol-hugs-and-kisses-replace-tear-gas-in-ferguson/“> ""We've got to solve that.""

Later, according the Post, a man whose niece had been teargassed asked Johnson what he would say to her. ""Tell her Capt. Johnson is sorry and he apologizes,"" he replied.

That empathy went both ways, per the Post. ""They respect us,"" one protester with a megaphone said about the newly peaceful police. ""So let's respect them. They've given us the sidewalk, so lets stay out of their street.""

Going forward: Nixon brought in the State Highway Patrol to take over from the St. Louis County police, {who had been}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96242/this-is-what-happens-when-the-police-become-the-military#.McXfphi9Y”> using tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters, arresting journalists and {generally}hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96276/the-disturbing-reason-ferguson-police-look-like-soldiers-from-call-of-duty#.3eV5ZFLZh”> {looking like}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96276/the-disturbing-reason-ferguson-police-look-like-soldiers-from-call-of-duty#.lfiT4Pzli”> soldiers in a war zone instead of local cops. Johnson and his altered police tactics were largely praised for helping instill an air of calm that had been missing from law enforcement over the past few nights.

It shouldn't really be a surprise that protesters react differently to masked, armor-clad officers point rifles at them than they do to to officers who speak to them politely in plain uniforms. (Refraining from firing rubber bullets and teargas canisters doesn't hurt, either.)

Racial discrimination and police militarization, of course, will not disappear simply by putting Ferguson in the hands of better cops. Being able to protest in peace is just a small step, but it's still a significant one, as sad as that may be.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Police Chief Thomas Jackson identified him simply as Darren Wilson in a highly anticipated announcement to the press on Friday.

The announcement comes after six days of civil unrest in the St. Louis suburb, where demands for accountability around the 18-year-old's murder have met with a violent police crackdown.

What happened? Jackson {said}<hyperlink=“http://bigstory.ap.org/article/turmoil-tear-gas-give-way-hope-ferguson”> Wilson, a six-year veteran of the police department, was called to the area after a 911 call reporting a ""strong-arm robbery"" at a nearby convenience store that preceeded Brown's shooting.

Background: In the six days since the officer killed Mike Brown, Ferguson residents have taken to the streets in protest.

A police crackdown led by heavily armed officers from 15 local jurisdictions helped turn the situation violent, prompting civil unrest and cumulating in the arrests of multiple residents, at least two journalists and a prominent local alderman, according to {reports}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96242/this-is-what-happens-when-the-police-become-the-military#.NN4hyhkv1”>. Videos from the scene show officers firing tear gas at residents.

The police department's refusal of transparency during the investigation – ""numerous death threats had been made"" against Willman, according to {Jackson}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teenager-and-officer-scuffled-before-shooting-chief-says.html?smid=tw-share&_r=1”> – had concerned residents looking for accountability.

""But the people want answers. When we get answers, things will calm down.""

The Ferguson police were not legally required to release the officer's name, the Times {reports}<hyperlink=“http://mic.com/articles/96256/we-now-know-which-police-officer-killed-michael-brown#.UXK0WQBab”}. But this policy is increasingly being {challenged}<hyperlik=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teenager-and-officer-scuffled-before-shooting-chief-says.html?smid=tw-share&_r=1”> in courts around the country. Legal groups including the National Bar Association and the American Civil Liberties Union have called for the release of documents pertinent to the investigation, according to the {Times}<hyperlink=<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teenager-and-officer-scuffled-before-shooting-chief-says.html?smid=tw-share&_r=1”>.

And not in a good way. Though blacks accounted for 65% of the city's population, they comprised 86% of traffic stops, 92% of searches and 93% of arrests after stops in 2013.

At least according to a report from Missouri's attorney general, as cited by the {Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=“http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-shooting-20140811-story.html”>. It doesn't help that Ferguson's police department has 53 officers, 48 of whom are white.

More: It's important to remember this when looking at violent responses to Michael Brown's murder.

So far, they've been casually derided. In the days since Saturday, people across the Internet have criticized Ferguson residents for destroying property and gutting stores.

[tweetbegin 498702457946771456 tweetend]

And it's not about Michael Brown, at least not exclusively. A glance at these numbers proves it to be a cumulative effect of decades of systemic inequality.

Background: News outlets have painted Ferguson, Mo., as a ""war zone"" since police charged in to pacify dissent this weekend.

But the New York Times reports a more entrenched war has been waged against black residents for years. The Editorial Board {writes}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/opinion/racial-history-behind-the-ferguson-protests.html?_r=1”> that ""restrictive [housing] covenants"" and ""exclusionary zoning tactics"" prevented blacks from living in the suburbs around St. Louis well into the 1960s. When they started moving in, the whites moved out — but power dynamics stayed constant.

This is apparent today: Police demographics aside, the mayor of the city is white, as are five of its six city council members and six of its seven school board members. This power gap has rendered blacks unable to purchase property or ""put down political roots,"" according to the {Times}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/opinion/racial-history-behind-the-ferguson-protests.html?_r=0”>.

It's not a unique story in America. Cities that see prominent black uprisings — like Detroit, Newark, Chicago and Los Angeles — all share a similar history of housing segregation, asymmetric wealth distribution and police oppression.

It's not a unique story in America. Cities that see prominent black uprisings — like Detroit, Newark, Chicago and Los Angeles — all share a similar history of housing segregation, asymmetric wealth distribution and police oppression.

In most of these cases, as with Ferguson, the murder or assault of a black person is merely a catalyst for the inevitable violence that follows.

Takeaway: History repeats itself.

In a city where blacks are twice as likely to be arrested if stopped by police as whites — despite that contraband is found on whites 34% of the time versus 22% for blacks, according to the {Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=“http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-shooting-20140811-story.html”> — stopping 18-year-old Michael Brown was standard.

And when the officer shot him from 35 feet away, {witnesses say}<hyperlink=“https://mic.com/articles/95956/one-striking-image-captures-the-depressing-reality-of-the-michael-brown-shooting#.0ITZE3h56”> he had his hands raised in surrender.

Despite reports of local police {abusing protesters}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/ferguson-protests_n_5686601.html”> and {threatening to kill}<hyperlink=“http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/17/3472290/police-officer-threatens-to-shoot-reporter-live-streaming-protests-in-ferguson/“> reporters in the midst of violent clashes over the weekend in Ferguson, Mo., a {Support Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=“https://www.facebook.com/pages/Support-Darren-Wilson/1464514543811507?sk=timeline”> Facebook page with more than 30,000 ""likes"" and counting asks people across the country to send aid to St. Louis-area police, to Wilson and to his family. According to the {Guardian}<hyperlink=“http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-supporters-police-killed-teenager-protest?CMP=twt_gu”>, more than 150 of Wilson's supporters attended a so-called ""peaceful rally"" on Sunday. The attendees, almost all of whom were white, said they believe Wilson was simply ""doing his job"" and is being ""victimized"" by people who are ""too quick to play the race card.""

It doesn't help claims of 'playing the race card' that Darren Wilson's primary Facebook support group is overflowing with {highly racist and offensive posts}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/08/19/officer_darren_wilson_s_online_support_group_is_as_classy_as_you_d_expect.html”>. But whether they'd like to believe it or not, the pro-Wilson camp should actually be rallying with the Brown protesters instead, because they share more values with Brown protesters than they might otherwise assume.

It's clear that Wilson's supporters harbor concern about a public servant having to sequester himself, with his career and livelihood on the line, during what has become a national outcry for his arrest and arraignment. Pro-Wilson organizers launched a {GoFundMe campaign}<hyperlink=“https://www.gofundme.com/SupportOfficerWilson”> shortly after Sunday's rally, which has so far raised more than $20,000.

At the same time, there's a glaring lack of acknowledgment that a young person died because of Wilson's actions, and that a shroud of secrecy has undermined both the public trust in the police and in the values of due process — an overall outcome that both sides should be able to agree is upsetting and undesirable.

Justice and fairness swing both ways, which is all the more reason why the people who ""Support Darren Wilson"" should actually be supporting the Brown protesters across the city.

Distrust between blacks and majority-white police forces hurts everyone.

It'd be disingenuous to accuse blacks of ""playing the race card"" when race does ultimately play a factor in the community's attitudes toward the police — a {tenuous relationship}<hyperlink”http://www.gallup.com/poll/163175/minorities-less-confident-police-small-business.aspx”> strained by {prejudice and abuses}<hyperlink=“http://www.vox.com/michael-brown-shooting-ferguson-mo/2014/8/19/6031759/ferguson-history-riots-police-brutality-civil-rights”> of power that dates back to before the civil rights movement. It was activists who pressured police forces to begin {integrating and to better represent}<hyperlink=“https://www.gwu.edu/page-not-found”> the racial and ethnic makeups of the communities officers are sworn to ""serve and protect."" 

{In Ferguson}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/the-breaking-point-for-ferguson/”>, this has become the exception rather than the rule. As {noted by Vox}<hyperlink=“http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/12/5994181/ferguson-is-67-percent-black-and-its-police-force-is-94-percent-white”> and based on reporting by the {Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=“http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html#page=1”>, the St. Louis suburb is 67% black, and its police force is 94% white. With such lopsided representation, it's much more likely that white residents can rely upon their police officers to understand their cultural norms and modes of self-expression — characteristics often making the difference between a peaceful or violent interaction.

This type of conflict erodes much-needed trust and cooperation between officers and civilians, something crucial to effective community policing, notes a 2010 {Department of Justice report}<hyperlink=“http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/Publications/e080917232-BuildingTrust.pdf”> . Black citizens, too, want to trust that their police officers will serve and protect them, not kill them with impunity.

It should go without saying that a community that trusts its police is a safer community for both civilians and police officers.

Increased police accountability and transparency helps both the officers and the communities they serve.

There's still been no clear explanation for Wilson's {use of lethal force}<hyperlink=<http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/Pages/welcome.aspx”>, prompting Brown's supporters to decry what they perceive as a violation of the constitutional rights of an unarmed teen. More transparency from authorities would bolster public confidence and ensure that everyone, including {the Obama administration}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/holder-selective-release-of-michael-brown-information-is-troubling/“>, is confident the investigation is being handled with integrity.

Both officers and civilians benefit from clear, public systems of accountability for police activity and use of force. For officers who sometimes feel the need to use force, it helps protect livelihoods and careers during situations in which they may have been following proper protocol — especially when there are accusations of excessive force or racial profiling. For civilians, such transparency would allow them to better question the overall activities and trends of their community's police, fostering a partnership that creates trust on both sides.

Unfortunately, Ferguson authorities have not demonstrated any willingness to be transparent or accountable during the investigation, or in previous situations. {The}<hyperlink=“http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html”> {Daily Beast}<hyperlink=“http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html”> reported that Ferguson cops severely beat an African-American during a 2009 investigation, despite a case of mistaken identity in the arrest. Mic's “Matt Connolly noted”<hyperlink=“https://mic.com/articles/96350/one-victim-s-story-reveals-ferguson-police-s-dark-history-of-brutality#.FYRWicoY8”> that this report, along with the {Washington Post's analysis}<hyperlink=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/12/the-breaking-point-for-ferguson”> of highly disproportionate law enforcement on blacks in Ferguson, ""sheds light on simmering problems that came to a head in the protests and ensuing crackdown following Brown's death."" 

[tweetbegin 500311689544208385 tweetend]

Solutions aren't one size fits all, but there are many good places to build common ground to address the unique needs of each community. One such example, highlighted in a {2008 presentation}<hyperlink=“http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/Forst.pdf”> prepared for the Bureau of Justice Statistics by researchers at American University, entails increasing public access to data and information on law enforcement activities. 

If people came together to ensure their law enforcement officials act responsibly and transparently, abuses of power might not be as easy to perpetrate.

The right to peaceful assembly should be enjoyed — without police interference.

The 100 or so rallying to support Wilson on Sunday assembled without much apparent molestation from local police. But the ""other side"" has, on the whole, peacefully gathered in solidarity with Brown and his family, only to encounter militarized police officer instead.

Indeed, their voices and concerns have been lumped in with looters in an attempt to cast racist aspersions on the people as violent and irrational — something Wilson's supporters also imply when they position their rally as a ""peaceful"" one to counter Brown's supporters.

It's a perception routinely created through mainstream media coverage and even in interpersonal interactions, when outrage, anger and even sadness are emotional facets of a generations-long struggle for equity and inclusion. We're nowhere near being in a post-racial society if white Americans and black Americans who peacefully protest don't receive the same public regard or lack of interference from law enforcement. 

Yet in Ferguson, there's an opportunity now to work across racial and cultural lines to unify in the name of repairing and rebuilding a community despite an intensely racist past. Maybe Wilson's protesters could start by extending the proverbial olive branch, acknowledging that even in these highly polarized circumstances, the common goals of due process, consensus building, transparency and trust are values both white and black community-member can get behind.",NA,NA,NA,NA

When those teams are called out to bring extreme force on suspected criminals, tragedies like the flashbang that {severely burned}<hyperlink=“http://www.salon.com/2014/06/24/a_swat_team_blew_a_hole_in_my_2_year_old_son/“> a two-year-old boy or the raid on the wrong house in Miami that {injured two children}<hyperlink=http://www.local10.com/news/police-investigate-after-boy-injured-during-swat-team-raid”> are inevitable.

2. Over 500 police agencies now have a mine-resistant personnel carrier

The ACLU estimates that 500 local authorities now own a mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle (MRAP), heavy armored personnel carriers designed to withstand a roadside bomb blast in Iraq or Afghanistan. In 2007, 27,000 were built to deploy to Iraq at a cost of $50 billion and now that the wars are over, the crafts are being handed out courtesy of the Pentagon's 1033 program. They're potentially heavy enough to {crush bridges}<hyperlink=“http://www.cnbc.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-missouri-protests-where-fergusons-military-cops-get-their-gear.html#.”>, though it's hard to imagine a situation where small-town cops would need to deploy what's essentially a tank. In Ferguson, police deployed a smaller vehicle known as a BearCat, which was scary enough:

[tweetbegin 499527910035062784 tweetend]

In 2013, the Washington Post {documented}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/04/18/congratulations-your-tiny-town-has-an-mrap-and-is-ready-for-war/“> a number of small-town police departments with MRAPs, from tiny Madison, Ind., (population 12,000) to Warren County, N.Y. (65,500).

The ACLU says the full haul includes military ""bomb suits, night-vision goggles, drones, shock-cuffs, rifles, cell phone sniffers, facial recognition 
technology, forced-entry tools, biometric devices, utility trucks, APCs, helicopters, GPS devices and personal protective armor.""

3. There's no oversight

The ACLU {filed public records requests}<hyperlink=“https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf”> with 255 different law enforcement agencies with 114 denying those requests outright. Those that were produced were ""at best sporadic and at worst virtually nonexistent"" on the use of SWAT teams or other heavy-handed tactics. According to the ACLU, only one state, Maryland, conducts state-level oversight on SWAT teams, and the records provided to state authorities by the police officers themselves were ""for the most part, woefully incomplete, raising serious questions about their utility for internal review of SWAT deployment practices.""

On the federal level, the Bureau of Justice Statistics conducts no research on SWAT deployment, use of military-grade hardware or anything related to either. The 1033 program is pretty loose, only requiring an inventory be kept and that the equipment remain unsold. As the Washington Post's Christopher Ingraham {reports}<hyperlink=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/14/want-an-armored-personnel-carrier-for-your-police-force-just-fill-out-this-one-page-form/“>, obtaining an MRAP only requires program membership and a one-page application:

In 2012, the Pentagon temporarily halted transfers until agencies could {provide records}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/11/pentagon-suspends-weapons-program-cops-military_n_1585328.html”> of whether 1033 equipment had been lost or sold after a slew of reports indicated many agencies had somehow lost (or planned to sell) military-grade supplies.

4. Access to military-grade equipment makes police more aggressive

Policing expert Jason Fritz {suggested to Vox}<hyperlink=“http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002917/ferguson-police-expert-interview-fritz/in/5757650”>a disturbingly simple reason police were so aggressively cracking down on protesters: ""They have the toys, and they just want to play with them, to put it bluntly.""

The ACLU's data backs that up, showing that police predictably act with more swagger and force when using heavier equipment, especially on drug raids. SWAT teams were 14 times as likely as regular officers to use flashbangs on drug raids and forcibly entered in more than 60% of drug searches. Dr. Peter Kraska, a professor of justice studies at Eastern Kentucky University, {estimates}<hyperlink=“http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21599349-americas-police-have-become-too-militarised-cops-or-soldiers”> that the number of SWAT raids has grown from around 3,000 annually in the 1980s to around 50,000 this year.

Many times, the police acted without ascertaining whether children would be present, putting them in unnecessary danger. What's more, the ACLU found that armored vehicles were routinely used for raids during which they proved useless.

5. It mostly impacts minorities

As we're {now seeing firsthand}<hyperlink=“https://mic.com/articles/96350/one-victim-s-story-reveals-ferguson-police-s-dark-history-of-brutality#.qRZKoiGiK”> in Ferguson, Mo., when the cops get rolling with their high-powered new gear, they mostly point it at black and brown people. The ACLU estimated that 61% of SWAT-style raids involved black or Latino suspects. Of those, an astonishing 68% were for drug searches, as opposed to only 38% of raids on white suspects. In every single agency, black people were disproportionately more likely to incur the wrath of a SWAT team than whites — despite {well-documented evidence}<hyperlink=“http://www.vox.com/2014/7/1/5850830/war-on-drugs-racist-minorities”> that white folks use drugs at more or less the same rates as black people.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Rather than tackle a thorny issue with {tact and honesty,}<hyperlink=""http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/clueless-things-white-people-say-racism/""> however, privilege also allows people to ignore the conversation, mock it or walk away from it altogether. But it doesn't have to be that way. Americans don't have to let this type of ignorance stop us from examining the many subtle, insidious attitudes and beliefs that help perpetuate racism through {microaggressions}<hyperlink=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/microaggressions-in-everyday-life/201010/racial-microaggressions-in-everyday-life""> — a term coined by African-American psychologist Chester Pierce and further developed by Derald Wing Sue and researchers at Columbia University to explain smaller instances of systemic, cumulative racial indignities. 

Here are a few problematic examples that can be used to help elevate a much-needed dialogue as the images streaming out of Ferguson, Mo., bring us face to face with America's {legacy of institutional intolerance.}<hyperlink=""http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/17-things-yes-all-black-people/"">

1. ""Why do black people have to make everything about race?""

The fact that someone was shot in general is the actual problem, stop making everything about race we don't choose our flesh.

— Hawaiian Punch Haley (@ThatHaleyWay) {August 14, 2014}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ThatHaleyWay/statuses/499859293156294657"">

If it seems as though black people talk about race so much, that's because America, as a government and as a power structure, has made everything about race, from the moment Columbus landed in 1492 to the recent shooting of Michael Brown at the hands of a cop with {institutional power and privilege}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3107729/michael-brown-shooting-ferguson-missouri-white-flight/""> on his side.

White people will never fully understand how racism impacts the everyday lives of black people and people of color. That's because they benefit from a racial system that enshrines {institutional racism}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/does-institutional-racism-persist-today-240281667797""> and racial prejudice as {the rule of law}<hyperlink=""https://mic.com/articles/95956/one-striking-image-captures-the-depressing-reality-of-the-michael-brown-shooting""> and social order.

[tweetbegin 499822566992003073 tweetend]
[tweetbegin 498490487616327680 tweetend]

For those who aren't already actively anti-racist, however, exercising empathy is a good place to start. Doing so means {taking the lead}<hyperlink=""http://feminspire.com/why-white-feminists-need-to-shut-up-and-listen-when-it-comes-to-race/""> from black people, listening to their stories of racialized pains and struggles, and reflecting on the ways privilege minimizes those hindrances for white people.

If the continuing conversation about racism upsets you, take a second to imagine what it's like for the black people who deal with racism everyday, and who are tired of thinking and talking about it, but discuss it anyway because for them, it's not just a dinner table dialogue. 

2. ""I don't have white privilege. Stop saying that I have white privilege.""

[tweetbegin 499845452376715266 tweetend]
[tweetbegin 499797003526631425 tweetend]

White privilege isn't inherently about being raised in an affluent, two-parent home with high educational attainment and markers of upward mobility in American society. White privilege is the many built-in perks afforded to white people by virtue of being born with white skin and white ethnicity in a social and legal system that enforces white supremacy as the rule of law. It's not having to seriously think about or discuss how the situation in Ferguson will affect friends and relatives or even how a broader justice system will work to protect (or to not protect) the constitutional rights of black people. 

White privilege is being able to walk away from the conversation, or to stop reading a piece about racism when it stirs up discomfort, rather than wrestling with the subject matter and owning up to personal biases and limits to understanding.

White privilege can be used for good too, of course, if those who wield it actively challenge the prejudices of their white friends and reject white supremacy. But as long as white people keep denying their privilege, white officers with badges and institutional power on their side will continue killing blacks with impunity. 

3. ""I'm not racist. I have black friends.""

Aside from the lazy logic of such a statement, this phrase describes the phenomenon wherein people use black people as accessories and distractions.

Having a black friend, or any relationship with a person of color, doesn't mean your everyday habits and politics are exempt from having racist implications. For proof, look no further than {Donald Sterling,}<hyperlink=""http://deadspin.com/exclusive-the-extended-donald-sterling-tape-1568291249""> who told his girlfriend, a person of color, to stop bringing black people with her to basketball games because he feels blacks are inferior.

4. ""These protesters speak so well, but they're such violent people.""

Most of the protests in Ferguson have been peaceful, but that fact hasn't stopped some characterizations from making it appear as though a race war is brewing. In effect, blacks are being typecasted as loud, irrational people who shouldn't be paid attention to, when they actually have valid concerns about the abuses from their local police force.

[tweetbegin 499929575884070912 tweetend]
[tweetbegin 499931742816706560 tweetend]

These types of remarks go hand in hand with an amazement about how poised, well-spoken and presentable some black protesters have been amid the chaos. In other contexts, ""You speak so well"" may sound like earnest praise, and sometimes it's received by black people as a commendation because of the apparent intent. However, more often than not, this sentiment is a {backhanded compliment}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/2014/04/10/301417507/boss-says-youre-smart-for-a-woman""> that assumes most black people speak with rudimentary grammar and communicate using ""lesser"" linguistic patterns such as Ebonics.

If a black person has great oratory skills, it's certainly possible to say so in a way that isn't infantilizing or denigrating. Talk about the content of the remarks and other communication dynamics they employed to be effective, but please do not assume that someone else's method of communication is automatically inferior just because it sounds different.

5. ""You probably voted for Barack Obama just because he's black.""

President Obama {issued a statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.ky3.com/news/local/president-obama-issues-statement-on-death-of-ferguson-missouri-teenager/21048998_27431674""> on Tuesday regarding Brown's shooting death, and {finally spoke Thursday}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-speaks-about-shooting-of-michael-brown-in-ferguson-mo/2014/08/14/d49f63ac-23c7-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html""> about it as he would any other major policy issue, noting a Justice Department investigation already in progress, and that there's ""never an excuse"" for police brutality or {excessive force}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/micnews/status/499963077430104065""> against peaceful protesters.

Unlike many other presidents and political leaders before, Obama has a better understanding of black issues, given his lived experiences as a person of color and his education. But don't treat black people as though they can't make an informed political decision that uses a cost-benefit analysis, or even a pragmatic approach to politics, in order to cast their vote.

[tweetbegin 499963077430104065 tweetend]
[tweetbegin 499731384169402368 tweetend]

The vast majority of African-Americans vote for Democratic candidates like President Obama in major elections, but this is often because of a sense of {""linked racial fate""}<hyperlink=""http://www.blackyouthproject.com/2011/05/linked-fate-organizing-and-the-power-of-a-shared-experience/""> — in other words, the candidate that represents the issues most relevant to the everyday lives of black people is most likely to win a disproportionate share of votes from black constituents. So it's not as much about skin color as it is about positions on issues, which is how most anyone else votes.

Otherwise, people like former Tea Party Republican congressman {Allen West}<hyperlink=""http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/07/18/allen-west-obama-purposefully-creating-drama-li/200143""> would have swept the the black vote in their elections, despite their problematic views on issues affecting black people.

6. ""It's not fair that you all can say the n-word, but we can't.""

[tweetbegin 499806851702091776 tweetend]

The n-word has hundreds of years of slavery, segregation and institutional racism attached to it. But in recent decades, it's been reclaimed by black people, which now means that some blacks use it in a variety of different ways, often to refer to one another in a not-so-derogatory manner.

But just because some black people have reclaimed the word in their everyday vernacular, or even in their cultural productions, doesn't mean white people get to participate in that same reclamation. White people irrevocably {lost that opportunity}<hyperlink=""http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/03/white-people-cant-use-the-n-word/""> the day the n-word coincided with lynchings, whippings, mob beatings and police shootings. 

7. ""I'm clutching my purse or my wallet when you walk past, because I think you might steal from me.""

Anyone of any race can perpetrate a mugging, or commit any other crime that involves physical or personal property. But because of how {white overrepresentation}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/police-staffing/""> in America's police departments and the justice system impacts the enforcement of laws, research shows there's a {disproportionate impact}<hyperlink=""http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/rd_reducingracialdisparity.pdf""> on how blacks are caught and publicly held accountable for their wrongdoing. The {situation in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""https://mic.com/articles/96234/one-alarming-statistic-perfectly-explains-the-violence-in-ferguson""> mirrors that very reality, as the {Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-shooting-20140811-story.html""> shows, based on a report from the Missouri attorney general's office {about racial profiling}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/Reports.php?lea=161""> in that state. That might explain why some people feel as though every time they hear about a violent crime or theft, they see a black mugshot or hear a name that ""sounds"" black. 

It also removes accountability from {larger social systems,}<hyperlink=""http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-prison-industry-in-the-united-states-big-business-or-a-new-form-of-slavery/8289""> such as the {school-to-prison pipeline}<hyperlink=""http://www.aclu.org/school-prison-pipeline""> and the {prison-industrial complex,}<hyperlink=""http://colorlines.com/archives/1998/09/masked_racism_reflections_on_the_prison_industrial_complex.html""> that may put someone in a position where they must choose between not having basic needs and stealing from someone who can afford them. Instead, disproportionately white police departments pull out all the stops in a show of excessive force, {protecting white privilege}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/opinion/granderson-missouri-police-shooting/""> and {white wealth}<hyperlink=""http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-teachers-07.htm""> in the process.

[tweetbegin 499769500603260928 tweetend]

8. ""I don't understand why you people...""

The phrase ""you people"" is {coded language,}<hyperlink=""http://www.diversityinc.com/things-not-to-say/10-things-never-to-say-to-a-black-coworker/""> a euphemism for the n-word, black people, outsiders or ""the other."" By being an outsider to whiteness and white supremacy, ""you people"" suggests that blacks (and other people of color) do not belong in the same rooms, venues or halls of power as white people. 

9. ""When I see you, I don't see race.""

{Color-blind racism}<hyperlink=""https://mic.com/articles/55867/colorblindness-is-the-new-racism""> is still racism. Without facing history and the present realities, it's impossible to understand how racism affects the everyday life of peoples of all races and ethnicities. 

Almost everyone, save for those who ascribe to a racist system or retain deep-seated racial prejudice, wants to be able to unite across races, ethnicities and cultures to live in harmony. But with the systems and structures of previous generations still in place, which codify and promote racism in politics and everyday life, we're nowhere close to being post-race or being able to ""not see"" skin color.

But there are moments every day when that racial divide is bridged in a way that is mutually beneficial and even life-giving for all parties involved. For proof, take a look at this black family, which welcomed a white reporter from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch into their home for safe shelter and sustenance while he reports about the situation in Ferguson. It's an illuminating example of what an authentic cross-cultural embrace can look like.

[tweetbegin 499746654887899136 tweetend]

10. ""If black men don't want to get stopped by police, maybe they shouldn't dress that way.""

It shouldn't matter what a young person is wearing, or how they walk down the street, or how they talk, how they speak or where they come from. It doesn't matter if black men wear suits everywhere, or stop sagging their pants, or stop wearing hoodies — a ""classy"" dress code isn't going to {stop police brutality.}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/jesset9/don-lemon-and-the-failure-of-respectability-politics""> 

In fact, many white young people wear the same kinds of clothing, yet are not subjected to the same kinds of the racialized subtexts. On average, a white man in a hoodie is less likely to be perceived as a threat by a police officer or concerned citizen. Indeed, the moment a self-appointed Florida neighborhood watchman named George Zimmerman thought he could accost and harass a black young man wearing a hoodie and jeans, the situation snowballed into that young man's death.

It is never the victim's fault. And {no change of clothing}<hyperlink=""http://www.postbourgie.com/2013/07/24/in-the-face-of-respectability/""> will hold the people and systems accountable for murdering young black people.

11. ""Racism ended in the 1960s. Stop making such a big deal out of nothing.""

This statement couldn't be farther from the truth. In fact, if you pay attention to news coverage, there's a laundry list of big and small issues proving that American racism is far from being a thing of the past.

The killings of Michael Brown, Renisha McBride, Jordan Davis, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and many other nameless, faceless black young people — all at the hands of police and whites — come at a time when black women like Marissa Alexander are simultaneously being denied the {""stand your ground""}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/07/22/marissa_alexander_denied_new_stand_your_ground_hearing_still_faces_up_to_60_years_in_prison/""> defense and instead threatened with decades in jail for firing a warning shot at an allegedly abusive spouse.

When it comes to the reality in Ferguson, Mo., the images speak for themselves. And that unsavory reality begins with the family that Brown leaves behind, including a father and mother struggling with the pain of burying their son because of the very people who should be keeping them safe.

Mic,mic21,http://mic.com/articles/96378/7-things-worth-more-than-a-black-person-s-life-in-america#.pKCHCXQ1R,7 Things Worth More Than a Black Person's Life in America,Zak Cheney-Rice,08/16/14,07/07/16,"We’re constantly being asked to qualify black life in America. So when Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson identified Darren Wilson as the officer who killed 18-year-old Michael Brown {during a press conference on Friday,}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XJ1Kh1CTB8""> the logic he employed to justify Wilson's actions was all too familiar.

""At 11:51, there was a 9-1-1 call from a convenience store nearby. At 11:52 dispatch gave a description of the robbery suspect over the radio ... further description of the suspect was given over the radio, which describe the suspect walking towards QuickTrip. The office [involved in the shooting] left a sick call. At 12:01 p.m., our officer encountered Michael Brown on Canfield Drive. At 12:04, a second officer arrived on the scene immediately following the shooting.""

In {not too subtle}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice-criminal-law-reform/ferguson-polices-pr-stunt-poisons-independent-and-impartial""> a move, Jackson accompanied his announcement with video of Brown allegedly shoplifting a box of cigars from a convenience store the day of his murder. The implication was clear: Brown was a criminal, hence a violent encounter with police was inevitable and most likely warranted.

It didn’t matter that Officer Wilson had no knowledge of the theft before shooting Brown. Nor that Jackson likely aired the tape unprompted, despite his claims to the contrary.

— Goldie Taylor (@goldietaylor) {August 16, 2014}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/goldietaylor/statuses/500473566169939968"">

What mattered was this: When a black person is killed under dubious circumstances, the conversation inevitably turns to what the victim did to precipitate – if not outright deserve – such an abrupt and violent demise.

This is not a new phenomenon, of course. Into the mid-20th century, even the most casual display of {disrespect}<hyperlink=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/till/""> towards a white person, real or imagined, was enough to justify a gruesome death. But in recent years, the tone has shifted: It’s more common to justify black death relative to specific items, e.g. what the victim had allegedly stolen, possessed or wanted at the time of his or her murder. 

Disputes over material goods have prompted a disturbing frequency in black people being killed by police and regular citizens alike in recent years. And in each of these actions lies an implicit value judgment: The black victims lives' are worth no more to their murderers than the items for which they were killed.

This is the America we live in today. Here are seven troubling examples from the past 22 years: 

1. Mike Brown = 1 box of convenience store cigars (approx. $34.99)

Brown, unarmed, allegedly stole a box of cigars from a convenience store shortly before Officer Darren Wilson shot him to death in Ferguson, Mo., on August 9.

2. Eric Garner = 1 carton of cigarettes (less than $48.57)

Garner, 43 and unarmed, was allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes when New York police officers {choked him}<hyperlink=""https://mic.com/articles/94604/this-moment-should-be-the-absolute-last-straw-for-americans-tired-of-police-brutality""> to death on Staten Island, NY, on July 17.

3. Renisha McBride = 1 phone call (approx. 25 cents)

McBride, 19 and unarmed, was seeking help after a car accident when she knocked on Theodore Wafer's front door the night of Nov. 2, 2012. Wafer {shot her to death}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/renisha-mcbride-shooter-shocked-guilty-verdict-article-1.1897748""> on his front porch outside of Detroit, Mich.

4. Kendrec McDade = 1 laptop (approx. $1,099.00)

McDade, 19 and unarmed, had allegedly stolen a laptop when police {shot him}<hyperlink=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/12/kendrec-mcdade-pasadena-police-shooting-justified.html""> to death in Pasadena, Calif., on March 24, 2012.

5. Trayvon Martin = 1 hooded sweatshirt (approx. $14.95)

Those are the findings of a USA Today {analysis}<hyperlink=“http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/police-killings-data/14060357/“> of seven years of {FBI data}<hyperlink=“https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expandhomicidemain”>, which claims around a quarter of the 400 annual deaths reported to federal authorities by local police departments were white-on-black shootings. What's more, the analysis indicates that 18% of the black suspects were under the age of 21 when killed by the police, as opposed to just 8.7% of white suspects.

Throughout much if not all of America, black people are disproportionately more likely to be killed by the police.

The background: Statistics like these may help explain why Pew polls have demonstrated {continued low confidence}<hyperlink=“http://www.gallup.com/poll/163175/minorities-less-confident-police-small-business.aspx”> among non-whites in the police and justice systems. Police in general, and white cops in particular, have a pattern of disproportionately directing force against black people. All too often, cases of abuse and excessive force are simply swept under the rug.

University of Nebraska criminologist Samuel Walker told USA Today that the lack of a comprehensive national repository on use of force has been a ""major failure"" for oversight, while USC colleague Geoff Alpert pointed out that around 98.9% of excessive force allegations are ultimately ruled as justified. In just one of many examples, NYPD {almost exclusively}<hyperlink=http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/police-shootings-michael-brown-ferguson-black-men}> shoots black or Hispanic suspects.

Protests involving black people are also {more likely}<hyperlink=“https://mic.com/articles/96318/there-s-one-disturbing-factor-that-causes-cops-to-use-force-against-protesters#.GrI1ZL7S3”> to attract police attention and use of force to disperse them. The ACLU has {intensely documented}<hyperlink=“https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf”> an immensely troubling pattern of police militarization and found SWAT teams and other heavy-handed tactics are much more likely to be used against minority suspects than white ones:

In Ferguson, where community members are currently protesting deeply entrenched, racially discriminatory policing, {92% of all people arrested}<hyperlink=“https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/blacks-overwhelmingly-get-stopped-by-the-police-in-ferguson?utm_term=.dmmjOq4ZXb#.lfxYorql64”> in 2013 were black. The community as a whole, however, is 65% black.

It's not just the police, either — the Urban Institute estimates that white-on-black homicides in states with Stand Your Ground laws are {354% more likely}<hyperlink=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/is-there-racial-bias-in-stand-your-ground-laws/“> to be ruled justifiable than white-on-white ones. The State's Warren Bolton {describes}<hyperlink=“http://www.thestate.com/2013/07/23/2874995/bolton-black-men-endure-a-lifetime.html”> how black men in America ""endure a lifetime of suspicion,"" both from the authorities and people of other races.

The statistics are clear. Being the disproportionate target of violence by the police and white people in general is a systemic problem for black people across America.

Why you should care: The statistic on white-cop-on-black-suspect shootings is alarming in and of itself. But while race plays a critical role, the number of white cops shooting black people is just part of a larger problem. Black people across the United States are more likely to face discrimination in the criminal justice system and be harassed, arrested and shot by police. Sadly, even the {most extreme cases}<hyperlink=“http://www.democracynow.org/2000/2/14/one_of_four_police_officers_on”> of police excess often {end in little punishment}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/nyregion/amadou-diallos-mother-asks-why-officer-who-shot-at-her-son-will-get-gun-back.html?_r=0”>.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Even as the dust settles in Ferguson, we have some hard questions to ask ourselves, as a culture, about why this happened and how we can keep it from ever happening again. ""Be Free"" is a touching tribute to all victims of racial injustice who have so tragically fallen as our country struggles to work through its brutal past. For better or worse, this track puts the events of the past week in their rightful context. Here's hoping that long history will soon be past.",NA,NA,NA,NA
