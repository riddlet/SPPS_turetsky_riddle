FERGUSON, Mo. -- Anger spurred by the death of a black teenager at the hands of a white police officer boiled over again when protesters stormed into a Missouri convenience store - the same one {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=â€œhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/darren-wilson-ferguson-police-officer-who-fatally-shot-michael-brown-identified/â€ù> was accused of robbing.

Police and about 200 protesters clashed in {Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=â€œhttp://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/â€ù>, late Friday after another tense day in the St. Louis suburb that began with authorities identifying the officer who fatally shot Brown as 28-year-old {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=â€œhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-and-michael-brown-5-things-you-need-to-know/â€ù>. At the same time, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released documents {alleging Brown had stolen a $48.99 box of cigars from the convenience store}<hyperlink=â€œhttp://www.cbsnews.com/videos/ferguson-police-release-surveillance-video-related-to-michael-brown-shooting/â€ù> and strong-armed a man on his way out.

Just before midnight, some in what had been a large, rowdy but mostly peaceful crowd broke into that same small store, Ferguson Market & Liquor, and began looting it, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said. Some protesters yelled at the aggressors to stop what they were doing, and about a dozen people eventually helped protect the convenience store.

CBS News correspondent Vladimir Duthiers reports from Ferguson that police in riot gear were on the scene, some with high-powered rifles trained on the crowd. Despite the tense standoff, rubber bullets were not used.

Teams of police officers dressed in riot gear used their cars to block a one-mile stretch of West Florissant Avenue, the street at the center of the protests. Occasional firecrackers sounded in the distance.

Some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Johnson said. One officer was hurt; details were not immediately available. Johnson said police backed off to try and ease the tension. No arrests were made.

""We had to evaluate the security of the officers there and also the rioters,"" Johnson said. ""We just felt it was better to move back.""

Johnson said he believed other stores were hit by looters. The crowd that had surrounded the convenience store dispersed but continued north. Two men in white undershirts threw debris through the windows of a liquor store and could be seen walking through the store as an alarm wailed.

Brown's death had previously ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Gov. Jay Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But Friday night marked a resurgence of the unrest that had momentarily abated.

Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly.

Jackson's decision to spell out the allegations that Brown committed the robbery, and his releasing of surveillance video, angered Brown's family and many in the community.

""They have attempted to taint the investigation,"" U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay told protesters through a bullhorn Friday night. ""They are trying to influence a jury pool by the stunt they pulled today.""

Family attorney Daryl Parks acknowledged the man in the footage ""appears to be"" Brown. But he and others said Brown's family was blindsided by the allegations and release of the footage. They said that even if it was Brown, the crime didn't justify the shooting after Brown put up his hands in surrender, as witnesses describe.

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said police ""are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style"" killing.

The surveillance video shows a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store's door. A police report alleges Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and ""forcefully pushed him back"" into a display rack.

Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, did not know the teen was a robbery suspect at the time of the shooting and stopped Brown and a companion ""because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic,"" Jackson said Friday. Police said they found evidence of the stolen merchandise on Brown's body.

Wilson is a six-year police veteran - two in neighboring Jennings and four in Ferguson - and had no previous complaints filed against him, Jackson said, describing him as ""a gentle, quiet man"" who had been ""an excellent officer.""

The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson's whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley asked Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster on Friday to take over the case, saying he did not believe McCulloch could be objective. Koster said Missouri law does not allow it unless McCulloch opts out, and McCulloch spokesman Ed Magee said the prosecutor has no plans to surrender the case.

Also Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said that FBI agents had conducted several interviews with witnesses as part of a civil-rights investigation into Brown's death. In the days ahead, the agents planned to canvass the neighborhood for more information, the statement said.",462,8900,NA,many of the articles repeated in the google search tool.

Wilson, 28, has been an officer in suburban St. Louis for six years and had no complaints filed against him, Jackson said. Police previously refused to identify Wilson,{citing concerns over the officer's safety}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/name-of-officer-in-michael-brown-shooting-a-festering-issue/"">.

The tension eased Thursday after the governor {turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/missouri-state-troopers-to-take-over-security-in-ferguson-missouri/"">. Within hours, the mood on the street lighted, with state troopers walking side-by-side with peaceful protesters and no hint of violence. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, pointing assault rifles at protesters and firing tear gas into crowds.

Brown's relatives immediately questioned whether the officer really believed Brown was a suspect and said no robbery would justify shooting the teen after he put his hands up. Later, a lawyer for the teen's parents acknowledged that the robbery suspect in the surveillance video appeared to be Brown.

""It appears to be him,"" attorney Daryl Parks said. He said the footage was released without any advance notice to the family from police.

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said Brown's parents were blindsided by the allegations.

""It's bad enough they assassinated him, and now they're trying to assassinate his character,"" Crump said.

An attorney for the teen who was with Brown on the day of the shooting said his client has acknowledged to investigators that Brown took cigars from the store.

State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, now in command of security in Ferguson, said he was not told about the convenience store video before Ferguson police released the information. Johnson said he took on his new role very suddenly, ""so I haven't had time to meet with a lot of leaders, but I do think there was opportunity for meeting prior to this morning.""

The Ferguson police chief said Wilson has been on administrative leave since the Aug. 9 shooting. Wilson was treated for injuries after the incident, said Jackson, who {told CBS affiliate KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Chief-Officer-in-fatal-shooting-suffered-facial-injuries-271079471.html""> that the officer ""was hit"" and the ""side of his face was swollen.""

Jackson described Wilson as ""a gentle, quiet man"" who had been ""an excellent officer."" He's been on the Ferguson force for four years. Prior to that, he patrolled in the neighboring community of Jennings, Jackson said.

At 11:51 a.m. on the day of the shooting, police records show, authorities received a call reporting a robbery at the Ferguson Market. An unidentified officer was dispatched to the store, arriving within three minutes. The officer interviewed an employee and customer, who gave a description of a man who stole the cigars and walked off with another man toward another store.

Descriptions of the suspect were broadcast over the police radio. The officer did not find the suspects either on the street or at the other store, the reports said.

The robber took a box of Swisher Sweets Cigars valued at $48.99, according to the reports. The suspects were identified as 18-year-old Michael Brown and 22-year-old Dorian Johnson.

Separately, Wilson had been responding to a nearby call involving a sick 2-month child from 11:48 am until noon, when he left that place. A minute later, he encountered Brown walking down a street. The documents contained no description of what happened between Brown and Wilson.

Crump noted that police did not release a photo of the officer but released images from the store's security video that they say show Brown grabbing a man inside the store. Crump said he had not seen the photos.

Police ""are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style"" killing, said Crump, who also represented the family of {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trayvon-martin-shooting-a-timeline-of-events/"">, the teenager fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.

The Aug. 9 video appears to show a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store's door. A police report alleges that Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and ""forcefully pushed him back"" into a display rack.

Johnson, Brown's friend, told investigators that Brown ""did take cigarillos,"" his attorney, Freeman Bosley, told MSNBC. Bosley said he was aware of video but had not seen it.

Police have determined that Johnson was not involved in the robbery and will not seek charges against him, Jackson said.

The Justice Department said Friday evening that FBI agents, working with attorneys from the department's Civil Rights Division and the U.S. attorney's office, have interviewed several witnesses as part of the federal investigation.

""Over the next several days, teams of FBI agents will be canvassing the neighborhood where the shooting took place to identify any individuals who may have information related to the shooting and have not yet come forward,"" the Justice Department said in a statement. ""We ask for the public's cooperation and patience, and again urge anyone with information related to the shooting to contact the FBI.""",1400,9300,NA,NACBS,cbs3,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiny-minority-of-lawbreakers-blamed-for-latest-trouble-at-ferguson-missouri-protests/,"Police, protesters clash anew in Ferguson, Missouri",CBS/AP,8/19/14,3/7/16,"FERGUSON, Missouri -- More clashes erupted between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, where racial tensions have boiled over since a {police officer killed an unarmed 18-year-old black man}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">. Dozens of people were arrested and the unrest forced schools to close for the rest of the week.

Protesters filled the {streets of Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hit-by-poverty-ferguson-reflects-the-new-suburbs/""> after nightfall Monday, and officers trying to enforce tighter restrictions at times used bullhorns to order them to disperse. Police fired tear gas and flash grenades, and deployed noisemakers and armored vehicles to push demonstrators back.

Molotov cocktails and bottles were thrown from the crowd and some officers came under heavy gunfire, said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is in charge of security in Ferguson. The {National Guard arrived again the St. Louis suburb}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/key-questions-about-the-national-guard-in-ferguson/""> but kept its distance.

At least two people were shot and 31 were arrested, he said. Four officers were injured by rocks or bottles. A photographer and two German reporters were arrested and later released.

One peaceful demonstrator, Charles Bourrage, told CBS News correspondent Vladimir Duthiers that a {small group of violent protesters}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/outsiders-agitating-situation-in-ferguson-community-says/""> were working against the message of the larger crowd.

""We grabbed those that were trying to move the violence forward and moved them back. We grabbed them literally,"" Bourrage said.

The violence in Ferguson has forced {three school districts to cancel classes}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Ferguson-Florissant-School-District-cancels-classes-for-the-rest-of-the-week-271774431.html"">. It has also forced the Ferguson-Florissant district to move the first day of school to Monday, August 25, more than a week after school was originally scheduled to begin.

The latest clashes came after a day in which a {pathologist hired by the family of Michael Brown's family}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/private-autopsy-reveals-details-of-michael-brown-shooting/""> said the 18-year-old suffered a bullet wound to his right arm that may indicate his hands were up or his back was turned. But the pathologist said the team that examined Brown cannot be sure yet exactly how the wounds were inflicted until they have more information.

Brown's Aug. 9 slaying by a white officer angered many in Ferguson, a {predominantly black community where the police force is mostly white}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/response-to-ferguson-shooting-divided-on-racial-lines-study-finds/"">.

Addressing the crisis Monday, {President Barack Obama said the mistrust between police and local residents}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/obama-urges-ferguson-authorities-protesters-dont-simply-holler-at-each-other/""> was endemic in many of America's communities and overcoming it would require Americans to ""listen and not just shout.""

He tried to strike a balanced tone, calling for respect for police but also understanding of the plight of young black men who feel unjustly targeted by law enforcement.

""In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,"" {Obama said at the White House}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/reacting-to-ferguson-a-vacationing-obama-keeps-his-distance/"">, while adding that crimes must be prosecuted and police honored for doing their jobs.

Obama said the vast majority of protesters in Ferguson were peaceful but a small minority was undermining justice. He said he spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon about his deployment of the National Guard in Ferguson and urged the governor to ensure the military reserve force was used in a limited way.

The president said {Attorney General Eric Holder would arrive Wednesday in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-dispatches-eric-holder-to-ferguson-in-wake-of-shooting/""> to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death.

The Justice Department has mounted an unusually swift and aggressive response to Brown's death, from the independent autopsy to dozens of FBI agents combing Ferguson for witnesses to the shooting.

Demonstrators no longer faced a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew that the governor had imposed but police told protesters that they could not assemble in a single spot and had to keep moving. After the streets had been mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave as well, citing the risk from gunfire that had been reported.

A photographer for Getty Images was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released. Two German reporters were arrested and detained for three hours. Conservative German daily Die Welt said correspondent Ansgar Graw and reporter Frank Herrmann, who writes for German regional papers, were arrested after allegedly failing to follow police instructions to vacate an empty street. They said they followed police orders.

Johnson said members of the media had to be asked repeatedly to return to the sidewalks and that it was a matter of safety. He said in some cases it was not immediately clear who was a reporter but that once it was established, police acted properly.

Witnesses have said Brown's hands were above his head when he was repeatedly shot by the officer.

The independent autopsy determined that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, the family's lawyers and hired pathologists said.

The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday. But she declined to comment further, saying the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney.

Holder, the attorney general, said a {third and final autopsy was performed Monday for the Justice Department}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-department-of-justice-orders-federal-autopsy/""> by one of the military's most experienced medical examiners.

The ""Hands up, don't shoot"" protest even made its way to the NFL. The Washington Redskins secondary emerged from the stadium tunnel during pregame introductions Monday night with hands raised and palms forward to show solidarity with the people of Ferguson. Eleven players took part as the team was preparing to face the Cleveland Browns.

Safety Ryan Clark said Brown ""could have been any one of us. That could have been any one of our brothers, our cousins. ... When you get an opportunity to make a statement and be more than a football player, it's good.""",457,1100,NA,NACBS,cbs4,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/protests-in-st-louis-suburb-again-turn-ugly/,Protests in St. Louis suburb again turn ugly,CBS/AP,8/14/14,3/7/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. -- Police used tear gas and smoke bombs to repel crowds who threw Molotov cocktails during another violent night in a {St. Louis suburb}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/police-and-protesters-clash-for-fourth-night-in-st-louis-suburb/""> in the wake of the shooting of unarmed 18-year old {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/police-fire-tear-gas-as-protests-turn-violent-in-ferguson-missouri/"">.

CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann reports from Ferguson that a second witness has come forward who claims to have watched a white police officer fatally shoot the black teen.

Tiffany Mitchell said she found Brown next to a police car struggling with an officer inside. Shortly after, a gunshot was fired.

""After the shot, the kid breaks away, and he starts running away from the cop,"" Mitchell said. ""The cop follows him, kept shooting, and the kid's body jerked as if he was hit.""

The 18-year-old tried to record the struggle on her phone but was too startled by the gunshots, Strassmann reports.

""After his body jerked, he turned around,"" Mitchell said. ""He puts his hands up, and the cop just continues to walk up on him and shoot him until he goes all the way down.""

On Wednesday, the police chief had said race relations were the top priority in the town. Authorities have {vowed to reach across the racial, economic and generational divide}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-missouri-police-chief-race-relations-a-top-priority-post-shooting/""> in a community in search of answers.

In the streets of {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/civil-unrest-over-missouri-teens-shooting/"">, though, the polite dialogue heard at community forums and news conferences is nowhere to be found.

Instead, officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, ""Hands up, don't shoot."" Wednesday saw more tense confrontations and further volleys of tear gas from police - this time paired with smoke bombs in response to flaming projectiles and other objects lobbed from the crowd. Protesters faced heavily armed police who at times trained weapons on them from armored trucks.

Several journalists were also allegedly physically assaulted by police, Strassmann reports. Officers stormed a McDonald's where Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post and Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post were working, telling them to stop recording and leave.

One officer reportedly slammed a reporter's head against glass. They were eventually detained and released shortly afterwards.

Strassmann reports that police made 16 arrests and that one officer was injured overnight.

{CBS St. Louis affiliate KMOV-TV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/video/Rising-tensions-again-during-protest-at-Canfield-Dr-West-Florissant-271154271.html""> reports that the arrests included St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been chronicling the protests on social media. Police had said earlier they would not have arrest information until early Thursday.

The White House said President Obama - who is on vacation on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard - was briefed late Wednesday on the situation in Ferguson by Attorney General Eric Holder and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. Mr. Obama has another briefing scheduled for Thursday morning.

Residents in Ferguson have complained about what they called a heavy-handed police presence that began with the use of dogs for crowd control soon after Brown's shooting - a tactic that for some invoked the specter of civil rights protests a half-century ago.

County Police Chief Jon Belmar, though, said his officers have responded with ""an incredible amount of restraint,"" as they've been the targets of rocks, bottles and gunshots, with two dozen patrol vehicles being destroyed.

""It's pretty amazing how impressed I am and inspired by these officers,"" he said. ""This is a very difficult circumstance.""

Police had also asked earlier that people assemble in ""an organized and respectful"" manner and disperse before evening.

The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer involved in Brown's shooting, citing threats against that officer and others.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson called improving race relations ""the top priority right now"" but also said he won't be pressured into publicly identifying the officer - despite, he said, mounting demands from clergy, computer hackers and protesters.

Jackson said he welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon asked community members to be patient and calm while the investigation proceeds and urged law enforcement agencies to ""keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press.""

Jackson said the investigation remains weeks away from completion.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car.

The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it ""ricocheted"" back, apparently upsetting the officer.

Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.",445,1600,NA,NACBS,cbs5,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hit-by-poverty-ferguson-reflects-the-new-suburbs/,"Hit by poverty, Ferguson reflects the new suburbs",Constantine Von Hoffman,8/19/14,3/7/16,"
The violent confrontations between police and {citizens in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/outsiders-agitating-situation-in-ferguson-community-says/"">, Missouri, highlight the rapid demographic shift in the suburbs, which are now home to a majority of the nation's poor.

The nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas have seen dramatic growth in poverty in the suburbs that surround them, according to {the Brookings Institution}<hyperlink=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/concentrated-poverty#/M10420"">. The number of suburban neighborhoods where more than 20 percent of residents live below the federal poverty line more than doubled during the 2000s, the research organization found.

Not only did nearly every one of these areas see suburban poverty grow during that decade, but poverty also grew more concentrated in specific neighborhoods.

By 2012, 38 percent of poor residents in the suburbs lived in neighborhoods with poverty rates of 20 percent or higher, according to Brookings. For poor black residents, 53 percent lived in neighborhoods with poverty rates of 20 percent or higher.

""At the start of the 2000s, the five census tracts that fall within Ferguson's border registered poverty rates ranging between 4 and 16 percent,"" Brookings' analyst Elizabeth Kneebone {wrote in a recent blog post}<hyperlink=""http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/the-avenue/posts/2014/08/15-ferguson-suburban-poverty"">. ""However, by 2008-2012 almost all of Ferguson's neighborhoods had poverty rates at or above the {20 percent threshold}<hyperlink=""http://www.huduser.org/portal/periodicals/em/winter11/highlight2.html""> at which the negative effects of concentrated poverty begin to emerge.""

These effects include lack of access to jobs and health care, sub-standard schools and higher crime rates. ""We find that suburban poor neighborhoods are more likely to be organizationally deprived than urban poor neighborhoods, especially with respect to organizations that promote upward mobility,"" Alexandra Murphy of the University of Michigan's National Poverty Center wrote in a report last year.

Ferguson itself is emblematic of the impact of poverty on America's suburbs. The town's unemployment rate has more than doubled in recent years, from less than 5 percent in 2000 to over 13 percent in 2010-12. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2012 about one in four residents lived below the federal poverty line ($23,492 for a family of four), and 44 percent fell below twice that level. Ferguson's per capita income of $21,000 ranks it 88th out of Missouri's 140 cities, {according to BiggestUSCities.com}<hyperlink=""http://www.biggestuscities.com/demographics/mo/ferguson-city"">, while its median household income of $36,645 is the state's 103rd highest.

""For those [Ferguson] residents who were employed, inflation-adjusted average earnings fell by one-third,"" Kneebone said. ""The number of households using federal Housing Choice Vouchers climbed from roughly 300 in 2000 to more than 800 by the end of the decade.""

Concurrently with the rise in poverty has been a shift in the racial composition of many suburbs around the U.S. This change has frequently not been reflected in the leadership of those cities and towns.

The clashes in Ferguson came in the wake of the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, by a police officer. Both the town's government and police force are overwhelmingly white, while the city's population is 67 percent African-American.

According to a study by the {American Communities Project at American University}<hyperlink=""http://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/chinni.cfm"">, ""In 2000, the urban suburbs were 67 percent non-Hispanic white, 12 percent African American and 13 percent Hispanic. By 2012, the non-Hispanic white population had dropped to 59 percent , the African-American population had climbed to 13 percent and the Hispanic population was roughly 18 percent.""

Nationwide, the poor have lower participation rates in elections and this appears to be the case in Ferguson as well. While the city has about 15,000 residents 18 or older, only about 1,350 votes were cast in last April's mayoral election, in which Mayor James Knowles III ran unopposed. Furthermore, in the last city council election held in 2013 there were about 1,500 votes cast. In 2011, one city councilman won his seat with a grand total of 72 votes.",6,787,NA,NACBS,cbs6,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-and-michael-brown-5-things-you-need-to-know/,â€‹Ferguson and Michael Brown: 5 things you need to know,CBS/AP,8/16/14,3/7/16,"On Aug. 9, unarmed 18-year-old {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-{protests}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/civil-unrest-over-missouri-teens-shooting/"">/""> was shot and killed in Ferguson, Missouri by an officer police later identified as {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/ferguson-police-identify-officer-in-michael-brown-shooting/"">.

1. What happened leading up to the shooting

On the morning of Saturday, Aug. 9, Michael Brown and a friend were {suspected of stealing}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/darren-wilson-ferguson-police-officer-who-fatally-shot-michael-brown-identified/""> a $48.99 box of Swisher Sweets Cigars from Ferguson Market and Liquor, according to information police released later in the week.

{Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/darren-wilson-ferguson-police-officer-who-fatally-shot-michael-brown-identified/"">, 28, a white six-year veteran police officer, had been responding to a nearby call unrelated to the robbery, police said. Shortly after leaving the call, he encountered Michael Brown and a friend, Dorian Johnson, walking down a street. It was later revealed that Wilson did not know the teen was a robbery suspect at the time, but stopped Brown and Johnson because they were in the street.

According to police, one of the men pushed Wilson into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

According to Johnson, he and Brown were walking in the street when an officer ordered them onto the sidewalk, then grabbed Brown's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. Johnson said Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Johnson told reporters that after the first shots, Brown ""turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down, and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""

Johnson was identified in police reports as a suspect in the morning robbery. Police said they later determined that Johnson was not involved in the robbery and will not seek charges against him. (Brown's family, while not denying the 18-year-old's involvement in the robbery,

Ferguson is a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

2. What happened immediately after the shooting

The next day, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. That night, tensions boiled over and nearly three dozen people were arrested following a candlelight vigil when crowds burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted officers.

Multiple days of unrest followed, amid calls for calm by Ferguson city leaders. Police, in riot gear and armored tanks, responded to protesters with tear gas, smoke bombs, rubber bullets and ""bean bag"" rounds. Early Wednesday, a St. Louis County police officer shot and wounded a man who authorities said pulled a handgun on the officer.

Two reporters were {detained}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/egregious-assault-on-freedom-of-the-press-in-ferguson-missouri/""> by police for not clearing out quickly enough from a McDonald's where they were working near the protests. The two, who work for The Washington Post and The Huffington Post, were released without any charges. Both said they were assaulted but not seriously hurt. Police also fired tear gas at a news crew from Al Jazeera forcing them to run for cover.

Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began with the use of dogs for crowd control soon after Brown's shooting - a tactic that for some invoked the civil rights protests from a half-century ago.

3. How the nation responded

President Barack Obama on Thursday {spoke publicly}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-on-racial-tension-in-missouri-nows-the-time-for-healing/""> for the first time about Ferguson, saying there was ""no excuse"" for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.

Images of police outfitted in paramilitary gear clashing with protesters in suburban St. Louis have driven Congressional leaders from across the political spectrum to call for demilitarization of the domestic police force.

Attorney General Eric Holder said {he was concerned}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-g-holder-deeply-concerned-about-use-of-military-gear-in-ferguson/""> that use of military equipment by police in Ferguson was sending a ""conflicting message."" The response by law enforcement to protests ""must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them,"" Holder said.

Civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton have called for justice following the shooting. Sharpton called Thursday for the Justice Department to monitor Ferguson and the way police are handling the crisis.

The protests have also played out on {social media}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/is-social-media-fueling-tensions-in-ferguson-mo/"">, where hashtags have called attention to witness accounts that Brown had his hands up when he was shot (#HandsUpDontShoot) and media portrayals of minorities (#IfTheyGunnedMeDown).

After days of violent protests, and the widely criticized police response, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol, stripping local police from the St. Louis County Police Department of their authority.

4. How a change in tactics changed the tone

There was a {dramatic shift}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/protests-turn-almost-festive-in-ferguson-missouri/""> in the atmosphere after Gov. Jay Nixon assigned protest oversight to Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black and grew up near Ferguson. He marched alongside protesters Thursday, joined by other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol as well as the county department. The marchers also had a police escort.

County police in riot gear and armored tanks gave way to state troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of peaceful protesters. The protests Thursday took on a light, almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd, more akin to a parade or block party. The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell -the point at which previous protests have grown tense - no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.

5. What happens next

On Friday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson {identified}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/darren-wilson-ferguson-police-officer-who-fatally-shot-michael-brown-identified/""> the officer involved in Brown's shooting as Darren Wilson. For nearly a week, protesters had called for the officer's name to be released. Police had initially refused, citing concerns over the officer's safety.

Brown's relatives said no robbery would justify shooting the teen after he put his hands up. Police ""are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style"" killing, said Benjamin Crump, one of the Brown family's attorneys.

Johnson, the Highway Patrol captain appointed to oversee security in the St. Louis suburb, expressed frustration with the way Ferguson police released the information. He was not told about the store video.

Police and about 200 protesters {clashed late Friday}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-missouri-clashes-resume-over-michael-brown-police-shooting/"">. Just before midnight, some in what had been a large and rowdy but mostly well-behaved crowd broke into the same small store that Ferguson police suspected Brown of robbing and began looting it, Ron Johnson said.

Attorney General Eric Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed witnesses to the shooting.",50,1500,NA,NACBS,cbs7,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-dispatches-eric-holder-to-ferguson-in-wake-of-shooting/,Obama dispatches Eric Holder to Ferguson in wake of shooting,Rebecca Kaplan,8/18/14,3/7/16,"Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Ferguson, Mo., Wednesday, President Obama announced Monday, making him the first high-level U.S. official to visit the St. Louis suburb after more than a week of public outrage at the {death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">.

Holder will meet with FBI agents and Justice Department personnel conducting the federal criminal investigation into the shooting, as well as other community leaders ""whose support is so critical to bringing about peace and calm in Ferguson,"" the president told reporters.

On Monday, he received an update on the latest developments in Ferguson from Holder as well as a briefing from his national security team on {Iraq}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/iraq-crisis/"">.

Over the weekend, Holder ordered the Justice Department -- which is {looking into possible civil rights violations in the case}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-looking-into-possible-civil-rights-case-in-michael-brown-shooting/""> -- to arrange for an {additional autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://to%20arrange%20for%20an%20additional%20autopsy%20to%20be%20performed%20by%20a%20federal%20medical%20examiner/""> on Brown's body to be performed by a federal medical examiner.

The clashes between police and protesters in the St. Louis suburb have continued for more than a week as authorities have struggled to find a response that does not provoke more anger. Mr. Obama urged people to ""seek some understanding rather than simply holler at each other.""

""We have all seen images of protesters and law enforcement in the streets. It's clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting. What's also clear is that a small minority of individuals are not,"" he said.

""While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos. It undermines rather than advancing justice.""

""Let me also be clear that our constitutional rights to speak freely, to assemble and to report in the press must be vigilantly safeguarded especially in moments like these. There is no excuse for excessive force by police, or any action that denies people the right to protest peacefully,"" he added.

Over the weekend, Gov. Jay Nixon, D-Missouri, tried {nightly curfews}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-curfew-in-ferguson-missouri-extended-for-second-night-amid-unrest/""> to convince people to leave the streets, with limited success. He announced Monday that the {curfew would be lifted}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-ferguson-missouri-no-curfew-but-a-static-assembly-ban/""> but that there would be a ban on static assembly. He also {called up the state's National Guard}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-guard-called-out-in-ferguson-missouri/"">.

""Those are real emotions. People need to grieve and they need to speak, but we also need to keep the rule of law and peace, and I think we need to balance all three of those,"" Nixon {said in an interview}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-jay-nixon-ferguson-robbery-video-had-an-incendiary-effect/""> on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday.

During his press conference Monday, Mr. Obama declined to reflect on the specifics of the Ferguson case because of the ongoing Justice Department investigation but did reflect broadly on the issues that young black men can sometimes face.

""In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,"" the president said, noting that young African American and Hispanic boys often have much higher rates of school suspension, frequent interactions with the criminal justice system and even different treatment during trials and sentencing.

He talked about how initiatives like the {White House's ""My Brother's Keeper,""}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-launches-my-brothers-keeper-initiative/""> which looks at the best public and private efforts to connect young men with mentoring networks and to help them cultivate skills to get ahead, can help get young men on a better track.

""There are young black men that commit crime and we can argue about why that happens...but if they commit a crime then they need to be prosecuted because every community has an interest in public safety,"" Mr. Obama said. ""What is also true is that given the history of this country where we can make progress in building up more confidence, more trust, in making sure that our criminal justice system is acutely aware of the possibilities of disparity in treatment, there are safeguards in place to avoid those disparities, where training and assistance is provided to local law enforcement who may just need more information in order to avoid potential disparity, all those things can make a difference.""

The president also addressed the situation in Iraq during the news conference and announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with the help of the U.S., had taken a major step forward in retaking the Mosul dam which had been captured by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).",150,1600,NA,NACBS,cbs8,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-ferguson-missouri-no-curfew-but-a-static-assembly-ban/,"In Ferguson, Missouri, no curfew, but a ""static assembly"" ban",CBS/AP,8/18/14,3/7/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. - As the governor of Missouri announced he was lifting {a two-day-old overnight curfew}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-curfew-in-ferguson-missouri-extended-for-second-night-amid-unrest/""> for local residents, police in the St. Louis suburb where {a white officer fatally shot an unarmed black teen}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/""> are enforcing an order against static assembly.

Authorities have been seen Monday urging people to keep moving and avoid standing in one place. Journalists who gathered by midday at a burned-out convenience were also being dispersed.

Officers say the order is not meant to disperse the protesters but to keep people moving.

Officers say the order came from the Missouri State Highway Patrol, which has assumed command of crowd-control measures since the killing of Michael Brown sparked days of protests in the city.

A state of emergency has been in place since Saturday.

Gov. Jay Nixon also {called in the National Guard}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-guard-called-out-in-ferguson-missouri/""> Monday to help restore order against what he described as ""a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community.""

""The Guard's immediate and limited responsibilities ... are to provide protection, and ensure the safety of our Unified Command Center, which was the target last night of a coordinated attack,"" Nixon said in a statement.

Police used tear gas to clear protesters off the streets late Sunday, a week after demonstrations over the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, whose agency was put in charge of security in Ferguson by Nixon, told reporters early Monday that police had to respond after shots were fired at them and others and several locations were looted or vandalized, including a McDonald's where employees felt the need to lock themselves in a storage room for their safety.

Johnson said Molotov cocktails, bottles and other objects were thrown at police.

At least two injuries resulted from the gunshots, Johnson said, but no officers were hurt. Several people were arrested.

Johnson blamed the latest trouble on a small group of people intent on causing it.

The latest clashes in Ferguson saw another peaceful protest quickly deteriorate.

Three hours before a midnight curfew imposed by Nixon, officers in riot gear ordered all the demonstrators to disperse. Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until getting hit by tear gas.

Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the street near the QuikTrip convenience store that was burned down last week. It was an apparent attempt to block police vehicles, but the vehicles easily plowed through. Someone set a nearby trash bin on fire, and gunshots rang out several blocks away.

Within two hours, most people had been cleared off West Florissant Avenue, one of the community's main thoroughfares. The streets remained empty as the curfew began. It remained in effect until 5 a.m.

Much of {the anger shown by protesters}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-guard-called-out-in-ferguson-missouri/""> in Ferguson has been over what has been seen as a lack of openness by police about the Brown shooting.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. {Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-some-ferguson-missouri-residents-do-not-believe-cops-story/""> as the officer fired multiple rounds.

On Monday, the Brown family's attorneys released {the results of a private autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/preliminary-autopsy-shows-michael-brown-shot-six-times/""> that they paid to have conducted. The state of Missouri has also conducted an autopsy but hasn't revealed the results yet, and it was announced Sunday {the federal government will also be conducting its own autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-department-of-justice-orders-federal-autopsy/"">.

The private autopsy revealed that Brown had been shot at least 6 times, and a pathologist hired by the family said a bullet wound to his arm may have happened when he put his hands up, ""but we don't know.""

Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells said a graze wound on Brown's right arm could have occurred in several ways. He says the teen may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position.

The two likely kill shots against Brown hit him in the head, the pathologists said. One of the family's attorneys, Darryl Parks, said the fact that one of the kill shots hit him in the top of the head at a ""back-to-front"" trajectory means ""the officer should've been arrested.""

""Why would he have been shot in the very top of his head, a 6-foot-4 man? It doesn't make sense,"" Parks said.

Dr. Lawrence Koblinsky, a forensic science expert and a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, {told ""CBS This Morning""}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/michael-browns-family-releases-independent-autopsy-results/""> it was important to note where exactly Brown was first shot.

""It's my opinion that seeing four shots to the right arm was an indication to me that the police officer wanted to stop him,"" Koblinsky said.

However, Koblinsky added later that ""six shots is five shots too many,"" because officers should be better trained at stopping suspects without lethal force.",51,406,NA,NACBS,cbs9,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-protest-broken-up-after-curfew/,"More violence, unrest in Ferguson",AP,8/17/14,3/9/16,"FERGUSON, Missouri - Seven people were arrested and one person was shot early Sunday morning as police used smoke and tear gas against protesters who defied a curfew in a St. Louis suburb where{ a black teen walking down the street had been shot by a white police officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">.

The shooting ignited racial tension in the mostly-black suburb and has {led to looting and several run-ins between police and protesters}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-missouri-clashes-resume-over-michael-brown-police-shooting/"">.

Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said the timing of police action on Sunday was coincidental.

Police received a report that people broke into a barbecue restaurant and some were on the roof - creating a potential danger for officers trying to disperse the protesters. Police were responding to that report - not the fact that protesters were still on the street after curfew, Johnson said.

Things got worse when a man with a handgun went into the street as police were nearing the restaurant. He ran away, but there was plenty of violence. A man was shot and critically wounded in the same area. Police were searching for the shooter. Someone shot at a police car - it wasn't clear if it was hit.

Hundreds of other protesters left peacefully before the curfew took effect. But remaining protesters - chanting ""No justice! No curfew!"" - refused to leave the area.

As officers put on gas masks, a chant from the distant crowd emerged: ""We have the right to assemble peacefully."" A moment later, police began firing canisters into the crowd of protesters.

Highway Patrol Spokesman Lt. John Hotz initially said police only used smoke, but later told The Associated Press that they also fired tear gas canisters.

Jayson Ross, who was leading the protesters toward police before the canisters were fired, said: ""They got guns. We got guns. We are ready.""

Gov. Jay Nixon on Saturday declared a state of emergency in Ferguson. The curfew announcement came after tensions again flared in Ferguson late Friday night. Earlier that day, local police identified the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson and released documents and video footage alleging that Brown had robbed a convenience store just before he was shot. Police said Wilson was unaware Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Nixon said the U.S. Department of Justice is widening {its civil rights investigation of the shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-looking-into-possible-civil-rights-case-in-michael-brown-shooting/"">.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door in the neighborhood starting Saturday, talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting.

In announcing the curfew, Nixon said that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow looters to endanger the community.

Darrell Alexander, 57, worried Saturday night that the curfew might spur anger and more violence.

""I think it's an antagonistic decision to not allow people to express their freedom of speech. It's an overreaction,"" he said.

Members of various black community groups were urging people to abide by the curfew, which runs from midnight to 5 a.m. Sunday, reports {CBS affiliate KMOV-TV in St. Louis}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Police-launch-tear-gas-to-disperse-protesters-for-violating-state-curfew-271559111.html"">. A woman from the New Black Panther Party walked the street with a bullhorn, telling the crowd: ""Please, please be out of the area by 12 o'clock.""

Some responded to her pleas by cursing at police, while others acknowledged they planned to leave before midnight.

But Keyon Watkins, a 26-year-old computer science worker from St. Louis, said that if many others stay in the street, he would join them.

""All of this is just building up -- pent-up aggression by being mistreated on a daily basis,"" Watkins said.

On Saturday, some residents said it appeared the violent acts were being committed by people who came from other suburbs or states.

Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, is a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, the local police chief has said.

The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson's whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting.

As times go on and crowds get bigger, Tatman says it gets harder to tell who is who.

""I can't tell if they're from this community or not because all of them have been down here since day one,"" she said. ""What I try and do is go and diffuse.""

But there are moments of reconciliation.

""If nothing else, you have that one or two you try to encourage, to plant a see that what you're doing is wrong,"" Tatman said. ""I had a young man tell me after we dialogued, with his hands full of merchandise.

Holder, Mr. Obama said, will meet with the Justice Department personnel and FBI agents conducting a federal criminal investigation into Brown's death. Holder will also meet with other community leaders whose ""support is so critical to bringing about peace and calm in Ferguson,"" Mr. Obama said.

What Mr. Obama did not say on Monday was whether or not he will head to Ferguson himself, as protesters and {pundits }<hyperlink=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-18/why-barack-obama-should-go-to-ferguson"">alike have called for. For now, after two days back at the White House, Mr. Obama returns Tuesday to Martha's Vineyard, where his family has been vacationing for more than a week.

Mr. Obama assured reporters that he remains ""personally committed"" to working on the problems spotlighted by Brown's death and the subsequent unrest in Ferguson, including racial inequities in the justice system and concern over militarized police forces. Broaching those issues, the president noted from the White House briefing room, is ""a big project. It's one that we've been trying to carry out now for a couple of centuries.""

It's certainly the case that Mr. Obama has been asked to address problems that will take time to solve, and a few extra days on Martha's Vineyard may not be that detrimental to those efforts. At the same time, some argue the president shouldn't underestimate the importance of symbolic imagery. Returning to the White House this week, or even traveling to Ferguson, could potentially move forward the nation's stuttering conversation about issues like race and justice. At the very least, it would eliminate the dissonant imagery of a president who's vacationing while Ferguson residents keep protesting.

""As far as substance goes, he's the president of the United States wherever he is... The president can be {fully in command}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/presidential-vacations-can-be-anything-but/""> from any place on the planet,"" John Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College, told CBS News. ""The issue here is symbolism... He has to be alert to appearances. Perhaps coming back to the White House would be a prudent step.""

Making symbolic gestures is about more than simply creating good optics, political experts say: it's about conveying one's priorities to the public.

""He will ultimately be judged on results, but as President Bush found after Katrina, sometimes the images can be hurtful,"" Pitney said, referring to President George W. Bush's much-maligned decision to fly over the hurricane damage in 2005 rather than stopping in the New Orleans area. ""The iconic image of Bush looking out from Air Force One, that didn't look good.""

By contrast, one of the rare instances in which Mr. Bush cut short a vacation at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, came in 2005 when he {flew back to Washington, D.C.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/21/politics/21bush.html""> to sign a bill to restore Terri Schiavo's feeding tube.

Mr. Bush ""had an issue he cared about, and it was part of a national conversation,"" American University professor Leonard Steinhorn, an expert on the presidency, told CBS News. ""It was important to get people talking.""

Deciding when to take that sort of symbolic step can be a tight wire to talk, Steinhorn said. Still, the events in Ferguson have clearly become a national issue.

""It's been a national issue for decades, the relationship between African-Americans and law enforcement, and it continues to be an issue, not just in Ferguson but everywhere in our country,"" Steinhorn said. ""It would be helpful for him to broaden out the perspective and become a bit of an educator-in-chief to help us understand better the dynamics of what's going on.""

In 2006,{ Mr. Obama said}<hyperlink=""http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/18/obama-in-2006-as-president-vacations-leisure-is-gone/""> that presidents should sacrifice vacation time to focus on governing the nation.

""Essentially the bargain that any president, I think, strikes with the American people is: 'you give me this office and in turn my fears, doubts, insecurities, foibles, need for sleep, family life, vacations, leisure is gone. I am giving myself to you,'"" he said in an interview with C-SPAN. ""And the American people should have no patience for whatever is going through your head because you've got a job to do.""

Meanwhile, as the first African-American president, Mr. Obama is uniquely suited to address the Ferguson events, Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

""This president knows better than most what happens in poor communities that have been antagonized historically by the hostile relationship between black people and the police department,"" Dyson said.

""It is not enough for him to come on national television and pretend there is a false moral equivalency between police people who are armed and black people who are vulnerable constantly to this. He needs to use his bully pulpit to step up and articulate this as a vision.""

Even so, the White House seemed unconcerned about the symbolism of the president's whereabouts on Wednesday night. Mr. Obama, the first lady, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were at a birthday party at a Martha's Vineyard golf club that evening. A little after 10 p.m. that night, the White House released a readout of the event that said, ""The menu consisted of surf and turf and pasta. The Obamas danced nearly every song. A good time was had by all.""

At the same time that evening, police decked out in combat gear were confronting protesters in Ferguson.

When asked on Monday whether he would travel to Ferguson, Mr. Obama responded thoughtfully but cautiously.

""Obviously, we've seen events in which there's a big gulf between community perceptions and law enforcement perceptions around the country,"" he said. ""This is not something new. It's always tragic when it involves the death of someone so young. I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed... I've got to make sure that I don't look like I'm putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other.""

The president pointed to his ""{My Brother's Keeper}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-launches-my-brothers-keeper-initiative/"">"" initiative as evidence of his long-term commitment to improving racial equity in the U.S.

Steinhorn said it's likely the president is taking a cautious approach to the Ferguson events because of the blowback he received for speaking plainly about other controversies involving race.

In 2009, Mr. Obama said that the Cambridge, Massachusetts police {acted ""stupidly""}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5181436-503544.html""> when they arrested Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., who is African-American, in his own home. The president used the incident to talk about the history of racial discrimination by law enforcement in the U.S.

The story of Mr. Obama's remarks exploded, and to tamp down the polarized nature of the national discussion, the president proposed a ""beer summit"" at the White House with Gates and the officer who arrested him, Cambridge police sergeant James Crowley.

""There's a lot that [Obama] could do, but I think he may have been somewhat burned by the reaction to the Gates incident,"" Steinhorn said. ""But he should be unbowed, because this is an incident that's not just located in Ferguson, Missouri -- it's located in American conscience and American history.

""Until we get the leadership to come to terms with it, this poor young man, or Trayvon Martin, or countless before them, will be victims of our inability to do so.""",49,1400,NA,NACBS,cbs12,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/missouri-state-troopers-to-take-over-security-in-ferguson-missouri/,"Missouri state troopers to take over security in Ferguson, Missouri",CBS/AP,8/14/14,3/9/16,"FLORISSANT, Mo. - The Missouri State Highway Patrol will take over the supervision of security in the St. Louis suburb that's been the scene of violent protests since a police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager, the governor announced Wednesday.

Gov. Jay Nixon said security will be overseen by Capt. Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol. Johnson, who is black, said he grew up in the community and ""it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence.""

""Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,"" Nixon said at a news conference.

On Thursday evening, hundreds of people protesting the death of Michael Brown were marching peacefully through the streets of Ferguson alongside state troopers.

Several marchers stopped to shake hands with police and troopers. Some people have stopped to hug and chat with Johnson.

The scene stands in stark contrast clashes earlier this week when officers wore riot gear. Crowds have gathered since Saturday's shooting of 18-year-old Brown.

Prior to the change in command, police defended the use of tear gas and smoke bombs to repel demonstrators after another night of chaos. But the police response has drawn heavy criticism.

Johnson said that he would be in Ferguson Thursday night and meet people at the Quik Trip gas station that was burned by vandals days ago and has now become a ""ground zero"" of sorts in the community.

""We are going to have a different approach,"" he said. ""We're going to have the approach that we're in this together.""

Earlier, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he was ""deeply concerned"" over acts of violence by the public and heavy-handedness by police.

""The law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them,"" he said.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said officers on Wednesday night tossed tear gas to disperse a large crowd of protesters after some threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers. More than 10 people were arrested in Ferguson.

""In talking to these guys, it is scary,"" Schellman said of officers on the front lines of the protest. ""They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.""

President Barack Obama also appealed for ""peace and calm"" on the streets.

""I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,"" Obama said. ""But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.""

Capitol Hill legislators are also responding to the situation in Ferguson.

Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson, is planning to introduce legislature that would restrict a Defense Department program which give free surplus military equipment to local law enforcement.

""Militarizing America's main streets won't make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent,"" Johnson told the Associated Press.

In other developments, the Twitter account of hacker group Anonymous was suspended Thursday. The account had been used to post the what the group claimed was the name and other personal information of the police officer involved in the weekend shooting.

Twitter's code of conduct strictly forbids the publication of private and confidential information without permission.After the account was suspended, a secondary account announced that the group won't be releasing any more information, for now.

One of the primary sticking points with protesters in Ferguson was a demand to release the name of the officer who shot and killed Brown.",36,517,NA,NACBS,cbs13,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-guard-called-out-in-ferguson-missouri/," National Guard called out in Ferguson, Missouri",CBS/AP,8/18/14,3/9/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. -- Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has called out the National Guard after another night of trouble in Ferguson, Missouri, and the first guard members were showing up on the city's streets early Monday.

Police used tear gas to clear protesters off the streets late Sunday, a week after demonstrations over {the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/""> filled the St. Louis suburb with angry, defiant crowds.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, whose agency was put in charge of security in Ferguson by Nixon, told reporters early Monday that police had to respond after shots were fired at them and others and several locations were looted or vandalized, including a McDonald's where employees felt the need to lock themselves in a storage room for their safety.

Johnson said Molotov cocktails, bottles and other objects were thrown at police.

At least two injuries resulted from the gunshots, Johnson said, but no officers were hurt. Several people were arrested.

Johnson blamed the latest trouble on a small group of people intent on causing it.

The latest clashes in Ferguson saw another peaceful protest quickly deteriorate.

Three hours before a midnight curfew imposed by Nixon, officers in riot gear ordered all the demonstrators to disperse. Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until getting hit by tear gas.

Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the street near the QuikTrip convenience store that was burned down last week. It was an apparent attempt to block police vehicles, but the vehicles easily plowed through. Someone set a nearby trash bin on fire, and gunshots rang out several blocks away.

Within two hours, most people had been cleared off West Florissant Avenue, one of the community's main thoroughfares. The streets remained empty as the curfew began. It remained in effect until 5 a.m.

{CBS St. Louis affiliate KMOV-TV reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/video/Tear-gas-deployed-against-protesters-in-Ferguson-ahead-of-midnight-curfew-271618921.html""> police also used sound-blasting technology to disperse the crowds.

Nixon's office announced early Monday that, ""A day of hope, prayers, and peaceful protests was marred by the violent criminal acts of an organized and growing number of individuals, many from outside the community and state, whose actions are putting the residents and businesses of Ferguson at risk. ... Given these deliberate, coordinated and intensifying violent attacks on lives and property in Ferguson, I am directing the highly capable men and women of the Missouri National Guard to assist ... in restoring peace and order to this community.""

There was no immediate indication of how many guard personnel would be involved.

The local school district announced early Monday that the opening of the school year, already postponed several times, was again being put off. The latest opening date had been Monday but, the district said, schools would remain shut ""due to continuing unrest in some areas of Ferguson, and in the interest of the safety of students and families."" No new opening date was announced.

The latest confrontations came hours after u.s. Attorney General Eric Holder {ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-department-of-justice-orders-federal-autopsy/""> on Brown, 18.

The ""extraordinary circumstances"" surrounding Brown's death and a request by Brown's family members prompted the Justice Department's decision to conduct a third autopsy, agency spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.

The examination was to take place as soon as possible, Fallon said.

The results of a state-performed autopsy would be taken into account along with the federal examination in the Justice Department investigation, Fallon said.

A {preliminary private autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/preliminary-autopsy-shows-michael-brown-shot-six-times/""> found that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

The two pathologists hired by the Brown family's attorney to conduct the private autopsy -- Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, and professor Shawn Parcells, a pathologist from Kansas -- said that one of the bullets entered the top of Brown's skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when he suffered a fatal injury.

Parcells said a bullet wound to his arm may have happened when he put his hands up, ""but we don't know.""

Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells said a graze wound on Brown's right arm could have occurred in several ways. He says the teen may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position.

The two pathologists said the reason for there appearing to be more than six wounds on Brown's body is that at least two of the bullets apparently caused multiple entry wounds.

The two likely kill shots against Brown hit him in the head, the pathologists said. One of the family's attorneys, Darryl Parks, said the fact that one of the kill shots hit him in the top of the head at a ""back-to-front"" trajectory means ""the officer should've been arrested.""

""Why would he have been shot in the very top of his head, a 6-foot-4 man? It doesn't make sense,"" Parks said.

Dr. Lawrence Koblinsky, a forensic science expert and a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told ""CBS This Morning"" that probably the most important detail from the release is that Brown was shot entirely in the front of his body.

""That is, {the story of the eyewitness, the friend of Michael Brown, Dorian Johnson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-some-ferguson-missouri-residents-do-not-believe-cops-story/"">, was that he had been running away from the vehicle and a shot was fired. That apparently is false. He was not shot in the back,"" Koblinsky said.

The forensic scientist also said it is important to note where exactly Brown was first shot.

""It's my opinion that seeing four shots to the right arm was an indication to me that the police officer wanted to stop him,"" Koblinsky said.

However, Koblinsky added later that ""six shots is five shots too many,"" because officers should be better trained at stopping suspects without lethal force.

The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation into the shooting. A day earlier, officials said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson neighborhood where Brown was shot to death Aug. 9.

A federally conducted autopsy ""more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises"" might help that investigation, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami's U.S. attorney's office. The move is ""not that unusual,"" he added.

Federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case, Weinstein said.

Earlier on Sunday, Johnson said he had met with members of Brown's family and the experience ""brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart.""

""When this is over,"" he told the crowd at a rally held at a local church, ""I'm going to go in my son's room. My black son, who wears his pants sagging, who wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, but that's my baby.""

Johnson added: ""We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael's going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.""

The Rev. Al Sharpton told the rally Brown's death was a ""defining moment for this country.""

Sharpton said he wants Congress to stop programs that provide military-style weaponry to police departments. He said he expects police to ""smear"" the slain teenager, his family and his attorneys. He also condemned the recent violence and looting in Ferguson.

The protests have been going on since Brown's death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting the governor's move to put the state highway patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents and a video alleging Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before he was killed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a robbery suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Nixon said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" that he was not aware the police were going to release the surveillance video from the store where Brown is alleged to have stolen a $49 box of cigars.

""It's appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,"" Nixon said.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

""When you're exhausted, when you're out of resources, when you're out of ammunition, you surrender,"" Brown's uncle, pastor Charles Ewing, told worshippers during a Sunday sermon at Jennings Mason Temple in Ferguson. ""He surrendered and yet he died.""

The officer who shot Brown has been identified as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting, and the department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Also Sunday, about 150 people gathered in St. Louis to show support for Wilson. The crowd protested outside a TV station because it had broadcast from in front of the officer's home.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the station, KSDK, later apologized. Others in the group, composed mostly of police and relatives of officers, carried signs urging people to wait for all the facts.",288,5600,NA,NACBS,cbs14,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-missouri-highlights-deep-national-mistrust-of-police-by-minorities/,"Deep national mistrust of police by minorities exposed in Ferguson, Missouri",CBS/AP,8/19/14,4/7/16,"WASHINGTON - For one night, all was well in Ferguson, Missouri.

A day later, Ferguson police, under pressure to disclose Wilson's name, also revealed that Brown was suspected of stealing cigars from a local store before his deadly encounter with Wilson. That announcement was met with disbelief and anger by residents and officials alike, who said local police were trying to smear Brown's name to justify his shooting.

Right after the video's release, {the streets of Ferguson exploded anew}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-missouri-clashes-resume-over-michael-brown-police-shooting/"">.

Brown's death is the latest illustration of deep divisions between minorities and police that have simmered for generations. Concern about the wariness playing out in Ferguson has coursed {all the way up to the White House}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/reacting-to-ferguson-a-vacationing-obama-keeps-his-distance/"">. President Barack Obama said {Attorney General Eric Holder would go to Missouri this week}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-dispatches-eric-holder-to-ferguson-in-wake-of-shooting/""> to check on the independent federal investigation into Brown's death.

""In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,"" the president said.

Mr. Obama has been forced to comment several times on that mistrust throughout his presidency. Famously, in 2009, he {said that a Cambridge, Massachusetts, police officer acted ""stupidly""}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-cops-acted-stupidly-in-professors-arrest/""> when they arrested Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., who is black, in his own home. The president used the incident to talk about the history of racial discrimination by law enforcement in the U.S.

The story of Mr. Obama's remarks exploded, and to tamp down the polarized nature of the national discussion, the president proposed {a ""beer summit""}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/white-house-brew-crew/""> at the White House with Gates and the officer who arrested him, Cambridge police sergeant James Crowley.

The depth of this distrust {becomes obvious in polling}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/response-to-ferguson-shooting-divided-on-racial-lines-study-finds/"">. While the unrest was occurring in Missouri, almost two-thirds of blacks - 65 percent - surveyed by the Pew Research Center said police went too far in their response to the Ferguson protests, while one-third of whites agreed and nearly another third said the police response has been about right. The Pew survey was conducted Aug. 14-17.

Gallup polling between 2012 and 2014 showed that a majority of blacks, or 64 percent, had only some, very little or no confidence in the police, while the majority of the whites questioned, or 58 percent, had either a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. Between 2009 and 2011, Gallup found 61 percent of blacks only had partial or no confidence in police, while 62 percent of whites had a lot of confidence in the police.

A factor that breeds {distrust}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/background-of-prosecutor-in-ferguson-case-has-some-suspicious-of-bias/""> is racial disparities between police and the communities they serve. Ferguson is nearly 70 percent black, while the police department is more than 90 percent white.

Distrust is also fueled by a perception of unchecked police violence through the ages: the 1992 acquittal of four white Los Angeles police officers in {the beating of black motorist Rodney King}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rodney-king-beating-fbi-releases-files-documenting-early-investigation/"">; the 1967 beating in Newark, New Jersey, of {cab driver John Smith}<hyperlink=""http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19670721,00.html"">; Miami in 1980, after the acquittal of six white police officers in the beating death of black motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie; Cincinnati in 2001 after 19-year-old {Timothy Thomas}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/protests-mark-cincinnati-anniversary/""> was shot and killed by a police officer. Rioting followed each of these cases.

""More African-Americans and Latinos believe police stop people without due cause, use excessive force and engage in verbal abuse than white Americans,"" said Ronald Weitzer, a George Washington University sociology professor who has studied race and policing in the U.S. and internationally. ""So they not only tend to see the police as having some racial biases, but also in their day-to-day activities behaving in ways that are more obtrusive and maybe unjustified in dealing with citizens.""

Brown was shot multiple times by Wilson on Aug. 9.

He ordered his officers to abandon the body armor and gas masks and instead ensure the public's right to peaceably assemble.

But things escalated again Aug. 15, after {Ferguson police released Wilson's name}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/ferguson-police-identify-officer-in-michael-brown-shooting/""> along with {video they said showed Brown robbing a store}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/ferguson-police-release-surveillance-video-related-to-michael-brown-shooting/""> shortly before he was killed. Brown's family condemned the revelation, with lawyer Anthony Gray calling it a ""sideshow.""

Weitzer described several different forms of police behavior that breed distrust, particularly among black and Latino males. That included unwarranted stops of individuals on the street by police, such as New York police's highly-criticized ""{stop-and-frisk}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bratton-miller-on-stop-and-frisk-and-job-qualifications/"">"" tactic, he said.

That particular tactic has come under renewed public criticism after {a black man on Staten Island died following being put in a chokehold by a white officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nypd-chokehold-arrest-of-eric-garner-to-go-to-grand-jury/""> while being arrested him for selling cigarettes illegally.

Although the St. Louis County medical examiner has conducted an autopsy, Brown's family ordered their own. It {found that Brown had been shot at least six times}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/preliminary-autopsy-shows-michael-brown-shot-six-times/"">, twice in the head.

Without directly referencing the video revelation, Holder said he was troubled by ""the selective release of sensitive information"" surrounding Brown's case, and said his agency would preserve the integrity of its investigation, ""no matter how others pursue their own separate inquiries.""

""This is a critical step in restoring trust between law enforcement and the community, not just in Ferguson, but beyond,"" Holder said.",69,2100,NA,NACBS,cbs15,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/key-questions-about-the-national-guard-in-ferguson/,Key questions about the National Guard in Ferguson,CBS NEWS,8/18/14,4/8/16,"Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon {deployed}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-guard-called-out-in-ferguson-missouri/""> his state's National Guard after a week of unrest in {Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">, following the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer. The use of the reserve military force to quell civil unrest is not unprecedented, but it does signal a new level in the crisis gripping the St. Louis suburb.

Here's the latest on key questions regarding the deployment:

Who are they?

There are about 11,000 Guard members in Missouri. Only about 80 have arrived in Ferguson so far. CBS News' Vladimir Duthiers reports that most are military police.

Who will command the troops?

The Missouri National Guard answers to the state's commander-in-chief, Gov. Jay Nixon, but it can also be mobilized under federal authority. In his {statement}<hyperlink=""https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/following-coordinated-attacks-civilians-and-law-enforcement-governor-nixon-signs"">, the governor said he is directing Guard troops to assist Col. Ron Replogle, the superintendent of Missouri's State Highway Patrol, which {took over security}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/missouri-state-troopers-to-take-over-security-in-ferguson-missouri/""> in Ferguson at the governor's request last week.

Overseeing Guard operations on the ground, according to a {follow-up statement}<hyperlink=""https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/statement-gov-nixon-regarding-ongoing-situation-ferguson-and-role-national-guard""> by Nixon, will be Missouri National Guard Brigadier General Gregory Mason, under the overall command of the Missouri State Highway Patrol.

""We're always in support, never in the lead domestically. We take orders from the lead law enforcement agency on the scene,"" Rick Breitenfeldt, a spokesman at the Guard's national headquarters, to the Associated Press.

If federalized, the National Guard then answers to the federal government.

Nixon reportedly deployed the Guard without letting President Obama know first. Mr. Obama said Monday that he will be monitoring the situation in coming days to see whether the National Guard's involvement is helping or hurting. The president also said he told Nixon that the use of the National Guard should be limited in scope.

What's the mission?

In a statement released later Monday, Gov. Nixon described the Missouri National Guard's mission ""limited in scope."" While he did not say how long the troops will be deployed, he said their ""immediate and limited responsibilities ... are to provide protection, and ensure the safety"" of the Unified Command Center authorities have set up in Ferguson. According to Nixon, that base was the target Sunday night of a ""coordinated attack.""

""The guard will concentrate its resources on carrying out this limited mission,"" Nixon said in his statement.

How often is the National Guard deployed domestically?

According to Donald Goldstein, a military historian, it is not unusual for governors to call upon their state's National Guard troops to assist in times of emergency. ""This is by far not the first time,"" he told CBS News.

Hawaii's Guard was called in just last week to provide security and prevent looting after Tropical Storm Iselle hit the Big Island. This summer, Texas Gov. Rick Perry called up {1,000 Texas National Guard troops}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gov-rick-perry-deploying-up-to-1000-national-guard-troops-to-border/""> to assist in securing his state's border with Mexico. Thousands of National Guard troops were called in for disaster relief following Katrina. According to the Associated Press, the Guard said that it responded to 28 wildfires, 14 floods, 10 winter storms, three hurricanes, a tornado and a tropical storm during fiscal year 2013.

Last year, Gov. Nixon {ordered}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-national-guard-to-help-with-flooding/article_8927e422-7882-5eae-8acd-27ce6fbf563b.html""> members of the Missouri National Guard to assist in areas of the state hit by flash floods.

The last time the National Guard was called up for this type of situation was the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, in which 11,000 members of the California Guard were mobilized following the acquittal of police officers charged with severely beating Rodney King.

National Guard troops were also deployed to deliver mail during the 1970 New York City Postal Strike, and to restore order in the riots following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. The California Army National Guard was called in during the Watts Riots in 1965. In 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent federal troops to Arkansas, and {federalized}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0925.html""> the Arkansas National Guard to allow nine black students to attend Central High School in Little Rock.

Officials say the officer was attacked, but CBS News' Julian Johnson reports many in the community are not satisfied with that explanation.

Angry protesters marched to the front door of the Ferguson, Mo., police department demanding answers one day after Michael Brown was shot and killed.

Police say the fatal shooting happened when the officer encountered two men on a street Saturday afternoon. They say one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and there was a struggle over the officer's gun.

""There was at least one shot fired within the car after that the office came back out of the car,"". said St. Louis County Police Chief John Belmar. ""He exited...his vehicle and there was a shooting that occurred where the officer shot the subject.""

Dorian Johnson said he was with Michael Brown, and he gave a different account. Johnson said the officer pulled up next to the two teens and exchanged words with them before choking Brown and trying to pull him into the squad car. The officer, he said, then exited his car, fired a shot and chased after Brown, who was running for his life.

""We wasn't causing no harm to nobody [sic],"" Johnson said. ""We had no weapons on us at all.

Tear gas was being fired at crowds as police stood in the streets holding shields at crowds chanting ""don't shoot"" while holding up their arms, which has become a symbol of protest in the police shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Demonstrators threw rocks at police and kicked tear gas canisters back at them.

No word of injuries of arrests yet.

Crowds holding picket signs were running through the streets, while others retreated from the police. Residents were told to clear the area by police. It was unclear what set the activity off, but it was similar to what happened Saturday night when police fired tear gas at demonstrators then.

Police attempted to push the demonstrators back by firing tear gas, shouting over a bullhorn that the protest was no longer peaceful, the Associated Press reported. Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley.

The development comes hours after a rally in support of Brown's family took place in Ferguson where Rev. Al Sharpton, Martin Luther King III and others criticized the release of a video that police believe showed Brown involved in a strongarm robbery at a convenience store near the street where he was shot.

The curfew, imposed by Gov. Jay Nixon, {was extended to a second night}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-curfew-in-ferguson-missouri-extended-for-second-night-amid-unrest/""> and extends from midnight to 5 a.m. Authorities had discussed extending it further depending on how Sunday night progressed.

Earlier Sunday, Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on Brown's body due to the ""extraordinary circumstances"" surrounding his death.

""This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,"" Department of Justice spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement. ""Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.""",53,1100,NA,NACBS,cbs18,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-curfew-in-ferguson-missouri-extended-for-second-night-amid-unrest/,"Curfew in Ferguson, Missouri, extended for second night amid unrest",CBS NEWS,8/17/14,4/8/16,"Clashes between demonstrators and police have led Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to extend the curfew imposed under his declared state of emergency in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson through Sunday night and into Monday morning, officials said.

Protesters have repeatedly taken to the streets upset over {the shooting of Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">, an unarmed black teen gunned down by a white police officer.

According to authorities, the purpose of the curfew is to protect the residents of Ferguson, but many residents said Saturday they had no intention of obeying the orders of the governor, reports {CBS affiliate KMOV in St. Louis}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Ferguson-curfew-remains-in-effect-for-Monday-morning-271603361.html"">.

Saturday night, many people defied the curfew, and {police used tear gas and smoke bombs}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-protest-broken-up-after-curfew/""> to push back crowds.

The curfew runs from midnight to 5 a.m. Monday. Authorities say the curfew imposed on Saturday night might have helped to quell some of the violence that erupted previously, and led to fewer protesters.

Seven people were arrested and one person was shot early Sunday morning, although not by police.

Nixon said that releasing a video that police believe showed Brown involved in a strongarm robbery at a convenience store near the street where he was shot only heightened tensions.

""I think it had an incendiary effect,"" Nixon said in {an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-jay-nixon-ferguson-robbery-video-had-an-incendiary-effect/"">

""When you release pictures and you clearly are attempting to besmirch a victim of a shooting,"" he said. ""There was a lot of folks that were concerned about that, and I do think it flamed it back up and has caused us to have to deal with some of that.""

Meanwhile, peaceful demonstrations continued through Sunday afternoon in Ferguson as a rally in support of the family of Michael Brown, who was killed on Aug. 9. The rally, led by Rev. Al Sharpton, was attended by Brown's family. His mother, Lesley McSpadden, appeared on stage at the rally, but did not speak to the audience.

Several activists did appear on the stage, however, including Martin Luther King III, son of the slain civil rights leader, who demanded that St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch recuse himself from the case because he has ""demonstrated bias.""

He joined others surrounding the case in a call for a special prosecutor to take over the case. The Justice Department {announced earlier that it would be conducting its own autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-department-of-justice-orders-federal-autopsy/"">.

King, Sharpton and others belief that {the video released Friday}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/ferguson-police-release-surveillance-video-related-to-michael-brown-shooting/""> was a diversionary tactic on the part of the Ferguson Police Department.

Benjamin Crump, the Brown family attorney, said to the crowd that the community deserves transparency.

""There is nothing that can justify the execution style murder of Lesley's son in broad daylight by this police officer,"" said Crump.",225,1600,NA,NACBS,cbs19,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/protests-turn-almost-festive-in-ferguson-missouri/,"Protests turn almost festive in Ferguson, Missouri",CBS NEWS,8/15/14,4/8/16,"Last Updated Aug 15, 2014 7:05 AM EDT

FERGUSON, Mo. -- County police in riot gear and armored tanks gave way to state troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of protesters as the St. Louis suburb where an {unarmed black teen was shot by a city police officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/angry-crowd-gathers-after-missouri-police-shoot-teen/""> overwhelmingly avoided violence Thursday after nearly a week of unrest and mounting public tension.

The dramatic shift came after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon {assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/missouri-state-troopers-to-take-over-security-in-ferguson-missouri"">, stripping local police from the St. Louis County Police Department of their authority after four days of clashes with furious crowds protesting the weekend death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

""All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,"" said Pedro Smith, 41, who has participated in the nightly protests. ""This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect.""

In St. Louis, Brown's mother appeared briefly Thursday night at an anti-brutality gathering near the city's Gateway Arch, urging through a relative for peace to prevail. The observance was among {dozens staged nationwide}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/demonstrators-nationwide-show-solidarity-after-ferguson-shooting/"">, each with a minute of silence for Brown and others affected by alleged police brutality.

The more tolerant response to protests in Ferguson came as {President Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-on-racial-tension-in-missouri-nows-the-time-for-healing/""> - and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is almost 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

Mr. Obama said there was ""no excuse"" for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters. He made the remarks in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, where he is on vacation.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is promising Brown's family a full, independent civil rights investigation, The Associated Press reports.

Holder's promise came Thursday in a telephone. A law enforcement official tells The AP that Holder spoke to the Brown family while they visited the U.S. attorney's office in Missouri.

The official was not authorized to be identified by name and requested anonymity to discuss Holder's call.

Holder expressed his personal condolences for Brown's death, and told his family that the Justice Department was investigating.

Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed witnesses to the shooting.

{Holder emphasized Thursday that the events unfolding in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-g-holder-deeply-concerned-about-use-of-military-gear-in-ferguson/""> ""cannot continue,"" and condemned acts of violence by the public as well as heavy-handedness by law enforcement.

""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" Holder said.

Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening in the neighborhood where looters had smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and where police had repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

But the latest protests had a light, almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd, more akin to a parade or block party. The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell -- the point at which previous protests had grown tense -- no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.

""You can feel it. You can see it,"" demonstrator Cleo Willis said of the change. ""Now it's up to us to ride that feeling.""

No arrests were reported,{ CBS St. Louis affiliate KMOV-TV says}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Mo-Highway-Patrol-Captain-Ron-Johnson-received-well-by-protesters-271334181.html"">.

Nixon appointed Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, to lead the police effort. Johnson, who grew up near Ferguson and commands a region that includes St. Louis County, marched alongside protesters Thursday, joined by other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol as well as the county department. The marchers also had a police escort.

""We're here to serve and protect,"" Johnson said. ""We're not here to instill fear.""

Several people stopped to shake hands and even hug Johnson and other officers, thanking them by name. At one point, Johnson spoke to several young men wearing red bandanas around their necks and faces. After the discussion, one of the men reached out and embraced him.

At the QuikTrip, children drew on the ground with chalk and people left messages about Brown.

Mr. Obama had appealed for ""peace and calm"" on the streets.

""I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,"" the president said. ""But let's remember that we're all part of one American family.""

Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control -- a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police had taken over the investigation of Brown's shooting and security at the request of the smaller city.

Nixon vowed that ""Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it."" The governor was joined at a news conference by the white mayor of St. Louis and the region's four state representatives and the county executive, all of whom are black.

Like {last year's shooting of Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""/feature/george-zimmerman-trial-trayvon-martin-case/"">, social media brought international attention to the tragedy. Ferguson spawned a proliferation of hashtags and has been a dominant subject on Twitter, Facebook and other sites. Journalists and protesters offered real-time pictures, videos and updates, and the world responded.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown, has told a much different story. He has said the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, told The Associated Press federal authorities have interviewed Johnson.",62,9600,NA,NACBS,cbs20,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shoooting-nelly-boogie-d-join-ferguson-protests/,"Nelly, local DJs join push for calm in Ferguson, Missouri",CBS NEWS,8/19/14,4/8/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. - Days after the shooting death of teenager {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">, the National Guard is in Ferguson.

The chaos erupted despite calls by community members to restore peace, CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann reports.

Nearly 100 ministers marched the Ferguson streets Monday night with the hope of leading a path to peace.

""Our goal is to speak some calmness to take some of the heat out of this situation and to encourage people to wait while the wheels of justice move,"" said Bishop Edwin Bass of the Empowered Church.

One woman armed demonstrators with roses to honor Brown.

""Something to lighten up, you know, make everybody smile out here, don't be so mad and angry,"" said local resident Ebony.

And with Ferguson perched on a national stage, rapper and St. Louis native Nelly urged the crowd to stand up but not feed into stereotypes.

""To show them who they think we are, that's working backwards,"" Nelly said.

The call for calm can be heard from the streets to the airwaves.

""All we want is peace in our streets,"" said DJ Jowcol Dolby, or Boogie D to his 450,000 listeners on local station Hot 104.1.

""We're not immune to what's happening down in Ferguson or West Florissant. We live here,"" Boogie D said.

In between the latest hits, the station opens phone lines to callers.

""We are not deterred. We are not broken. And we are Mike Brown,"" one caller said.

The station also airs public service announcements trying to minimize the violence, which Boogie D blames on a small minority.

""Now I just think it's some really bad individuals taking advantage of an unfortunate situation,"" he said. ""And to me they're kind of hijacking the message of what those good protests have been doing for the last week or so.""",NA,797,NA,NACBS,cbs21,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-police-released-surveillance-video-over-feds-objections/,Feds opposed releasing Ferguson robbery video,CBS NEWS,8/16/14,4/8/16,"Last Updated Aug 16, 2014 11:55 PM EDT

After Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released the video and documents identifying Brown, 18, as a suspect, dozens of looters {ransacked several stores in the St. Louis suburb}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-missouri-clashes-resume-over-michael-brown-police-shooting/""> Friday night, CBS News correspondent Vladimir Duthiers reports.

Orr reports that, according to a U.S. law enforcement official, the Ferguson Police Department wanted to release the video Thursday.

In the video, a man wearing a St. Louis Cardinals cap reaches over the counter and grabs a $48 box of cigars. The suspect shoves a store clerk as he leaves.

A lawyer for Brown's family said Friday the suspect apparently was Brown. But the family said even if the teen had been involved in the robbery, that would not justify a police officer shooting him when he had his hands up, as several witnesses have described.

According to police dispatch transcripts, the suspect's description was broadcast at 11:52 a.m. last Saturday. Ten minutes later, an officer spotted Brown, and a minute later Brown lay dying in the streets just three blocks away from the store.

The Justice Department asked Ferguson police not to release the video, believing that it would roil the community further, and were able to successfully prevent the video from being released Thursday, the U.S. law enforcement official said.

Friday's release occurred over the objection of federal authorities, the official said.

A copy of the video has also been in the possession of federal investigators, and there weren't any plans by the investigators to release it, the official said.",77,2100,NA,NACBS,cbs22,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/egregious-assault-on-freedom-of-the-press-in-ferguson-missouri/,"""Egregious assault on freedom of the press"" in Ferguson, Mo.",Julia Dahl; CBS NEWS,8/14/14,4/8/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. -- As protests continue in Ferguson, Mo., in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, police are clashing not just with civilian demonstrators, but with journalists from some of the nation's leading news sources.

Lowry, according to an account published Thursday morning in the Post, was told to stop recording the officer who repeatedly tells him, ""Let's go.""

Lowry writes, ""As I turned, my backpack, which was slung over one shoulder, began to slip. I said, ""Officers, let me just gather my bag."" As I did, one of them said, ""Okay, let's take him.""

Lowry was handcuffed and taken into custody. Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly, was also in the McDonald's. Lowry writes: ""I could see Ryan still talking to an officer. I said: 'Ryan, tweet that they're arresting me, tweet that they're arresting me.' He didn't have an opportunity, because he was arrested as well.""

Both reporters were later released but according to a statement from the Post, were assaulted in the process of being detained.

According to the {Los Angeles Times' Matt Pearce}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-reporter-arrests-20140813-story.html"">, when Ferguson Police Chief Tim Jackson learned of the arrests he responded, ""Oh God,"" and later instructed his officers to release the two men.

Lowry and Reilly were not the only journalists whose reporting at the scene of a major news story was interrupted by police. Al Jazeera President Kate O'Brian issued a statement Thursday saying that an Al Jazeera America crew was fired upon with tear gas and rubber bullets:

""They were easily identifiable as a working television crew. As they were setting up their camera for a live report, tear gas canisters landed in their proximity and police fired rubber bullets in their direction. Police continued to shoot after crew members clearly and repeatedly shouted 'Press.'""

The statement continued: ""Al Jazeera America is stunned by this egregious assault on freedom of the press that was clearly intended to have a chilling effect on our ability to cover this important story.""

The Al Jazeera crew also {reportedly had their equipment taken by police}<hyperlink=""http://www.businessinsider.com/police-fire-tear-gas-on-al-jazeera-america-tv-crew-and-then-take-their-equipment-2014-8"">.

Mike Cavender, the president of the Radio Television Digital News Association told Crimesider that he wrote a letter to Ferguson Police Chief Tim Jackson on Wednesday after hearing initial reports of journalists being harassed while working on the city, but got no response. After the overnight arrests, he{ wrote again}<hyperlink=""http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/263359/media-organizations-to-police-in-ferguson-we-are-appalled/"">, calling the officers' conduct ""outrageous.""

""When they're operating lawfully - even in very stressful, volatile situations like the one in Ferguson - journalists should be allowed to do their jobs and have the respect of law enforcement agencies,"" Cavender said.

He continued: ""It seems like too often in these situations law enforcement agencies don't think of the very vital job the journalists are doing and have a disregard for them.""

Andrew Beaujon, who writes about media for the Poynter Institute, called the fact that reporters working in Missouri now have to be concerned about getting arrested or shot with tear gas, ""nuts.""

""To my memory, it's unprecedented,"" said Beaujon, who expressed concern that the way reporters were treated in Ferguson might have a chilling effect on newsgathering in the future.

""I don't think the cops went out to try and target journalists,"" Beaujon told Crimesider. ""But the net effect is that most sensible journalists are now going to think twice before getting into a situation like that. Not everyone is 23-years-old with no kids.""

Beaujon pointed out that usually it's the ""cowboys"" who report in combat zones like Egypt or Iraq: ""I've reported in the U.S. for years and I've never been hit with tear gas - I don't think that should be an unexceptional thing.""

As the turbulence continues after an officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, advocates are calling for more body-mounted police cameras to monitor interactions between officers and citizens. That is leading investors to pile into shares of Taser International ({TASR}<hyperlink=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/tasr/quote/"">), the main manufacturer of the cameras used by police departments.

Taser's stock price climbed nearly 10 percent on Friday and another 5 percent Monday to close at $14.68. Shares are still down from the $20 they reached last spring, but have turned sharply upward over the last week.

There is no footage of the shooting in Ferguson that took the life of 18-year-old Michael Brown. The Ferguson police department did have a supply of body-worn cameras but had not yet deployed them to officers, The Wall Street Journal {reports}<hyperlink=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/what-happens-when-police-officers-wear-body-cameras-1408320244"">.

""The stock is running on speculation that more police officers may be wearing these things,"" Brian Ruttenbur, an analyst with CRT Capital Group, {told Bloomberg}<hyperlink=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-15/taser-gains-as-shooting-spurs-calls-for-police-cameras.html?cmpid=msnmoney"">. ""It's directly related to what's happening in Missouri.""

Body-worn cameras account for only a fraction of Taser's revenue. Most of the company's sales come from the stun guns that the company calls ""conducted electrical weapons,"" or CEWs. But the company's video arm is growing quickly, more than doubling in the spring quarter to about $4.5 million in net sales.

Some police officers oppose the implementation of body-worn cameras, saying they fall off and can interfere with duty, but police departments are quickly embracing the technology. Taser's bookings for its video unit rose almost twofold last quarter, {Businessweek reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-14/after-ferguson-shooting-of-michael-brown-will-police-wear-cameras"">, propelled by contracts in San Diego and smaller cities in North Carolina and South Carolina.

The American Civil Liberties Union is also on board. ""Everybody wishes right now there was a video record of what happened"" in Ferguson, Jay Stanley, author of an ACLU white paper supporting the cameras, told Businessweek.

In Rialto, California, the use of body-mounted cameras led to a 60 percent drop in the use of force by officers, The Journal reports, while citizen complaints against police fell by 88 percent.

The price of the cameras has fallen to between $300 and $400 as Taser wages a competitive battle with another camera maker, Vievu. Both companies also charge a monthly subscription fee to store the video in the cloud, The Journal reports. Taser stores its video data on Amazon's ({AMZN}<hyperlink=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/amzn/quote/"">) cloud service.

The hardware and technology are getting so cheap, in fact, that police departments may soon be able to deploy their own systems or use a product like Google Glass, The Journal reports. That could throw more competition Taser's way.

No officers were injured in the incident. The suspect was transported to a local hospital where he died, authorities say.

""My heart is so heavy. My son was a good kid. He didn't deserve to die,"" Tritobia Ford told the station.

She reportedly said her son was lying on the ground and complying with the officers' orders when he was shot three times.

A man who said he witnessed the shooting and who identified himself as the cousin of the victim told the station authorities shot his cousin the back.

""They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area, from the Newtown Division, knows that - that this child has mental problems,"" the man, who declined to be identified by name, reportedly said.

""The excessive force... there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in the back while he's laying down? No. Then when the mom comes out, they don't try to console her... they pull the billy clubs out,"" he reportedly continued.

The shooting came just two days after {Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was killed by police}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-police-withholding-name-of-officer-in-fatal-mo-shooting/""> on a street in Ferguson, Mo.

But{ after the fatal police shooting in suburban St. Louis}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/angry-crowd-gathers-after-missouri-police-shoot-teen/"">, protesters took not only to the street - they took to the Web.

There's nothing new about the racial tension underpinning the events in Ferguson, Missouri, nor in the power of an image to rouse people to action.

But what is new about Ferguson is the role of social media in spreading the message wider and more quickly, particularly for African-Americans.

Could the community have been galvanized in such a way before social media?

""It could have been, but not this quickly,"" said Andre Fields, a 27-year-old political aide.

""It's bringing awareness, to say, 'Hey, you need to tell the whole story,'"" Field said.

While more whites than black use the Internet, the disparity disappears when it comes to overall use of social media. In fact, 6 percent more African-Americans aged 18-29 use social media than whites, 12 percent with Twitter alone.

Kwame Opam covers social media for the {online magazine The Verge}<hyperlink=""http://www.theverge.com/"">.

""The digital divide is such that having access to broadband Internet is lesser in poor communities, urban communities, so access to a smart phone gives the chance to use the Internet in a way that other people might not have,"" Opam said.

Smart phone are more social media driven.

""If you are accessing Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, you are just going to jump on them because that's what you are holding in your hands,"" he said.

It looked like a military operation. That's because police departments in the St. Louis area -- like those across the country -- are arming their officers with equipment once on the battlefields of {Iraq}<hyperlink=""/isis/""> and Afghanistan. Much of it is free of charge or bought with federal grant money authorized by Congress, CBS News' Jan Crawford reports.

In the past year, the {Department of Defense}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-g-holder-deeply-concerned-about-use-of-military-gear-in-ferguson/""> has given local law enforcement over 600 MRAPs, the armored vehicles designed to withstand roadside bombs. Texas alone has received 68, Florida 45.

The Warren County Sheriff's Department in upstate New York also got one.

""I'm hoping I never have to use this vehicle, but if I do have to use it, I'm not going to have to worry about my people or possibly the public being injured because it certainly can save them,"" Sheriff Bud York said.

The Pentagon program has given departments over $5 billion worth of surplus equipment since the program launched in 1991: helicopters, firearms, protective gear, night vision, even computers and camouflage clothing.

The local police also get federal grant money to buy the military-style equipment.

One recent study by The Center for Investigative Reporting found the federal government has doled out more than $34 billion to local police departments since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

But critics say local police aren't the military, and that some of the equipment and tactics involved should not routinely be used against American citizens.

Former New York City Police Detective Bo Dietl said the answer is proper training.

""If you're going to have all these advanced weaponry, you must train the people,"" he said. ""That must come part and parcel. You're going to buy it, know how to use it and know when to use it.""",5,85,NA,NACBS,cbs28,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-missouri-leaders-urge-residents-to-stay-home-and-allow-peace-to-settle-in/,"Ferguson leaders urge residents to stay home and ""allow peace to settle in""",CBS/AP,8/19/14,4/18/16,"Last Updated Aug 19, 2014 8:08 PM EDT

FERGUSON, Mo. -- Ferguson's leaders urged residents Tuesday to stay home after dark to ""allow peace to settle in"" and pledged several actions to reconnect with the {predominantly black community}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/response-to-ferguson-shooting-divided-on-racial-lines-study-finds/""> in the St. Louis suburb where the{ fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown has sparked nightly clashes }<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">between protesters and police.

According to a statement from the city, Ferguson's mayor, City Council and other employees have been exploring how to increase the number of African American applicants to the law enforcement academy, develop incentive programs to encourage city residency for {police officers}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-missouri-highlights-deep-national-mistrust-of-police-by-minorities/""> and raise funds for cameras that would be attached to patrol car dashboards and officers' vests.

""We plan to learn from this tragedy, as we further provide for the safety of our residents and businesses and progress our community through reconciliations and healing,"" according to the statement released Tuesday.

Ferguson's mayor, James Knowles tried to explain the lack of black officers in his town.

""We continue to try and diversify our police department,"" he explained to CBS News correspondent Mark Strassman. ""It's very difficult to get. There's not a huge pool of applicants we can get interested or involved in police work in the African American community.""

The {National Guard arrived in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/key-questions-about-the-national-guard-in-ferguson/""> Monday but kept its distance from the streets {during another night of unrest}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiny-minority-of-lawbreakers-blamed-for-latest-trouble-at-ferguson-missouri-protests/"">.

Protesters filled the streets after nightfall Monday, and officers trying to enforce tighter restrictions at times used bullhorns to order them to disperse. Police deployed noisemakers and armored vehicles to push demonstrators back. Officers fired tear gas and flash grenades.

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is in charge of security in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hit-by-poverty-ferguson-reflects-the-new-suburbs/"">, said bottles and Molotov cocktails were thrown from the crowd and that some officers had come under heavy gunfire. At least two people were shot and 31 were arrested, he said. He did not have condition updates on those who were shot. Johnson said four officers were injured by rocks or bottles.

However, St. Louis County spokeswoman Candace Jarret says 57 people were booked at the county jail, that does not include people taken to municipal jails elsewhere in the region. She did not have information on how many additional arrests were made.

Just four of the 57 arrested had Ferguson addresses. Fifty-four were cited for failure to disperse, two for unlawful use of a weapon, and one for interfering with an officer.Sixteen of those arrested are from out of state.

One peaceful demonstrator, Charles Bourrage, told CBS News correspondent Vladimir Duthiers that a {small group of violent protesters}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/outsiders-agitating-situation-in-ferguson-community-says/""> were working against the message of the larger crowd.

""We grabbed those that were trying to move the violence forward and moved them back. We grabbed them literally,"" Bourrage said.

Demonstrators no longer faced the neighborhood's midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew, but police told protesters that they could not assemble in a single spot and had to keep moving. After the streets had been mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave as well, citing the risk from the reported gunfire.

A photographer for Getty Images was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released. Two German reporters were arrested and detained for three hours. Conservative German daily Die Welt said correspondent Ansgar Graw and reporter Frank Herrmann, who writes for German regional papers, were arrested after allegedly failing to follow police instructions to vacate an empty street. They said they followed police orders.

Johnson said members of the media had to be asked repeatedly to return to the sidewalks and that it was a matter of safety. He said in some cases it was not immediately clear who was a reporter but that once it was established, police acted properly.

Citing ""a dangerous dynamic in the night,"" Johnson also urged protesters with peaceful intent to demonstrate during the daytime hours.

The latest clashes came after a day in which a {pathologist hired by the Brown family said the unarmed black 18-year-old suffered a bullet wound to his right arm}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/private-autopsy-reveals-details-of-michael-brown-shooting/""> that may indicate his hands were up or his back was turned. But the pathologist said the team that examined Brown cannot be sure yet exactly how the wounds were inflicted until they have more information.

Witnesses have said Brown's hands were above his head when he was repeatedly shot by an officer Aug. 9.

The independent autopsy determined that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, the family's lawyers and hired pathologists said.

The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday. But she declined to comment further, saying the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney.

Wilson has been provided legal counsel through the Fraternal Order of Police's union office in St. Louis, Duthiers reported.

A third autopsy was performed Monday for the Justice Department by one of the military's most experienced medical examiners, Attorney General Eric Holder said.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, said Michael Brown's funeral and memorial service would be Monday, though the time and location haven't been finalized.

A Justice Department official confirmed to CBS News that Holder spoke Tuesday afternoon with the federal medical examiner who conducted the autopsy to discuss the results of the examination. The autopsy results will not be made public.

{Holder was scheduled to travel to Ferguson }<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-dispatches-eric-holder-to-ferguson-in-wake-of-shooting/"">later this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death.

The Justice Department has mounted an unusually swift and aggressive response to Brown's death, from the independent autopsy to dozens of FBI agents combing Ferguson for witnesses to the shooting.

Obama said he also spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon about his deployment of the National Guard in Ferguson and urged the governor to ensure the Guard was used in a limited way.

Crump said Brown's parents wanted the additional autopsy because they feared results of the county's examination could be biased. Crump declined to release copies of the report.

""They could not trust what was going to be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child,"" he said during Monday's news conference with forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells and Dr. Michael Baden, who has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

The second autopsy, Crump said, ""verifies that the witness accounts were true: that he was shot multiple times.""

Parcells, who assisted former New York City chief medical examiner Baden during the private autopsy, said a bullet grazed Brown's right arm. He said the wound indicates Brown may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position across his chest or face.

""We don't know,"" Parcells said. ""We still have to look at the other (elements) of this investigation before we start piecing things together.""

Meanwhile, the start of fall classes has been postponed again in Ferguson.

Classes in the Ferguson-Florissant School District were scheduled to begin on Aug. 14, five days after 18-year-old Michael Brown's death. The district initially postponed the start of school until Monday due to safety concerns, then decided to wait another full week until Aug. 25.

The nearby Jennings and Riverview Gardens school districts have also canceled classes Tuesday after starting back up just days earlier.

Browns' death has resulted in a week of clashes between protesters and police in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., even as Gov. Jay Nixon attempted to restore the peace by {instituting a curfew}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/missouri-governor-jay-nixon-declares-state-of-emergency-in-ferguson/""> over the weekend.

Nixon said in a {separate interview on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-jay-nixon-ferguson-robbery-video-had-an-incendiary-effect/""> that the local prosecutor assigned to the case ""has a real opportunity to step up"" in the aftermath of the shooting, and that a dual investigation by the Justice Department and FBI ensures that justice will be served.

But Brooks said there is a need for a special prosecutor to restore credibility with the mostly black residents of Ferguson.

""It is critically important for a prosecutor to be appointed,"" Brooks said on ""Face the Nation."" ""It is critically important for the Justice Department to remain active and engaged because this county, this municipality both have a long history of troubled relationships with the community. And so as a matter of community credibility, as a matter of credibility with respect to the nation they need to step up.""

He said the local investigation, from the lack of engagement with the community to the local police department's decision to release a {surveillance video}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/ferguson-police-release-surveillance-video-related-to-michael-brown-shooting/""> that purportedly showed Brown robbing a convenience store, has been ""very troubling.""

""I would liken it to the Keystone Cops but I don't want to insult the Keystone Cops,"" he said.

Nixon said the release of the video, which federal law enforcement opposed, had an ""incendiary effect"" in Ferguson.

But Brown did have praise for the White House and federal handling of the case, noting he has received calls from the White House to discuss the situation.

""They want to see justice served here, it speaks well of the president and the attorney general that the Justice Department is on the ground,"" he said. ""The NAACP has been working with the FBI agents to identify and bring forward witnesses. That says to me that the Justice Department is not operating from Washington but in Ferguson, Missouri. That speaks well of the potential for this investigation to result in justice.""

He also said it was ""incredibly encouraging"" that the Justice Department announced that it {would perform a second autopsy on Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-department-of-justice-orders-federal-autopsy/""> to ensure an independent examination.

Brooks said the police's {use of heavy military gear}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-rethinks-giving-excess-military-gear-to-police/""> to help contain the protests ""absolutely"" added to the unrest in the wake of Brown's death.

He said Americans across the country are asking themselves, ""How is it the in the wake of this controversy we respond with armored vehicles with militarization, as opposed to explanation, conversation, community engagement?""

But Rep. Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that sometimes police officers do need tactical gear because they are outgunned.

""As a former F.B.I. agent, law enforcement officer, you're taught about that force continuum, and when do you escalate force? Obviously your first goal is to deescalate the problem. It appears that they may have reacted a little quickly on that force continuum when they decided to deal with certainly the protesters. Hard to say, sitting a thousand miles away,"" Rogers said. ""But I will tell you that you have to at least police officers with the ability to have something to meet those particular challenges.""",9,713,NA,NACBS,cbs30,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-missouri-community-deeply-at-odds-with-police/,"Tension between community, Ferguson police deeply rooted",Mark Strassmann,8/19/14,4/18/16,"Protesters say long before {Michael Brown was killed}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">, Ferguson cops policed by race.

Kyle Borders, 26, says Ferguson cops have pulled him over 10 times in three years. But they've never even given him a ticket.

""Sometimes you just get tired of it,"" he said. ""The first question is 'Do you have any guns, do you have any drugs, anything of that nature?'

""I am like sir, I don't even have a record. I have never been in trouble.""

Ferguson has 22,000 residents. Two-thirds are black. But African-Americans have a disproportionate share of run-ins with the city's mostly white police force.

According to the Missouri attorney general, last year in Ferguson, 86 percent of police stops, 92 percent of searches and 93 percent of arrests involved black people.

That means blacks are three times more likely than whites to be stopped by police and twice as likely to be searched or arrested.

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles spoke about the perception that police treat blacks unfairly.

""I am not in their shoes,"" he said. ""We can always improve relationships, whether it is true or not, there is a belief that it happens and that is not acceptable.""

He also commented on there being only three black police officers in a department of 53 cops.

""We continue to try and diversify our police department,"" he explained. ""It's very difficult to get. There's not a huge pool of applicants we can get interested or involved in police work in the African-American community.""

State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed has tried to calm crowds here. She's a critic of local police.

""I don't think they are trying hard enough to recruit African-Americans,"" Nasheed said. ""They don't want African-Americans in their good old boy network.""

Ferguson police have pledged to increase their minority recruiting pool. They also want to encourage cops who work here to live here.",47,1400,NA,NACBS,cbs31,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/background-of-prosecutor-in-ferguson-case-has-some-suspicious-of-bias/,Background of prosecutor in Ferguson case has some questioning probe's credibility,CBS/AP,8/18/14,4/18/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. - The Missouri prosecutor overseeing an investigation into the {fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/""> has deep family roots among police: his father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for St. Louis' police department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect.

The connections now are being cited by some local residents and black leaders who question whether St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch can remain impartial. Brown, who was black, was fatally shot in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on Aug. 9 by local police officer Darren Wilson, who is white.

Grand jurors may begin hearing the case Wednesday, though it could be weeks before they decide whether to indict Wilson on state criminal charges. The U.S. Justice Department is {conducting a separate civil rights investigation}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/justice-department-investigates-police-shooting-that-sparked-ferguson-violence/"">, which could also result in charges.

President Obama said Monday that he is {dispatching Attorney General Eric Holder}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-dispatches-eric-holder-to-ferguson-in-wake-of-shooting/""> to Ferguson to meet with FBI agents and Justice Department personnel conducting the federal criminal investigation into the shooting.

A private autopsy, commissioned by Brown's family, was conducted Sunday. But {CBS correspondent Bob Orr reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/private-autopsy-conducted-for-brown-family-unlikely-to-carry-much-weight/""> that it is not likely to be considered by prosecutors. Dr. Michael Bade, the pathologist who did the autopsy said he did not find gunpowder on Brown's body, which suggest the shooting was not at close range, but he couldn't be sure because Brown's clothes were unavailable.

He also did not see X-rays taken that would show exact bullet wound locations on the body. However, an autopsy done by St. Louis County will be used by prosecutors. But because of wide public distrust, the Justice Department will conduct a third autopsy on Brown.

McCulloch's spokesman, Ed Magee, said Monday that the prosecutor plans to remain in charge of the case, despite mounting pressure to step aside amid violent clashes between police and protesters demanding that Wilson be charged.

McCulloch, a Democrat who has been in office since 1991, referenced his father's death in his initial campaign. He survived a Democratic primary earlier this month and faces no Republican opposition in his re-election bid.

Protesters questioned his objectivity when grand jurors returned no charges against two officers who fired 21 bullets into a vehicle in June 2000, killing two black men during an attempted drug arrest.

But at the time, McCulloch said his father's 1964 shooting by a black man at a public housing complex was an ""incredibly irrelevant facet"" as he sought to ""make sure everybody gets a full and fair hearing."" McCulloch was 12 when his father was killed.

U.S. attorneys also reviewed the case and decided a year later not to bring any civil rights charges against the officers.

In Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb of St. Louis, many residents say they have long been harassed and intimidated by the police department, which has just three black officers on its 53-member force. They also have little confidence in McCulloch.

""He's not going to prosecute the police officers,"" said Robert Fowler, a 48-year-old electrician. ""In the ghetto ... every police officer, he's letting go free. They call it justifiable homicide.""

McCulloch recently {told CBS affiliate KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/McCulloch-says-Nixon-has-no-legal-authority-in-Ferguson-investigation-271449051.html"">: ""I've been as fair and impartial and done as thorough of a job as we could.""

Police allege that Brown failed to move out of the center of the street when Wilson asked him to, and a scuffle ensued before he was shot. Witnesses say Brown had his hands up as Wilson fired multiple rounds.

Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

In some other prominent cases - most notably, the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida - special state prosecutors have been appointed to determine whether to pursue charges. That at times occurred only after local authorities took no action.

But under Missouri law, it ""would be highly, highly, highly unusual"" for a prosecutor to step aside merely because of racial tensions in a high-profile case, said Peter Joy, a Washington University law professor who directs the school's Criminal Justice Clinic.

In Missouri, ""the buck stops with the head prosecutor"" in each county, Joy said.

Missouri law allows two avenues for outside prosecutors: The local prosecutor can ask for help from the governor, who can appoint the state attorney general's office to the case; or a court can appoint a special prosecutor if the elected one has a conflict of interest.

Police shootings don't automatically qualify as conflicts of interest and often are handled by local prosecutors.

""Just because the case is really hot and really controversial would not be a reason why I would seek a special prosecutor,"" said Eric Zahnd, a Kansas City-area prosecutor and past president of the Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys.

But some black leaders - including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley and state Sens. Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Jamilah Nasheed - have called on McCulloch to {consent to a special prosecutor}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/naacp-president-special-prosecutor-critically-important-in-ferguson/"">.

Nasheed started an online petition that has gotten about 25,000 signatures in four days seeking a special prosecutor.

""In the past, justice has not been achieved in these types of police shootings,"" said Clay, who represents the area. ""So I have no comfort with local-authority prosecution, the judicial system or even police conducting a thorough and conclusive investigation that delivers justice to the family of Michael Brown.""

""Simply put: he has a natural bias,"" added Chappelle-Nadal.

Johnson, who is black, has been appointed to head security in the Missouri town where tension has been high since the August 9 shooting of the unarmed black teen by a white Ferguson police officer, who has now been identified as Darren Wilson.

Last night, there were no arrests.

""Last night was a great night,"" said Johnson. ""People were talking to each other, inspiring each other.""

Johnson pledged to ""ensure the safety of the people of Ferguson"" as well as their right to gather and peacefully protest. He said he understood the ""inner anger"" over Brown's death and police tactics, but warned, ""we have to make sure we don't burn down our own house...that does not help.""

Johnson took questions, talked about his own children, and quoted from the Bible during the press conference, which took place just hours after Ferguson police released the name of the officer who killed Brown. Authorities also released surveillance images and a police report indicating that Brown may have stolen cigars from a QuikTrip convenience store just prior to his death.

Before wrapping up the press conference, Governor Jay Nixon stepped in to praise Johnson, saying he ""didn't want to be critical of anybody"" but that bringing the highway patrol in ""made a very positive difference over the last 18 hours.""

Finally, Johnson signed off, telling the crowd, ""I'll see you guys tonight down at the QuikTrip.""",3,7,NA,NACBS,cbs33,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-guard-assembles-in-ferguson-as-crowd-becomes-agitated/,Police fire tear gas as demonstrations become chaotic,CBS NEWS,8/18/14,4/18/16,"Demonstrators and police were locked in a confrontation late Monday as tear gas was fired at crowds who reportedly refused to disperse from the streets of Ferguson, Missouri. Tactical units and armored vehicles began to move in as the situation deteriorated.

Sheriff's deputies in body armor and state troopers carrying wooden bats and gas masks stood watch over the group. The streets of Ferguson remained crowded and active with few incidents through the day on Monday. By sundown, more protests began to take place and larger crowds began to gather, attracting more police presence. As midnight closed in a scene of chaos ensued.

Missouri National Guard troops began to assemble earlier Monday at a location not far from the epicenter of protest activity in Ferguson. The guardsmen have moved into town based on an order from Gov. Jay Nixon in order to return order after several nights of unrest in the wake of the {police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">.

They will be responsible, at least initially, for guarding the police staging area.

Two men were arrested for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse, police said. A photographer for the Getty photo agency was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released. Authorities were also establishing a designated protest zone for nightly demonstrations.

The plan was announced Monday by St. Louis County police.It was not clear what would happen to those who refuse to use the area along West Florissant Avenue, where the majority of protests have occurred.

{Although a curfew ordered by Gov. Jay Nixon was lifted in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-ferguson-missouri-no-curfew-but-a-static-assembly-ban/""> on Monday night, police told protesters that they could not assemble in a single spot, saying they had to keep moving. In federal court, a judge denied a request from the American Civil Liberties Union for a restraining order that would have prevented authorities from enforcing the rule. And police said that two men were arrested for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse.

Earlier Monday, activists from groups like the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party worked on quelling tensions that have led to violence over the past several nights.

The activists called for demonstrators to clear areas that had been a hotbed of activity and led to police firing tear gas, reports of molotov cocktails being thrown and arrests.

Among the main items to come up are the results of an independent autopsy conducted by pathologists hired by Brown's family.

The independent autopsy determined that Michael Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, the family's lawyers and hired pathologists said.

Witnesses have said Brown's hands were above his head when he was repeatedly shot by an officer Aug. 9 in Ferguson.

But the incomplete nature of the private autopsy done for the Brown family means it likely won't be considered by prosecutors, CBS News correspondent Bob Orr reports.

The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday. But she declined further comment, saying the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.

The {Justice Department announced}<hyperlink=""mailto:http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-department-of-justice-orders-federal-autopsy/""> that it would conduct its own autopsy of Brown's body as part of a federal investigation into Brown's death. Also President Obama announced that Attorney General Eric Holder{ would be dispatched to Ferguson later this week}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-dispatches-eric-holder-to-ferguson-in-wake-of-shooting/"">. More than 40 FBI agents are on the ground doing interviews and collecting evidence.

The unrest that has taken place over the past eight days, many in the Ferguson community say is not on the part of peaceful demonstrators, but rather comes from outsiders bent on agitating the marches.

""Those people who are smashing stores, those people are from different sides, from the south side,"" Tony Davis told CBS News correspondent Mark Strassman. ""Those are the people coming for that purpose,to steal, to take advantage of the situation and that's not right.""

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson, should be charged in the teen's death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney.",15,1500,NA,NACBS,cbs34,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/eric-holder-promises-full-and-fair-investigation-in-ferguson/,Eric Holder promises full and fair investigation in Ferguson,Rebecca Kaplan; CBS NEWS,8/19/14,4/18/16,"In an op-ed to the community of Ferguson, Missouri, Attorney General Eric Holder pledged that the Justice Department's investigation into the {death of Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/""> will be full and fair but said that acts of violence committed there must stop.

""We understand the need for an independent investigation, and we hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in Ferguson. In order to begin the healing process, however, we must first see an end to the acts of violence in the streets of Ferguson,"" Holder {wrote in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/a-message-to-the-people-of-ferguson/article_ea8b7358-67a3-5187-af8c-169567f27a0d.html"">. ""Although these acts have been committed by a very small minority -- and, in many cases, by individuals from outside Ferguson -- they seriously undermine, rather than advance, the cause of justice. And they interrupt the deeper conversation that the legitimate demonstrators are trying to advance.""

Holder also said that law enforcement can play a role in reducing the tensions. He noted that as the brother of a retired law enforcement officer, he understands the danger and personal risk that police officers face each day. At the same time, he said, it requires ""forging bonds of trust between the police and the public.""

""This trust is all-important, but it is also fragile. It requires that force be used in appropriate ways. Enforcement priorities and arrest patterns must not lead to disparate treatment under the law, even if such treatment is unintended. And police forces should reflect the diversity of the communities they serve,"" he wrote.

He said it is ""painfully clear"" more progress, dialogue and action is needed on this issue in cities across the country.

Holder is {traveling to Ferguson Wednesday}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-dispatches-eric-holder-to-ferguson-in-wake-of-shooting/""> at the request of President Obama, making him the first high-level U.S. official to visit the St. Louis suburb since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot there last week. {Clashes between police and protesters}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiny-minority-of-lawbreakers-blamed-for-latest-trouble-at-ferguson-missouri-protests/""> have been a daily occurrence since then.

Holder will meet with FBI agents and Justice Department personnel conducting the federal criminal investigation into the shooting, as well as other community leaders. Over the weekend he ordered the Justice Department -- which is {looking into possible civil rights violations in the case}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-looking-into-possible-civil-rights-case-in-michael-brown-shooting/""> -- to arrange for an {additional autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://to%20arrange%20for%20an%20additional%20autopsy%20to%20be%20performed%20by%20a%20federal%20medical%20examiner/""> on Brown's body to be performed by a federal medical examiner, which was performed Monday. The results will not be made public, but a Justice Department official tells CBS News Holder discussed the results with the federal medical examiner on Tuesday.

As for the visit to Ferguson, Holder laid out tall aims and a promise to stand with the community.

""This is my pledge to the people of Ferguson: Our investigation into this matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will be independent. And beyond the investigation itself, we will work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public to ensure that this tragedy can give rise to new understanding -- and robust action -- aimed at bridging persistent gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve,"" he wrote.",7,60,NA,NACBS,cbs35,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-g-holder-deeply-concerned-about-use-of-military-gear-in-ferguson/,"A.G. Holder ""deeply concerned"" about use of military gear in Ferguson",CBS NEWS,8/14/14,4/18/16,"U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder emphasized Thursday that the events unfolding in Ferguson, Mo., ""cannot continue"" and condemned both acts of violence by the public and heavy-handedness by law enforcement.

""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" Holder said.

In a statement released just a few hours after President Obama {spoke on the tense situation}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-on-racial-tension-in-missouri-nows-the-time-for-healing/""> in suburban St. Louis, Holder said the Justice Department is offering technical help to authorities on the ground with crowd control and maintaining public safety while avoiding extreme uses of force by police.

He also said the department's civil rights investigation into the case is continuing. Investigators from the Civil Rights Division and U.S. attorney's office have already conducted interviews with witnesses of shooting victim Michael Brown, who was killed Saturday by a Ferguson police officer. Police chief Tom Jackson said the 18-year-old got into a physical altercation with the officer and tried to grab his gun. But several witnesses have said publicly that the officer shot Brown while his hands were up and was surrendering.

Since the shooting, tensions have flared in the small city of about 21,000 and outside of what authorities have said were overall peaceful protests, vandalism and looting have been reported as well as several run-ins between law enforcement and demonstrators.

In at least one incident, armored police fired {tear gas and rubber bullets}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/protests-in-st-louis-suburb-again-turn-ugly/""> at crowds as a response to Molotov cocktails being thrown.

Wednesday night, two journalists, Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post were in a McDonald's when they were ordered to leave. The reporters say police became rough with them, then placed them under arrest, though they were later released.

Holder spoke specifically to these incidents.

""The law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them,"" he said. ""Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.""

Meanwhile, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said he plans an ""operational shift"" in police handling of the protests. He said that the people in Ferguson must be able to continue demonstrating peacefully.

""There is a certain level of emotion that must be expressed in order for us to reach a higher plane,"" Nixon told an audience in Florissant, Mo. ""And my sense is over the last few days, there has been a fear to hear.""

Congress is also responding to the unrest. Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson, is planning to introduce legislature that would restrict a Defense Department program which give free surplus military equipment to local law enforcement.

""Militarizing America's main streets won't make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent,"" Johnson told the Associated Press.",3,19,NA,NACBS,cbs36,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/response-to-ferguson-shooting-divided-on-racial-lines-study-finds/,"Response to Ferguson shooting divided on racial lines, study finds",CBS NEWS,8/18/14,4/18/16,"Blacks are about twice as likely as whites to say that the {shooting death of teenager Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">, who was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, raises important issues about race that need to be discussed, a new study finds.

The {study}<hyperlink=""http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/"">, conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, finds that other issues around the shooting, including whether police responded too aggressively to the riots that followed and the level of confidence the public has in the ensuing investigations, also break down along racial and sometimes political lines.

Among all adults surveyed, 44 percent say the case raises important issues about race while another 40 percent say race is getting more attention than it deserves. When those numbers are broken down by race, a full eight in 10 blacks said the race issues were important compared to 37 percent of whites. Eighteen percent of blacks said race was getting more attention than deserved, while a full 47 percent of whites did.

Still, whites were more likely to say that race got too much attention after George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the {shooting death Florida teenager Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/feature/george-zimmerman-trial-trayvon-martin-case/""> than they are now in relation to Brown's death. Sixty percent of whites said race got too much attention in Martin's death.

That trend was present, but less pronounced, when assessing the police response to the shooting. Sixty-five percent of blacks and just 33 percent of whites said the police had gone too far, whereas just 20 percent of blacks and 32 percent of whites said it had been about right. Fifteen percent of blacks and a full 35 percent of whites had no response.

Just 18 percent of blacks but more than half of whites (52 percent) say they have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in the investigations that are being conducted. Three-quarters of blacks (76 percent) and one third of whites (33 percent) say they do not have much or any confidence of that.

Democrats were more likely to say that the case raises important issues of raise, with 68 percent of Democrats and just 22 percent of Republicans agreeing with that position. Sixty-one percent of Republicans say race has gotten too much attention, while just 21 percent of Democrats hold that opinion.

Republicans were also more likely to view the police response as appropriate (43 percent) and say they have confidence in the investigations (65 percent), while 56 percent of Democrats say the police went too far and only 38 percent have confidence in the investigations.

The poll was based on landline and cellular telephone interviews with 1,000 adults ages 18 and older. The margin of error at the 95 percent confidence level ranges from 3.6 to 11.1 percentage points based on the different groups sampled.",8,2100,NA,NACBS,cbs37,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/witnesses-in-ferguson-describe-intimidation-clashes-with-police/,"Witnesses in Ferguson describe intimidation, clashes with police",Mark Strassmann,8/14/14,4/18/16,"After four nights of violence in Ferguson, Missouri -- and with no end in sight-- the president and the governor took action Thursday. Governor Jay Nixon put state police in charge of security in the St. Louis suburb where local police have clashed with demonstrators protesting the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer.

President Obama interrupted his vacation to call for calm. He says there is blame for the violence on both sides.

""There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" Obama said. ""There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights."" CBS News correspondent Mark Strassman has more.

Police in Ferguson say they won't stop a peaceful protest. That's exactly what Liz Peinado says she was doing when heavily armed police rolled in on armored vehicles last night.

""I'm 115 pounds, 4'11 sitting on the floor with my peace sign and being yelled at by large men,"" she said, describing an officer pointing a gun at her head.""He was grabbing me pretty tight and I said 'sir I'm a really tiny woman. You don't have to grab me that hard.' ""

Tear gas and smoke bombs were used to scatter protesters. Police say someone threw objects including molotov cocktails.

In one cell phone video, you can see a police officer aiming his weapon at demonstrators. Many of the officers had semi automatic rifles. Those who did not quickly respond to commands -- including journalists -- were taken into custody. Baptist minister Dinah Tatman says she was goaded by one officer.

""He wanted to taunt me to resist and when I said you don't know who I am, he took my arms and yanked. 'Oh are you trying to resist,'"" Tatman said the officer quipped. ""I said don't do it.""

Earlier, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he was ""deeply concerned"" over acts of violence by the public and heavy-handedness by police.

""The law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them,"" he said.

Tensions with the press were also heightened when media itself became part of the story.

{Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowry}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html""> was recharging his cell phone and working on his laptop at a Ferguson, Mo., McDonald's Wednesday night when police in riot gear approached him and told him to leave the restaurant.

Lowry, according to an account published Thursday morning in the Post, was told to stop recording the officer who repeatedly tells him, ""Let's go.""

Lowry writes, ""As I turned, my backpack, which was slung over one shoulder, began to slip. I said, ""Officers, let me just gather my bag."" As I did, one of them said, ""Okay, let's take him.""

After 4 nights of unrest -- in which one person was critically wounded -- Missouri governor Jay Nixon promised ""a change in tone."" He put State Highway Patrol captain Ron Johnson to command the operation.

""I grew up here and this is currently my community and my home,"" Johnson said at a press conference. ""Therefore it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence, fuse the tension and build trust.""

Johnson said that he would be in Ferguson Thursday night and meet people at the Quik Trip gas station that was burned by vandals days ago and has now become a ""ground zero"" of sorts in the community.

The investigation into Michael Brown's death could take two more weeks. Ferguson police say Brown tried to grab the gun of the unidentified white officer. But two witnesses say Brown was unarmed and had his hands up when he was shot multiple times. Tiffany Mitchell says she saw Brown outside the police car.

""The kid breaks away and he starts running away from the cop,"" said Mitchell. ""The cop follows him and kept shooting and the kid's body jerked as if he was hit.""

Michael Brown's body has been returned to his family. They are waiting for the official autopsy and we have learned they are also planning to have an independent autopsy done.

The FBI is conducting an independent investigation of the shooting.

Meanwhile Capitol Hill legislators are also responding to the situation in Ferguson.

Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson, is planning to introduce legislature that would restrict a Defense Department program which give free surplus military equipment to local law enforcement.

""Militarizing America's main streets won't make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent,"" Johnson told the Associated Press.

In other developments, the Twitter account of hacker group Anonymous was suspended Thursday. The account had been used to post the what the group claimed was the name and other personal information of the police officer involved in the weekend shooting.

Twitter's code of conduct strictly forbids the publication of private and confidential information without permission. After the account was suspended, a secondary account announced that the group won't be releasing any more information, for now.

Nixon said his office did not know the video was going to be released. CBS News correspondent Bob Orr reported Saturday that federal authorities {opposed the release of the video}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ferguson-police-released-surveillance-video-over-feds-objections/"">.

The clashes between protesters and police have continued for nearly a week since Brown was shot by Darren Wilson, a white officer, in the mostly-black suburb of St. Louis.

The confrontation was ended about an hour after the curfew, and Nixon said, ""we feel much better"" this morning. He said the protesters who have refused to obey the curfew were not locals.

""The thousands of folks there, certainly there were seven folks detained and had to be arrested, but most of those folks weren't directly from the area. So we're hopeful that we're making progress. I think it's right for people to grieve. I think it's right for people to speak,"" he said.

Nixon said he is working to balance the frustration of protesters with the need for calm in the area.

""Those are real emotions. People need to grieve and they need to speak, but we also need to keep the rule of law and peace, and I think we need to balance all three of those,"" he said.

Jay Nixon said Tuesday evening he will not remove St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch from the investigation into Michael Brown's death, a case that has sparked more than a week of angry protests and violent unrest.

A grand jury could begin hearing testimony as soon as Wednesday in the case. The 18-year-old Brown, who was black, was killed by a white police officer on Aug. 9. Witnesses have said Brown, who was unarmed, had his hands up when Officer Darren Wilson shot him multiple times.

After sundown Tuesday, the streets of Ferguson filled once more with protesters who marched along the street. There were no immediate reports of clashes with police, who stood by with batons and gas masks.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is {expected in Ferguson on Wednesda}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/eric-holder-promises-full-and-fair-investigation-in-ferguson/"">y to oversee the federal investigation into the case.

Some black leaders have questioned whether McCulloch can investigate the case impartially. The prosecutor's father, mother, uncle and cousin all worked for St. Louis' police department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect.

But Nixon said removing McCulloch would only create ""legal uncertainty"" in a case that has already stirred emotions nationwide.

""There is a well-established process by which a prosecutor can recuse themselves from a pending investigation, and a special prosecutor be appointed,"" the governor said in a statement. ""Departing from this established process could unnecessarily inject legal uncertainty into this matter and potentially jeopardize the prosecution.""

But many observers feel that McCulloch {would be biased toward the Ferguson police department}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/background-of-prosecutor-in-ferguson-case-has-some-suspicious-of-bias/""> and has a history of siding with law enforcement.

U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley and Missouri state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed each have called on Nixon to remove McCulloch from the case.

""Given Mr. McCulloch's history and his close relationship to the Ferguson Police Department, and his track record of never indicting a police officer who used excessive, deadly force against a black suspect, it's no wonder that the community has no confidence in his independence,"" Clay, D-Mo., {told CBS affiliate KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/"">.

McCullouch has said he has no intentions of leaving the case, but would if Nixon demanded it.

Earlier Tuesday, community leaders urged Ferguson residents to stay home after dark to ""allow peace to settle in"" and pledged several actions to reconnect with the {predominantly black population}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/response-to-ferguson-shooting-divided-on-racial-lines-study-finds/""> in the St. Louis suburb.

At least two people were shot he said, although not by police. He did not have condition updates on those who were shot. Johnson said four officers were injured by rocks or bottles.

St. Louis County spokeswoman Candace Jarret says 57 people were booked at the county jail, a number that does not include people taken to municipal jails elsewhere in the region. She did not have information on how many additional arrests were made.

Just four of the 57 arrested had Ferguson addresses. Fifty-four were cited for failure to disperse, two for unlawful use of a weapon, and one for interfering with an officer.Sixteen of those arrested were from out of state.

One peaceful demonstrator, Charles Bourrage, told CBS News correspondent Vladimir Duthiers that a {small group of violent protesters}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/outsiders-agitating-situation-in-ferguson-community-says/""> were working against the message of the larger crowd.

Meanwhile, the start of fall classes has been postponed again in Ferguson.

Classes in the Ferguson-Florissant School District were scheduled to begin on Aug. 14, five days after Brown's death. The district initially postponed the start of school until Monday due to safety concerns, then decided to wait another full week until Aug. 25.

Two reporters said they were detained by police while covering the tensions that have torn Ferguson since the death Saturday of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told a news conference earlier in the day that the St. Louis County investigation of the shooting could take weeks to complete.

In the meantime, he said, his department welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.

""Unfortunately, an undertow (of racial unrest) has bubbled to the surface,"" said Jackson. ""Race relations is the top priority right now.""

The situation became more tense after nightfall, with police ordering people to go home and then using smoke bombs and later tear gas after some people threw Molotov cocktails at them.

""We have to stand and fight here right now!"" one young woman screamed as police began firing tear gas.

Earlier, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post said they were handcuffed and put into a police van after officers came in to quickly clear a McDonald's restaurant where they were doing some work. The Post reported that Lowery said that at one point, he was slammed against a soda machine and plastic cuffs were put on his wrists. The reporters were subsequently released without any charges.

Detained, booked, given answers to no questions. Then just let out

One thing about being arrested in 2014 is that you don't remember any phone numbers.

Martin D. Baron, the Post's executive editor, issued a statement saying there ""was absolutely no justification for his arrest"" and that the organization was appalled by the conduct of the officers involved.

Jackson did not immediately return a cellphone message Wednesday night from The Associated Press seeking comment.

Police have Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car, and they have refused to clarify their account.

Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told {CBS affiliate KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html""> and other media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it ""ricocheted"" back, apparently upsetting the officer.

Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.

Some protesters Wednesday raised their arms above their heads as they faced the police. Others held signs asking for answers about Brown's death. The most popular chant has been, ""Hands up! Don't shoot!""

Brown's body remained on the street for hours - a span Jackson deemed ""uncomfortable"" but justified, given that ""you only get one chance at that crime scene"" to process it correctly. Jackson said authorities also were concerned about gunfire they could hear in a nearby building.

Brown's grandmother, Desuirea Harris, said she heard a commotion and went outside to see her grandson lying dead on the street. She told KMOV the teen had been on his way to visit her.

""He came to visit me and they did that to him for no reason,"" she said.

But the pathologist said the team that examined Michael Brown can't be sure yet exactly how the wounds were inflicted, citing the need for more information.

The incomplete nature of the private autopsy done for the Brown family means it likely won't be considered by prosecutors, CBS News correspondent Bob Orr reports.

The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday. But she declined further comment, saying the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.

But there is {wide distrust in the community}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/background-of-prosecutor-in-ferguson-case-has-some-suspicious-of-bias/"">, so the Justice Department is now conducting a third autopsy, which will be compared to the county medical examiner's, as part of its federal civil rights investigation, Orr reports. The federal autopsy will be carried out by one of the military's most experienced medical examiners, Attorney General Eric Holder said.

Holder was {scheduled to travel to Ferguson later this week}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-dispatches-eric-holder-to-ferguson-in-wake-of-shooting/""> to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out the independent federal investigation into Brown's death. More than 40 FBI agents are on the ground doing interviews and collecting evidence.

The independent autopsy determined that Michael Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, the family's lawyers and hired pathologists said.

Witnesses have said Brown's hands were above his head when he was repeatedly shot by an officer Aug. 9 in Ferguson.

Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells, who assisted former New York City chief medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden during the private autopsy, said a bullet grazed Brown's right arm. He said the wound indicates Brown may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position across his chest or face.

""We don't know,"" Parcells said. ""We still have to look at the other (elements) of this investigation before we start piecing things together.""

In Washington, President Barack Obama said the vast majority of protesters in Ferguson were peaceful, but warned that a {small minority was undermining justice}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/background-of-prosecutor-in-ferguson-case-has-some-suspicious-of-bias/"">.

During a brief pause in his summer vacation, Obama said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to ""listen and not just shout.""

The president also weighed in for the first time publicly on the militarization of some local police departments, saying it would probably be useful to examine how federal grant dollars had been used to allow local police to purchase military-style equipment.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon {mobilized the National Guard}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-guard-called-out-in-ferguson-missouri/""> to help manage the unrest. Mr. Obama said he told Nixon that he wanted to ensure the Guard's mission was {limited in scope}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/key-questions-about-the-national-guard-in-ferguson/"">. CBS News correspondent Vladimir Duthiers reports that there are roughly 80 National Guard troops in Ferguson, mostly military police.

Also Monday, Nixon {lifted the neighborhood's midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-ferguson-missouri-no-curfew-but-a-static-assembly-ban/""> two days after it went into effect when he declared a state of emergency. The governor had summoned the National Guard overnight after police again used tear gas to quell protesters.

Brown's death has heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and Ferguson's mostly white police department. Another protest quickly deteriorated Sunday night as marchers pushed toward one end of a street, and authorities - who said they were responding to reports of gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters hurling Molotov cocktails - pushed them back with tear gas.

Nixon said the National Guard troops would be under the direction of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, which is overseeing security during protests. Their primary objective is to protect the police command center.

News of the National Guard deployment brought hope to Ibrahim Ramaha, whose store has been looted twice. When asked what he wanted the National Guard to do, Ramaha said ""just bring the city back, give rest to the family, give rest to the business community, give rest to the business owners.""

Police were telling protesters Monday that they could not assemble in a single spot, saying they had to keep moving. In federal court, a judge denied a request from the American Civil Liberties Union for a restraining order that would have prevented authorities from enforcing the rule.

Authorities were also establishing a designated protest zone for nightly demonstrations. The plan was announced Monday by St. Louis County police.

It was not clear what would happen to those who refuse to use the area along West Florissant Avenue, where the majority of protests have occurred.

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney.

Family attorney Benjamin Crump said Brown's parents wanted the additional autopsy because they feared results of the county's examination could be biased. Crump declined to release copies of the report.

""They could not trust what was going to be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child,"" he said during Monday's news conference with Parcells and Baden, who has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

The second autopsy, Crump said, ""verifies that the witness accounts were true: that he was shot multiple times.""

Baden said one of the bullets entered the top of Brown's skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when he suffered that fatal injury. The hired pathologists said Brown, who also was shot four times in the right arm, could have survived the other bullet wounds.

Baden also said there was no gunpowder residue on Brown's body, indicating he was not shot at close range. However, Baden said he did not have access to Brown's clothing, and that it was possible the residue could be on the clothing.

Crump also noted that Brown had abrasions on his face from where he fell to the ground, but there was ""otherwise no evidence of a struggle.""",532,4600,NA,NACBS,cbs42,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gov-jay-nixon-ferguson-police-response-example-of-too-much-armor/," Gov.

For several nights this week, tanks, combat gear and assault rifles were seen in the city as protesters demonstrated against the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer.

""This is a good example of what can happen if there's too much armor and not enough working together,"" Nixon said.

""As we saw that acceleration, both of the confrontations as well as the amplitude of the force, it became obvious to me we needed a force change,"" Nixon said. ""That's why I brought in the Highway Patrol, put Capt. (Ron) Johnson in the front and also why folks backed up last night, got in the community as opposed to into MRAPs, and I think that's one of the reasons we had zero arrests last night.""

With Ferguson police saying Friday morning it would release the name of the officer involved in Saturday's shooting, Nixon said it would be ""yet another step in healing.""",NA,11,NA,NACBS,cbs43,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-unarmed-black-missouri-teen-shot-after-altercation-police-say/,"Unarmed black Mo. teen shot after altercation, police say",CBS/AP,8/10/14,4/18/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. - An unarmed 18-year-old black man was {shot and killed by police in suburban St. Louis}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/angry-crowd-gathers-after-missouri-police-shoot-teen/""> after an altercation that involved two people and an officer, authorities said Sunday while hundreds of protesters demanded answers outside.

Police have not officially disclosed the name of the man who was killed, but family members say it was 18-year-old Michael Brown.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference that an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and the struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where one of the two people was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known, but ""It was more than just a couple."" He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the man who was shot was unarmed.

Jackson said police are in contact with the second person who was involved in the altercation, but that the person has not been arrested or charged and is expected to be interviewed later Sunday. Authorities aren't sure if the second person was unarmed, Jackson said.

Tensions in the community are still high, reports CBS affiliate {KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html""> in St. Louis. A large police presence is on hand.

Police are asking the community to stay calm and allow the investigation to proceed.

During the news conference, which was held in a separate building, some protesters walked into the Ferguson Police Department chanting ""don't shoot me"" and holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase and stopped the crowd without using force.

Others outside shouted ""We want answers"" and ""no justice, no peace,"" and some carried signs saying ""stop police terrorism"" and ""disarm the police.""

The St. Louis County Police are in charge of the investigation. On Saturday, John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, said the FBI should get involved ""to protect the integrity of the investigation."" And State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch she would ask the U.S. Justice Department on Monday for a formal investigation.

Gaskin alluded to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, as well as the New York man who died from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes.

""With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,"" Gaskin said.

The officer has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years and that he wasn't aware of other issues involving the man, Belmar said. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is a common procedure after officer-involved shootings.

After the news conference, several protesters yelled at the officers who surrounded the crowd.

""I don't want you killing my child just because he walked out the door,"" Shontell Walters, of Ferguson, said.

Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, said Saturday she saw him in her neighborhood, and minutes later, she heard a commotion and went outside. She found Brown's body less than two blocks away.

""My grandson never even got into a fight,"" she said of Brown, who she added had recently graduated high school. ""He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.""

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, had harsh words Saturday for authorities.

Violence has been limited to the suburb and has been met with a strong law enforcement presence, but shop owners say local residents are afraid of mayhem potentially spreading.

""They're just afraid of whats going on and they're coming in to purchase either additional firearms or their first firearm,"" Steven King, owner of Metro Shooting in Bridgeton, Mo., {told CBS affiliate KMOV}<hyperlink=""http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2014/08/12/gun-sales-up-across-area/"">.

Despite the spike, King says sales at his other shop in Belleville, Mo., have been normal.

Sales of weapons were up as much as 50 percent at Mid-America Arms in St. Louis, including semi-automatic handguns and shotguns. Al Rothweiler, an owner of the shop said more women than normal were purchasing firearms at his store.

""The things that have gone on (locally) have made people act,"" Rothweiler{ told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/gun-stores-in-st-louis-area-see-a-spike-in/article_f3e99891-8111-5f3e-a159-c94ad7834a72.html"">. Business had increased for him, ""but I don't like selling on fear.""

An employee at Bull's Eye, L.L.C. in St. Louis told the Post-Dispatch sales are up ""a little bit.""

Meanwhile more protests took place in Ferguson Tuesday night and into early Wednesday, but witnesses say none turned violent. However, an officer shot and critically wounded a suspect early Wednesday near Ferguson.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said officers responded to a report of four men wearing ski masks armed with shotguns a block or two east of Ferguson.

An officer confronted a suspect who pulled a handgun on the officer, according to the police spokesman.

""In fear for his life, the officer shot the subject,"" Schellman continued. He was taken to a hospital in critical condition. The suspect's handgun was recovered at the scene.

In a separate incident, one person was injured in a drive-by shooting in Ferguson early Wednesday, Schellman said.",8,183,NA,NACBS,cbs45,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/angry-crowd-gathers-after-missouri-police-shoot-teen/,Angry crowd gathers after Missouri police shoot teen,CBS/AP,8/10/14,4/18/16,"FERGUSON, Mo. - A large crowd of angry residents confronted police officers in Missouri on Saturday afternoon, yelling such things as ""kill the police"" after an officer fatally shot a teenager who witnesses say was unarmed.

Officer Brian Schellman, spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, said ""a couple hundred"" people came out of apartment buildings after an officer shot and killed the young man. Schellman did not identify the male or say what prompted the shooting.

But family members and witnesses identified the young man as 18-year-old Michael Brown. Multiple witnesses said Brown had no weapon on him and had his hands up in the air but was shot by authorities multiple times, {CBS affiliate KMOV reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html"">.

""He (the officer) shot again and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air,"" said Dorian Johnson, a friend Brown's. ""He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""

Brown's grandmother said she found his body in the middle of the street minutes after he was expected to arrive at her home.

Desuirea Harris said she was driving through her suburban St. Louis neighborhood Saturday afternoon when she saw her grandson walking a few blocks from her house. After she arrived home minutes later, she heard a commotion and ran outside to see Brown's body on the pavement nearby.

""He was a good kid. He didn't live around here,"" Harris told KMOV. ""He came to visit me and they did that to him for no reason.""

John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP civil rights group, called on the FBI's assistance was needed ""to protect the integrity of the investigation.""

""With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,"" Gaskin said.

Gaskin was apparently referring to the recent case of {Eric Garner, a black man in New York City who died after a police officer put him in a chokehold}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/eric-garner-death-rally-held-after-nyc-man-put-in-police-choke-hold-dies/""> while trying to arrest him. {Trayvon Martin was an unarmed black teen}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/feature/george-zimmerman-trial-trayvon-martin-case/""> who was killed in 2012 by Florida neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who was acquitted after pleading self-defense.

Gaskin said officials in the organization spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who told them the male was a teenager and had been shot twice.

After the shooting, some people yelled threats toward the police, and officers said they thought they heard gunshots, Schellman said. There were no reports of additional injuries, he said.

After the crowd gathered, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents. According to the U.S. Census Bureau from 2012, about two-thirds of the residents are black.

Schellman said the crowd was under control by about 5 p.m. and several of the additional officers had left the area.

Gaskin said the angry crowd was reacting to a ""trauma.""

""Anytime you have this type of event that's taken place, emotions are going to run high,"" he said.

St. Louis County Police said at least 19 different departments responded to Ferguson, arresting at least 32 people. According to police, shots were fired at a police helicopter in the area.

The tensions erupted after a candlelight vigil Sunday night for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after a scuffle involving the officer, Brown and another person in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb of the city.

KMOV-TV reports at least 12 businesses near the shooting scene were looted, including a convenience store, a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer, and carted rims away from a tire store.

TV footage showed streams of people walking from a liquor store carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters stood atop police cars or taunted officers who stood stoic, some carrying shields and batons. Video posted online by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch showed a convenience store on fire.

Witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows. Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van.

Police also responded to reports of shootings throughout the area. At one point, windows of a KMOV-TV live truck were smashed out by the angry crowd.

Tear gas was reportedly been used by police in some areas. Authorities set up blockades to keep people from the most looted areas.

Police struggled to catch looters because crimes were happening at several locations in Ferguson and spilling into neighboring communities, Mayor James Knowles told KTVI-TV.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries as of about 11 p.m. But there were scattered reports of assaults into the early morning.

""The small group of people are creating a huge mess,"" Knowles told KTVI-TV. ""Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.""

Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting ""Don't shoot me"" while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn't use force; the crowd eventually left.

KMOV-TV reported that internet vigilante group Anonymous hacked into the city of Ferguson's email system last night and made it unusable for a time.

In a statement, the group said they are ""outraged at this cold blooded murder of a young teen.""

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said {the shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/angry-crowd-gathers-after-missouri-police-shoot-teen/""> occurred after an officer encountered Brown and another man outside an apartment complex in Ferguson.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known and that all shell casings at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police were investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and it wasn't clear if he was armed.

A crowd gathers in Ferguson, Mo., on Saturday, August 9, 2014, after an officer-involved shooting left an apparently unarmed black teenager dead.

A crowd gathers in Ferguson, Mo., on Saturday, August 9, 2014, after an officer-involved shooting left an apparently unarmed black teenager dead.

Jackson said blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him. Toxicology tests take weeks to complete.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she didn't understand why police didn't subdue her high school graduate son with a club or stun gun, and that the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,"" she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

""We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,"" said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.

St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, and Dooley said he will request an FBI investigation. The U.S. Justice Department said Attorney General Eric Holder instructed staff to monitor developments.

The race of the officer involved in the shooting has not been disclosed. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.

Authorities have {refused to release the name of the officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-police-withholding-name-of-officer-in-fatal-mo-shooting/""> who shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said he's concerned about the officer's safety amid numerous death threats. Computer hackers have also targeted the city's website and released details online about individual city employees.

At a press conference Wednesday, Jackson said the officer ""was removed from the scene pretty quickly"" after the incident. Jackson said the officer involved was injured at the time and treated at a local hospital afterwards for an injury to his face.

Another officer's name was released and identified by some as the one involved in Brown's killing, but Jackson said those reports were false.

""We're taking the threats seriously"", Jackson said.

Jackson said there have been cyberattacks against the city's website, but that won't compel him to release the officers name. An anonymous global group of hackers had pledged to create mischief with Ferguson's city computers if the name wasn't released.

The officer has been with the force for about six years and was on a routine patrol when he encountered the two young men, Jackson said previously.

Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. Brown was black.

Civil rights activists and the attorney for Brown's family, all pressing for calm amid nights of unrest since Saturday's shooting, counter that knowing the officer's name may help the area to heal, allowing the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and others to dig into the officer's background for any prior brutality.

""We don't want anyone's life threatened. If someone like this officer is killed, then there is no justice,"" said John Gaskin III of St. Louis County's NAACP chapter. ""What the officer may have done is certainly unacceptable, and we are outraged. But we want to be realistic here: This is a man with a family.""

Investigators have released few details, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Brown and another man to get out of the street, and that the officer's weapon fired at some point inside a patrol car. Witnesses {say Brown had his hands raised}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-some-ferguson-missouri-residents-do-not-believe-cops-story/""> when the officer repeatedly shot him.

The shooting has exposed deep racial and economic fault lines in the community, with the release of the officer's name a festering demand of protesters, as well as activist computer hackers.

In the aftermath of Brown's death, the group Anonymous said in online postings that it was monitoring police treatment of Ferguson's protesters and threatened to disrupt the suburb's government websites.

On Monday, someone burrowed into the city website and shut it down for much of the day. Representatives of Anonymous have taken credit. Separately someone snipped City Hall's fiber-optic cable during a protest that day, Jackson said.

Jackson, whose 53-person police force includes just three black officers, said he was unaware whether the hackers obtained any personal information about his officers. But, he added, ""I don't know why they'd sit on it if they did.""

On Tuesday, hackers went after St. Louis County's chief, Jon Belmar, whose department has been asked to investigate Brown's death. Some posted pictures of Belmar's home and family online, as well as his home address and telephone number.

""Realistically, what positive could come from that information coming out?"" Jackson said. ""Right now, people want it so they can destroy that person's life. That's the only reason that group's asking for it.""

At a Tuesday night community meeting, Belmar and the county's prosecutor, Robert McCullough, said law enforcement won't release the officer's name won't be released unless criminal charges are filed.

Still, impatience grows by the day.

""We have the right to know, and the family has the right to know who murdered their son,"" said Sahari Gutierrez, a 27-year-old Ferguson legal assistant.

""The community is {crying out for transparency}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/we-need-justice-for-our-son-cries-father-of-slain-mo-teen/"">, and we want to be able to know what kind of person would shoot an unarmed kid in broad daylight,"" said Ben Crump, the Brown family's attorney who also represented relatives of Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.

The candlelight gathering was for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was {shot multiple times}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-unarmed-black-missouri-teen-shot-after-altercation-police-say/""> Saturday after a scuffle involving the officer, Brown and another person in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb of the city.

Afterward, some people looted a convenience store. Several other stores along a main road near the shooting scene were broken into and looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store.

People were seen carrying bags of food and toilet paper. TV footage showed streams of people walking out of a liquor store carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters were standing atop police cars or taunting officers who stood stoic, often in riot gear.

Other witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows. Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van.

""Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess,"" Ferguson's mayor, James Knowles, told St. Louis KTVI-TV. ""Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors. There's nothing productive from this.""

As the investigation of Brown's death progresses, ""we understand people want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out,"" Knowles added. ""We're going to obviously try to urge calm.""

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries but confirmed widespread property damage. ""Right now I'm just worried about people, not property,"" he said.

Earlier in the day, a few hundred protesters had gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police building, some chanting ""Don't shoot me"" while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn't use force; the crowd eventually left.

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after an officer encountered two people -- one of whom was Brown -- on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who allegedly struggled with the officer.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known, but ""it was more than just a couple."" He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

Officials say the officer was attacked, but CBS News' Julian Johnson reports many in the community are not satisfied with that explanation.

Speaking to reporters at the scene, Dorian Johnson said he was with man with Michael Brown, and he gave a different account of events. Johnson said the officer pulled up next to the two teens and exchanged words with them before choking Brown and trying to pull him into the squad car. The officer, he said, then exited his car, fired a shot and chased after Brown, who was running for his life.

""He shot again and once my friend felt that shot he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down, and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""

""We wasn't causing no harm to nobody [sic],"" Johnson said. ""We had no weapons on us at all.""

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV there was no apparent video footage of the shooting from a nearby apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn't yet put in use.

Jackson said blood samples had been taken from Brown and the officer who shot him, with those toxicology tests generally expected to take weeks to complete.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said he had graduated from high school and was about to enter a local college. She said she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue her son with a club or Taser, and she said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,"" she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged {shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/feature/george-zimmerman-trial-trayvon-martin-case/""> by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

""We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,"" said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.

The Rev. Al Sharpton called the shooting ""very disturbing"" and said he planned to go to Ferguson to meet with the family.

St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, and Dooley said he will request an FBI investigation. The U.S. Justice Department said Attorney General Eric Holder had instructed staff to monitor developments.

The race of the officer involved in the shooting has not been disclosed.

Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI's St. Louis field office, says the agency is looking at possible civil rights violations arising from the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Police say Brown was shot multiple times Saturday in a scuffle with an officer in Ferguson.

Mimura says the FBI is monitoring the case and working with St. Louis County police. The FBI has stressed that it is not taking over the investigation from local officials.

In addition, Attorney General Eric Holder announced Monday that the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney's Office will also launch a probe into Brown's death.

""The federal investigation will supplement, rather than supplant, the inquiry by local authorities,"" Holder said in a statement. ""At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right.

A candlelight vigil for Brown was held Sunday, and tensions erupted later that night. {Nearly three dozen people were arrested after a crowd looted and burned stores}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-vigil-for-dead-teen-turns-violent/"">, vandalized vehicles and taunted officers.

The state of Missouri is performing its own autopsy on the corpse of Michael Brown, the black teen who was unarmed and shot several times by a white officer.

In a statement, the Department of Justice said: ""Due to the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family, Attorney General Holder has instructed Justice Department officials to arrange for an additional autopsy to be performed by a federal medical examiner. This independent examination will take place as soon as possible.""

Justice Department officials said they will still take the results of the state-performed autopsy ""into account in the course of their investigation.""

Federal officials had previously announced they were {looking into possible civil rights violations}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-looking-into-possible-civil-rights-case-in-michael-brown-shooting/""> in the case.

David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami's U.S. Attorney's office, told the Associated Press a federally conducted autopsy ""more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises"" might help that investigation, and that the move is ""not that unusual.""

The incident in question has been a tale of two sides so far.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt.

""There is a certain level of emotion that must be expressed in order for us to reach a higher plain,"" Nixon said at a meeting of community leaders.

Nixon said he had spoken Thursday morning to President Obama, who expressed concern over the ""violent turn"" of events in Ferguson.

Nixon asked community members to be patient and calm while the investigation proceeds and urged law enforcement agencies to ""keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press.""

""We must make sure that justice prevails without fear or favor,"" Nixon said.

Two reporters said they were detained by police for not clearing out quickly enough from a McDonald's where they were working, near the protests but away from the more volatile areas. The two, who work for The Washington Post and The Huffington Post, were released without any charges. Both say they were assaulted but not seriously hurt.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said officers on Wednesday night tossed tear gas to disperse a large crowd of protesters after some threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers. More than 10 people were arrested in Ferguson.

""In talking to these guys, it is scary,"" Schellman said of officers on the front lines of the protest. ""They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.""

But the{ police response is drawing criticism}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/police-fire-tear-gas-as-protests-turn-violent-in-ferguson-missouri/""> from many circles. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton called Thursday for the Justice Department to monitor Ferguson and the way police are handling the crisis.

""Even if we disagree, this climate is not good for anyone and is dangerous for everyone,"" Sharpton said in a statement.

The police chiefs of Ferguson and St. Louis County said Wednesday that race relations were the top priority in the town, where a white police officer fatally shot the black teen.

A meeting was scheduled for Thursday between civil rights leaders and police.

Officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, ""Hands up, don't shoot."" Protesters faced heavily armed police who at times trained weapons on them from armored trucks.

St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said in a tweet that the suspect was brandishing a knife at the time of the shooting, according to KMOV. Witnesses said he was acting erratically.

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" Obama said.

There were at least five arrests but no reports of looting, St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said. The night before, nearly three dozen people were arrested following a candlelight vigil as crowds burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers.

""People are tired. They have reached the end of their rope,"" Ruth Latchison Nichols said after a crowded town meeting Monday night hosted by the NAACP. ""Enough is enough. This is a state of emergency.""

By early Tuesday, the streets were once again calm. A handful of police officers sat in patrol cars near the burned out gas station, vastly outnumbered by news crews putting together their early reports in Ferguson, which is nearly 70 percent black.

But law enforcement officials were taking every measure to ensure safety, even in the skies above Ferguson. A flight restriction was called in to the Federal Aviation Administration due to a St. Louis County police helicopter being fired at multiple times from the ground Sunday, police spokesman Officer Brian Schellman told CBS News.

""As soon as they feel the air is safe, we'll release it immediately,"" Schellman said. ""The goal is hopefully tonight. We pray that nothing else goes on up there. The situation will dictate that.""

He said through Tuesday afternoon, no further unrest had been reported.

National NAACP President Cornell William Brooks implored residents to ""turn your anger into action"" while condemning the violent response to Brown's death. The organization hosted a community forum Monday that drew hundreds of people.

""To sneak around under the cover of darkness, to steal, to loot, to burn down your neighborhood - this does not require courage,"" he said. ""Courage is when you strive for justice.""

""Martin Luther King did not live and die so that we may steal and lie in the middle of the night,"" he added.

Witnesses have said that Brown had his hands raised when the unidentified officer approached with his weapon drawn and repeatedly fired.

Authorities have been vague about what led the officer to open fire, saying only that the shooting - which is being investigated by St. Louis County police - was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man in which the officer's weapon discharged inside a patrol car.

Ferguson residents said prior to Saturday's shooting, relations between citizens there and police had not been much of an issue. CBS News found four federal complaints against the Ferguson Police Department, all had been thrown out.

Investigators are urging anyone with information about the shooting to come forward, CBS News correspondent Dean Reynolds reported.

Brown's parents, who planned to drop their son off at a technical college Monday, have been among those calling for calm. His family also is asking for people to come forward with information or videos related to the shooting. Police have said there is no security or police video of the incident.

Investigators have also refused to disclose the race of the officer. But witness Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot, and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.

Brown ""was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,"" Walker told The Associated Press.

The officer ""had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times,"" Walker said, adding that the officer then ""stood over him and shot him"" after the victim fell wounded.

Dorian Johnson offered a similar account, telling KMOV-TV that he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of the vehicle.

""We wasn't causing harm to nobody,"" Johnson said. ""We had no weapons on us at all.""

Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away.

""He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down. But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots,"" Johnson said.

Walker said he did not see a scuffle or the circumstances that preceded the first gunshot.

""I don't want to sugarcoat it,"" said the family's attorney, Benjamin Crump. ""(Brown) was executed in broad daylight.""

Crump also represented relatives of Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder charges.",74,33,NA,NACBS,cbs57,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-aug-19-2014/,"This Morning from CBS News: Aug.19, 2014",CBS NEWS,8/19/14,4/22/16,"With the National Guard arriving in Ferguson, Missouri, {protesters collided again with police}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiny-minority-of-lawbreakers-blamed-for-latest-trouble-at-ferguson-missouri-protests/"">.

The public has absorbed images of heavily armed police, snipers trained on protesters and tear gas plumes. Against that backdrop, Attorney General Eric Holder said that when police and citizens need to restore calm, ""I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.""

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said police responses like that in Ferguson have ""become the problem instead of the solution."" Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., said he will introduce legislation to curb the trend of police militarization.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his committee will review the program to determine if the Defense Department's surplus equipment is being used as intended.

One night after the violence that accompanied the presence of military-style equipment in Ferguson, tensions eased when {a police captain, unprotected and shaking hands, walked through a crowd in a gesture of reconciliation}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/officer-in-charge-promises-a-new-day-in-ferguson-missouri/"">. The contrast added to the perception that the tanks and tear gas had done more harm than good.

As the country concludes its longest wartime period, the military has turned over thousands of surplus weapons and armored trucks to local police who often trained alongside the military.

A report by the American Civil Liberties Union in June said police agencies had become ""excessively militarized,"" with officers using training and equipment designed for the battlefield on city streets. The report found the amount of goods transferred through the military surplus program rose in value from $1 million in 1990 to nearly $450 million in 2013.

""Every police force of any size in this country has access to those kinds of weapons now,"" said David Harris, a police expert at the University of Pittsburgh law school. ""It makes it more likely to be used (and) is an escalation all by itself.""

In Louisiana, masked police in full body armor carrying AR-15 assault rifles raided a nightclub without a warrant, looking not for terrorists but underage drinkers and fire-code violations. Officers in California train using the same counterinsurgency tactics as those used in Afghanistan.

""They're not coming in like we're innocent until proven guilty,"" said Quinn Eaker. SWAT teams last August raided his organic farm and community, the Garden of Eden, in Arlington, Texas. ""They're coming in like: 'We're gonna kill you if you move a finger.'""

Police found no drugs or weapons and filed no charges after their search, which authorities said followed standard procedure.

In 1990, Congress authorized the Pentagon to give surplus equipment to police to help fight drugs, which then gave way to the fight against terrorism. Though violent crime nationwide is at its lowest level in generations and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have largely concluded, the military transfers have increased.

Police say the equipment, which includes free body armor, night vision goggles and scopes, keeps officers safe and prepares them for the worst case.

""A lot evolved from the military, no question,"" said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Chief Bill McSweeney, who heads the detective division. ""Is it smart for them to use that stuff and perhaps look like soldiers from Iraq going into a place? Is that smart or over the top? I'd say generally that's smart. Now, if you use that every time a guy is writing bad checks, that's getting rather extreme.""

The U.S. has provided 610 mine-resistant armored trucks, known as MRAPs, across the country, nearly all since August 2013, including at least nine in Los Angeles County, according to Michelle McCaskill, a spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency.

In rural western Maine, the Oxford County Sheriff's Office asked for an MRAP. Cpl. George Cayer wrote in his request that Maine's western foothills face a ""previously unimaginable threat from terrorist activities.""

In Orange County, Florida, masked officers in tactical gear helped state inspectors raid barber shops in 2010 to find people cutting hair without a license. Using a mini battering ram and pry bar at times, police arrested dozens of people. Officials said they found illegal items such as drugs and a weapon.

McSweeney said it's hard to argue that police shouldn't use the best equipment available.

""It's tempting to say, 'Shouldn't we wear these things? Shouldn't we approach this as if we could get shot?'"" he said. ""How do you say no to that question?""

Nick Gragnani, executive director of the St. Louis Area Regional Response System, said such supplies have proved essential in hurricane relief efforts and other disaster responses.

""The shame of it will be ... if somebody does a brushstroke and takes out all the funding and then we can no longer be prepared for that big incident,"" he said.

The LAPD's deputy chief, Michael Downing, who heads the department's counterterrorism and special operations bureau, said officers are dealing with ""an adversary who is more sophisticated, more tactically trained.""

Downing emphasized that though police might train with soldiers, they're not warriors with a mission to kill but public servants with no ""enemies.""

""In police work there are times we have to become soldiers and control through force and fear,"" Downing said. ""But we have to come back to being a public servant as quick as we can to establish that normality and that ethical stature with communities, because they're the ones who give us the authority to do our police work.""",11,332,NA,NACBS,cbs59,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/defense-donations-favored-congressmen-who-back-militarized-police/,Defense donations favored congressmen who back militarized police,Stephanie Condon,8/15/14,4/22/16,"The House of Representatives voted as recently as June on whether or not to keep funding a program that lets the Defense Department give local police forces free military equipment.

The House voted in June on an amendment, sponsored by Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., to partially defund the Defense Department program that transfers military equipment to police. The amendment failed by a vote of 62 to 355.

MapLight examined campaign contributions that House members received, from 2011 through 2013, from PACs and individual employees of employers such as Defense aerospace contractors, Defense shipbuilders, Defense Research & Development firms and others.

While members of Congress {may now be rethinking the program}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/after-missouri-what-can-washington-do-about-militarized-police-forces"">, the Pentagon confirmed that it still supports giving local police forces military equipment like Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected vehicles (MRAPs), pistols, automatic rifles and flashbang grenades.

""This is a useful program that allows for the reuse of military equipment that otherwise would be disposed of that can be used, again, by law enforcement agencies to serve their citizens,"" Navy Rear Adm.

Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., who has produced {legislation }<hyperlink=""http://1.usa.gov/VmPWmm"">that would put several constraints on the federal program, wrote in March about some of the reasons why the defense industry supports the program.

{CBS affiliate KMOV-TV in St. Louis}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/crime/Officer-involved-shooting-in-North-County-overnight-271045551.html""> reports that St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said officers responded to a report of four men wearing ski masks armed with shotguns a block or two east of Ferguson, as well as reports of shots fired in the area.

When they arrived, they found more than two dozen suspects fleeing on foot, Schellman said.

At one point, an officer confronted a suspect who pulled a handgun on the officer, according to the police spokesman.

""In fear for his life, the officer shot the subject,"" Schellman continued. He was taken to a hospital in critical condition. The suspect's handgun was recovered at the scene.

Separately, said Schellman, one person was injured in a drive-by shooting in Ferguson early Wednesday.

He said the incident involved several males in a black sedan, and a female was shot once in the head. He said she was taken to a hospital with injuries that did not appear life-threatening.

Schellman said the shooting occurred in the same vicinity as the protests over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Meanwhile, the Rev. Al Sharpton, Brown's family and others pressed police Tuesday to {release the name}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-police-withholding-name-of-officer-in-fatal-mo-shooting/""> of the officer who shot Brown, an unarmed black teenager, and he pleaded for calm after two nights of violent disturbances over Brown's death.

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said the name of the officer {will not be released}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-police-withholding-name-of-officer-in-fatal-mo-shooting/""> due to fears for his safety, reports CBS News correspondent Mark Strassman.

""This officer has been receiving threats even though his name is not even known,"" Knowles said.

Police Chief Tom Jackson also said he had decided against releasing the officer's name, adding it could be weeks before they do so.

""We're taking the threats seriously"", Jackson said.

Jackson said there have been cyberattacks against the city's website, but that won't compel him to release the officers name. An anonymous global group of hackers had pledged to create mischief with Ferguson's city computers if the name wasn't released.

The officer has been with the force for about six years and was on a routine patrol when he encountered the two young men, Jackson said.

Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. Brown was black.

The mayor of Ferguson said the city has never before faced a racial divide, but acknowledged its police department can improve its recruitment of minority officers. According to the 2010 census, about two-thirds of Ferguson's 22,000 are black, but just three of the 53 members of the town's police department are black.

There were more protests in Ferguson Tuesday night into early Wednesday, but they didn't turn violent, witnesses said.

Still, authorities reported several new arrests.

At one point, police used tear gas to disperse a crowd, reports the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Investigators have released few details of Brown's shooting, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Brown and another teen to get out of the street. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, police said.

""The local authorities have put themselves in a position - hiding names and not being transparent - where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,"" Sharpton said during a news conference in St. Louis at which he was joined by Brown's parents.

He also echoed pleas for peaceful protests by the NAACP and Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., who told the crowd, ""I need all of us to come together and do this right. ... No violence.""

{President Obama also urged calm}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-michael-browns-death-is-heartbreaking/"">, saying people must comfort each other ""in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds."" Mr. Obama called Brown's death ""heartbreaking.""

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, whose appearance was unannounced, told a standing-room only crowd at a community forum Tuesday night that the shooting feels ""like an old wound torn fresh"" in a nation still struggling with race relations.

{KMOV said}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Gov-Nixon-flies-into-town-271010841.html""> Nixon didn't answer reporters' questions about whether he'd call out the National Guard if the civil unrest resumed in Ferguson.

The forum, held at a church, was organized as an alternative response to two nights of unrest in which crowds burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers. Ferguson's mayor and police chief also attended the meeting, and were welcomed with applause.

The fullest account of Brown's death so far has {come from Dorian Johnson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-some-ferguson-missouri-residents-do-not-believe-cops-story/"">, who said he was walking home from a convenience store with Brown when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who, using expletives, ordered them to move to the sidewalk.

In the hours after the shooting, Johnson told news crews that he and Brown had kept walking and explained to the officer they were near their destination. The officer then reversed his car ""to where it almost hit us.""

The officer, Johnson said, tried to open his door, but he was so close to the men that it ""ricocheted"" back. Johnson said the officer then reached through the window, ""grabbed my friend around the neck"" and tried to pull him into the car. The officer then reportedly pulled out his weapon and said, ""'I'll shoot you,' or 'I'm going to shoot,'"" Johnson said.

When the officer opened fire, Brown was hit and started to bleed, Johnson said. Johnson ran to hide behind a car.

Brown ""kept running, and he told me to keep running because he feared for me, too,"" Johnson said.

Johnson said the officer pursued Brown with his weapon drawn and fired again.

When Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. But the officer kept firing, Johnson said.

""And my friend died. He didn't say anything to him. He just stood over and he's shooting.""

Authorities have not commented directly on Johnson's account.

Police have said a scuffle broke out after the officer asked the boys to move to the side. {Witnesses say Brown's arms were in the air}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-some-ferguson-missouri-residents-do-not-believe-cops-story/""> - in a sign of surrender - as a white policeman repeatedly shot the black youth.

After a vigil Sunday night, {an angry crowd looted stores}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/thousands-march-at-vigil-for-teen-killed-in-police-shooting/"">, and a night later police in Ferguson fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse protesters. The U.S. Justice Department has announced that its civil rights division was opening an investigation. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton was to meet with Brown's family on Tuesday as tensions remained high.

Brown was among a small group of students who had graduated Aug. 1 from Normandy High School, needing the summer to finish their required credits.

""We can't even celebrate; we've got to plan a funeral,"" said his tearful mother, Lesley McSpadden.

He had been staying at his grandmother's apartment, where he would often hang out in the parking lot tossing a football with friends, said Markese Mull, a neighbor whose 17-year-old-son was one of Brown's closer friends.

Brown was an aspiring rapper, though it was more of a hobby. This week, he was supposed to start college in pursuit of a career as a heating and air conditioning engineer. On the day of this death, Brown had walked with another friend to a nearby convenience store. Mull saw them in the street and honked his horn to say to ""hi"" - just minutes before the police officer came by.

""He was never a person who liked confrontation,"" Mull said. ""His smile was going to make you smile.""

Neighbors described Brown as quiet and respectful - a ""good boy,"" who ""was never in trouble,"" said Sharon Johnson, 58, who lives just a little ways down the street. Johnson said Brown would frequently stop to chat.

""We talked about how when you turn yourself to the Lord you feel so good - and good things come your way,"" Johnson said. ""He had a more mature mind than a little boy's mind.""

On Monday, Johnson was standing at the side of the street where Brown was shot as a woman who had driven in from a nearby community preached loudly to anyone willing to listen about the importance of peaceful protests and parental discipline for teenagers.

A passing car stopped, letting out a man wearing a newly made black T-shirt bearing Brown's baby picture and the words ""NO JUSTICE NO PEACE.""

""I'm his father,"" he said somberly, eliciting hugs.

The older Brown picked up a piece of cardboard that had been lying on the ground. ""End police brutality,"" it read. He placed it on a pile of toy animals stacked by a streetlight pole, then set about straightening up his son's mid-street memorial.

He had just returned to the grass when a gunshot rang out. Then another. And another.

If confirmed, this would be a hugely symbolic and strategic victory in the months-long battle against the insurgents.

The U.S. hopes to contain ISIS, using air power, until the Iraqi government and other regional powers can neutralize the threat.

""The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time,"" Mr. Obama said in a statement.

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.

In a rare move for him, the president planned a break in the middle of his {Martha's Vineyard vacation}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/presidential-vacations-can-be-anything-but/""> to return to Washington on Sunday night for meetings with Vice President Joe Biden and other advisers.

The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions. But Sunday afternoon, they revealed at least two things on the agenda: Attorney General Eric Holder will brief the president on the latest developments in Ferguson, Mo., where there have been ongoing clashes between protesters and police over the {shooting death of teenager Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">, and he will receive an briefing from the National Security Council on the {crisis in Iraq}<hyperlink=""/isis/"">.

""The President has been getting regular briefings on the situation in Ferguson, including this morning by [senior adviser] Valerie Jarrett. Valerie spoke with Governor Nixon yesterday to get an update and offer the administration's continued coordination and support with state and local officials. Over past few days, Valerie has also been in touch with civil rights leaders, including Al Sharpton and NAACP President Cornell Brooks,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Sunday.

Part of the decision appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises.

Yet those crises turned the first week of Obama's vacation into a working holiday. He made on-camera statements on {U.S. military action in Iraq}<hyperlink=""/isis/""> and the {clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting-protests/"">. He called foreign leaders to discuss the {tensions between Ukraine and Russia}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/ukraine-crisis/"">, as well as {between Israel and Hamas}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/israel-gaza-conflict/"">.

""I think it's fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that's why you've seen the president stay engaged,"" Schultz said.

Obama is scheduled to return to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend.

Even though work has occupied much of Obama's first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island.

He also attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan's wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

That get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama's vacation. Just as Obama was arriving on Martha's Vineyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which {she levied some of her sharpest criticism of Obama's foreign policy}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-seeks-distance-from-obama-on-foreign-policy/"">.
