LOUIS COUNTY, Mo. – An 18-year-old shot and killed near a Ferguson apartment complex Saturday afternoon had no criminal record, according to the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s office.

According to police, Brown pushed a Ferguson Police Department officer into his car. Then, both struggled and at some point, Brown reached for the officer’s weapon before a shot fired inside of the car followed by a number of other shots. Brown was not armed.

St. Louis County Prosecutor’s office confirmed that Brown had no prior misdemeanors or felonies against him.

A preliminary autopsy showed Brown died from gunshot wounds. An official autopsy will be released later.

DetroitFreePress,freep2,http://www.freep.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-to-name-officer-in-michael-brown-shooting/14100217/,"Ferguson police ID officer, say Brown suspected in robbery before shooting",David A. Lieb,08/15/2014,02/16/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. – A suburban St. Louis police chief on Friday identified the officer whose fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager ignited days of heated protests, and released documents alleging the teen was killed after a robbery in which he was suspected of stealing a $48.99 box of cigars.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released several police reports and documents during a news conference where he also identified the officer involved as Darren Wilson, who has been on administrative leave since he shot 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9.

Jackson says the officer didn’t know the teen was a robbery suspect at the time of the shooting.

Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, were suspected of taking the cigars from a convenience store in Ferguson that morning, according to police reports. Jackson said Wilson went to the area after a 911 call reporting a “strong-arm” robbery just before noon. He said a dispatcher gave a description of the suspect, and that Wilson encountered Brown a few minutes before another officer arrived.

Jackson said Wilson is a six-year veteran of the police department, but he refused to release any other details about the officer.

The family’s attorney, Benjamin Crump, accused police of trying to draw attention away from Brown’s death. He said Brown’s parents were “incensed” by what he calls “the old game of smoke and mirrors.”

“It’s bad enough they assassinated him, and now they’re trying to assassinate his character,” Crump said.

Johnson acknowledged to the FBI and other investigators that he and Brown went to the store and “that he did take cigarillos,” his attorney, Freeman Bosley, told MSNBC.

Bosley said he was aware of security video from the store but had not seen it.

Police released security video, dated Aug. 9, that appears to show a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store’s door. A police report alleges that Brown grabbed a man who had come from behind the store counter by his shirt and “forcefully pushed him back” into a display rack.

Brown’s uncle, Bernard Ewing, questioned whether Wilson really believed Brown was a suspect. He noted Johnson’s account that the officer told the two young men to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk, and that Brown had his hands up when he was shot.

“If he’s a robbery suspect, they would have had the lights on,” Ewing said. “If you rob somebody, you would tell them, ‘Get on the ground’ or something, not, ‘Get off the sidewalk.’ ”

“It still doesn’t justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,” he added. “You still don’t shoot him in the face.”

Brown’s death has sparked several days of clashes with furious protesters in the city. The mood was quelled on Thursday after the governor {turned oversight of the protests over to the state Highway Patrol}<hyperlink=""http://www.freep.com/"">. State troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of peaceful protesters replaced the image of previous nights: police in riot gear and armored tanks.

But the police chief’s announcement Friday was met with immediate disbelief and anger by several dozen community members who also attended the news conference, which was hastily held at a gas station burned during a night of looting earlier in the week in Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

“He stopped the wrong one, bottom line,” yelled Tatinisha Wheeler, a nurse’s aide who was at the news conference.

A couple dozen protesters began marching, chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!”

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer’s weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times, according to police.

Dorian Johnson has told media a different story. He said an officer ordered him and Brown onto the sidewalk, then grabbed his friend’s neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He said Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Tensions in Ferguson boiled over after a candlelight vigil Sunday night, as looters smashed and burned businesses in the neighborhood, where police have repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

By Thursday, there was a dramatic shift in the atmosphere after Gov. Jay Nixon assigned protest oversight to Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black and grew up near Ferguson. He marched alongside protesters.

“We’re here to serve and protect,” Johnson said. “We’re not here to instill fear.”

The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell — the point at which previous protests have grown tense — no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store, which had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.

“All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,” Pedro Smith, who has participated in the nightly protests, said Thursday. “This is totally different. Now we’re being treated with respect.”

The more tolerant response came as {President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time}<hyperlink=""http://www.freep.com/""> about the shooting — and the subsequent violence. Obama said there was “no excuse” for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.

Jay Nixon said the National Guard would help “in restoring peace and order” to Ferguson, where protests over the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer entered their second week. Police said they acted in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails.

Gov. Jay Nixon said the National Guard would help “in restoring peace and order” to Ferguson, where protests over the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer entered their second week. Police said they acted in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails.

“These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served and to feel safe in their own homes,” Nixon said in a statement.

The latest confrontations came on the same day Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on Brown, and as a preliminary private autopsy reported by The New York Times found Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

As night fell in Ferguson Sunday, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated and the streets were empty well before the midnight curfew.

“Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of response,” said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is command in Ferguson. At least two people were wounded in shootings by civilians, he said.

The “extraordinary circumstances” surrounding Brown’s death and a request by his family prompted the Justice Department’s decision to conduct a third autopsy, agency spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement. The examination was to take place as soon as possible, Fallon said.

The results of a state-performed autopsy would be taken into account along with the federal examination in the Justice Department’s ongoing civil rights investigation, Fallon said.

Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, told the New York Times that one of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when he suffered a fatal injury.

Brown also was shot four times in the right arm, and all the bullets were fired into his front, Baden said

The Justice Department already had deepened its investigation into the shooting. A day earlier, officials said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson neighborhood where Brown was shot to death Aug. 9.

A federally conducted autopsy “more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises” might help that investigation, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami’s U.S. attorney’s office.

Federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case, Weinstein said.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

Sunday’s clashes in Ferguson erupted three hours before the curfew imposed by Nixon. Officers in riot gear ordered all the protesters to disperse, and many did, but about 100 stood about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley of tear gas.

Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the street in an apparent attempt to block police vehicles, which easily plowed through. Someone set a trash bin on fire, and the crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away.

Within two hours, most people had been cleared off West Florissant Avenue, one of the community’s main thoroughfares. The streets remained quiet as the curfew began. It was to remain in effect until 5 a.m.

Earlier in the day, Johnson said he had met members of Brown’s family and the experience “brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart.”

“When this is over,” he told the crowd, “I’m going to go in my son’s room. My black son, who wears his pants sagging, who wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, but that’s my baby.”

Johnson added: “We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael’s going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.”

The protests have been going on since Brown’s death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Nixon to put the state highway patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson police waited six days to {publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store}<hyperlink=""http://www.freep.com/""> shortly before he was killed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a robbery suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

The officer who shot Brown has been identified as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting, and the department has refused to comment on his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.",NA,NA,NA,“ “

Johnson, who grew up near Ferguson, said people need to show respect to each other.

FERGUSON, Mo. — Hundreds of protesters are gathering near the flashpoint where riots and civil unrest have unfolded here in recent days, but so far no violent clashes have been reported.

President Obama called for peace and calm in Ferguson, after meeting with Attorney General Eric Holder about repeated clashes between police and protesters after the shooting death of Brown, who was unarmed, on Saturday.

Obama: 'Emotions are raw'

""I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,"" Obama said from his vacation in Edgartown, Mass.

""But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law; a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protes.""

Holder said after meeting with Obama that he was ""deeply concerned"" about the deployment of military equipment and vehicles in Ferguson. The Justice Department is investigating the death of Brown, which sparked the protests, for possible violations of state law or civil rights.

Holder said trust must be rebuilt between law enforcement and the community, and he was offering assistance through the COPS office and the Office of Justice Programs to help crowd control and maintain public safety

""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" Holder said. The technical assistance from Justice is aimed at maintaining public safety ""without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.""

Darryl Parks, an attorney for Michael Brown's family, said Brown's mother met with two attorneys from the U.S. Department Justice's Civil Rights Division and two prosecutors from the office of the U.S. Attorney Eastern District of Missouri.

The 1:30 p.m. meeting lasted about an hour with the officials not going into details about their work but ensuring a fair and through investigation into Brown's death and possible civil rights violations.

""This family feels far better today about the investigation that is taking place,"" Parks said.

""It gives them real assurance that a proper investigation is taking place and that as the truth comes out the responsible person will be held accountable for what he did to Michael Brown,"" Parks said. ""They have a lot more confidence and trust in what the feds are going to do compared to what the state was doing.""

The federal officials didn't provide any specifics about their investigative plans or what they have already learned. The DOJ has already talked to some witnesses but did note give Lesley McSpadden, Brown's mother, a timeline for when they might conclude.

Parks said Brown's family will likely meet with the officials again as the investigation continues.

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said she thought the police resonse had become part of the problem. ""The police response needs to be demilitarized,"" she said.

Investigation into Brown

KSDK-TV reports that the FBI will take over a large part of the investigation into the shooting incident that has led to four days of violent protests in the city.

The St. Louis County Police Department has been in charge of the investigation into the unarmed black teenager's death and with securing the streets of the city during the confrontations between protesters and law enforcement.

It was not immediately clear how removing the county police force would affect the Ferguson Police Department, which is a separate law enforcement entity. It was a Ferguson police officer who was involved in the fatal shooting of Brown that has angered the largely African-American community of around 20,000 people.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson echoed the view that the police would change how they interact with protesters.

""We are going to try to facilitate the protests tonight and we hope the protesters will recognize that we are trying to help everybody bring the tension down,"" he said at a news conference Thursday.

""It's a powder keg, and we all recognize that,"" he said. ""What's happening now is not what anyone of us want... We need to get everyone to calm down.""

But he also said that the police was prepared to respond forcefully to violence. ""We have to respond to deadly force,"" he said. ""We certainly don't want to have any violence on our part.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Edward McGee, spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, said local investigators have interviewed Ferguson, Mo., police Officer Darren Wilson and he will be ""offered the opportunity'' to testify if he chooses.

Magee said the case will be presented to a regular grand jury that already has been seated. He said the panel has a few weeks remaining in its current term.

He did not know how long it would take to present the case.

""We will extend the term, if necessary,'' Magee said.

Also Tuesday, local leaders pleaded for calm and promised changes in the police department as the city braced for another night of protests and, possible, confrontation.

""We plan to learn from this tragedy,"" city officials said in a statement.

Officials are working to increase the number of black law enforcement applicants and raise funds for cameras for patrol car dashboards and officer vests.

Ten days of protests and violence are taking their toll on this normally quiet city of 21,000 people 12 miles from St. Louis.

""This has to stop,"" Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Johnson said Tuesday.

Johnson is charged with bringing peace to a city torn apart by violence since Brown, 18, was fatally shot by a Ferguson police officer, setting off the angry protests that have made international headlines.

Brown's funeral will be Monday, family lawyer Benjamin Crump said.

On Tuesday, more sad news. A 23-year-old man was fatally shot by a police officer in north St. Louis, just a few miles from Ferguson. Authorities said he had threatened officers with a knife after imploring them to kill him.

In Ferguson, streets were quiet Tuesday, hours after peaceful demonstrations once again descended into chaos with police coming ""under heavy gunfire"" and arresting 78 people.

Johnson said four police officers were injured by thrown rocks and bottles, at least two people were shot and two fires were set during another night of clashes between police and protesters that lasted into early Tuesday.

Johnson lauded local police, state troopers and National Guard personnel, saying they ""acted with restraint and calm."" He said police were shot at but did not fire any shots themselves.

""I don't want anyone to get hurt. I don't want an officer to get hurt, I don't want a citizen to get hurt. We have to find a way to stop it.""

Even in daylight hours, life has not returned to normal. The school year had been scheduled to begin more than a week ago, but Ferguson-Florissant district officials canceled classes last week due to the unrest. Then they canceled Monday. Now they say they will try for next Monday.

""This decision was made after much careful deliberation and consideration of input received from local law enforcement officials and District security staff,"" the district said in a statement. ""We believe that closing schools for the rest of this week will allow needed time for peace and stability to be restored to our community and allow families to plan ahead for the additional days that children will be out of school.""

Businesses are hurting. Kathleen Osborn, executive director of The Regional Business Council in the St. Louis area, said about 25 business have been directly damaged by violence, many more simply by fear that is keeping so many residents from leaving their homes.

""The tragedy of it is that we are talking about small businesses,"" she told USA TODAY. ""Yet they are extraordinarily resilient. Some of these business owners get up in the morning, clean up their damage and open their stores. The problem is that you can't get them fully back in order until you know there won't be any more damage.""

Ali Rafiq, whose parents have owned the Subway restaurant in the heart of the protest zone, told CNN the shop has lost about 60% of its daily revenue -- about $1,000 a day -- since the protests began. Rafiq blamed protesters and journalists for taking up parking spaces in the area, leaving few spots for customers.

""It's almost more of an issue to go up to people and ask them to move their car and get backlash,"" said Rafiq. ""It's easier to let them park.""

Most protesters say they just want justice -- and the truth. A grand jury could begin hearing the case as soon as Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. It was unclear how long it might take for a decision on whether Wilson should face criminal charges for Brown's death.

Many protesters realize the violence has to stop. Monday night, a group of people trying to keep the peace locked arms and managed to position themselves between the more confrontational protesters and the police line. However, while many among the protesters clamored for calm, some in the crowd appeared determined to provoke an incident.

Johnson said some of those arrested were from as far away as New York and California — part of what he called ""a dangerous dynamic of the night.""

In fact, of the 78 arrests, only four were Ferguson residents. Eighteen were from out of state.

""Our peaceful protesters are not the enemy,"" Johnson said. ""Tonight we closed the roadway; we allowed those who come in peace to walk the roadway.""

And before the protests escalated, demonstrators crowded around well-known rapper Nelly, who is from St. Louis, and who was marching with protesters in Ferguson Monday night.

Nelly, who wore a white T-shirt with ""#MikeBrown"" stamped on it in black letters, cautioned the crowd to remain peaceful.

""It's a lot of people out for themselves that's out here right now,"" Nelly said. ""They are overshadowing people.""

He added that people needed a solution that goes past traditional ways of protesting.

""The way we approach the problem is the same every single time,"" Nelly said. ""We get angry. We march. We sing ... We don't strategize. All we do is react.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

More than two hours before the curfew was set to begin late Sunday, police fired tear gas at hundreds of angry protesters who were marching down the town's main thoroughfare toward a police command center.

County police tweeted that protesters were throwing ""Molotov cocktails"" at police, but protesters, including Renita Lamkin, a pastor who has been acting as a peacekeeper, said no one threw Molotov cocktails. ""That is not true,"" she said. Meanwhile, a police announcer told the crowd, ""This is no longer a peaceful protest. You must leave the area.""

But protesters moving away from police faced a greater threat: gunshots coming from the other direction.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declined Sunday to say when he expects the curfew to end or whether it would be extended further. ""We'd like to see it ratcheted down,"" NIxon said. ""What we'd like to see, that will be judged by the community."" Speaking on CNN, Nixon said he was ""heartened"" by the response to the curfew early Sunday.

At a rally Sunday afternoon, the civil rights attorney who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old shot to death in Sanford, Fla., in 2012., told a crowd that police are trying to assassinate Brown's character. On Friday, when police named Officer Darren Wilson as the officer who shot Brown, they also released a surveillance video that appears to show Brown stealing cigars from a convenience store and roughing up the clerk a few minutes before the fatal confrontation.

""They tried it with Trayvon, and now they are trying it with Michael,"" Benjamin Crump said. ""We know that this was an execution."" He noted that when the officer fired, witnesses say, Brown had his hands raised above his head. ""This means 'Surrender! Don't shoot!' And the most hardened criminals in history, when they put their hands up, we didn't execute them,"" Crump said.

Civil rights activist Al Sharpton told the crowd that protests would continue.

""We are not going to shut up,"" he said. ""We are going to come together and have a real peace.""

He told protesters not to loot in Brown's name. ""There's a difference between an activist and a thug,"" Sharpton said.

Donations for Brown's family poured in at the rally. Speakers announced that all three of Brown's siblings would receive full college scholarships. TV's Judge Greg Mathis announced that he would give the family $10,000. Sharpton said his National Action Network would pay for Brown's funeral. He encouraged others to give the family money. Donors filled several large baskets with cash. Sharpton said the money would go directly to the family.

He announced that a class-action lawsuit would be filed on behalf of Ferguson protesters who were tear-gassed while demonstrating and others who were injured. Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers for Justice and members of the New Black Panther Party have said they would file a lawsuit because they believe protesters' civil rights had been violated.

At the rally, Ron Johnson, the Missouri Highway Patrol captain at the head of security here, said protesters ""need to pray. We need to thank Mike for his life. We need to thank him for the change that he is going to make.""

Johnson told an animated crowd that Brown's violent death at the hands of police on Aug. 9 ""is going to make it for our sons so that they can be better black men. He's going to make it better for our daughters so they can be better black women, better for me so I can be a better black father. And we know they're going to make our mamas even better than they are today.""

Johnson, who is African-American and lives in nearby Florissant, told the crowd, ""This is my neighborhood. You are my family, you are my friends, and I am you. And I will stand and protect you. I will protect your right to protest.""

He said that when the protests are over, ""I'm going to go in my son's room — my black son, who wears his pants sagging, wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms — but that's my baby."" The crowd cheered loudly.

About 150 people rallied in downtown St. Louis on Sunday evening in support of Wilson, the officer who shot Brown. Passersby honked and cheered in support.

The Justice Department said Sunday that it would arrange for an independent autopsy of Brown's body ""due to the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family.""

The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy concluded that Brown died of gunshot wounds, but other details have not been released.

During protests after the rally, 44-year-old LaDonna Hurd said she brought her two daughters Layla Green, 7, and Kentavia Taylor, 16, from their home in Belleville, Ill., about 25 minutes away.

""I feel like they need to be part of this,"" Hurd said. ""They need to know prejudices are still there.""

She said she brought her daughters to experience the protests firsthand because she wanted them to know that the struggles and issues that motivated Martin Luther King remain and must be challenged.

""I feel like in numbers we can get things done,"" she said. ""This is history.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

It can be an act of communal madness, reflecting the emotional imbecility of those who believe the best way to express joy at their ball team’s win is to overturn a car.

It can be an act of opportunism, a chance, under cover of darkness, influence of chaos, suspension of order, to smash and grab and run away, arms heavy with loot.

And it can be an act of outcry, a scream of inchoate rage.

That’s what happened this week in Ferguson, Missouri. The people screamed.

To believe that this carnage — the windows smashed, the buildings torched, the tear gas wafting — is all about the killing of Michael Brown is to miss the point. Brown, of course, was the unarmed 18{-year-old African-American man shot multiple times by a Ferguson police officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/2014/08/13/dorian-johnson-michael-brown-eyewitness/13986845/""> on Saturday.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar — Ferguson Police asked his department, as an outside agency, to investigate the shooting — has said Brown was walking with another individual when a so-far unnamed officer sitting in a police car, stopped him. According to Belmar, the officer was trying to get out of his car when one of the two individuals pushed him back inside, where there was a struggle over the officer’s weapon and at least one shot was discharged. He says the officer came out of the car and fired, striking Brown, who was about 35 feet away, multiple times.

Witnesses say Brown, who was to have started college this week, had his hands up when he was shot. Police have not said why the officer felt the need to stop him in the first place.

Details are still too sketchy for us to draw hard conclusions about what happened that afternoon. But it is all too easy to understand what happened afterward and why good people should be paying attention.

Because, again, this is not just about Brown. It’s about Eric Garner, choked to death in a confrontation with New York City Police. It’s about Jordan Davis, shot to death in Jacksonville, Fla., because he played his music too loud. It’s about Trayvon Martin, shot to death in Sanford, Fla., because a self-appointed neighborhood guardian judged him a thug. It’s about Oscar Grant, shot by a police officer in an Oakland, Calif., subway station as cellphone cameras watched. It’s about Amadou Diallo, executed in that vestibule and Abner Louima, sodomized with that broomstick. It’s about Rodney King.

And it is about the bitter sense of siege that lives in African-American men, a sense that it is perpetually open season on us.

And that too few people outside of African America really notice, much less care. People who look like you are every day deprived of health, wealth, freedom, opportunity, education, the benefit of the doubt, the presumption of innocence, life itself — and when you try to say this, even when you document it with academic studies and buttress it with witness testimony, people don’t want to hear it, people dismiss you, deny you, lecture you about white victimhood, chastise you for playing a so-called “race card.”

They choke off avenues of protest, prizing silence over justice, mistaking silence for peace. And never mind that sometimes silence simmers like water in a closed pot on a high flame.

One can never condone a riot. It is a self-defeating act that sells some fleeting illusion of satisfaction at a high cost in property and life.

But understanding this does not preclude recognizing that the anger we see in Ferguson did not spring from nowhere, nor arrive, fully-formed, when Michael Brown was shot. It is the anger of people who are, as Fannie Lou Hamer famously said, sick and tired of being sick and tired.

Silence imposed on pain cannot indefinitely endure. People who are hurting will always, eventually, make themselves heard.

DetroitFreePress,freep8,http://www.freep.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/19/police-lob-tear-gas-smoke-grenades-at-ferguson-protesters/14271767/,Calm returns to Ferguson after night of chaos,Larry Copeland; Charisse Jones,08/19/2014,02/17/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. – Schools were closed and streets were quiet Tuesday, hours after peaceful demonstrations once again descended into chaos with police coming “under heavy gunfire” and arresting 31 people.

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said four police officers were injured by thrown rocks and bottles, at least two people were shot, and two fires were set during another night of clashes between police and protesters.

Johnson said “officers came under heavy gunfire” during the night, but said officers did not fire a single shot. They “acted with restraint and calm,” he said.

The violence has become a nightly event since Michael Brown, 18, was fatally shot by a Ferguson police officer, setting off angry protests that have claimed international headlines.

Amid the tense situation, a group of people trying to keep the peace locked arms and managed to position themselves between the more confrontational protesters and the police line. However, while many among the protesters clamored for calm, some in the crowd appeared determined to provoke an incident.

Johnson said some of those arrested were from as far away as New York and California — part of what he called “a dangerous dynamic of the night.”

“Our peaceful protesters are not the enemy,” Johnson said. “Tonight we closed the roadway; we allowed those who come in peace to walk the roadway.”

Police ordered the media to move away from the scene of the confrontation to their command center, about one mile away.

Earlier, Scott Olson, a news photographer with Getty Images, became the latest journalist to be arrested, according to Pancho Bernasconi, Getty’s vice president for news. He was later released, and in a statement Getty said he would continue working in Ferguson.

And before the protests escalated, demonstrators crowded around well known rapper Nelly, who is from St. Louis, and who was marching with protesters in Ferguson Monday night.

Nelly, who wore a white T-shirt with “#MikeBrown” stamped on it in black letters, cautioned the crowd to remain peaceful.

“It’s a lot of people out for themselves that’s out here right now,” Nelly said. “They are overshadowing people.”

He added that people needed a solution that goes past traditional ways of protesting.

“The way we approach the problem is the same every single time,” Nelly said. “We get angry. We march. We sing ... We don’t strategize. All we do is react.”

Others had their own tense encounters with the police. In one instance Monday afternoon, St. Louis County police officers arrested a man walking on a sidewalk.

Two police officers tackled the man to the ground while onlookers shouted that the man wasn’t doing anything wrong.

“I didn’t see anybody behaving in any way that would instigate for the police to do anything,” said Ben Mengis, 55, of St. Louis County, who said he was standing 10 feet from the incident. “He did not do anything.”

A police spokesman could not be reached for comment.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Monday dropped the curfew that had been in effect for two nights in an ill-fated effort to curb the violence that has ripped this city since Brown, an unarmed black pedestrian, was shot to death by white police officer Darren Wilson, 28.

Nixon announced that the National Guard would assume “limited responsibilities” to help keep order during nighttime protests over the shooting.

Most of the National Guard units that had been summoned by Nixon appeared early Tuesday to be keeping their distance from the protests and protecting a police staging area.

“With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard,” Nixon said in a written statement.

“This has to stop,” Johnson said early Tuesday morning. “I don’t want anyone to get hurt. I don’t want an officer to get hurt, I don’t want a citizen to get hurt. We have to find a way to stop it.”

A grand jury may begin hearing the case on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. It was unclear how long it might take for a decision on whether Wilson should face criminal charges for Brown’s death",NA,NA,NA,NA

Police and about 200 protesters clashed in Ferguson, Missouri, late Friday after another tense day in the St. Louis suburb that began with authorities identifying the officer who fatally shot Brown as 28-year-old Darren Wilson. At the same time, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released documents alleging Brown had stolen a $48.99 box of cigars from the convenience store and strong-armed a man on his way out.

Just before midnight, some in what had been a large, rowdy but mostly peaceful crowd broke into that same small store, Ferguson Market & Liquor, and began looting it, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said. Some protesters yelled at the aggressors to stop what they were doing, and about a dozen people eventually helped protect the convenience store.

Teams of police officers holding rifles and dressed in riot gear used their cars to block a one-mile stretch of West Florissant Avenue, the street at the center of the protests. Occasional firecrackers sounded in the distance.

Some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Johnson said. One officer was hurt; details were not immediately available. Johnson said police backed off to try and ease the tension. No arrests were made.

“We had to evaluate the security of the officers there and also the rioters,” Johnson said. “We just felt it was better to move back.”

Johnson said he believed other stores were hit by looters. The crowd that had surrounded the convenience store dispersed but continued north. Two men in white undershirts threw debris through the windows of a liquor store and could be seen walking through the store as an alarm wailed.

Brown’s death had previously ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Gov. Jay Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But Friday night marked a resurgence of the unrest that had momentarily abated.

Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly.

Jackson’s decision to spell out the allegations that Brown committed the robbery, and his releasing of surveillance video, angered Brown’s family and many in the community.

“They have attempted to taint the investigation,” U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay told protesters through a bullhorn Friday night. “They are trying to influence a jury pool by the stunt they pulled today.”

Family attorney Daryl Parks acknowledged the man in the footage “appears to be” Brown. But he and others said Brown’s family was blindsided by the allegations and release of the footage. They said that even if it was Brown, the crime didn’t justify the shooting after Brown put up his hands in surrender, as witnesses describe.

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said police “are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style” killing.

The surveillance video shows a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store’s door. A police report alleges Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and “forcefully pushed him back” into a display rack.

Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, did not know the teen was a robbery suspect at the time of the shooting and stopped Brown and a companion “because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic,” Jackson said Friday. Police said they found evidence of the stolen merchandise on Brown’s body.

Wilson is a six-year police veteran — two in neighboring Jennings and four in Ferguson — and had no previous complaints filed against him, Jackson said, describing him as “a gentle, quiet man” who had been “an excellent officer.”

The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson’s whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley asked Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster on Friday to take over the case, saying he did not believe McCulloch could be objective. Koster said Missouri law does not allow it unless McCulloch opts out, and McCulloch spokesman Ed Magee said the prosecutor has no plans to surrender the case.

Also Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said that FBI agents had conducted several interviews with witnesses as part of a civil-rights investigation into Brown’s death. In the days ahead, the agents planned to canvass the neighborhood for more information, the statement said.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Except this was in Middle America and the civilian population was made up of people demonstrating with their hands up to protest the police shooting of an unarmed black teen.

A day after St. Louis County Police clashed with protesters here, throwing tear gas canisters, shooting rubber bullets and using long-range acoustic weapons meant to cause ear-splitting pain, Ferguson has ignited a national debate over local police use of military-style tactics and equipment. Is it effective policing or an excessive display of force?

The St. Louis County police department, which has been patrolling Ferguson during the unrest following the death of

18-year-old Michael Brown

, has been criticized for heavy-handed tactics that include intimidating peaceful protesters.
“At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,” Attorney General Eric Holder said in a written statement Thursday. “The law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them.” “

Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon promised Thursday a “different tone” and an “operational shift” by police on the protest-wracked streets of Ferguson. He directed the State Highway Patrol to take over supervision of security.

Some critics say the military-style policing has worsened an already volatile situation.

“The police response needs to be demilitarized,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat. “I think the police response has become part of the problem as opposed to being part of the solution. We’ve all got to take a deep breath and realize that the vast majority of people protesting have a constitutional right.”

Francis Slay, mayor of St. Louis, said the situation has been mishandled. “It creates a higher level of anxiety and higher level of anger,” he said. His city’s government and police force are separate from neighboring St. Louis County, where Ferguson is located.

Anxiety was evident in Ferguson. Since the shooting Saturday afternoon, the St. Louis County Police SWAT unit patrolled the town dressed in fatigues, carrying automatic assault rifles and driving tanks.

The effect was a city turned war zone.

Officers faced angry protesters, some of whom destroyed parts of the city. They pointed rifles at vehicles that got too close. They yelled at reporters to duck behind their cars or risk being shot in the crossfire.

The tension reached a breaking point Wednesday when St. Louis County Police arrived with four armored trucks. Officers in gas masks and fatigues yelled at protesters to leave.

“We won’t tolerate non-peaceful actions,” an officer yelled through a loudspeaker Wednesday night. He told protesters to put down their rocks and weapons, though no rocks had been thrown and no weapons were visible. People who had been singing and playing drums grew angry and yelled back.

Sierra Smith, who lives in the apartment complex at the center of the protests, told the governor on Thursday that her neighborhood has been under police siege since Brown’s death.

“Every night we’re tormented,” she said. “The police have no respect at all for the community.”

But Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, a union that represents more than 325,000 officers nationwide, defended the actions of the Ferguson and St. Louis County police. He said he had spoken with officers there who told him they have been responding to violence from people who have looted, started fires and thrown rocks and bottles at them.

He said the police here have used as much restraint as possible, including verbal commands and non-lethal weapons such as tear gas and bean bag rounds, to break up crowds. Canterbury said a large crowd that is unruly, or appears likely to become unruly, requires a strong show of force to control it.

“You don’t retreat,” said Canterbury, a 26-year veteran of the Horry County Police Department in Conway, S.C. “We have to protect property and we have to protect people.”

Much of the high-tech gear seen in Ferguson is to protect police, he said.

The military appearance is “more a perception than reality,” he said. “They are two different things. The military is trained to engage and law enforcement is trained to defuse.”

Thomas Nolan, a 27-year veteran of the Boston Police Department who heads the criminal justice department at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, calls the pictures coming out of Ferguson a “black mark on contemporary policing practices.

“We are are absolutely seeing the most visible manifestation possible of the militarization of police,” he said.

The trend grew nationwide after 9/11, when police work expanded from community policing to include homeland security, but it is overkill to use armored personnel carriers, long-range acoustic weapons and other military weapons on civilians in the USA, he said.

“I predict that future law enforcement training will include this episode as how not to engage a crowd,” Nolan said. “This will be in every police academy in the country.”

Al Sharpton spoke against “over-policing of low-level alleged crimes” in the wake of the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.

The shooting of Brown, an unarmed black teenager, one week ago has stoked days of racial unrest in that largely black suburb and questions about the militaristic tactics police have used to quell rioting and looting there.

As supporters packed into rows of red chairs at the National Action Network (NAN), Sharpton cited the recent death of Eric Garner, who died last month after being placed in a choke hold by a New York City police officer.

“Eric Garner or Michael Brown could have been us,” Sharpton told the crowd.

In Brown’s case, police released documents Friday that the teen was a suspect in a strong-armed robbery. Police suspected Garner, 43, of selling untaxed cigarettes.

“It’s not only for my son,” said Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, who spoke at the rally. “It’s for Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo. It could be for your son next, your husband next.”

Sharpton urged people to protest against injustice in a responsible way.

“There is a difference between having a fit and having a movement,” he said.

Toney Lee and his wife, Jacqueline Johnson-Lee, were among the supporters of Sharpton in attendance.

“Young black men are under attack,” said Toney Lee, CEO of the music company Total Success Records International. “This happens over and over and over again.”

Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York — who took the stage after Sharpton — also talked of issues with the state court system and pressed for more federal involvement.

Kirsten John Foy, the northeastern regional director of NAN, said a planned rally for next Saturday in Staten Island would apply pressure for an indictment for those involved in Garner’s death.

“Every officer on the scene played some part in Eric’s death,” he says. The group plans to converge at the area where Garner died and do a march through Staten Island that will end near a police precinct.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Lieb; Jim Salter,08/14/2014,02/17/2016,"FLORISSANT, Mo. – The Missouri State Highway Patrol will take over supervising security in the St. Louis suburb that has been the scene of violent protests since a police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager, the governor announced Thursday.

Gov. Jay Nixon made the announcement that security will be overseen by Capt. Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol after the local police response drew heavy criticism.

Nixon said the change is intended to make sure “that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately.”

Johnson, who is black, said he grew up in the community and “it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence.”

“Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,” Nixon said at a news conference.

Crowds have gathered to protest since Saturday’s shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. On Sunday night, some residents were seen looting stores, damaging buildings and vandalizing property.

Since then, officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” a reference to witness accounts that Brown had his hands raised when he was shot.

Police have used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse large crowds, including on Wednesday night when some people threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers.

Nixon, who has faced increasing criticism over suggestions he has not done enough to calm tensions, said local police will still be involved in providing security, but under state supervision.

Earlier Thursday, President Barack Obama appealed for “peace and calm” on the streets.

“I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,” Obama said. “But let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.”

Obama, speaking from the Massachusetts island where he’s on a two-week vacation, said there was no excuse for excessive force by police in the aftermath of the shooting. He said he had asked the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate the incident.

Early Thursday evening, St. Louis County Police and state troopers were walking alongside demonstrators marching through the streets of Ferguson. Several marchers stopped to shake hands with officers. One woman hugged Capt. Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol, who is overseeing security.

The scene stands in stark contrast to earlier this week when officers in riot gear and in military equipment clashed with protesters. Crowds have gathered each day since Saturday’s shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Johnson told the Associated Press, “We all want justice. We all want answers.”

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said his officers have responded with “an incredible amount of restraint” as they’ve had rocks and bottles thrown at them, been shot at and had two dozen patrol vehicles destroyed.

The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others. The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said later that the name was incorrect.",NA,NA,NA,NA

On Aug. 9, Brown was walking home from a convenience store with friends. A so-far-unnamed police officer stopped Brown, for reasons as-of-yet undisclosed. The county police chief investigating the killing says Brown or one of his friends pushed the officer back into his car, but an eyewitness says Brown had his hands up, and was some distance from the car when shot.

He’d have started college Monday.

In the five days since Brown was killed, Ferguson has erupted in protests. Scenes of armed riot police advancing on protestors, accompanied by tanks or preceded by flares — automatic weapons trained on crowds of protestors and sonic cannons or tear-gas grenades lobbed into crowds — shouldn’t feel good to any American

There’s not much question that the police agencies involved, the Ferguson Police Department and the St. Louis County Police, are out of their depth. (That’s the same county agency investigating the shooting, which surely is not helping soothe the fears of Ferguson protestors.) In the immediate wake of Brown’s killing, law enforcement withheld key information, like why Brown was stopped. A county prosecuting attorney said it could be two weeks or more before 911 tapes and other evidence is made public. ({President Barack Obama said Thursday}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/14/white-house-walks-a-careful-line-on-ferguson/""> that the U.S. Department of Justice will also take up the case.)

Protestors, according to reports, have thrown bottles and Molotov cocktails at police officers. That’s not acceptable, either. The hacker collective Anonymous has published what it says is the identity of the officer, and the home address and pictures of the St. Louis County police chief, his wife and daughter. (The former are fair game; the latter terrifies me.) The collective is also taking credit for crashing the St. Louis County website — and yet, there’s a real difference between the actions of individuals, and institutions.

Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) to the police chief of nearby St. Louis, police are changing their approach, dropping the militarized response tactics.

But the damage, both literally and figuratively, is done.

Regardless of what any investigation finds, whether Brown was an instigator or an innocent victim, the response in Ferguson is telling us something vitally important about race in America, about the confidence black and other minority Americans have in the institutions meant to protect all of us, and particularly about the history of law enforcement when it comes to people who aren’t white, particularly non-white men.

This is a point so well-covered, so exhaustively documented, that it feels foolish to make this case. Yet shamefully, it’s still necessary. This is a different country, if you’re not white. It’s a worse country.

Look at the response of some metro Detroiters to stepped-up police enforcement on Belle Isle, after it became a state park, and it’s abundantly clear that for most white people, the presence of police is reassuring. I believe most police offers are good public servants trying their best to do a difficult job well. But there’s a long list of historical examples why black or Hispanic Americans might find police presence ominous.

Too many white people would prefer to pretend racial discrimination doesn’t exist, that it’s largely been solved. Or that the roots of discrimination (the multi-century, racially motivated enslavement of millions of Americans), of the significant disadvantages black Americans face, and the attitudes those disadvantages engender in folks who are more privileged, aren’t genuine.

That act of pretension is a luxury white people can indulge because largely, we’re free from the consequences of this deep racial divide. White children, by and large, do better in school. White people acquire more wealth, and are more likely to become homeowners. Those are objective facts. {A smaller percentage of white Americans are incarcerated}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002175/its-not-just-ferguson-americas-criminal-justice-system-is-racist/in/5757650"">. Whites are less likely to be arrested for and convicted of the same crimes that see non-whites do jail time. And sentences tend to be longer for black men convicted of the same crimes as white men.

But a wave of seemingly unarmed black protestors? This merits full riot response, complete with tanks, tear gas and arrests.

The goal, legal observers say, is to ensure that the truth about the killing is revealed, to ease racial tensions, and to reassure those fearing a cover-up that justice will be done.

Brown was shot dead in the street in the St. Louis suburb on Aug. 9. Gov. Jay Nixon asked for a federal investigation two days later, after riots erupted when the county police force confronted protesters with armored vehicles, tear gas and dogs. After the images of the military-style police response drew widespread criticism, federal officials said they were coaching local authorities on different tactics.

On Saturday, 40 FBI agents started going door-to-door in the neighborhood where the shooting took place, interviewing witnesses and gathering information. An independent federal autopsy was announced Sunday, and Attorney General Eric Holder said it was performed Monday. President Barack Obama also announced Monday that Holder would travel to Ferguson to meet with investigators and community leaders.

“What they usually do is wait for the local investigation to complete itself,” said Alberto Gonzales, former attorney general under President George W. Bush.

Gonzales said that although he did not have all the information being evaluated by federal officials, it appeared to be an aggressive and unusual response to an unusual case.

“They’re going in with one goal: to ascertain the truth. And to do so in a way that raw feelings can be comforted and soothed,” said Gonzales, who is now dean of the Belmont College of Law in Nashville.

Ferguson is about 70 percent black. Ferguson’s mayor is white, as are five of six city council members and 50 of its 53 police officers. Many in Ferguson and beyond fear that local officials will not act fairly in determining whether to charge the officer, Darren Wilson, with a crime.

St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, who is in charge of the investigation, also is white. He comes from a family of police officers, including his father. When he was 12, his father was fatally shot by a black man while responding to a call. In a 2000 case, McCulloch brought no charges against two officers who fired 21 shots into a vehicle, killing two black men during an attempted drug arrest.

McCulloch has declined calls to step away from the case, saying in a TV interview, “I’ve been as fair and impartial and done as thorough of a job as we could.”

At the Department of Justice, Holder, the first black attorney general, who took office promising to fiercely fight discrimination and inequality, has been an increasingly visible presence during the Ferguson case.

That is reassuring to Blair L.M. Kelley, a history professor at North Carolina State University.

“I’m glad to see him being proactive,” she said. “That’s the best way to tamp down anger on the streets, is to pursue justice in an evenhanded manner. I think he knows that and is using his position to best serve a broader sense of justice.”

“It puts pressure on the local investigators to do their best, because he’s there,” Kelley said.

Sampson Cheney III, a Ferguson resident who lives 50 yards from where Brown was shot, is glad that federal agents are on the scene. He was interviewed by an FBI agent Saturday. He doubts that local officials would file charges against the officer.

“It seems (federal officials) don’t have a horse in the race,” Cheney said.

Holder and White House adviser Valerie Jarrett spoke with representatives of civic groups who had been invited to participate in a White House call Monday afternoon.

A person on the call said participants were told that federal investigators have interviewed about 200 people so far, some referred through the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The call was closed to reporters, and the participant spoke on condition of anonymity because of the no-media ground rules.

Kelley said Holder’s actions have been reminiscent of the role played by Attorney General Robert Kennedy (whose portrait hangs outside Holder’s office) during the civil rights movement, when President John F. Kennedy was trying to navigate black resistance to white supremacy in the Jim Crow South. Ultimately, the Kennedys used federal authority to ensure equal treatment for African-Americans. They also brought federal civil rights charges in some cases — a possibility that Holder’s Justice Department is investigating in Ferguson.

The Justice Department investigated civil rights charges after the unarmed teen Trayvon Martin was killed by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman in Florida. No charges were filed, despite requests by the NAACP and other advocacy groups.

But there are important differences between the Kennedy years and now, said John Malcolm, a former deputy assistant attorney general, who now is director of the Meese Legal Center at the Heritage Foundation.

“I don’t think in this case police are like, we want to oppress black people and deny them their constitutional rights,” Malcolm said. “They’re responding to a riot situation, and it got out of control.”

Malcolm could not recall a similar federal response to a case like Michael Brown’s.

“It’s certainly aggressive,” he said. “It sends a message that the federal government is concerned and wants to get involved and de-escalate the tension as soon as possible.”

Malcolm said that strategy could backfire, if it fans false assumptions that there is a racial component to the case. But overall he did not have any criticism of the DOJ’s actions.

“This is a rapidly deteriorating situation,” he said. “Clearly in the public mind there is a racial component to how police have acted. Police have not helped themselves with their overreaction to the situation. So I think there are times when (federal involvement) can help defuse the situation. Let’s hope that’s what happens here.”",NA,NA,NA,No images

The poll from the Pew Research Center, released Monday, shows Americans overall closely divided on whether the shooting by police of unarmed young black man Michael Brown in Ferguson raised “important issues about race.”

But that overall division comes in large part because of sharply differing views by blacks and whites.

Blacks, by 4 to 1, said events in Ferguson did raise important racial issues. Whites were more closely divided, with 37% saying the case raised important racial questions, while 47% said they thought race was “getting more attention than it deserved.”

Similarly, blacks by more than 3 to 1 said they thought the police reaction to events in Ferguson had “gone too far,” while whites divided almost evenly on that question, with 33% saying the police had gone too far, 32% saying the police reaction had been about right and 35% saying they did not know.

Whites had far more confidence than blacks about the official investigations into the shooting, with about half of whites, but only about 20% of blacks, saying they had at least a “fair amount” of confidence. Roughly three-quarters of blacks said they had “not too much” or no confidence at all in the investigations.

Those disparate views reflect frequently documented differences in how blacks and whites see issues of race. But the gap in perceptions of Ferguson was notably smaller than the racial differences Pew found last year in reactions to the jury verdict in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, the black teenager killed by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer of white and Latino heritage in Florida.

Black perceptions of both events were quite similar, with about 80 percent of African Americans saying both cases had raised important racial issues.

But white perceptions of Zimmerman’s acquittal by a Florida jury were more starkly in conflict with those of blacks. In the Florida case, whites by 28% to 60% said that race was getting too much attention, a much larger margin than the 37% to 47% division of white opinion regarding Ferguson.

The different responses to the two cases may be a function of time, however. The unrest in Ferguson is now in its second week, but in the Florida case, Zimmerman’s acquittal came after almost a year and a half of racially charged debate over the shooting.

In addition to the racial divide, reactions to Ferguson also split along familiar partisan lines. Democrats were far more likely than Republicans to say that the shooting raises important racial issues. Among white Democrats, for example, only 25% said the racial issues were getting more attention than they deserved. Among white Republicans, 60% said they believed that was the case.",NA,NA,NA,No images

“They tried it with Trayvon, and now they are trying it with Michael,” Benjamin Crump said.

“We know that this was an execution,” he said, noting that at the time of his death, witnesses say Brown had his hands raised above his head. “This means ‘Surrender! Don’t shoot!’ And the most hardened criminals in history, when they put their hands up, we didn’t execute them.”

Sunday’s rally was at Greater Grace Church.

Martin Luther King III said the local prosecutor looking into the shooting should recuse himself from case. “Justice perhaps won’t come without an independent prosecutor,” he said.

The Rev. Al Sharpton told the crowd that it was despicable for police to release a robbery report naming the 18-year-old Brown as a suspect before his mother had buried her son. Sharpton called the incident “defining moment for this country” and said protests would continue.

“We are not going to shut up,” he said. “We are going to come together and have a real peace.”

He told protesters not to loot in Michael’s name. “There’s a difference between an activist and a thug,” Sharpton aid.

Anger has grown after police on Friday released a surveillance video purporting to show Brown stealing from a convenience store and roughing up its clerk a few minutes before the confrontation with Officer Darren Wilson.

Ron Johnson, the Missouri Highway Patrol captain at the head of security here, told the rally that protesters “need to pray, we need to thank Mike for his life, we need to thank him for the change that he is going to make.”

Johnson told an animated crowd that Brown’s violent death at the hands of police on Aug. 9 “is going to make it for our sons so that they can be better black men. He’s going to make it better for our daughters so they can be better black women, better for me so I can be a better black father. And we know they’re going to make our mamas even better than they are today.”

Johnson, who is African-American and lives in nearby Florissant, told the crowd, “This is my neighborhood. You are my family, you are my friends and I am you. And I will stand and protect you. I will protect your right to protest.”

Cedric Evans, 29, Brown’s cousin said after the rally that the event was uplifting for members of Brown’s family. Throughout the service he sat solemnly watching as speaker after speaker voiced their concerns about someone he had known personally.

“Instead of this being just another murder in St. Louis, it is looking better for our side,” he said.

Evans said he planned to gather with other members of Brown’s family and protest.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Obama, speaking from his vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., called the weekend death of 18-year-old Michael Brown a tragedy, and urged police and protesters to ""take a step back"" and consider how to move forward.

""Now is the time for all of us to reflect on what happened,"" Obama said.

Police need to be ""open and transparent"" about their investigation, Obama said. And there is no excuse for looting or violence towards police, nor for police to abuse citizens. Obama criticized police for taking two journalists into custody during protests Wednesday.

Police used tear gas Wednesday on crowds who gathered to protest the death of Brown on Saturday; some protesters threw Molotov cocktails.

In a written statement on Tuesday, Obama called the teenager's death ""heartbreaking,"" and said the Department of Justice is working with local officials on the case.

Obama also said that, while the shooting has ""prompted strong passions,"" people should honor Brown ""through reflection and understanding,"" and remain calm.

""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds,"" Obama said.

As for Iraq, Obama said there has been progress with the limited military mission he announced last week.

Earlier in the week, the Obama administration began considering a rescue operation for members of the Yazidi religion who were trapped atop Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq, surrounded by Islamic State fighters.

On Wednesday, a Pentagon assessment team reported that most of the Yazidi have escaped, and a full-scale rescue operation would not be needed.

""We broke the mountain siege of Sinjar,"" Obama said, praising the performance of the U.S. military.

a heartbreaking letter

published in TIME magazine to the family of Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old recently shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
Fulton says she wishes she could say “it will be alright” but the truth is she can only “pray” as their ‘lives are forever changed.”

The letter, published Monday, comes from Fulton’s experience in 2012 when her 17-year-old son Trayvon was shot by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman, 28, in Florida.

Zimmerman was

found not guilty of second-degree murder

and manslaughter

“Our children are our future so whenever any of our children – black, white, brown, yellow, or red – are taken from us unnecessarily, it causes a never-ending pain that is unlike anything I could have imagined experiencing,” Fulton wrote.

Fulton explains the dichotomy of detractors and supporters family members will face since they’ve sadly joined “this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.”

For Fulton, the loss meant devoting her life to the missions of

The Trayvon Martin Foundation

. She lends her support to Brown’s family and “to seek justice for your Michael and the countless other Michaels & Trayvons of our country.”


Fulton offers hope in perhaps the most touching line of the letter. “But know this: neither of their lives shall be in vain. The galvanizations of our communities must be continued beyond the tragedies.”

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who has been the public face of the city torn by Saturday’s death of Michael Brown, 18, told reporters the St. Louis County investigation of the shooting could take weeks to complete.

In the meantime, he said, his department welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force’s 53 officers are white.

“Unfortunately, an undertow (of racial unrest) has bubbled to the surface,” Jackson said. “Race relations is the top priority right now.”

The mystery of the officer’s identity has fanned the discord, with Jackson arguing that revealing that detail could bring retribution to the officer. Since Saturday, the officer’s life has been countlessly threatened.

But civil rights activists and the attorney for Brown’s family, all pressing for calm amid nights of unrest since Brown’s death, counter that knowing the officer’s name may help the area to heal, allowing the NAACP and others to dig into the officer’s background for any prior brutality.

“We don’t want anyone’s life threatened. If someone like this officer is killed, then there is no justice,” said John Gaskin III of St. Louis County’s NAACP chapter.

Police have said the shooting happened after an officer encountered Brown and another man on the street.

They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer’s weapon.

At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

Dorian Johnson, who said he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a different story.

Johnson told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it “ricocheted” back, apparently upsetting the officer.

Johnson said the officer grabbed his friend’s neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing.

Johnson said Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Johnson and another witness said Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him.

Robert McCulloch, the county’s prosecutor, said that investigators were interviewing Johnson on Wednesday.

Chief Jackson said that the officer sustained swelling facial injuries during the confrontation that preceeded the shooting.

Brown’s body remained on the street for hours — a span Jackson deemed “uncomfortable” but justified, given that “you only get one chance at that crime scene” to process it correctly. Jackson said authorities also were concerned about gunfire they could hear from a nearby building.

In the shooting’s aftermath, the notorious hacking collective Anonymous has taken credit for hacking into the city website and shutting it down for much of Monday.

The group also released what it said were audio experts from St. Louis County dispatch on the day Brown was killed. Police declined to comment on the recordings.

On Tuesday, hackers posted pictures of St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar’s home and family online, as well as his home address and telephone number in hopes of pressuring him to release the officer’s name.

“Realistically, what positive could come from that information coming out?” Jackson said. “Right now, people want it so they can destroy that person’s life. That’s the only reason that group’s asking for it.”

But community members said they want to know who the officer is.

It seems two reporters — Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post and Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post — were working on the story at a McDonald’s, which has been used as a staging ground by reporters covering the ongoing unrest following the Aug. 9 police shooting of an unarmed African-American man.

According to their accounts, the two were accosted by police, some in militaristic riot gear, demanding identification and ordering them out. These officers refused to provide their badge numbers or names or a reason for the order and grew angry when one of the men attempted to take a video.

Both reporters were arrested. Reilly says a cop intentionally banged his head against the glass on the way out of the restaurant, then gave him a facetious “apology.”

The two were transported to a lockup. No mug shots were taken, no fingerprints collected, no paperwork done. After some minutes, they were released. The men were told they’d been arrested for “trespassing.”

At a McDonald’s. Where they were customers.

“Apparently, in America, in 2014,” tweeted Lowery, “police can manhandle you, take you into custody, put you in cell and then open the door like it didn’t happen.”

Actually, both men had been treated with a heavy-handedness and official contempt that are apparently all too familiar to black people in Ferguson — and to black and poor people of whatever tribe all over America. In arresting reporters for reporting, Ferguson police raise a pressing question: Just what are they trying to hide?

The same night Reilly and Lowery were handcuffed, after all, a local alderman who had posted video of the protests to social media was arrested. All last week we had reports of news photographers being ordered to stop taking pictures and reporters being tear-gassed. One officer reportedly took a TV camera and pointed it to the ground. Add to this police refusal until six days after the incident to name the officer who shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, and the picture that emerges is not one of transparency.

At least three witnesses have now disputed the official version of what happened, the tale of how Brown inexplicably shoved a police officer back inside the officer’s car, and they wrestled for the officer’s gun. One witness, Dorian Johnson, says he was walking in the street with Brown toward Brown’s grandmother’s apartment when the officer, who was in his car, commanded them to “get the eff” out of the street. The street in question, to judge from television images, is a quiet one. We’re not talking Broadway at rush hour.

Johnson says the officer reached out of the car and grabbed Brown and the struggle ensued, the two men wrestling through the car window as a shot was fired. Then the officer got out. Another witness, Tiffany Mitchell, says Brown had broken away and was facing the officer with hands up when he was shot.

Let us hope that between the time of this writing and the time of your reading, the fighting in the streets of Ferguson is done. It makes no sense to compound tragedy with tragedy.

But let us also understand: The mere restoration of order is not the same as peace. If events in Ferguson prove nothing else, they prove the status quo of police harassment and no accountability is untenable and intolerable. And what happened to these two reporters should be instructive to those whose reflex in such matters is to accord police the benefit of even overwhelming doubt.

Such people might want to reconsider. If this is how some cops behave when the whole world is watching, can you imagine what they’re like when the whole world is not?",NA,NA,NA,NA

After an activist posted on Twitter that there would be a vigil in downtown Manhattan for Brown, Feminista Jones reached out.

“I wonder why they always have vigils so far removed from the people who are most likely to be affected by police brutality,” she wrote back to the poster. “I just know that people in the Bronx and Brooklyn will struggle getting there on Sunday trains.” (The correspondence is

Plans for today’s the peaceful assemblies began through that platform, then moved to Facebook. It’s an update to activism Jones compares to “phone banking and letter writing — just reaching 90,000 people.”

“We’re having a national moment of silence — one chord, one silent voice — to honor not only Mike Brown, not only Eric Garner, but all victims of police brutality, especially those who have lost their lives,” she said.

In Detroit, there was some unrest Wednesday after {police shot and wounded the occupant of a vehicle being driven at officers}<hyperlink=""http://www.freep.com/""> on the city’s east side. According to police, officers observed two men purchase a gun illegally. When they pulled over the vehicle, the men tried to run an officer down, police said. The man who was shot was treated and released and both men are in custody, police said. Police said an AK-47 was recovered.

At the scene, a man went under the crime scene tape, assaulted an officer and was pepper-sprayed and arrested, police said.

Detroit Police Chief James Craig said it seemed like there were a few agitators in the crowd. He said that, to keep an open dialogue with the community, neighborhood police officers went out into the community.

The social media movement has sturdily moved offline in preparation for the national moment of silence Thursday. Jones held a conference call with more than 75 organizers Wednesday night, and says when she went to sleep, more than 90 communities had committed to hosting the silent vigil.

Her inbox was flooded Thursday morning.

Jones, whose real name is Michelle but chose not to give her last name, references the Boston concert James Brown put on the day after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, providing a peaceful way for people to “show resistance and protest while also stopping the risk of loss of life.”

“I wanted to have a moment of peace and self reflection for those who have the same feelings, a massive group therapy moment we can use moving forward to figure out the next steps to improve relations on a community level and stop these acts,” she said.

“We must mourn the loss of people who have become victims, and give them a place to find healing with people who care,” she said.

From there, Jones hopes activists will “take the next steps at their local level.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

The autopsy was at the request of the Brown family, according to a statement by the Justice Department. Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old was shot to death by a police officer on Aug. 9. Police identified officer Darren Wilson, 28, a 6-year department veteran, as the shooter on Friday.

The St. Louis County Medical Examiner's autopsy concluded that Brown died of gunshot wounds, but other details have not been released.

The news came as seven people were arrested and one person was shot early Sunday as police and protesters clashed again in a haze of tear gas despite a curfew that took effect at midnight.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson said one person was shot overnight and was in critical condition. Johnson said police used tear gas in an effort to reach the person who was shot. Other protesters took the shooting victim to the hospital before authorities could reach him, Johnson said.

It was not clear who fired the shot, but Gov. Jay Nixon said Sunday that no police officers fired their guns during or after the protest.

Seven people will face charges of failure to disperse. Early Sunday, members of the media were ordered to remain in the parking lot of the Ferguson Market or risk arrest.

The curfew, put in place by Nixon, was designed to quell ongoing unrest in the St. Louis suburb since the Aug. 9 fatal police shooting of Brown. Police also released a surveillance video purporting to show Brown stealing from a convenience store and roughing up its clerk about 15 minutes before the confrontation with Wilson.

""We were unaware they were going to release it, and we certainly were not happy with that being released,"" Nixon told ABC's This Week on Sunday. ""It appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw. ""

The curfew expired at 5 a.m. local time. Crowds had dwindled significantly leading up to the curfew, but remaining protesters — chanting ""No justice! No curfew!"" — refused to leave the area. Some stood with their hands up, the emblematic pose used by many protesters to characterize the position witness have said Brown had assumed when he was fatally shot.

""We ready. We ready. We ready for y'all, "" people chanted, while others screamed, ""We are Mike Brown.""

About 45 minutes past the curfew deadline, armored tactical vehicles approached the crowd in an effort to disperse those that refused to leave West Florissant Avenue, a main thoroughfare and scene of numerous protests.

""You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately. Failure to comply may result in arrest,"" officers said through a loudspeaker.

As officers put on gas masks, a chant from the distant crowd emerged: ""We have the right to assemble peacefully.""

Police used smoke and tear gas to push back the crowd of protesters, and officers also carried rifles, gas masks, plastic handcuffs and helmets.

Police also brought in armored tanks after learning of some disturbances at Reds Barbecue, a local restaurant. En route, officers encountered a man who flashed a handgun and appeared in the middle of the street as armored vehicles approached the crowd of protesters, Johnson said.

Johnson said someone also fired at a patrol car, but no officers were injured.

Johnson defended the use of military-style armored cars and tactical units dressed like soldiers. The situations faced by police justified their actions and tactics, he said.

""We have a shooting victim that is in critical condition that may lose their life,"" Johnson said. ""We had a subject standing in the middle of the road with a handgun. We had a police car shot at tonight.""

St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who represents the 21st Ward, said he and other community members pleaded with everyone to obey the curfew.

""Some of the guys didn't want to be told to leave,"" French said. ""There was no convincing them. They wanted to do civil disobedience.""

Umar Lee, 39, an independent journalist, who said he grew up in North St. Louis, saw protesters were throwing canisters of gas deployed by the police back at the police during the tense clashes.

""This is surreal to see my hometown look like Gaza,"" Lee said. ""I just pray for peace in my community.""

Nixon, however, told CNN on Sunday he was encouraged by the most recent events.

""Thousands of people spoke, thousands of people marched, not a single gunshot from police last night,"" Nixon said. ""We are trying to use the least amount of force to provide people with protection.""

FBI took over the investigation Monday

of a weekend shooting in which an officer killed an unarmed 18-year-old.
The St. Louis County NAACP, which will have a meeting for residents at 6 p.m. CT Monday, had called for the FBI to investigate the death of Michael (Mike) Brown, shot multiple times Saturday after police say he was involved in a scuffle with an officer and another person in this predominantly black St. Louis suburb.

“It is our hope that this discussion will provide accurate and reliable information to be shared with the community,” Esther Haywood, president of the county’s NAACP, said in a statement. “Our expectation is to educate the public on the NAACP’s strategy toward justice for the Brown family and the community.”

The St. Louis County executive and Ferguson police chief also they welcomed FBI involvement. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon also said Monday that he requested an independent U.S. Department of Justice investigation.

“I ask St. Louis County residents to exercise patience and respect for their neighbors as federal authorities work to get to the bottom of what happened,” Nixon said in a statement.

Anger follows police shooting in St. Louis suburb

Police early Monday used tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered a few hours earlier for a candlelight vigil for Brown. More than 300 officers from 19 St. Louis-area departments were called in.

At least one convenience store was looted and set on fire in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents 10 miles northwest of St. Louis. Twelve businesses along a main road near the shooting scene were broken into, including a check-cashing store, a boutique, a small grocery store, a sporting goods store, a cellphone retailer, a tire store and a Walmart. As people carted away goods from several of the stores, police moved in.

“Most came here for a peaceful protest but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch,” said Deanel Trout, 53, who has lived in Ferguson for 14 years. “I can understand the anger and unrest, but I can’t understand the violence and looting.”

He thinks the troublemakers largely came from outside Ferguson and that they had used the angst at the vigil as an opportunity to steal.

Thirty-two people were arrested and two officers had minor injuries — one injured a knee, another was struck with a brick, authorities said. One officer was shot at but not injured, nearly a dozen patrol cars were damaged, and someone in the crowd fired shots at a police helicopter but did not hit it, according to St. Louis County Police.

By mid-Monday, employees of the businesses affected were cleaning up their parking lots, calling for glass repairs and trying to reopen.

Earlier Sunday, Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police Department said the incident started when a Ferguson officer encountered Brown and another male on the street near an apartment complex. One male pushed the officer into his police vehicle, Belmar said.

The men had a struggle inside the car, Belmar said, and at some point a man — it was unclear whether it was Brown — reached for the officer’s weapon. One shot was fired inside the vehicle.

The fight moved outside the squad car and Brown suffered fatal gunshot wounds about 35 feet from the vehicle, Belmar said. The second person has not been arrested, and police are not sure whether he was armed.

“As a mother, I grieve for this child and his family,” Sen. Claire McCaskill said in a statement. “I pray that the wonderful, hardworking, and God-loving people of Ferguson will find peace and patience as we wait for the results of what will be numerous and thorough investigations of what happened.”

Investigators found multiple shell casings at the scene. Brown was shot more than once, but an exact number of shots fired has not yet been determined, Belmar said. All the shell casings came from the officer’s weapon.

“Our prayers go out to the family and friends of 18-year-old Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo.,” said Cornell Williams Brooks, president of the national NAACP. “The death of yet another African-American at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve the community where he lived is heartbreaking.”

Brown’s family has retained civil-rights lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represented the family of Trayvon Martin after that teen was shot and killed by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Sanford, Fla. The Rev. Al Sharpton said he plans to meet with Brown’s family Monday night or Tuesday in Ferguson.

Crump told USA TODAY that Monday would have been the teen’s first day of college.

“Instead of his mother and grandmother celebrating and looking forward to his future, they are having to try to plan out his funeral,” Crump said. “And for what? It’s so hard to fathom what those witnesses said--that he (Brown) is putting his hands up and the police shoot anyway.”

He and the family are holding a press conference at 4 p.m.

Crump said he and the family want the Department of Justice overseeing an investigation because “The family has no trust in the local police agencies.”

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson asked county police to take over the investigation from the local department, Belmar said. Results of the investigation will be turned over to the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, which will determine if charges should be filed.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Afterward, a group of several dozen protesters broke off from the gathering and marched up Woodward Avenue, shouting slogans and blocking traffic. That march, apparently led by members of the civil rights activist group By Any Means Necessary, came after most of the crowd had dispersed from the Hart Plaza rally.

As motorists honked in support, the marchers chanted: “Hands up, don’t shoot. We Stand for Ferguson.”

Police left the protesters alone and the march ended without incident.

The nationwide vigils came days after unarmed Michael Brown, 18, was killed by police in Ferguson, Mo.

Thousands of people gathered across the U.S. for the National Moment of Silence event to honor Brown and others who have died. Rallies were held in New York, Los Angeles and Hawaii as word spread through social media with the hashtag, #NMOS14.

Flyers for the event said the rallies were planned in response to the recent deaths of Brown, Eric Garner and John Crawford.

Organizers said they wanted to use the event to honor victims of police brutality and those “who have fallen due to racism, bigotry and intolerance.”

Whitney Syphax Walker organized the Detroit event, which organizers say drew more than 500 people; police estimated the crowd at less than that.

“I am surprised,” she said of the turnout. “I am also fearful they will go home thinking they’ve done enough. My hope is something will spark them to go home and have a conversation about what’s going on.”

Syphax Walker said she decided to organize the event after she saw what was unfolding in Ferguson after Brown’s death. She said a woman, who goes by the name Feminista Jones, helped spread word of all of the nationwide events.

She said she works at a local school and is worried those students will be “fair game” and exposed to violence in a few years.

“They’re going to be exposed to a system that doesn’t value them based on their skin color,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking.”

In Ferguson, dozens of residents have been protesting since Brown was killed Saturday. According to police, Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. Police said one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, before physically assaulting him in the vehicle. Police said one of the men struggled with the officer over the officer’s weapon and at least one shot was fired inside the car.

The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

The protests have been met with officers from multiple departments clad in riot gear and backed by armored vehicles, as protesters chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot.”

At Thursday’s rally in Detroit, about four police cars were stationed outside the event. Sgt. Michael Woody, a spokesman for the Detroit Police Department, said extra patrols were available to respond if necessary.

The crowd listened to speakers, poets and pastors who called on attendees to take action. They also held a moment of silence, which was interrupted by a man who screamed, “We’ve been silent too long.” The crowd began to chant, “No justice, no peace.”

Southfield resident Sharon Brewton said she came to the event because she has a 30-year-old son and 16-year-old grandson who she said has been exposed to police brutality.

“Killing our black children is unacceptable,” she said. “I want justice.”

Detroit resident Angelette Green said she has seen too much violence in the city and hopes the rally will “wake people up.”

“Something’s gotta be done,” she said. “Enough is enough.”

The Detroit Police Department has been under federal scrutiny for more than a decade after accusation of brutality. In 2003, the city entered into two consent judgments with the U.S. Justice Department after police were accused of unconstitutional conduct, including excessive use of force and illegal detentions.

In a joint motion filed this week, Detroit and the Justice Department asked a federal judge to terminate the use of force and arrest and witness detention consent judgment.

The motion — which says the city and Justice Department agreed to enter into an 18-month transition agreement — says that “serious uses of force have drastically declined and the DPD has completely ended the practice of arresting and detaining witnesses.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

It isn’t simple.

The crime scene in Ferguson makes clear that a police officer shot Michael Brown from some distance away while, according to witnesses, he had his hands up.

Outrage ensued. Outrage begat anger. Anger begat demonstrations. And suddenly, the veil has been stripped from this suburban St. Louis town, where poor race relations are now on display.

The first thing the mayor and police chief should have done was call for an independent investigation into the shooting, announce that the officer had been suspended pending the outcome of that investigation and plead for calm.

Instead, the town left Brown’s body on the ground for hours like a trophy and sent in an army to hold protesters at bay.

The police chief was late. The mayor was late. President Barack Obama was late. And Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, for four days, acted like Ferguson wasn’t in his state. Only then did he make a drive-by statement and later call in the state Highway Patrol.

State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, who was tear-gassed Mondaywhile resting during what she said was a peaceful march, later told MSNBC that Gov. Nixon “has been absent from the minority community his entire political career.”

And that may be the problem. Ferguson appears to be operating like it’s 1950. Duly outraged demonstrators numbering anywhere from 100 to 1,500 as anger grew, were met with what looked like militia, heavily protected and armed officers who treated people with disdain, detained two national reporters and dismantled media camera equipment, quelling the First Amendment while attempting to suppress outrage.

And we still don’t want to deal with race in America.

“As a nation, we urgently need to rethink our approach to criminal justice,” Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a statement. “Our entire criminal justice system has mushroomed in the past four decades, in large part because certain politicians have made it a strategy to stoke fear among white people — fear about young black men. Young men like Michael — and their families — are paying the price.”

Nadal, the state senator, asked Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson on Wednesday whether she would be attacked with tear gas again. He replied: “I hope not.”

A sure sign that you have no control over your department is when you cannot guarantee the safety of an elected official. If all Jackson can do is hope, and not lead, he should resign.

Why should we care about what’s happening in Ferguson, Mo.?

That’s like asking why we should care about the Middle East.

We should care because all of us should learn lessons from the worst things that happen just as we learn from the best things that happen.

We should care because there, but for the grace of God, goes any city. A crowd gathered after a police shooting in Detroit Wednesday, referencing Ferguson and requiring additional police to disperse.

We should care because we can determine what a good job looks like when we see a bad one on display.

The lessons from Ferguson are that poor race relations affect everything and that inappropriate policing — that makes front pages in Australia — cannot be tolerated.

Oh, and there’s this: Ferguson is an example of what not to do.

It’s that simple.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Police have not disclosed the name of the man who was killed, but family members say it was 18-year-old Michael Brown.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference that an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn’t known, but “it was more than just a couple.” He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer’s gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and was expected to be interviewed later Sunday. Authorities aren’t sure if that person was unarmed, Jackson said.

A few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson police headquarters about the time the news conference was to begin. At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police building.

Protesters outside chanted slogans — “No justice, no peace” and “We want answers” — and some carried signs that read “Stop police terrorism” and “Disarm the police.”

Brown’s mother Lesley McSpadden says she doesn’t understand why police didn’t subdue her son with a club or Taser, and she says the policeman who shot him should be jailed. The officer has been put on leave.

McSpadden was speaking at the site of the Saturday killing. She says police have not explained why her son was confronted by the officer.

“I would like to see him fired,” McSpadden said Sunday. “I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty.”

St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation. County Executive Charlie Dooley, who showed up at the protest Sunday to urge calm, said he will request an FBI investigation. U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said Sunday that Attorney General Eric Holder had instructed attorneys in the department’s civil rights division to monitor developments.

“We’re outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,” said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP. “This is an issue everywhere in America. You never believe that this can happen in your town.”

Critics have contended that police in the St. Louis too often target young black men. Statistics on police-involved shootings in the region were not immediately available.

Brown’s grandmother, Desiree Harris, said Saturday she saw him minutes before she heard a commotion and went outside. She found Brown’s body less than two blocks away.

“My grandson never even got into a fight,” she said. “He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.”

Several protesters were angry that Brown’s body remained on the street for hours after the killing. Belmar said that officers “had to practice our due diligence and that’s why it took as long as it did.”

LOUIS – A 23-year-old male robbery suspect is dead after allegedly waving a knife at police, screaming at them to kill him and then being shot by an officer in north St. Louis, authorities said Tuesday.

The incident took place in the city's Sixth District, about four miles from unrest in suburban Ferguson, where protests and clashes continue following the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of an 18-year-old man by local police. The Tuesday incident did not appear to be related to Ferguson, although a crowd that gathered around the scene appeared to have questions, prompting two aldermen at the scene to urge calm. No officers were injured, authorities said.

In a news conference following Tuesday's incident, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson confirmed the shooting in the city's Sixth District. The suspect came within 3 or 4 feet of police officers and ""brandished a knife"" during a convenience store altercation and yelled, ""Shoot me; kill me now,"" Dotson said.

Some witnesses described the incident as ""suicide by cop"" — a situation in which someone with a death wish engages in activity that may prompt a law enforcement officer to shoot at them — but Dotson said he did not agree.

The suspect walked into a convenience store, stole some energy drinks, walked out, walked back in again and stole some pastry, Dotson said.

The store owner called police as the man paced in front of the store, Dotson said. When police arrived, the man ""brandished a knife,"" Dotson said.

The suspect was black, and the incident prompted St. Louis Aldermen Antonio French and Chris Carter to urge residents who gathered near the scene to remain calm.

""Let's be patient,"" French said. ""The last thing we need is violence in our neighborhood. No silliness over here. We're going to find out what happened. You've got people that got your back over here. You aren't alone like they are in Ferguson.""

French's comment may have been a reference to a lack of minority representation in local government in Ferguson, which has captured attention during news coverage of the clashes.

Carter said they were there to ""ask people to stay calm and to wait on the facts of the investigation.""

As French and Carter tried to calm emotions, several in the crowd shouted questions about why the officers didn't use Tasers instead of guns. There also were repeated chants of ""Hands up! Don't shoot!"" That has been the rallying cry of the protesters in Ferguson in response to the Michael Brown shooting.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Walker,08/17/2014,02/18/2016," Khairat Abdul-Mujeeb and her husband, Ali Abdus-Shaheed, placed jewelry on stands and in cases Sunday afternoon under a tent set up on Brush Street in Midtown Detroit, telling passers-by about the origin of the designs.

“Look at that,” Abdus-Shaheed said, pointing to a bracelet. “That’s a fork.”

In it was an oval chunk of onyx, held in place by fork spears fashioned around it.

The couple runs Lateef Originals, one of more than 100 vendors who set up along Brush and on the grounds of the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History for the 32nd Annual African World Festival. The three-day festival, ending tonight, drew about 150,000 people in its third year at the museum since it moved from its longtime digs at Hart Plaza.

“Folks have recognized how suitable these grounds are for presenting this event,” said festival director Njia Kia, motioning toward the berms and greenery in the backdrop of the museum.

She said the viewing area to the main stage, directly behind the museum, was packed Saturday as Detroit gospel acts the Clark Sisters and Kierra Sheard jammed out. But without the stationary kitchens that are present at Hart Plaza, the number of food vendors is still rebounding from the move, Kia said.

Still, vendors have had nothing but praise for the retooled event, she said.

For the owners of Lateef Originals, they said the festival brought with it a chance for them to help establish a place in the local market.

“We chose to use this opportunity to do business in Detroit,” said Abdul-Mujeeb, who said they set up shop at various festivals across the country to sell the unique jewelry. “If we continue to spend with ourselves, we can create a stronger economic base.”

Kia said the event continues to grow at its new digs. In addition to the vendors selling food, clothes and jewelry, activities this year included African dance performances, a classic car exhibit, and a Coca Cola experience in which participants could name their cans and bottles, as seen in the recent “Share a Coke” campaign.

Sunday afternoon, during a segment honoring black elders and ancestors, U.S. Rep. John Conyers took the stage and mentioned the late Nelson Mandela, the former South African president who died in December. Conyers, who recently advanced to the Nov. 4 General Election for a chance at a 25th term in office, also invoked the memory of Michael Brown, the teen shot to death by a police officer in the St. Louis suburb Ferguson, Mo., which has sparked rioting, looting and militarized responses from local authorities.

“I come to you to tell you police brutality is something we have to watch out for everywhere, including Ferguson,” he told the crowd of about 200 around the main stage.

He also mentioned Milton Hall, a homeless Saginaw man shot to death by police in July 2012 after officers responded to reports that a man had stolen a cup of coffee from a convenience store. Hall was shot at 47 times by six officers, and struck by 11 bullets. Witnesses to the incident recorded portions of it on their cell phones.

He said the cases prove to him that the laws on record are “criminalizing” the nation, but having a lopsided effect on black males. He said it’s a focal point of his next term in office, which he’s expected to cruise to in the heavily Democratic 13th District.",NA,12,NA,NA
