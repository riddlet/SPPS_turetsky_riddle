I searched the hashtag #FERGUSON trying to gain a little bit more knowledge on the situation. Social media is a great way to get a person to person perspective on national news stories, as opposed to a main stream media point of view. What I found on the hashtag was way more disturbing that knowledgable. It looked like something straight out of a scene from Saving Private Ryan, instead the war took place in Ferguson. Pictures of people who had been in the middle of tear gas bombs, videos of police firing rubber bullets at unarmed civilians, it looked like the photos we see from Iraq. Could this be our country? Should police even have equipment like tanks with mounted machine guns? All types of questions started running through my head.

NewsOne,news2,https://newsone.com/3045626/jesse-williams-mike-brown-ferguson/,Jesse Williams On Ferguson: ‘White People Have The Privilege Of Being Treated Like Human Beings’,NewsOne Staff,08/18/14,02/01/17,"In an appearance on CNN on Sunday, “Grey’s Anatomy” star Jesse Williams, 33, tackled the blatant racial bias in media character assassinations of  slain Ferguson teen Michael Brown, who was unarmed when he was shot and killed August 9 by police officer Darren Wilson.

I think we have to talk about the narrative and make sure we’re starting at the beginning. You will find that people doing the oppressing often want to start the narrative at a convenient point,” Williams said. “This started with a kid getting shot and killed and left in the street for four hours. I’ve never seen a white body left in the heat for four hours in the sweltering heat.”

…

“I know plenty of white kids that steal stuff from convenience stores,” Williams continued in response to allegations that Brown stole cigars moments before his murder by law enforcement. “There is this idea that every time a black person does something they automatically become a thug worthy of their own death.”

“The rest of us are not treated like human beings. Period,” the actor said. “That needs to be discussed. That is the story.”

Williams is always found front and center in calls for social and racial justice, as evidenced by his consistent and fearless advocacy for of Black men.

“There’s a lot of young black men getting gunned down because people felt they were threatened,” said Williams about slain Florida {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhcADY5u_Ak"">. “Unarmed boys who were supposedly threats because being a black man in this country is sometimes an act of aggression in itself.”

When speaking out about the shooting death of {Jordan Davis}<hyperlink=""http://www.hlntv.com/video/2014/02/13/greys-anatomy-star-people-should-be-outraged""> with HLN’s Jane Velez-Mitchell, Williams discussed the myth of the Black criminal:

“This is a tradition in this country, where people are able to go ahead and kill Black people because they’ve gotten sassed or inconvenienced. We’re victims of a fantasy. This fantasy of what the Black body does and can do has become more importantly than the reality and we pay for it with our lives,” Williams said. “Look at the amount of boys that are being shot because you feel scared. The idea of feeling threatened is not the same thing as being threatened. We pretend that it is, but it’s not. We have to keep fighting to be heard and to be treated like human beings.”

When Velez-Mitchell introduced William’s class privilege into the conversation, asking how he could still feel so “disenfranchised” with all of his success, he responded:

“I don’t think of just me, I think of a collective group of people. While privilege is very well, whether it’s a class issue that obviously exists–I’m glad you bring that up. This idea of having to explain why it’s racial, while we’re standing in our own blood is silly. It’s racial because it doesn’t happen to White people.”",0,1200,NA,NA

As reported by several witnesses in the city via social media, the looting and riots have not occurred since Monday evening but that hasn’t stopped authorities from rolling out heavy artillery. Armed in gear as if Ferguson was a full-out war zone, the police drove armored tanks in the streets and hit peaceful protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets.

Rev. Sharpton spoke with Chief Belmar this morning, ahead of a planned meeting with NAN staff and local leaders with police in the county, stating he’ll return to the region once talks have commenced. Rev. Sharpton visited with the family of Brown and held a press conference and rally that called for justice in the case. Further, NAN will help provide funds to the Brown family to conduct a proper funeral for the 18-year-old.

From Rev. Sharpton:

I told Chief Belmar that I was outraged by what I have seen on TV since leaving Ferguson and that we must not have excessive force to deal with legitimate protest of excessive force. We want to solve the problem, not create new ones. Even if we disagree, this climate is not good for anyone and is dangerous for everyone.

According to NAN, the organization’s Rev. De-Ves Toon of the National Field Department and other colleagues will revisit the area with Rev. Sharpton after the planned talks conclude. at the hands of police. On Thursday, Rev. Sharpton spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief John Belmar, demanding restraint from officers in Ferguson and also demanding a thorough Justice Department investigation.",0,14,NA,NA

As CNN cameras rolled, Lemon held a microphone as an officer is gruffly ordered, “Move out of the way, sir. Move!” To which Lemon reponded,“We’ve been standing here all day.” Still, the officer outstretched his arms to push the reporter and the crowd back.

“We’ve got rights!” a woman behind Lemon screamed.

Lemon continued his report despite the officer’s aggressiveness toward him and the crowd. “I’m not going to resist a police officer,” Lemon stated as he was pushed backward. “Now you see why people are so upset here, because we have been here all day,” he added. “We’re on national television. So imagine what they are doing to people when you don’t see on national television, the people who don’t have a voice like we do.”

At one point, the 48-year-old Emmy Award-winning reporter, who has received criticism from the Black community for his controversial generalizations about Blacks, asked an officer, why he was trying to move people out of the area. After listening to the officer’s response, Lemon concluded, “I think from my perspective here, the police actually created the traffic situation and the situation that’s going on, the chaos here, rather than the people who are just standing here.”

Mya Aaten-White (pictured) posted an image to her Instagram page, which showed her bandaged and bruised, and her former school acknowledged her via social media.

Aaten-White was among the many citizens who took to the Ferguson streets to protest the police shooting death of 18-year-old Michael “Mike” Brown. Although details of who shot Aaten-White are not yet known, the current legal assistant posted the photo of her injury on Wednesday. From the photo, Aaten-White is in the back of an ambulance receiving treatment for her injuries.

According to a report from NBC Washington, there hasn’t been an announcement from authorities confirming if the shooting occurred during the protests nor has Aaten-White provided more information aside from her postings on social media. A scan of her Instagram page does show she was active and on the ground during the protests.

Howard University’s Twitter page featured a tweet in support of Aaten-White:

“Our prayers are with alumna Mya White & her family. The senseless gun violence has to stop. As a nation, we must stand against the violence,” it read.

The situation in Ferguson has been intense over the past few days, but the state finally took action Thursday by replacing an  police force in the predominantly Black city with the Missouri State Highway Patrol squad. The state’s Highway Patrol will be led by Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, an African-American man who is a native of St. Louis.

Brown, a 2014 graduate of Normandy High School, was scheduled to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday.

According to Dorian Johnson, he was walking with Brown when an officer confronted them and drew his weapon.

“He (the officer) shot again and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air,” said Johnson. “He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.”

“He was a good kid. He didn’t live around here,” said Desuirea Harris, grandmother of the victim. “He came to visit me and they did that to him for no reason.”

Brown’s mother, Lesley Mcspadden, reacts:

“We are hurt to hear that yet another teenaged boy has been slaughtered by law enforcement especially in light of the recent death of Eric Garner in New York who was killed for selling cigarettes.

I said, “Now who among you are willing to step up in your cities and make this happen?” Immediately, I had people from Detroit, from Chicago, Philadelphia, DC, come up and say, “I’ll do it, I’ll do it. I’m willing to organize.” As more and more people joined, I gave people some guidelines. I put out an request for someone to design a logo and a young woman stepped up and did it. I asked people to create a Facebook event page, identify the location where you’ll be, and to make a vigil — not a rally or a protest because you have to permits to do those. Some areas actually did get permits because they are doing actions near their State building. Most vigils are happening in open parks where you can assemble, so we wanted people to be consistent with that message. So that there would be uniformity.

To all who are reading this,
We are Anonymous.

We call upon the citizens of the United States to rise up and stand in solidarity with the people of Ferguson. They are currently fighting for their right to peacefully protest. The media will have you believe that these protesters are looters and criminals. This is certainly not the case. As we’ve seen tonight with our own eyes, the police began preemptively striking the protesters with tear gas, rubber bullets, and flash bangs. We’ve seen journalists assaulted and arrested, targeted by tear gas and rubber bullets, and told to turn off their cameras and move away or be subject to arrest. We witnessed as police threatened demonstrators to DISPERSE AND RETURN TO THEIR HOMES, and then firing tear gas in people’s own yards.

We cannot sit still and watch this happen. It is our time to get off our chairs, turn off the TV, and make ourselves heard. Let us all stand in solidarity with Mike Brown, the people of Ferguson, and every single person that was brutalized, and brutally murdered by so-called authorities.

Anonymous plans to assist with protests by leaving our keyboards and going on the ground with the people. Our collective will join those who demonstrate on the streets.

Now Hampton, Mo., resident Joshua Hampton, along with his girlfriend and a friend, allege they were arrested for sitting in his aunt’s driveway, reports the  {The Washington Post}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/17/i-just-kept-asking-why-am-i-being-arrested-for-sitting-in-my-aunts-driveway/?hpid=z12"">.

After reportedly attending a march for slain youth Michael Brown, Hampton, his unidentified girlfriend, and her friend were allegedly sitting in his aunt’s driveway in the wee hours Sunday morning discussing the events of the march. Soon after,  an officer suddenly approached Hampton’s vehicle with a gun pointed at his chest.

In a move that is probably pretty perfunctory for young Black men throughout the country, Hampton says he kept his hands where the officer could see them, while the policeman allegedly reached in to Hampton’s car through an open window and opened the vehicle’s door.

Hampton, his girlfriend, and friend were being arrested but on what grounds?

All three were reportedly ushered in to a police truck where they were first taken to a command post then transferred to another police vehicle. All the while, Hampton kept inquiring why they were being arrested since he felt neither he, nor his friends, had broken any laws sitting on private property in his aunt’s driveway.

Ironically, all three had actually planned on sitting outside his aunt’s home but then thought the better of it because they didn’t want to look as if they were loitering.

Even with his repeated inquiries, the three were taken to a county jail, where photographs of their faces became mugshots.

Police officials ultimately informed Hampton that he and his friends would get slapped with “pending to disperse charges,” which the young man thought was absurd since he was on private property.

Five hours later, the group was released from jail.

Ironically, there were seven people in all who were arrested at the time — including Hampton and his friends — and they had all attended the Brown march.",0,52,NA,NA

Four days ago John Wilson turned to Facebook for support without mentioning his son by name.

“Dear FB friends, Our family is in need for prayers to be sent up for a family member,” John Wilson wrote. “Circumstances do not allow for us to say anything further. Please pray with our family in mind. Put a covering of protection over our family member please.”
A woman who replied in the comment thread told John that she could put him in touch with someone that “has been through many difficult times with his children. Prayers are what brought the family through the rough times. We are just a phone call away.”
John Wilson thanked his many friends who were quick to offer encouragement.
“Please continue to do so as we deal with a family situation that is very challenging,” he wrote.
In his last post this week, John Wilson shared a saying from a Texas evangelical pastor: “When something is ‘out of control’ it is merely out of your control — not God’s!”
 
The Ferguson police department has done it’s best to paint Brown as the aggressor, describing Wilson as a “gentle” man and an “excellent” police officer who is “devastated” about killing Brown.

But he wasn’t too devastated to stand over him and gun him down while the unarmed teen held his hands in the air.

NewsOne,news18,https://newsone.com/3046139/peter-kinder-anglo-american-justice/,Missouri Lt. Governor Wants ‘Anglo-American Justice’,Michael Arceneaux,08/19/14,02/10/17,"While I can appreciate Missouri’s Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder (R) (pictured) not agreeing with Ferguson Mayor James Knowles’ foolish claims that “{there is not}<hyperlink=""http://on.msnbc.com/XychPK%20""> a racial divide in the city of Ferguson,” I’m weary of anyone who uses phrases like “Anglo-American civilization.” Repeatedly at that with a selective interpretation of history, that when used, (indirectly or not) makes the ugly insinuation that those protesting in the streets of Ferguson are outliers.

In the wake of crisis in Ferguson, Kinder has been on a bit of media tour to critique his superior, Democratic Governor Jay Nixon. One of those stops included Tuesday’s edition of “Ronan Daily,” where Kinder explained to Ronan Farrow why he feels the city should restore its curfew. Kinder said, “I don’t understand an argument for not reinstating it. I don’t understand that. I’m not trying to be overtly political. I am saying, the people of Ferguson, the people of the state of Missouri are crying out for leadership.”

He is indeed being overly political, but politicians will do what politicians will do. However, wrong is wrong and it’s absolutely incorrect for Kinder to assert, “We do not do justice in America in the streets, though.”

Kinder is White and 60 years old. That makes him old enough to remember a time in American history, when disenfranchised people had to take to the streets in order to get the government to recognize their rights and humanity. 

When did this happen?
Say, the 1960s…or any period between August 9th and today.

Kinder’s pro-Anglo bit {carried on}<hyperlink=""http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/08/19/missouri-lt-gov-we-need-anglo-american-justice-in-ferguson-not-racial-protests/"">:

“We have legal processes that are set in motion, that are designed after centuries of Anglo-American jurisprudence tradition. They’re designed to protect the rights and liberties of everyone involved — that includes the Brown family, for justice for them and for the community. It also includes the officer who has not yet been charge. Our constitutional and our Bill of Rights protections have to be followed here, and we do not do justice in the streets.”

Unfortunately, this went unchallenged by Farrow. The same goes for Kinder’s claims that, “That’s one of the great advances of Anglo-American civilization, is that that we do not have politicized trials. We let the justice system work it out.” Why not gussy up this fallacy further, Kinder? Just tell us Jesus ghostwrote the Constitution while you’re at it.
For someone who recently claims that he experienced racism due to his mother having something called “Black Mother-it is,” it’s a shame Farrow didn’t challenge — even subtly —  Kinder’s description of America solely through the prism of Anglo Americans. I don’t know what “{Black Mother-itis}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/ronan-farrow-mother-blackmotheritis"">” is exactly, but perhaps it’s contagious and something that precluded Farrow from pushing back on Kinder’s White lies about this joyous Anglo-American civilization yesterday.

Not for the sake of creating one of those typically useless cable news TV fights, but for the simple fact that Kinder’s idea of America is both ahistorical and exclusive to Whites. Kinder needs to understand that the people out protesting for justice on the streets of Ferguson are being just as American as anyone who participated in the Boston Tea Party. You know, because Kinder is a stickler for all things Anglo. He also needs to understand that this Anglo-American utopia he speaks of also has a long history of slavery, genocide, rape, and yes, mistreatment of people of color.

Then again, Kinder only knows the America he sees. Yet, he and others like him are being reminded that they are not the only people here. Nor are they the only people worthy of being heard. Different means of expression do not make our words any less important. Kinder’s remarks are the very sort of speech that contributes to the racial divide in Ferguson, across the state of Missouri and elsewhere in the nation.

It’s mighty White Anglo-American to think otherwise.",0,48,NA,NA

Streets in Ferguson upended on Sunday night were relatively quiet early Monday. Some debris littered the area but crowds had dispersed.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said 32 people were arrested for various infractions including assault, burglary and theft. Schellman said two officers suffered minor injuries and that there were no reports of civilians hurt.

The tensions erupted after a candlelight vigil Sunday night for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday in a scuffle with an officer. The investigation in to what led to the shooting is ongoing.
 
Several businesses were looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique, and a small grocery store. People took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer, and carted rims away from a tire store. Some climbed atop police cars as the officers with riot shields and batons stood stoic nearby, trying to restrict access to the most-seriously affected areas.
 
Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used Brown’s death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.
 
“Most came here for a peaceful protest, but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. … I can understand the anger and unrest, but I can’t understand the violence and looting,” Trout, 53, said.
 
St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries as of about 11 p.m. But there were scattered reports of assaults into the very early morning. Pat Washington, a spokeswoman for Dooley, said tear gas had been used. Authorities would not immediately confirm media reports of gunfire.
 
“The small group of people are creating a huge mess,” Mayor James Knowles said. “Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. … We’re only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.”
 
County Police Chief Jon Belmar said that on Saturday, an officer encountered Brown and another man outside an apartment complex in Ferguson. One of the men pushed the officer in to his squad car and they struggled. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who fought with the officer.
 
The struggle spilled out in to the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn’t known and that all shell casings at the scene matched the officer’s gun. Police were investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.
 
Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and it wasn’t clear if he was armed.
 
Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV there’s no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn’t yet put to use.
 
Jackson said blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him. Toxicology tests can take weeks to complete.
 
Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting, “Don’t shoot me,” while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn’t use force; the crowd eventually left.
 
Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she didn’t understand why police didn’t subdue her high school graduate son with a club or stun gun, and that the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.
 
“I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,” she said, fighting back tears.
 
The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""https://newsone.com/tag/trayvon-martin/""> by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.
 
“We’re outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,” said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.
 
Ferguson’s population of about 21,000 people is almost 70 percent black. The race of the officer has not been disclosed. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.

POTUS on #MichaelBrown shooting at 1:13:30:

Read part of the transcript here:
 
Now, second, I want to address something that’s been in the news over the last couple of days and that’s the situation in Ferguson, Missouri.  I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we’ve seen in the heartland of our country, as police have clashed with people protesting.  Today, I’d like us all to take a step back and think about how we’re going to be moving forward.
 
This morning, I received a thorough update on the situation from Attorney General Eric Holder, who has been following it and been in communication with his team.  I’ve already tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI to independently investigate the death of Michael Brown, along with local officials on the ground. 
 
The Department of Justice is also consulting with local authorities about ways that they can maintain public safety without restricting the right of peaceful protest and while avoiding unnecessary escalation.  I made clear to the Attorney General that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened, and to see that justice is done.
 
I also just spoke with Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri.  I expressed my concern over the violent turn that events have taken on the ground, and underscored that now is the time for all of us to reflect on what’s happened, and to find a way to come together going forward.  He is going to be traveling to Ferguson.  He is a good man and a fine governor, and I’m confident that, working together, he is going to be able to communicate his desire to make sure that justice is done and his desire to make sure that public safety is maintained in an appropriate way.
 
Of course, it’s important to remember how this started.  We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances.  He was 18 years old.  His family will never hold Michael in their arms again.  And when something like this happens, the local authorities –- including the police -– have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death, and how they are protecting the people in their communities.
 
There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting.  There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.  And here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.  Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority.
 
I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened.  There are going to be different accounts of how this tragedy occurred.  There are going to be differences in terms of what needs to happen going forward.  That’s part of our democracy.  But let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family.  We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law; a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest; a reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us; and the need for accountability when it comes to our government. 
 
So now is the time for healing.  Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.  Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done.  And I’ve asked that the Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney on the scene continue to work with local officials to move that process forward.  They will be reporting to me in the coming days about what’s being done to make sure that happens. 
 
Thanks very much, everybody.",0,41,NA,NA

The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time.  As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed.  I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.  We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.  Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.

Attorney General Eric Holder also released a statement yesterday on the shooting, calling for a federal investigation to supplement the inquiry by local authorities:

The shooting incident in Ferguson, Missouri this weekend deserves a fulsome review. In addition to the local investigation already underway, FBI agents from the St. Louis field office, working together with attorneys from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and US Attorney’s Office, have opened a concurrent, federal inquiry. The federal investigation will supplement, rather than supplant, the inquiry by local authorities. At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right. I will continue to receive regular updates on this matter in the coming days. Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

McSpadden went on to explain, “He was a good boy. He deserved none of this. We need justice for our son.”

No stranger to this kind of disregard toward Black people’s humanity, attorney Benjamin Crump, who has since been retained by Brown’s parents, made his thoughts clear at a recent press conference. “I don’t want to sugarcoat it, their baby was executed in broad daylight,” Crump noted. “We want to know and see exactly what happened because this family rejects what the police authorities said at their press conference.”

As does Michael Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson, who along with other eyewitnesses, {disputed Brown’s killer’s claims}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> that he shoved the officer and tried to wrestle the officer’s gun from him.

Any Black man living in this country and who values his life knows better than to tempt fate that way.

The truth may be less imaginative but no less chilling: Even when we don’t fight back, our presence is still intimidating to the point where select members of law enforcement feel no choice but to shoot us dead.

Such a revelation brings justified anger, and while Brown’s parents have encouraged protesters to remain peaceful, their rage is understandable.
Protesters arrived with signs and peaceful discourse and were greeted with dogs, rubber bullets, and tear gas.

And as New York Times correspondent Julie Bosman {reported via Twitter}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/juliebosman/status/499000196953817089"">, these rubber bullets were even shot in the direction of journalists and photographers. Meanwhile, area police officers {describe the scene}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/juliebosman/status/499018559075651584""> as a “war zone” and even when protesters sought an exit, the police reportedly blocked them from locating one. There’s since been word of one police officer {referring to protesters}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/felixgirke/status/499162801500614656""> as “fucking animals” during coverage on CNN.

Yet, some wonder why some of the protesters supposedly sang, “F*ck the police.”

And while I don’t necessarily excuse the acts of looters and those described as “rioters,” I do have empathy. This is why I take issue with Jonathan Capeheart’s “{A Shameful Way To Protest the Michael Brown Shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/08/11/a-shameful-way-to-protest-the-michael-brown-shooting/"">,” where he writes, “This is not how you make authorities understand your anger and concern. This is not how you get others to join your cause.”

You mean the authorities who shot a Black child in cold blood, left him in the street for hours as some sort of “example” to other people in his area, and greet peaceful protest with nothing but contempt and the intent to further antagonize? The same authorities who employ individuals who refer to the rightfully angry public as “f*cking animals.” The authorities who enter their neighborhood and limit their access?

I am not in the business of policing people’s emotions particularly with respect to dire situations such as these. Anger has its consequences, including irrational behavior. It doesn’t make it right, but learn to have compassion for people in a situation you have yet to experience. There’s a time for discussions on personal responsibility and there’s a time to look at tragedy and respect the rightful rage it creates.

Many people are angry and they are running on empty.

I am tired of having to write about people like Michael Brown. The same goes for 22-year-old John Crawford III, {who was shot and killed after holding a BB gun in a Walmart}<hyperlink=""https://newsone.com/3042992/john-crawford-ohio-police-walmart/"">. Like Brown’s mother, Crawford’s father described his son fondly, saying, “He was a good son and a good Father to his two children.”

We shouldn’t have to quantify our lives this way.

We shouldn’t have to quantify our lives this way.

It doesn’t even matter if Michael Brown was a “big teddy bear” heading to college or that John Crawford was a good Dad. No matter what kind of personalities they had, there was no reason to slaughter them this way. We shouldn’t have to worry that once our lives are unjustly stripped from us, we will be purposely vilified in order to excuse our killers’ actions — as evidenced in the trending topic {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=""http://theurbandaily.com/2014/08/11/if-they-gunned-me-down-hashtag-mike-brown/?_ga=1.113111876.1532971526.1486760369"">, and more hauntingly, in both trials relating to the deaths of Trayvon Martin and {Renisha McBride}<hyperlink=""https://newsone.com/3042697/one-battle-won-in-the-war-against-black-bodies-opinion/"">.

Structural racism, widening economic inequality, a gun manufacturing lobby so hell bent on making money that they’ll probably see to it that guide dogs for the blind receive gun permits, plus the continuation of the militarization of police have all helped it be open season on Black people. You can’t help but feel exhaustion, grief, and yes, anger.  To some, such rage may not “help our cause,” but the alternative clearly has its limitations too.

Brown, aka “gentle giant,” as he was so lovingly referred to by his loved ones, was senselessly gunned down by a Ferguson, Missouri police officer on August 9 while he and a friend were on their way to his grandmother’s house.  The young man was approached by Officer Darren Wilson for walking on the side of a road.

When the officer told him to get on the sidewalk, an altercation allegedly occurred and Wilson reportedly shot a bullet from his cruiser.  The boys ran fearing for their lives.  According to witness accounts, Brown held up his hands in compliance but the officer allegedly brutally gunned him down anyway.

Brown, who had never been in trouble with the law, was unarmed.

Everyone who knew Brown loved him.  According to his dad Michael Brown, Sr., the boy did not like violence and steered clear of it.  “He was funny, silly. He would make you laugh. Any problems that were going on or any situation, there wasn’t nothing he couldn’t solve. He’d bring people back together,” the dad recounted to a CNN reporter.

Brown, who had just graduated high school, was a fave among his former teachers because he stayed out of trouble and worked hard to graduate.  The 18-year-old was determined to make something of himself and according to friend Hershel Johnson, “We were at graduation, me and him, and we were talking.  He said he wasn’t going to end up like some people on the streets. He was going to get an education. He was going to make his life a whole a lot better,” he told the news {outlet}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/michael-brown-remembered-as-a-gentle-giant/article_cbafa12e-7305-5fd7-8e0e-3139f472d130.html"">.

Lesley McSpadden told CNN that her son was so excited about starting technical college, “He looked forward to it so much. You didn’t have to tell him, ‘Make sure you get to school.’ He was ready.”

On the young man’s career radar was a future job as a heating and cooling engineer, working at repairing air conditioning units.  Instead of pursuing pipe dreams like becoming a basketball or football player like a lot of his classmates, Brown focused on one day possibly owning his own business.  According to friend Gerard Fuller, “He’d say, ‘Let’s make something out of nothing,'”he told the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/michael-brown-remembered-as-a-gentle-giant/article_cbafa12e-7305-5fd7-8e0e-3139f472d130.html"">.

Unlike so many of the people he knew, Brown valued getting an education and according to Johnson, “He said he wasn’t going to end up like some people on the streets. He was going to get an education,” he told the Post-Dispatch. “He was going to make his life a whole lot better.”

And now Brown, a “good kid,” who had mapped out a solid plan for his life, always managed to do the right thing and who made his parents proud is lying in a coffin and according to his heartbroken father, “He didn’t deserve none of this.”",0,10,NA,NA

North Carolina rapper J. Cole, with a heavy heart, pleads for the police to find value in black life on the song “Be Free.” The Roc Nation artist also pleads for the freedom to live. The sparse beat provides an open space for Cole to deliver simple yet poignant lyrics like, “All we wanna do is take the chains off/All we wanna do is be free.”

The cover for the single is the chilling photo of Brown’s lifeless body on display in the middle of the street as a cop stands nearby. A message appears on the photo, “Rest in Peace to Michael Brown and to every young black man murdered in America, whether by the hands of white or black. I pray that one day the world will be filled with peace and rid of injustice. Only then will we all Be Free.”

Singer Elle Varner took a more general approach to her protest song. While many are solely focused on the shooting of Michael Brown, Varner wrote a song talking about peace all over the world. “One Love” finds the jazz-influenced chanteuse imagining a world where guns aren’t necessary and speaking respectfully to one another is the norm. Before releasing the track, Elle stated, “Over the past few tumultuous days I have prayed long and hard for Mike Brown’s family, the people of Ferguson, and the families of many others we have lost due this horrific death pattern. With persistence, strategy, and intellect, we can not only obtain justice for Mike Brown but we can effectuate changes that will prevent these things from happening again!”

We have to do something different. It hasn’t changed that black boys have been dying since we came to this country. He won’t be the last cop to shoot an unarmed black man. What we gotta make sure is that we help to get the laws passed so that (officers) don’t get off. You don’t get the laws passed by breaking into QuickTrip.

All we are doing is disgracing the memory of the victim and his Brown family. The only pictures we should see on world news is Michael Brown, his mother and his father. That’s it.

NewsOne,news28,https://newsone.com/3045642/ferguson-autopsy-shows-michael-brown-was-struck-at-least-6-times/,Preliminary Autopsy Shows Michael Brown Was Shot at Least 6 Times,NewsOne Staff,08/18/14,02/12/17,"A preliminary autopsy of Michael Brown — performed Sunday by Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York — found that the unarmed teenager was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

“People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day 1,” Baden told The New York Times after performing the autopsy. “They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.”

According to Baden, who performed the autopsy at the Brown family’s request, although Michael was shot at least six times, only three bullets were recovered from his body. In a diagram of the entry wounds, he noted that the six shots produced numerous wounds with some of the bullets entering and exiting several times, including one that left at least five different wounds.

The {Times has the story}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?smid=tw-share"">:

One of the bullets entered the top of Mr. Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury, according to Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, who flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family’s request to conduct the separate autopsy. It was likely the last of bullets to hit him, he said.

Mr. Brown, 18, was also shot four times in the right arm, he said, adding that all the bullets were fired into his front.

The bullets did not appear to have been shot from very close range because no gunpowder was present on his body. However, that determination could change if it turns out that there is gunshot residue on Mr. Brown’s clothing, to which Dr. Baden did not have access.

One of the bullets shattered Mr. Brown’s right eye, traveled through his face, exited his jaw and re-entered his collarbone. The last two shots in the head would have stopped him in his tracks and were likely the last fired.

Mr. Brown, he said, would not have survived the shooting even if he had been taken to a hospital right away. The autopsy indicated that he was otherwise healthy.

Dr. Baden said it was unusual for the federal government to conduct a third autopsy, but dueling examinations often occur when there is so much distrust of the authorities. The county of St. Louis has conducted an autopsy, and the results have not yet been released.

He stressed that his examination was not to determine whether the shooting was justified.

“In my capacity as the forensic examiner for the New York State Police, I would say, ‘You’re not supposed to shoot so many times,’ ” said Dr. Baden, who retired from the state police in 2011. “Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.” {Read more}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?smid=tw-share"">.

And so, as students begin their school year this week, they can look forward to the prospect of their campus police officers going G.I. Joe in drag on any given day. When appearing before the board, Compton Unified Police Chief William Wu said, “This is our objective — save lives, bottom line.”

All I can hear right now is “whoa dere, daddy, daddy.”

Who exactly are they protecting students from with such weaponry?

{According to the Los Angeles public radio station KPPC}<hyperlink=""http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/08/18/46025/school-police-assault-rifle-policy-raises-question/"">, Wu claims that officers “are woefully underequipped in the event of a terrorist attack or mass shooting, in which shooters increasingly wear body armor, which is not penetrable with standard firearms.”

Riddle me this, Batman: What beef does Hamas have with the students of Compton, California? Not to mention, since when are the “urban schools” known for mass shootings? And how many of these mass shooters are showing up with body armor?

Wu went on to explain, “Handguns you’d be lucky to hit accurately at 25 yards. With a rifle in the hands of a trained person, you can [fire at] 50, 100 yards accurately.”

Take three teaspoons of paranoia, a dollop of crazy talk, and blend it with the tragic trend of treating even civilian institutions, such as public schools, as a war zone and what you have is a recipe that’s perfect for gun manufacturers and nauseating to the rest of us.

However, the police union continues to defend the move, {writing}<hyperlink=""http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/08/compton-school-board-approves-ar-15-rifles-for-campus-police/378738/"">:

If we encounter an active mass murderer on campus with a rifle or body armor, our officers may not adequately be prepared to stop that suspect. School Police Officers will undergo a training course, followed by a shooting proficiency test on a firing range and a written exam. The rifles are designed for increased accuracy and use rifled ammunition than can pierce body armor. The safety of our Students, Staff, and Parents are very important to us.

New York Times columnist Ross Douthat {refutes such logic}<hyperlink=""http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/arms-and-the-cop/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1"">, noting that “the evidence that such sprees are sharply increasing is {shaky and debatable}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/17/graph-of-the-day-perhaps-mass-shootings-arent-becoming-more-common/""> and the evidence that a more militarized police is necessarily crucial to stopping such killers seems thin as well.”  Douthat also made note of recent events in Ferguson, Missouri, writing that “the question raised by the trajectory of events in Ferguson is whether the use of military tactics by ordinary cops early in a protest-driven crisis is the best way to forestall such a breakdown, or whether it actually makes that point of breakdown more likely to arrive.”

The Atlantic’s Conor Friedersdorf {commented}<hyperlink=""http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/08/compton-school-board-approves-ar-15-rifles-for-campus-police/378738/""> on the “nationwide trend of militarized police force” adding that this is taking place “in schools with heavily armed city and county police agencies nearby.” I imagine Wu and other defenders of this move could also cite issues with gangs having heavy military in the area, but even in that scenario, why can’t they handle that issue with the armor already provided, or if nothing else, contact SWAT and other agencies in the area if necessary?

What troubles me most about this, though, is that in the last few weeks, we have been provided with horrific reminders that there are plenty members of law enforcement with a blatant disregard for Black life. Moreover, many of these officers refuse to use the other tools on their belt before reaching for their gun, and when they do reach for their guns, they’re shooting to kill as opposed to wound.

Cops, much less ones on public school campuses, don’t need this sort of weaponry. Period.",0,22,NA,NA

Spirit Airlines Responds to a Passenger’s Claim of Racism

Bellach was traveling from Dallas to Phoenix when she says she came across a black male passenger who had purchased an upgraded ticket that would allow him to sit in the front of the plane. According to Bellach, when the passenger approached his assigned seat, there was already a white man sitting in the seat, next to another white traveling companion.

When the unnamed black passenger informed the white man that he was sitting in the wrong seat, the passenger scoffed at him, Bellach says. At that point, according to her account, the black man told the white passenger that he would be back and then walked toward the flight attendant, presumably to resolve the issue. The black man returned with a white female attendant, Bellach says. But, she told The Root, the attendant sided with the white passenger. {Read more}<hyperlink=""http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/spirit_airlines_responds_to_a_passenger_s_claim_of_racism.html"">.

Democrats Pay Black Staffers 30% Less

If you’re a person of color hoping to get hired by a political campaign, here’s the ugly truth: You’ll probably get paid less than your white counterparts, if you’re even hired at all. On both sides of the aisle, there is a racial pay gap in campaign politics. Asian, Black and Latino staffers are paid less than their white counterparts, according to an analysis by the New Organizing Institute. For example, African-American staffers on Democratic campaigns were paid 70 cents for each dollar their white counterparts made.

Crawford was in the toy section at Walmart’s Beavercreek location when a customer called 911 to report a man waving “what appeared to be an AR-15 at children and others.”

“He said he was at the video games playing videos, and he went over there by the toy section where the toy guns were,” said LeeCee Johnson, the mother of Crawford’s children, who was on the phone with him the entire time. “The next thing I know, he said, ‘It’s not real,’ and the police start shooting, and they said ‘Get on the ground,’ but he was already on the ground because they had shot him.”

“I could hear him just crying and screaming,” Johnson said. “I feel like they shot him down like he was not even human.”

Crawford, who, according to his girlfriend, went to the store to get ingredients for S’mores, was reportedly holding a MK-177 (.177 caliber) BB/Pellet Rifle when he was gunned down.

“He looked like he was going to go violently,” said Ronald Ritchie, the former marine who called police. “If he would have dropped the weapon, he could have came out with his life, but unfortunately, he didn’t.”

The police department is showing no remorse over Crawford’s slaying.

According to police chief Dennis Evers, Officers Sean Williams and David Darkow acted appropriately when they shot Crawford to death

“The officers gave verbal commands to the subject to drop the weapon,” Evers said in a statement. “The subject … was shot after failing to comply with the officers’ commands. The quick response of officers was instrumental in containing this situation and minimizing the risk to customers.”
