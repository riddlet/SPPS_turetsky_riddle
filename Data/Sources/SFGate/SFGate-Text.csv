SFGate,sfg1,http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/johnson/article/Ferguson-protests-should-spark-peaceful-uprising-5690000.php,Ferguson protests should spark peaceful uprising of raised hands,Chip Johnson,08/15/2014,03/20/2016,"I have watched with great despair and sadness the events that have unfolded in Ferguson, Mo., this week after the fatal shooting by police of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=”http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea%2Fjohnson&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Michael+Brown%22”>, an unarmed 18-year-old African American man.

Consecutive days of protest, interspersed with looting and violence, have captured the nation's attention and raised serious concerns that the police response - with smoke bombs, tear gas and rubber bullets used on protesters - is worsening the situation.

But amid the chaos, there has been one poignant gesture in Ferguson that seems to capture the sentiments of many black folk around the nation. As police officers approach, some protesters simply raise their arms high in the air.

It's the universally recognized symbol of surrender, a sign that the person represents no threat or ill intentions. It's what a witness said Brown was doing when a police officer opened fire.

In this instance, it sends a message: African American residents are not the enemy. We're law-abiding people who come from every walk of life, and we need police to stop shooting our kids! Please.

I believe African Americans deserve an annual national event to honor the memories of our brothers, uncles, cousins and fathers who've died in confrontations with police. Goodness, there are plenty of them - and it seems like more each week.

On Monday night, a Los Angeles police officer shot and killed {Ezell Ford}<hyperlink=”http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea%2Fjohnson&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Ezell+Ford%22”>, an unarmed man with mental problems, in Florence, an unincorporated community in south-central Los Angeles. The shooting occurred after police stopped Ford on the street. Police said there was a struggle. A witness said the man was on the ground when he was shot. Ford was 25.

Unarmed and 23
On Aug. 3, an Alameda County sheriff's deputy shot and killed Jacorey Calhoun, who fled from Oakland police and deputies investigating a home-invasion robbery. {John Burris}<hyperlink=”http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea%2Fjohnson&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22John+Burris%22”?, the family's attorney, has said Calhoun was unarmed and running away when a sheriff's deputy shot him in the head. Calhoun was 23.

There's also {Alan Blueford}<hyperlink=”http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea%2Fjohnson&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Alan+Blueford%22”>.

He was an 18-year-old high school student - just a month shy of graduating - when an Oakland police officer chased him for three blocks one night in May 2012 and shot him three times in the chest after Blueford tripped and fell. Blueford's parents and supporters have never accepted the claim by authorities that the youth was armed when he was shot.

Then, of course, there's {Oscar Grant}<hyperlink=”http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea%2Fjohnson&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Oscar+Grant%22”>.

Like the protests in Ferguson, the demonstrations after the killing of the unarmed Grant by BART police on New Year's Day 2009 were violent and destructive and fueled by outrage at the slaying and law enforcement's lack of transparency.

Those shootings and countless others are why we should gather on that day outside police stations, precincts and headquarters by the millions, every hue in the broad spectrum of the African American community, form a line and raise our arms high in the air. The call to justice can't be carried by Occupy protesters or Anonymous, the shadowy anarchist group, or even well-intentioned supporters. It has to come from us, in our words, relaying our hopes and dreams - but most of all our heartsick grief and pain.

There should be doctors and lawyers and engineers and police officers, political leaders and professionals of all kind. Everyday people, working-class people, rich and poor people, and disenfranchised people.

And whenever a police officer is encountered on the street that day, whether you're in Seattle, New York or Tuscaloosa, Ala., throw your hands into the air until he or she passes by.

Collective sadness

Not only would it be a profound statement too broad to ignore, it may be the best way to convey our collective sadness, fear and concern for our kids - especially our young men - far too many of whose lives end unfulfilled and tragically by a shot from a law enforcement officer's firearm.

The scene in Ferguson, a predominantly black city of 21,000 residents patrolled by a police department with just two black officers in a force of 55, looks like it was torn from the pages of a history book on the civil rights demonstrations in the South in the mid-1960s.

For anyone not old enough to remember or who hasn't seen footage from the oft-bloody civil rights protests, the scene in Ferguson was eerily similar. Virtually all of the protesters were African American and nearly all of the police were white.

It's those circumstances that heighten frustration and anger.

In Chicago, where African Americans are 80 percent of the victims in officer-involved shootings but make up just under one-third of the city's population, there's a community perception that police only make bad situations worse when they are called, said {Craig Futterman}<hyperlink=”http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea%2Fjohnson&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Craig+Futterman%22”>, a professor at {the University of Chicago}<hyperlink=”http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea%2Fjohnson&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22The+University+of+Chicago%22”> Law School who has studied the relationship between police and black residents in some of Chicago's poorest and most segregated communities.

Treated as criminals

Students at all-black high schools in South Chicago told researchers that being treated as a criminal suspect in encounters with police is standard, he said.

""When me and my law students look at them in a dumbfounded way when they talk routinely about being stopped and searched, they look at us like, 'How dumb can you be?' This is still very much a story about race in America,"" Futterman said. ""It's not just about police.""

While there is no repository that gathers statistical data on how many unarmed African Americans are shot by police each year in the U.S., the anecdotal evidence from cities large and small has become too overwhelming to ignore.

The death of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=crime&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Michael+Brown%22”>, 18, hung over the vigil at {Frank H. Ogawa Plaza}<hyperlink” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=crime&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Frank+H.+Ogawa+Plaza%22”>. But his name was only one in a list of young people of color shot dead by police that the demonstrators repeated Thursday night.

They shouted the names over the hum of news helicopters overhead: ""{Alan Blueford}<hyperlink” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=crime&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Alan+Blueford%22”>."" ""{Andy Lopez}<hyperlink” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=crime&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Andy+Lopez%22”>."" ""Alex Nieto.""

And on the signs some carried was the phrase that has been a rallying cry: ""We are {Oscar Grant}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=crime&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Oscar+Grant%22”>.""

Bay Area protests against police brutality - some that turned violent - made national headlines after the death of the 22-year-old Grant, a Hayward resident who was lying prone when shot by BART police at the Fruitvale station in the early morning hours of Jan. 1, 2009.

The protests then grew from the same plaza where the peaceful but energetic vigil was held Thursday night. Like the protests in Ferguson, the rallies in 2009 became violent at times. Demonstrators clashed with officers in SWAT gear, and there was rioting and vandalism.

A jury acquitted former BART police Officer {Johannes Mehserle}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=crime&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Johannes+Mehserle%22”> of murder in July 2010, but convicted him of involuntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to two years in prison and served 11 months before being paroled. BART has paid more than $2.5 million in settlements to Grant's family.

The vigils in the Bay Area were part of the National Moment of Silence, a nationwide action against police brutality. In San Francisco, demonstrators gathered at {Civic Center}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=crime&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Civic+Center%22”>, where streets were blocked by police. In Santa Rosa, people rallied for Andy Lopez, the 13-year-old shot by a Sonoma County sheriff's deputy who said he mistook the teen's toy gun for a real one.

And in Oakland, Jeralynn Blueford, the mother of 18-year-old Alan Blueford, who was shot and killed by Oakland police on May 6, 2012, stepped to the front of the gathering to both support the protesters in Ferguson and further rally the group against police brutality.

""This is not 'protect and serve' - this is shoot to kill,"" she said to cheers and applause. ""I can't get my Alan back, but I can stand up to say, 'I'm not going to take it anymore.' I'm a mother of action and it's time to take action.""

In Oakland, the moment of silence lasted just a few minutes. It was broken with chants of what has become Ferguson's rallying cry: ""Hands up, don't shoot.""",100,NA,NA,NA
SFGate,sfg3,http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Ferguson-a-familiar-story-to-young-black-males-5692082.php,Ferguson a familiar story to young black males,Spencer Whitney,08/15/2014,03/21/2016,"Two years ago, I was stopped by Berkeley police while returning home from Oakland's First Friday Art Murmur. They claimed I ran a stop sign on my bike. There was no stop sign. My bag was searched and I was patted down, and forced to sit on the curb for 30 minutes while backup was called and two more officers arrived. I was three blocks from my house.

When nothing was found and the officers realized I was a graduate student at UC Berkeley, I was eventually let go. After being searched and questioned, I received neither an explanation nor an apology.

I guess I should count myself as fortunate that the situation didn't escalate.

As a young black man, I've been stopped countless times by police: in cars, walking down the street, on a bicycle. My encounters with law enforcement are similar to that of many black males growing up, whether they live in big cities or rural towns.

There is a reason the shooting of 18-year-old {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Michael+Brown%22”> in Ferguson, Mo., has generated so much anger and frustration. It evokes the long history of racial violence in the United States. It makes us wonder, once again, whether black lives matter.

Since the shooting, there have been demonstrations in Ferguson and beyond, calling for justice and an end to police brutality. The over-the-top response by Ferguson police had the aura that they were taking on an enemy army: tear gas, rubber bullets, camouflage body armor, armored vehicles. Missouri Gov. {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Jay+Nixon%22”> said Ferguson looked like ""a war zone.""

In fact, law enforcement across the country has begun to resemble small armies, a result of persistent funding to fight the drug war and 9/11-related terror plots. Something is terribly amiss when police officers in our neighborhoods are wearing more body armor and equipment than our soldiers who invaded Iraq. While I don't condone any of the looting, rioting or violence, I can understand the pain of a community that feels victimized and oppressed by the people who are sworn to serve and protect them.

It's not just the police that seem to be at war with communities of color. With the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown, black people across the country have taken to Twitter to express their outrage with media outlets in the portrayal of Brown, who was originally shown with his high school graduation photo. The picture was later changed to a more insidious photo of the teenager dressed in a sports vest making a sign with his hand that could be perceived as a gang photo.

On Friday, Ferguson police identified {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Darren+Wilson%22”> as the officer who killed Brown - along with revealing that Brown was the lead suspect in a robbery at a convenience store. The fact that police waited days to simultaneously release these details suggests an effort to shift blame from the officer to a focus on Brown's character, even the offense that caught Wilson's attention was jaywalking.

Once again, we are seeing an unarmed young black man on trial for his own murder. It's appalling.

The question remains: When will law enforcement be held accountable for their actions against black youth?
The shooting in Ferguson is not unique. Michael Brown is not unique. What happened to me in Berkeley is not unique. What happened there can happen anywhere. The next time I'm stopped by the police, I'll be left wondering: Will I be the next Michael Brown?",82,NA,NA,NA
SFGate,sfg4,http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-rally-protests-Missouri-shooting-5692419.php,"Oakland, Berkeley marchers protest Missouri shooting",Vivian Ho,08/16/2014,03/21/2016,"The events of the last week in Ferguson, Mo., where the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Michael+Brown%22”> led to days of protests against heavy-handed police tactics in the St. Louis suburb, continued to reverberate across the country Friday.

More than 100 people marched through the streets of Oakland and Berkeley and on the UC Berkeley campus on Friday evening, protesting police brutality in solidarity with those in Ferguson and calling for justice in the name of Bay Area victims of violence at the hands of law enforcement.

Protesters broke windows and damaged property in both cities.

Two arrests were reported in Oakland. A 45-year-old Oakland man was taken into custody for allegedly assaulting an officer, and a 41-year-old Hayward man was arrested on suspicion of obstructing police.

In Berkeley, police arrested {Taylor Tengwall}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Taylor+Tengwall%22”>, 24, of Berkeley for allegedly resisting arrest and {Lael Montgomery}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Lael+Montgomery%22”>, 19, of Vallejo on suspicion of trying to remove a weapon - not a gun - from an officer and resisting an officer. Tengwall was being held at Berkeley City Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail, while Montgomery has posted bail.

{Dana Sabir}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Dana+Sabir%22”>, 23, of San Leandro said she joined the march ""to show that America will not go for justice anymore, that it's not OK to treat people who are different than you like animals.""

""Something has to change,"" she said between chants for justice for Brown and Oscar Grant, ""because it keeps happening and happening.""

The march got under way around 7 p.m., heading south on Broadway from {Frank H. Ogawa Plaza}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Frank+H.+Ogawa+Plaza%22”> with protesters chanting, ""Justice for Michael Brown!"" and ""Hands up! Don't shoot!""

Police presence was heavy, with officers in riot helmets carrying long batons, but the march was mostly peaceful except for several tense moments. Police faced off with protesters near a freeway on-ramp and, at one point, someone discharged a noxious spray, causing many to cough. The origin of the spray was unclear.

Oakland police on scene said they did not use any chemical agents, and several officers were affected by the spray, according to Sgt. {Holly Joshi}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Holly+Joshi%22”>, chief of staff for Chief {Sean Whent}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Sean+Whent%22”>. One officer suffered a back injury, she said.

""The majority of protesters were committed to being peaceful. However, there were elements in the crowd intent on committing acts of vandalism and attempting confrontation with officers,"" Joshi said.

Whent said his officers acted with ""tremendous restraint"" and ""exhibited a high level of professionalism.""

As night fell, a few protesters with covered faces pulled out paint cans and hammers and sprayed antipolice graffiti on buildings along the march route and broke some windows of businesses on Telegraph Avenue.

Drivers along the way, sitting in cars blocked by the marchers, honked in support, eliciting cheers from the crowd. At one point, aerial fireworks were set off near 14th Street and Broadway, bringing more whoops and hollers from the rowdy protesters.

When one masked protester tried to spray paint on the window a restaurant, 53-year-old {Ralph Guerra}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Ralph+Guerra%22”> ran at him, telling him to stop.

For his efforts, protesters poured liquid down his back. ""Smells like urine,"" Guerra said, but it had the strong burn of alcohol.

""These people are just local business people,"" Guerra said. ""Like over there, Youth Radio? They broke their windows last time. They're a nonprofit. They're not trying to hurt anybody.""

Guerra is a plumber who services local Oakland businesses. He said he had an equal beef with the police not doing more to stop the vandalism.

""That?"" he said, gesturing to a helicopter above. ""That's not helping anybody. They're spending millions of dollars, but what are they doing?""

The march was billed as a ""F- the Police"" action by organizers, but ""FTP"" meant different things to different people.

SFGate,sfg5,http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Michael-Brown-death-illustrates-need-to-rescue-5691870.php,Michael Brown death illustrates need to rescue urban youth,Jewelle Taylor Gibbs,08/15/2014,04/06/2016,"One of the major factors contributing to the stressful environment for young black males (and other minority youth) continues to be the persistent pattern of police harassment, misconduct and brutality toward these youth. As {Michelle Alexander}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Michelle+Alexander%22”> has noted in her recent book, ""The New Jim Crow,"" the United States has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world; this seems to be a deliberate strategy to deal with black males who are frequently viewed as a threat to the social order.

In 1988, I published the book, ""Young, Black and Male in America: An Endangered Species,"" delineating and analyzing the multiple social problems of black youth in American society: high rates of school dropouts, unemployment, delinquency, drug use and incarceration.

These problems were then, as now, exacerbated by single-parent families, poor schools, inferior housing and lack of access to social services and health care. During the past 25 years, these socio-environmental factors and related social problems have shown very little improvement, despite sporadic, short-term intervention efforts.

The tragic death of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Michael+Brown%22”>, a college-bound black male in Ferguson, Mo., is just the latest example in the past 25 years of brutal beatings and killings of unarmed black males by the police, from the highly publicized cases of {Rodney King}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Rodney+King%22”> in Los Angeles, {Amadou Diallo}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Amadou+Diallo%22”> and {Abner Louima}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Abner+Louima%22”> in New York City in the 1990s to the more recent killings of Eric Garner on Staten Island and {Ezell Ford}<hyperlink=” http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Ezell+Ford%22”>, a mentally impaired 25-year-old in Los Angeles on Monday.

In the first three cases, predominantly white juries were unwilling to convict the police despite overwhelming evidence of excessive force and intentional culpability to harm these victims. Each incident had its unique set of circumstances, yet it is important to examine the phenomenon of violent confrontations between the police and young black males in a broader sociohistorical context.

As these black youth grow up in a society where they are targeted from birth with low expectations for success in schools, negative stereotypes in the community, and differential treatment by representatives of all major social institutions, much of their behavior can be understood as a fairly rational response to these recurrent social messages.

By the time they reach early adolescence, many have experienced failure in school, problems with social agencies, rejection by adults in authority roles, and harassment by police for ""stop and frisk."" It should not be surprising that they begin to react externally with anger and hostility to these frequent negative social interactions, thus inevitably provoking confrontations with parents, teachers, social workers and the police.

However, internally, many of these youth develop feelings of frustration, hopelessness and despair, leading them to seek alternative identities and illegitimate sources of income, such as gang membership, drug dealing or illegal gambling. If they can't gain recognition and succeed in the regular economy, they will gravitate to the ""underground economy,"" setting themselves up for a lifetime of skirmishes with the police and cycles of incarceration.

Given this vicious cycle of deprivation, despair, confrontation with police, and incarceration, what are the remedies? Demographic trends indicate that minority youth (African American, Asian, Latino and Native American) will constitute a majority of all youth in the United States by 2018; the total minority population will become the majority of the nation by 2043.

As the majority white population ages and declines in the next 30 years, the implications of these demographic trends are quite significant. If our society does not change course rather quickly to develop long-term solutions to these problems, there will not be a well-educated and well-trained labor force to fill the increasingly technological jobs of the future.

Many experts have advocated for a Marshall Plan for America's inner cities in order to rebuild their infrastructure, improve the schools, create sustainable jobs, build affordable housing, and provide an array of social, health and recreational services.

However, the politicians have routinely complained that these programs would be too costly and voters don't want to pay higher taxes for such ambitious social programs. Yet it is very ironic that in the past decade our government has spent billions of dollars on unsuccessful wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are currently spending millions to rescue tribal minorities in Iraq, sending medical aid to Ebola patients in Africa, and supporting military conflicts throughout the Middle East and Eastern Europe. It is past time that we rescue our own urban areas from poverty, blight and dysfunction.

I would suggest that it is not only a political and moral imperative to invest in our inner cities in order to improve life options for black and other minority youth and their families, but it is also an economic imperative to reverse the deteriorating cycle for these youth.

If America hopes to remain the most vibrant and innovative nation in the world, our political, business and educational leaders must collaborate in building a national consensus to transform the rhetoric of equal opportunity and equal justice for all into realistic possibilities, policies and programs for these youth to succeed and enter the mainstream of American society.",5,NA,NA,NA
