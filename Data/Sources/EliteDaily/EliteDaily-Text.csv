EliteDaily,elite1,http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/fresh-prince-ferguson-michael-brown/718326/,An Episode Of ‘The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air’ Is Eerily Similar To The Events In Ferguson,Adam Pliskin,08/19/14,02/13/17,"The shooting of Michael Brown and {the situation in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://elitedaily.com/news/world/ferguson-police-tear-gassed-protestors/714305/"">, Missouri have opened this country’s eyes to the sad truth that racism is still alive and well in America. 

Many may have felt we’ve been living in a “post-racial” America after the election of Barack Obama. 

Clearly, that couldn’t be further from the truth. This type of racism perpetrated by law enforcement officials is nothing new. 

In fact, “{The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air}<hyperlink=""http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/will-smith-jazzy-jeff/714777/"">” dealt with such systemic racism in an episode called “Cased Up” that aired in 1991. Coincidentally (or maybe not), 1991 was the same year of the Rodney King beating by members of the LAPD, not far from where the sitcom is set. 

In this particular episode, Jazz (DJ Jazzy Jeff) has a court date after getting into a car accident. In the court, Jazz refuses to lower his arms as he fears that the bailiff may empty his clip into Jazz’s back. 

It’s a chilling coincidence that Michael Brown was shot exactly six times by police officer Darren Wilson. 

Basically, the whole point of highlighting this clip from 1991 is to prove that not much has changed in the intervening years. 

Racism still runs rampant in the US, and hopefully, by highlighting examples such as this one, people will start to get the message.

Brown was shot and killed in Ferguson, Missouri, by a police officer on August 9. His shooting immediately led to protests in Ferguson, which eventually escalated into rioting, vandalism, looting and violent clashes between residents and the local police. 

At present, the situation in Ferguson is only {getting worse}<hyperlink=""http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/2014-racism-still-alive-well-america/707655/"">, as understandably angry residents continue to clash with police. 

It’s tragic that in 2014, the United States of America is still dealing with systematic racial discrimination, particularly given the history of the country in relation to slavery and Jim Crow. Progress is a bumpy and convoluted road. 

Yet, the United States is not alone, as there are also many disturbing trends surrounding race, immigration and politics in Europe. 

Likewise, as this man from Paris recently Tweeted: We complain about racism in America but in Europe it’s severe — Olà⚡️ (@olaadams_) August 12, 2014 Neo-Nazism, xenophobia and racism are shockingly and disturbingly on the rise in many nations across Europe. At present, this is true both in terms of European politics and culture.

Neo-Nazis In the EU: European Parliament Elections

In May, the world witnessed what some have characterized as a “{political earthquake}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/25/world/europe/eu-elections/"">” in Europe, as far-right parties from a number of countries gained substantial ground in the European Parliament. A leader of one of these parties from Greece, {Ilias Kasidiaris}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/07/greece-golden-dawn-fascism-threat-to-democracy"">, even has a swastika tattooed to his arm (seen above). 

That’s essentially the equivalent of letting someone dress as a member of the KKK in the US Congress. Neo-Nazism is not only evident in Greece, it is also prevalent in Sweden, among {other European countries}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/26/far-right-europe-election_n_5391873.html"">. 

Some neo-Nazis from {Sweden}<hyperlink=""http://www.thelocal.se/20130131/45918""> have also {made pilgrimages to Ukraine}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/28/the-swedish-neo-nazis-of-kiev.html""> in an attempt to influence the situation there. 

Accordingly, many of these far-right parties have radical and oppressive agendas. For example, the founder of the French party Front National {suggested that Ebola could be released on migrants}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/21/jean-marie-le-pen-ebola-population-explosion-europe-immigration""> in order to decrease their numbers. 

Moreover, in Holland, the Party for Freedom is {fiercely anti-Islam}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/03/geert-wilders-defections-freedom-party"">, so much so that it wants to {prevent Muslims from being able to enter the country}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/26/far-right-europe-election_n_5391873.html"">. 

Needless to say, there are some decidedly unsettling trends in Europe at present. 

{Euroscepticism}<hyperlink=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2014/05/european-elections-0"">, or discontent with the European Union, has allowed many of these parties to make political gains.

It’s also evident in everyday European life. Recently, a Greek court acquitted Greek farmers that {shot 28 Bangladeshi strawberry pickers}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/31/greek-court-acquits-farmers-shot-strawberry-pickers"">. These were migrant workers who simply requested months of backpay that they were owed.

Racism in Sports

[tweetbegin 468948049260457984 tweetend]

Indeed, racism is a huge problem in Europe when it comes to football, or soccer. 

Players of color are often heckled by fans in Italy and Spain, among other places. Fans have been heard using racist slurs, monkey chants and have even thrown bananas and peanuts at certain players. Imagine if something like that happened at an NFL game in the United States… There would be riots. 

In the video below, a player from the Ivory Coast becomes so fed up with fans in Italy that he understandably picks up the ball and attempts to walk off the field. This man has even been ridiculed by fans in his own stadium for his race… It’s heartbreaking. Sports are meant to breed solidarity, but obviously some people haven’t got that message.

Racism in soccer goes to show that discrimination in Europe extends far beyond its politics. It’s disgusting that this still happens in the present-day, but at least there are some people who are able to take it in stride… Early this year, Dani Alves, a Brazilian who plays for Barcelona, had a banana thrown at him by a fan. His reaction was priceless, and sparked a social media campaign {#SayNoToRacism}<hyperlink=""http://elitedaily.com/sports/worlds-best-soccer-stars-join-barcelonas-dani-alves-fight-racism-photos/"">…

Anti-Semitism

{Anti-Semitism is on the rise in Europe}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/07/antisemitism-rise-europe-worst-since-nazis"">. This is reminiscent of the Holocaust, which makes it particularly disconcerting and terrifying. Much of this sentiment is {derived from the current situation in Gaza}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/08/09/anti-semitism-europe/13662903/"">, but that does not justify blatant acts of hatred. 

Very recently, there have been incidents in multiple European countries, including Germany, in which mobs have attacked Jewish neighborhoods, synagogues and businesses. In one instance, a synagogue in France was {firebombed by a mob of over 400 people}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/07/antisemitism-rise-europe-worst-since-nazis"">. Clearly, racism and discrimination are not unique to any single country or region. Oppression is a global problem that we must all address in unison. 

In this globalized world, it is inevitable that we will all find ourselves in more diverse societies, and it’s imperative that we learn to live together. We are all human, and everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. 

It is a shame that we are still dealing with problems surrounding racism {across the globe]<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/"">. 

Until more of us realize that we are meant to share this world, and that race is ultimately superficial, it seems that this madness may continue. The battle against intolerance is fundamental to the survival and progression of humanity, and we must all strive to join this fight.

Shoot, coward, you are only going to kill a man. — Che Guevara Famous last words, like those of Che Guevara and Josephine Baker, are many times immortalized as we pair them with the witty, cunning and elusive status of their owners. But when the words are spoken too close to home, they hit us with a different effect.

Like those of Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin, the last words of the unjustly murdered sit cold on the page, not yet ready to be seen with enlightenment and wisdom. Dark tragedy holds a power different from those whose deaths we were not around to witness. They are words that haunt us and hurt us, as we sadly realize that when we’re not looking at it as history, it’s tragedy. 

This chilling {Tumblr account}<hyperlink=""http://nowinexile.tumblr.com/post/94852596429/the-last-words-said-by-black-youth-before-they"">, which showcases the last words of victims before they were murdered by vigilantes or policemen, awakens a different type of pulse in our hearts.

In the wake of the {events surrounding Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://elitedaily.com/news/world/ferguson-police-tear-gassed-protestors/714305/"">, this brutal testimony should be a reminder that injustice still exists in this world and last words shouldn’t mean lost battles. 

Eric Garner was 43 when he was brutally choked and murdered by a Staten Island police officer when trying to break up a fight. John Crawford was fatally shot by a policeman in an Ohio Walmart for holding a toy gun. Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer although he was unarmed and standing at a distance from the cop. 

Trayvon Martin was fatally shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, for having a hood on and “looking suspicious.” Sean Bell was fatally shot in Queens, NY, by undercover NYPD officers on the morning of his wedding. He was attending his bachelor party at a strip club that was being investigated by undercover police when the cops misinterpreted a conversation and thought a shooting would take place. 

Oscar Grant was fatally shot in Oakland, California, when police arrived on the platform of the Fruitvale BART station after calls of a fight. They detained him, threw him on the ground and shot the unarmed Grant in the back, stating that he “resisted arrest.” 

Kendrec McDade, a California college student and football star, was fatally shot seven times at close range by Pasadena cops responding to a false robbery claim that he had stolen a store worker’s backpack. Amadou Diallo was fatally shot after four New York City police department officers fired 41 shots outside his apartment. 

He was unarmed. Kimani Gray was fatally shot seven times after sparking mini street riots. There were three bullets in his back, suggesting he was running away. 

Jonathan Ferrell was fatally shot after getting into a car accident, dragging himself to the nearest house and asking for help from the home of a woman who subsequently closed the door on him and called the cops.
