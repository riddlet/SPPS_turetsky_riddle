A hard-working young man, Mr Brown graduated from Normandy High School on 1 August, some months after he posed with around 100 or so others in his senior class.

Described as a “gentle giant” with a “football tackle build”, he was in an alternative learning programme at school and was far from the first in his class to get his diploma.

In glowing tributes, his teachers said he’d “accomplished it” in the end, and was due to start at a local technical college on Monday, 11 August.

But two days before that he was killed, shot in an incident involving a police officer that has sparked {widespread fury in what is rapidly descending towards a national crisis}<hyperlink=”http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ferguson-missouri-riots-police-use-rubber-bullets-and-tear-gas-as-new-witness-says-michael-brown-9668278.html”>.

The anger in Missouri comes first and foremost from the fact that they have lost a member of the community, killed by those whose pledge it is “to protect and serve”.

The incident set off an immediate, spontaneous demonstration, and was initially called in to dispatchers at St Louis as a case requiring “crowd control”.

Though they have repeatedly called for only peaceful demonstrations, the Brown family have led protesters in their rage at what has happened.

Immediately after the incident, Desiree Harris said she was expecting Mr Brown, her grandson, to visit her that afternoon and discovered him dead after she heard a commotion outside her apartment complex.

“When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing,” she said.

The teenager's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told an acquaintance the shooting was “wrong and it was cold-hearted,” the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

And according to the newspaper, Mr Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, held a sign that read: “Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!”

Two witnesses to the incident say that the teenager was shot while he had his hands in the air in submission. The first, Dorian Johnson, was walking with his friend Mr Brown when there was a row with a police officer in a car.

Johnson has said in media interviews that the officer wanted the pair to move over onto the pavement, a request they refused. He says his friend was not struggling with the officer and had his hands in the air when he was shot multiple times in the head and chest.

Tiffany Mitchell, another witness, told CNN she saw Mr Brown “tussling through the window” of the police car with the officer. She said a shot was fired through the window, and then Mr Brown backed away with his hands in the air.
“The cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks the concrete,” she said.

Many are angry now at what they see as a lack of police transparency over the shooting. Their account of what happened remains vague, describing simply a struggle over a gun in a police car.

They have also refused to reveal the name of the officer involved, saying that he will become a “target” following threats received online – particularly after a number of hacking attempts from the group Anonymous. The officer was placed on administrative leave following the incident.

Perhaps what has angered people most since the shooting itself is the perceived disproportionate nature of the police response.

Images widely shared online show officers equipped with military-style fatigues, automatic rifles and using reinforced vehicles.

Since yesterday they have also deployed tear gas, smoke grenades and rubber bullets – but County Police Chief Jon Belmar insists his officers have acted with “an incredible amount of restraint” as they've been the targets of rocks, bottles and gunshots. He said two dozen patrol vehicles had been destroyed.

This has not been just a show of strength from the police, either. Around 10 people were arrested on Wednesday evening, including the highly-respected St Louis alderman Antonio French, who had been tweeting from the protests.

That same night two reporters, Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan J Reilly of Huffington Post, were arrested when police shut down a McDonald’s restaurant from which they had been reporting.

In total, around 40 protesters have been arrested so far since Saturday.
“I've had enough of being pushed around because of the color of my skin. I'm sick of this police brutality,” said one protester, who gave only his first name, Terrell, 18. “I'm going to keep coming back here night after night until we get justice.”

The incident has highlighted the ongoing and serious issue of civil rights in the town, as well as across the rest of the US, and Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson called improving race relations “the top priority right now”.

[tweetbegin 499714499688300545 tweetend]

The numbers are again getting people angry. Around 70 per cent of the town’s 21,000-strong population are black. But on the police force of 53, just three officers are black.

Mr Jackson said the protests involved “an undertow [of racial unrest] that has bubbled to the surface”.

Some civil rights leaders have drawn comparisons between Mr Brown's death and that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was shot dead by a Florida neighbourhood watch volunteer who was later acquitted of murder charges.

Meanwhile, police in California were investigating a separate incident of an officer fatally shooting an unarmed 25-year-old black man in Los Angeles.

With the scale of the protests having increased each night and Barack Obama now briefed on the Ferguson situation by the Attorney General Eric Holder, the fury is not expected to have abated before tonight.

There is also anger that the US President remains on holiday on the Massachusetts island of Martha’s Vineyard.

He knows more bad stuff could be seconds away. “Tonight it’s not going down, it’s not going down tonight.”

The leader of a group called Black Lawyers for Justice, Malik Shabazz isn’t alone in joining the throng once again protesting against the shooting of a black man here 10 days ago, urging the restless, nervy crowd to stay within the bounds of lawful protest, not to provoke the police into yet another night of conflagration. Local community leaders are trying the same as well as a contingent of pastors.

“I am whispering in their ears, telling them to move on, that we care and that we love them,” says the Rev Michael McBride of the Way Christian Centre in Oakland, California. He has come because he is horrified. “If only police departments across the country would do the same. Whisper in their ears, tell them they love them.”

Love, however, has for the time being taken its leave from Ferguson, a suburb on the north-western edge of St Louis. It flew away at about four minutes past noon on 9 August when a police officer, identified as Darren Wilson, 28, fired six bullets into the unarmed man, 18-year-old Michael Brown, and robbed him of his young life. It was gone when the police let his body lie on the street for hours before finally taking it away. Or perhaps it was gone long before that in a town where to be black is to feel disenfranchised, relegated to life’s lower divisions, oppressed.

Unrest in Ferguson over Michael Brown shooting
 
Love seems a quaint sort of sentiment. We see what’s happening here at the junction of Ferguson and West Florissant Avenues. A rag-tag line of police – some with gas masks, some without, all with riot shields – has blocked us off to the south and, some distance away to the north a second line is forming. We, protesters and journalists, have become penned in. A sonic cannon is beginning to pierce our ear drums. It gives out a percussive, high-pitch shrieking.

Video: Unrest continues in Ferguson
And we see also the hulking black vehicle – Captain Ron Johnson, the State Trooper assigned by Governor Jay Nixon at the end of last week to take charge, is later to call it a “Swat truck” – with its front turret. The turret has a man inside who pops out occasionally gripping a machine gun. He sweeps its muzzle left to right. For a second its barrel is pointed at me, just as the searchlight from the helicopter above every now then catches me in its gaze.

And love is not what they are asking for now. It’s justice. “We want justice, we want justice,” the protesters bellow. It’s what Mr Shabazz’s group is after. It’s what the rather young and occasionally terrified-looking band of observers from Amnesty International is here to protect. America thinks it can take justice for granted. But in Ferguson, that is being tested. Justice is looking slovenly, amateurish and slow. And it’s looking ugly.
Justice is the holy grail in Ferguson. President Barack Obama says he wants it. So does the Attorney General, Eric Holder, who will be here today and who has opened his own federal investigation into what happened on that Saturday to Mr Brown. The circumstances of it are still unclear. Justice is what his mother, Lesley McSpadden, says must happen before the trouble will stop. But the road to it is long and has many forks.

Ms McSpadden and most of the demonstrators wanted it yesterday. That they don’t see it is what enrages them. But in America justice is a deliberate and bureaucratic affair. Evidence surrounding the shooting that has been collected so far, most of which we haven’t seen, will be presented for the first time by the St Louis prosecutor, Robert McCulloch, to a special grand jury beginning today. But that process may take weeks to complete. American justice is a thing of cogs and they turn slowly, far too slowly for the family and its supporters.

Justice means allowing everyone out here on this sultry night to voice their anger, as the US Constitution requires. And it means listening. Captain Johnson tries hard to do that. Before this night’s mayhem breaks out – and how it does – he walks among the angry crowds, he tries to debate with everyone. Like Charles Reid, a 59-year-old computer technician, who has been here every night since last Wednesday with his “honey”, Renee. He holds a sign that says it precisely. “JUSTICE, LOVE, PEACE”. Why not get people like him to help the police, he asks, keep the order, clear the streets of fallen projectiles, move people onto the pavement?

And he tries to reason with the young man, who beats his own chest hard enough to break a rib, demanding that he be heard. “The kids are hurting, the kids are dying. We need your help, we need your help,” he rages, his face in the captain’s, sweat running down his neck. His scrawled sign says “2 Timothy. 1:7. Don’t Kill!” “If you want to hear my response, you have to listen too,” the captain attempts. The man doesn’t listen, though; he is almost crazed.

Justice on this night also means something else, says the captain. It means letting people like this man speak, but not letting those who break the laws of the land – breaking windows, looting and firing weapons – get away with it. It is getting those people who pollute peaceful protest out of the way. And it means giving the police their Swat trucks, smoke bombs, stun grenades and the gas. Or so insists the captain. Otherwise mayhem takes hold.

“The violent voices here are the ones who are here to get something,” he tries to explain, surrounded on the street in a scrum of reporters and angry residents. “You break into a meat store and the meat isn’t going to last. But the people who are here for change, that will last a lifetime. We have to take those elements out and let them know they are not going to win. I am not going to let those bent on ruining this community to succeed.”

But what does justice in America look like exactly when so suddenly a town like this can resemble less a suburb in the heartland than a battlefield in Gaza, a terrorist stronghold in Iraq or a Taliban redoubt in Afghanistan? For right here, in a just a moment, everything goes mad.

It happens at the other police line, to the north, where I and a small group of reporters wandered to. It’s where a far more determined knot of men have gathered. No pastors are here. A man tears a street sign out of the road and brandishes it before the police line, another Swat truck in place. Over a loudspeaker a disembodied voice appeals for them to disperse, “or you will be arrested”. Then another instruction: members of the media must separate themselves from the protesters “immediately”. I retreat into the bay of a scruffy car wash, watching, wondering if my not having a gas mask is something I might soon regret.

As I do. I am still not exactly clear how it started. But loud cracks ring out from a side street – the street where Michael Brown was felled. Then I see the rockets fly into the air, like fireworks. White smoke begins to billow and a colleague mentions smoke bombs. But it’s not that, it’s tear gas. We all run. Those unprotected clasp our hands to our faces. But nothing stops the grip of the gas on your eyes and then your lungs.

On Monday it did go down, startling and appalling all of America all over again. And maybe it will go down again tonight and for many more nights to come. Justice has revealed itself above all to be two things: a thing of violence and great noise and a thing of clay, unable to satisfy the demands for speed. It requires patience and it requires trust.

Now in its second week, the protests triggered by the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer, Darren Wilson, show no sign of abating even after attempts by officials to use multiple tactics to stop the violence. 

While Governor Jay Nixon had ordered in the National Guard on Monday he had also lifted a nighttime curfew in hopes of easing tensions.

Captain Ron Johnson, the State Trooper appointed by Governor Nixon to restore order to the community, spent the first part of the evening walking along the stretch of West Florissant Avenue, the strip that has been the main flashpoint of the nightly eruptions, talking with protesters about his hopes that the worst might be over. “In my gut, in my soul, I feel that tonight is going to be better,” he commented.

By the end of the night Capt Johnson said that two people had been shot, 31 protesters arrested and that police had come under 'heavy gunfire"" during the course of the night.

Unrest in Ferguson over Michael Brown shooting

""These criminal acts came from a tiny minority of law-breakers,"" he said. ""It is criminals who throw Molotov cocktails, fire shots and endanger lives. These are not acts of protesters but acts of violence.""

""Not a single bullet was fired by officers despite coming under heavy attack. Our officers came under heavy gunfire,"" he added.

Earlier, the atmosphere was edgy as a line of police officers in gas masks and riot gear had formed a line at one end of the protest area. Soon, a second phalanx of police, now backed up by armoured vehicles topped with machine gun nests had also gathered at the other end of the street. Sound cannons released ear-piercing tones to discourage assembly. Sandwiched in between were hundreds and demonstrators and journalists.

While some degree of calm appeared to be holding at one end with the help of several community organisers and church pastors mixing with the crowds and urging restraint, at the other end, just off the street where the teenager, Michael Brown, was killed last Saturday, a far angrier knot of demonstrators had gathered, taunting police, ripping out a street and ignoring orders to disperse.

With a far smaller group of reporters at the same junction as witnesses, the stand-off abruptly dissolved into fresh chaos.  First some of the protesters scattered, as if spooked by something, which later was said to have been gunfire. Moments later, the police began firing tear gas, while protesters began hurling objects back, ranging from water bottles to at least one Molotov cocktail. The gas in the area spread fast, sparing only the few wearing gas masks.

Later a police officer ordered a CNN broadcast crew - and soon all other remaining reporters - to clear what had been a media ‘safe’ area outside the McDonald's. “There has been a gunshot victim, please leave,” one officer shouted. Meanwhile, riot police weaved through the air pointing automatic weapons indiscriminately at protesters and reporters.

Seemingly not involved directly in the street confrontations were the National Guard troops, who held back mostly to protect the police command centre in a nearby shopping centre.

Earlier, President Barack Obama had said during a White House press conference that he had urged Governor Nixon strictly to limit the involvement of the National Guard to avoid further inflaming community resentment.

President Obama, who said he had directed the Attorney General, Eric Holder, to visit Ferguson personally on Wednesday, urged all sides to work for calm. “While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police, only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos,” he said.  “It undermines, rather than advancing, justice.”

The fresh protests followed the release by lawyers for Mr Brown’s family of the preliminary results of a privately conducted autopsy of the victim suggesting he had been shot six times. The trajectory of one bullet, from the top of the head and out one eye, was seen by some to corroborate claims that the young man had been trying to surrender when hit by the fatal shot.  A wound to an arm may also fit with his having had his arms raised at the time, though the private pathologists said they could not say for certain.  Two more autopsies are pending from St Louis and also federal authorities.

The family meanwhile called for the arrest of the officer responsible for the shooting, who has been identified as 26-year-old Darren Wilson.

“As officers arrived, the suspect turned towards the officers and started to walk towards them, clutching his waistband. He then pulled out a knife in what we describe as an overhand grip, and told the officers: 'Shoot me now, kill me now'.”

Police said the ignored verbal commands to drop the knife and continued to approach the officers, coming “within three to four feet” before two policemen opened fire. The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene while the officers, whose identity has been withheld, have been suspended pending an investigation. Details of the incident were still emerging on Tuesday but it will invariably inflame tensions, coming 11 days after the police shooting of Michael Brown which has sparked days of violent protests in the town of Ferguson, prompting a heavy police crackdown.

Many of the reporters already in the area covering the shooting of Mr Brown flocked to the scene of the latest incident, east of Ferguson, as news permeated across America.

Unrest in Ferguson over Michael Brown shooting

It comes at a delicate moment in the first investigation. US Attorney General Eric Holder is already due to visit Ferguson today to meet officials investigating the shooting of Mr Brown, while the St Louis county prosecutor's office confirmed it present evidence against the officer who killed Mr Brown to a grand jury imminently. Meanwhile a new poll by the respected Pew Research Center has found US reaction to the police killing of Michael Brown falls along distinct racial lines.

Meanwhile protesters have thrown bottles and Molotov cocktails at lines of police put in place to quell looting and violence in Ferguson, a town of about 21,000 people that is overwhelmingly African-American. In Washington, President Barack Obama said the vast majority of protesters in Ferguson were peaceful, but warned that a small minority was undermining justice.

Police and protesters have clashed almost nightly since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot by police offier Darren Wilson on 9 August, and reporters from across the world have flocked to the scene.

The shooting heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department in the Missouri city. Civil rights activists have compared the shooting to other racially charged cases, particularly the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin - the unarmed black teenager shot by Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.
As night fell in Ferguson on Sunday, the peaceful protest quickly deteriorated and clashes erupted three hours before the midnight curfew imposed by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon. Officers in riot gear ordered all the protesters to disperse. While many did, around 100 stood about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley of tear gas.

You get that light off or you're getting shot with this!”

Hussein, a political science student, has been documenting the demonstrations since Wednesday, according the Huffington Post. He told the website that Argus Radio was launched a year ago and had purchased video equipment to live stream concerts. But the station had decided to film protests in Ferguson as it feared local broadcasters would not continue their coverage through the night.

Meanwhile, Chris Hayes, a professional reporter from US TV channel MSNBC, was broadcasting live on air when an officer reportedly told him: ""Media do not pass us, you're getting maced next time you pass us.""

The incidents come amid swathes of posts on social media in which journalists complained of police tactics and aggression.  

TheTelegraph’s Rob Crilly, Neil Munshi of the Financial Times and Robert Klemko from Sports Illustrated all tweeted on Sunday that they’d been arrested by police in Ferguson, Missouri, but were released minutes later.

Stories of Molotov cocktails being slung at police, who in turn lob back flash grenades and tear gas, has left a community reeling.

The unrest was sparked by the 9 August death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, a black teenager fatally shot by police after what officers say was an altercation.

An autopsy found that he was shot six times – twice in the head – with eye-witnesses claiming that the teenager had had his hands above his head at the time he was killed.

Most of the protesting has been non-violent, with residents congregating almost immediately after Brown’s death shouting ""Don’t shoot me"" and ""No Justice! No Peace"".

Impassioned demonstrators have created heart-felt and poignant signs to supplement their chants in Ferguson and elsewhere, after protests erupted in other US cities in solidarity.

They also released new information about the circumstances of the shooting, apparently tying the teenager, 18-year-old Michael Brown, to an attempted robbery in a nearby convenience store minutes before he was killed.

In a brief press conference, Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, said the name of the police officer who shot the young Mr Brown just after midday last Saturday on a street outside a low income housing complex was Darren Wilson. He said he was a six-year veteran of the department with no history of disciplinary action for past infractions. He had earlier refused to release the name citing concern for the officer’s safety.

No arrests had been reported overnight in Ferguson, a mostly black suburb of St Louis, which over the previous four nights had been the scene of repeated stand-offs between armour-wearing police wielding tear gas canisters and stun grenades and protesters enraged at the shooting of Brown the previous Saturday.

But a decision by Governor Jay Nixon to take responsibility for security away from the Ferguson police department and give it to a state police force headed by an African-American captain went a great distance on Thursday night to defuse the atmosphere on the street. Whereas on previous nights, the streets were filled with tear gas, smoke and other projectiles, on Thursday night Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson was walking and chatting with protestors.

The convulsions in Ferguson have gripped the whole country and by Thursday both Governor Nixon and President Barack Obama were urgently calling for calm. There has also been growing revulsion at the intensity of the police response in the community before Thursday, prompting widespread calls for an examination of how police forces across the nation have become increasingly militarised, thanks in part to surplus equipment from the Pentagon.

Feeding the drama in Ferguson has been a lack of clarity about happened last Saturday. The police have said that Officer Wilson was assaulted by the young man and have spoken of his being treated in hospital for facial swelling. But witnesses have said that the teen had his hands in the air in surrender when he was brought down by gun fire.

As well as releasing the officer’s name, Chief Jackson also provided a packet of additional documents and video footage showing that Officer Wilson and colleagues had been called to a “strong-arm” robbery in a shop near to the location where Mr Brown was later shot. He did not confirm that one of those seen on security footage in the store was Mr Brown, but the documentation said he had been identified by one officer as being one of those in the store.

A ""strong-arm"" robbery implies that violence but no firearms were involved. The police assert that the officer was called to the incident at 11.52 am. The shooting of Mr Brown occurred only a few minutes later when he and one other man were asked to get out of the street by Officer Wilson who was in a police vehicle.

Chief Jackson wouldn’t response when pressed to explain what precise link there may be between the robbery and the shooting of Mr Brown. “I cannot discuss the investigation about the attempted apprehension of the suspect in the strong-arm robbery,” he said. “That goes to the county prosecutor’s office.”  

New protests erupted almost immediately after the police briefing, with marchers demanding ""justice"".

Thursday evening also saw scores of additional protest marches, rallies and vigils in different locations across the country mourning the death of the 18-year-old but also demanding information on why it happened and how. Among places that saw hundreds of concerned people gather, black and white, were both downtown St Louis just a few miles from Ferguson and also Times Square, New York, which after dark was closed by protesters.

Several members of Congress, currently on summer recess, have been driving the calls for an investigation into the transformation of police departments in recent years into mini-militaries with all manner of weapons and assault hardware, ranging from drones, machine guns to tanks. 

“Our Main Streets should be a place for business, families and relaxation, not tanks and M16s,” Democratic Congressman Hank Johnson said announcing plans to introduce legislation when Congress returns in September to curb the trend. “Militarizing America’s Main Streets won’t make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent.”",0,23,NA,NA

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said one person was shot and critically wounded after dozens defied a midnight curfew imposed on the town, NBC reports. He said seven people have also been arrested.

Tensions grew overnight after the Governor of Missouri declared a state of emergency in the St Louis suburb following violence on Friday. Governor Jay Nixon ordered a curfew to run from midnight to 5am beginning Saturday, telling reporters: “This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching.”

Many left the area peacefully before midnight, but around 150 protesters refused to leave before the deadline and police fired smoke bombs and tear gas to disperse the crowd. Johnson defended their use of tear gas as a “proper response”, which he said was done after a police car was shot at. 

Highway Patrol Spokesman John Hotz initially said police only used smoke, but later told The Associated Press they also fired tear gas canisters. He said of police efforts: ""Obviously, we're trying to give them every opportunity to comply with the curfew.""

Johnson said the police operation throughout the night was in response to unrest that erupted near the Red The BBQ Man restaurant in Ferguson, not in response to the curfew.
On Friday, Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson admitted at a news conference that the white officer who shot and killed Brown was not aware the teenager was a suspect in a store robbery, and had in fact approached Brown because “he was walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic"".

At around midnight that evening, a large crowd broke into the convenience store that the 18-year-old allegedly robbed the day he was killed and several other stores were also looted, while car windows and the glass around at least one bus stop were smashed.

Hundreds of campaigners took to the streets there and in cities across the US in remembrance of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager shot dead by a Ferguson police officer last Saturday.

The peaceful protests came after four straight nights in which heavily armed officers had fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators, leading to widespread condemnation of their aggressive tactics and calls for the demilitarisation of police in the US.

On Thursday, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon turned over responsibility for security in Ferguson from the local police to the State Highway Patrol, led by Captain Ronald Johnson, who is both black and a former Ferguson resident. Johnson told demonstrators on the street that they could remain there peacefully for as long as they wanted, and that his officers were there to “protect the safety of the community”.

Johnson told the Washington Post he was troubled by the breakdown in relations between police and residents. “When I see a young lady cry because of fear of this uniform, that’s a problem,” he said. “We’ve got to solve that.”

Thousands attended vigils and protests on Brown’s behalf in New York, Boston, Detroit, Chicago and Atlanta. The details of the 18-year-old’s death remain disputed. Ferguson police have so far declined to name the officer involved, but insist there was a struggle which left him with facial injuries. Other witnesses said Brown had his arms raised when the officer shot him multiple times.

The incident has inflamed existing racial tensions in a town with an overwhelmingly African-American community, but where only three of 53 police officers are black.

On Thursday, US President Barack Obama appealed for “peace and calm” in Ferguson following the unrest. Speaking from Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, where he is on holiday, the President condemned the looting and violence reportedly directed at police, but said there was “no excuse” for the excessive force used by law enforcement.

He also urged the police to be “open and transparent” about the facts of Brown’s shooting.",0,2,Tensions ease after responsibility for security handed from local to state police,NA

The group has also advertised a fundraiser asking for donations of $10 (£6) and above, with all proceeds going to “the cop who did his job against the negro criminal”.

SPLC, an Alabama-based civil rights organisation, said they received an email from the group about the reward being raised, which read: “We are setting up a reward/fund for the police officer who shot this thug.

""He is a hero! We need more white cops who are anti-ZOG and willing to put Jewish controlled black thugs in their place. Most cops are cowards and do nothing while 90 per cent of interracial crime is black (and non-white) on white.”

The KKK also sparked outrage in South Carolina last month when residents in Seneca, Oconee County, awoke to find bags of sweets on their driveways on a Sunday morning, along with leaflets urging them to “Save our land, join the Klan”.

Protests have continued in Ferguson throughout this week after officer Darren Wilson shot Brown on a street outside a housing complex in the St Louis suburb.

Tensions arose again on Friday night after a police statement was released showing the 18-year-old had been suspected of robbing a store before his death.

However, hours after Brown was named as a suspect in the ""strong-arm"" robbery of cigars from a store was released, police said that Officer Wilson, 28, had no idea he was a robbery suspect.

Jay Nixon, a Democrat, told ABC News he was “thunderstruck” by the images emerging from the St Louis suburb. “The over-militarisation… The guns pointed at kids in the street. All of that I think instead of ratcheting down, brought emotion up,” he said.

His comments came on Sunday morning as a man was in critical condition at a Ferguson hospital, having being shot overnight when protests over Mr Brown’s killing again descended into violence. Officers used smoke bombs, tear gas and wooden rounds to clear the streets on Saturday night, after Mr Nixon had declared a state of emergency in the hope of ending the unrest.

Police said a crowd of about 150 people defied a curfew imposed in the city between midnight and 5am, despite the pleas of some community activists who urged them to go home. Most were soon put off by heavy rain, and there was no repeat of the looting on Friday night, but seven people were arrested for failure to disperse. The unnamed shooting victim, who was not shot by police, was taken to hospital by bystanders.

Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, the black officer who has become the public face of the law enforcement response, said police moved in only after reports of a break-in at a local restaurant. “I was disappointed in the actions of tonight,” Capt Johnson told reporters yesterday. “We have a shooting victim in critical condition… We had a subject standing in the middle of the road with a handgun. We had a police car shot at.” He added: “I think that was a proper response tonight, to maintain officer safety and public safety.”

Mr Brown was shot dead on 9 August by an officer later named as Darren Wilson. The details of the incident are disputed: police said Mr Brown reached for the officer’s gun during an altercation inside a police car; witnesses insisted Mr Brown had his hands up when he was shot. The killing stoked anger in a community that is about two-thirds black, but patrolled by an overwhelmingly white police force. Public disquiet escalated when largely peaceful protests were met by officers in riot gear firing tear gas and rubber bullets.

Following four nights of clashes, the mood had cooled on Thursday as Mr Nixon turned over responsibility for security in the city from the local police to the State Highway Patrol, led by Capt Johnson, a former Ferguson resident.

But tensions flared again on Friday when local police issued a statement saying Mr Brown had been a suspect in a “strong-arm” robbery at a local convenience store. The authorities also released CCTV footage of the robbery, leading to accusations that they were trying to smear the victim. Mr Nixon criticised the release of the video, saying it “appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street.”

Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson later admitted at a news conference that Mr Wilson was not aware that Mr Brown was a suspect at the time of the shooting, and had in fact approached the teenager because “he was walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic”. The officer’s identity had been withheld for almost a week after the shooting despite widespread calls for transparency.

As he announced the curfew at a news conference on Saturday, Mr Nixon said: “The eyes of the world are watching. This is a test of whether a community, this community, any community, can break the cycle of fear, distrust and violence and replace them with peace, strength and ultimately justice… We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.”

They are angry because of the shooting dead of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, by a law enforcement officer on 9 August.

There is an ongoing official FBI investigation into the killing, which many of the demonstrators believe to be completely unprovoked and a sign of existing racial inequality in the criminal justice system.

They are demonstrating for the officer that killed him, Darren Wilson, to be arrested and tried for murder.

President Obama has called for calm, insisting that he understands the ""passions and anger"" that have possessed the neighbourhood in recent days.

But his plea fell on deaf ears, and police – supported by the National Guard – arrested a further 31 people last night (18 August) as the protests once more erupted in violence.

So rapper Nelly, a St Louis native, thought he’d have a go at restoring order to the conflicted area. Armed with a #MichaelBrown T-shirt and a megaphone, he took to the streets to appeal to local residents and convince them that violence isn’t the way to approach the tragedy.

""We've got to understand that we have options and stop choosing the reaction option cause at the end of the day we gonna pay - our brothers are gonna be the ones in jail,"" he said.

Eye-witnesses report seeing police, with no visible ID badges, hurling tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters and threatening members of the press in another night of demonstrations.

Amnesty International USA's Executive Director, Steven W Hawkins said that the “people of Ferguson have the right to protest peacefully the lack of accountability for Michael Brown’s shooting”.

Jasmine Heiss, one of the 13-strong team sent by Amnesty, told Buzzfeed that the limits placed on the organisation’s access to post-curfew areas was indicative of “the overall lack of transparency in this investigation”.

“Law enforcement, from the FBI to state and local police, are obligated to respect and uphold the human rights of our communities,” Mr Hawkins said in a statement on 14 August.

“The US cannot continue to allow those obligated and duty-bound to protect to become those who their community fears most,"" said Amnesty International USA's executive director, Steven W. Hawkins.”

The fresh dissidence has led to Jay Nixon, the Governor of the state of Missouri, ordering the deployment of National Guard troops to “protect life and property”, he said in a statement this morning.

The military will, he says, will “maintain peace and order” by closing streets and thoroughfares, if it must, after the events that have unfolded have “continued to create conditions of distress and hazard to the safety, welfare and property of the citizens of the community beyond the capacities of local jurisdiction”.

Relations between protesters and police quickly deteriorated yesterday as a second night under curfew began, following the State of Emergency that was declared on Saturday.

Officers say they were responding to gunfire, looting, vandalism and the hurling of Molotov cocktails at them, with at least two people wounded.

""Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of response,"" said Captain Ron Johnson, from the Missouri Highway Patrol.

A number of journalists present at the clash in the early hours of this morning reported being threatened with tear gas if they didn’t move, as they were shepherded away from the media enclosure.

“We want a thorough investigation into Michael Brown's death and the series of events that followed.”

Amnesty’s criticism is echoed by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, strangely, who also laid into the US for “committing crimes against its own people”.

He has issued a series of tweets over the last week highlighting how “racial discrimination’s still a dilemma in US”, as well as denouncing the country’s support of the Israeli government despite the deaths happening in Palestine, and the “illegal prisons & massacred #prisoners” in Afghanistan under President George W Bush.

He tweeted: “Based on global statistics, US govt is the biggest violator of #HumanRights. Besides int’l crimes, it commits crimes against its ppl #Ferguson”.

According to Human Rights Watch, Iranian authorities continue to subject political prisoners to abuse, while women still face “discrimination in many areas including personal status matters”.

“Authorities restricted political participation and employment of minority groups, who account for about 10 per cent of the population,” Human Rights Watch said of Iran, while the organisation has also called for US police to “stop intimidating Missouri protesters”.

An independent post-mortem yesterday found that Brown had been shot six times by the officer, including twice in the head.

Witnesses say his hands were above his head when he was shot, while the teenager’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, has called for criminal proceedings to be brought against policeman Darren Wilson.

The situation in the suburb of St Louis has rapidly deteriorated following largely peaceful vigils on Tuesday night, and has led to calls for Barack Obama to cut short his golfing holiday to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts.

Last night some protesters were seen hurling rocks at the heavily-armed and camouflage-wearing police units, while there were reports of young men preparing what appeared to be petrol bombs in a bus shelter.

Angry protests have taken place in Ferguson every night since Saturday, when the 18-year-old was shot to death in what police say was a struggle over a gun in a police car.

A new witness, Tiffany Mitchell, told CNN she was watching when Mr Brown and an officer, who has not been named, were “tussling through the window”.

Ms Mitchell said the officer was pulling the teen in as he struggled to get away, and then “a shot was fired through the window”.


“The kid finally gets away and he starts running. As he runs, the police get out of his vehicle and he follows behind him shooting,” Mitchell said, adding that Brown turned around and put his hands in the air.

“The cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks the concrete.”

Another witness, Dorian Johnson, has said that Brown was not struggling with the officer and had his hands in the air when he was shot multiple times in the head and chest.

Schools in the district around Ferguson have cancelled all classes until Monday, while national figures ranging from the civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton to the President himself have issued statements calling for calm.

Mr Obama was briefed on Wednesday night about the events unfolding in Ferguson by a team that included the US Attorney General, Eric Holder, the White House said.

While it has been said that the President could do more to calm the situation, an official at the White House came in for special criticism for tweeting about a party Mr Obama was attending as another night of unrest got underway in Missouri. The post has since been deleted.

A common theme among protesters has been the “brutality” of the heavily armoured police, who on Wednesday night also arrested two journalists while shutting down a McDonald’s branch from which they were reporting.

 Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said that the protests represented “an opportunity to fix what’s wrong” with race relations in the town. While around two-thirds of the 21,000 population are black, the vast majority of the 53=strong police force is white.

Meanwhile, police in California were investigating a separate incident of an officer fatally shooting an unarmed 25-year-old black man in Los Angeles.

On social media, groups claiming to be associated with the Anonymous hacker activist group called for nationwide protests and threatened to reveal personal information about Ferguson police officers.

The Ferguson police said there have been attempts to hack their website, which suffered a temporary disruption, and that the cyber-threats prompted their decision not to release the officer's name.",0,0,"As anger over black teenager’s death escalates, Barack Obama has been criticised for staying away on holiday",NA

But the flare-up after the shooting of the unarmed student Michael Brown by a white police officer, constitutes the biggest race relations test for America’s first black president since he took power. And in contrast with his previous forays onto this treacherous terrain, Barack Obama is displaying a caution that is disappointing some black opinion here.

Why, these critics ask, is he not planning a visit to Ferguson himself? Instead he is dispatching Attorney General Eric Holder to the St Louis suburb today. And why has Mr Obama not condemned the behaviour of the police more forcefully?

Instead the President, in his most extensive remarks on the subject on Monday, urged all parties to “seek understanding, rather than just hollering at each other.”

He did criticise the police and said he understood the anger at Mr Brown’s death among African-Americans. But, Mr Obama added, “giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police, only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos”.

That dry, almost scripted, response contrasts with his reaction to other recent racial incidents that have made headlines – above all the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch officer, on murder and manslaughter charges after he shot Trayvon Martin, another unarmed black teenager, on a Florida estate in 2012.

“If I had a son, he’d look like that… Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,” Mr Obama said then, explaining the deep resentment at what had happened: “there are very few African American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. There are very few African-American men who haven’t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars.”

But in the case of Michael Brown, the President has injected no such personal feelings. There are of course major differences. Then, Mr Obama was speaking after the legal resolution of the Zimmerman case. This time, the Ferguson investigation is barely started, with the most basic facts in dispute. All the more reason therefore, why Mr Obama should be studiously even-handed.

Bear in mind too that this black president has been burnt before when he waded into a racial controversy. After the 2009 arrest of the black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, at his Cambridge, Massachusetts, home, Mr Obama criticised police handling of the affair - only to stir a firestorm among police organisations, who claimed he had misrepresented the facts.

This time the President is, above all, seeking not to inflame matters, and thus leave himself room to tackle the issue at the heart of the Ferguson confrontation: the enduring white control of politics and the police in a predominately black town.",0,18,NA,NA

Footage of the chaos on the streets of Ferguson has dominated newscasts, yet attempts to ease tensions have faltered as local police commanders have chosen to deploy overwhelming force to repel protesters and have declined to release the identity of the officer who opened fire on 18-year-old Michael Brown, days before he was to start college.

“Many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we have seen,” President Barack Obama said, reiterating that he had ordered the FBI and the Justice Department to independently investigate the shooting of Mr Brown. The President broke from his holiday on Martha’s Vineyard to address the ongoing violence.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, told a meeting of residents that “you will all see a different tone” in the police response, after announcing unspecified “operational shifts” in law enforcement tactics.
 
While the exact circumstances of the shooting remain in dispute and may not be officially determined for weeks, his death has become the latest symbol of the simmering racial frustration that still infects American society, 50 years after the Civil Rights Act and six years after Mr Obama became the first black president.

Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, told a meeting in Ferguson that she was seeking a “demilitarisation” of the police response to the protests. Armoured vehicles and non-lethal ammunition such as stun grenades have been deployed, turning an American suburb into what has looked like a war zone.

Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St Louis County police department, defended the use of tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse crowds on Wednesday night, which also saw the brief detention of two reporters for videotaping the events. They were released without charge.

“In talking to these guys, it is scary,” Mr Schellman said of officers on the front lines of the protest. “They hear gunshots going off, and they don’t know where they’re coming from.”

Mr Obama said there was no excuse for vandalism or unwarranted attacks against the police, but added pointedly that there was “also no excuse for police to use excessive force against citizens” engaged in legitimate protests. He also took direct aim at whoever arrested the two reporters, working for the Washington Post and the website Huffington Post. Police “should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are trying to do their jobs,” he declared.
While Ferguson is the latest flashpoint in America’s struggle to overcome a legacy of racial tension going back to slavery, it could just as easily have been somewhere else; Los Angeles, where 24-year-old Ezell Ford, also black, was shot and killed by a police officer on Monday, or perhaps New York, where the death of Eric Garner while in custody, after an officer held him in an illegal chokehold last month, is still fuelling anger.

The grievances still felt by many African-Americans are rooted in the life experiences of many of them, particularly young men, which are also reflected in the sometimes shocking statistics. Statistics just from Ferguson are startling but by no means unique to the town, which, on the edge of downtown St Louis, became majority black after whites fled decades ago to escape rising violence and sinking schools.

Until last weekend, few beyond Ferguson will have known that only three of its 53 police officers are black, even if the community is overwhelmingly more black than white. Or that 483 blacks were arrested in town last year but only 36 whites. Or that blacks, who make up less than two thirds of the driving-age population, account for 86 per cent of all traffic stops by police.

Nationally, similar instances of unequal lives abound. Median income levels for African-Americans remain about two thirds of what they are for whites, and black unemployment is twice as high. These are disparities that are not always ignored, of course. Hence a current campaign to change sentencing rules for narcotics crimes and enable early release for drug offenders, to try to reduce madly elevated rates of incarceration for black males.

But progress can be offset by reverse steps. A campaign inside the white half of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, known as St George, to secede from the rest of the city has widely been condemned, for instance, as a barely disguised return to segregation, where whites will get the best schools and blacks will be left out. A Supreme Court ruling last year gutting the 1965 Voting Rights Act has also been deplored as a betrayal of the civil rights movement.",0,0,"It is still a deeply unequal society 50 years after the Civil Rights Act was passed - as the unrest seen in Ferguson, Missouri, this week shows",NA

The renewed violence began as a private autopsy report was released showing that Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager killed by a white police officer in the St Louis suburb last weekend, had been shot six times – twice in the head.

The fresh dissidence has led to Jay Nixon, the Governor of the state of Missouri, ordering the deployment of National Guard troops to “protect life and property”, he said in a statement this morning.

The military will, he says, will “maintain peace and order” by closing streets and thoroughfares, if it must, after the events that have unfolded have “continued to create conditions of distress and hazard to the safety, welfare and property of the citizens of the community beyond the capacities of local jurisdiction”.

In the midst of what appeared to be a peaceful protest last night, the St Louis County Police Department tweeted reports that Molotov cocktails were being thrown at officers, and that shots had been fired in the area. Police launched smoke canisters and tear gas into the crowds, which sent hundreds fleeing, with many reportedly covering their faces to escape the gas.

Earlier yesterday, it seemed tensions might finally have been quelled in Ferguson, where police and protesters have clashed almost nightly since Mr Brown’s death on 9 August. Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, the black officer who has become the public face of the law enforcement response, received a standing ovation when he addressed the Brown family and other community members on Sunday at the town’s Greater Grace Church.

Capt. Johnson reminded the crowd that he, too, was from Ferguson, and that he had much in common with many families there, including a son whom he said wears baggy trousers and sports tattoos. “We all ought to be thanking the Browns for Michael, because Michael's going to make it better for our sons, so they can be better black men,” he said.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon last week asked the Highway Patrol to take over responsibility for security in Ferguson, after four nights in which local police had met largely peaceful protests with riot gear, tear gas and rubber bullets. Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Mr Nixon said he had been “thunderstruck” by the police response. “The over-militarisation… The guns pointed at kids in the street. All of that I think instead of ratcheting down, brought emotion up,” he said.

Yet while the arrival of Capt. Johnson and his officers brought about a brief calm, by Friday night public anger flared again after police issued a statement saying Mr Brown had been a suspect in a robbery at a local convenience store. Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson later admitted that Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Mr Brown, was not aware he was a suspect at the time.
The authorities also released CCTV footage of the robbery, leading to accusations that they were trying to smear the victim. On Saturday Mr Nixon declared a state of emergency and ordered the nightly curfew from midnight to 5am; the Governor also criticised the release of the video, saying it “appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street.”

The details of Mr Brown’s shooting are still disputed: police said he reached for Wilson’s gun during an altercation inside a police car; witnesses insisted Mr Brown had his hands up when he was shot. A preliminary private autopsy was conducted on Sunday at the Brown family’s request by Dr Michael Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York.

Anthony Gray, a lawyer representing the family, said the trajectory of one of the two bullets that struck Mr Brown in the head was particularly noteworthy. “To have a shot that’s at a 90-degree angle from the top of his skull to the bottom of his chin, almost vertical, that sounds like an officer standing over him,” Gray said.

On Sunday US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department would also conduct its own autopsy on Mr Brown’s body due to “the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case”.

Ms Epstein was one of eight people arrested and charged with “failure to disperse” during a demonstration outside of the Wainwright building, where Governor Jay Nixon has an office. She is due to appear in court on 21 October.

Ms Epstein, a resident of St Louis, is a political activist and speaker widely known for her vocal support of the Free Gaza Movement. Pictures of her in handcuffs and flanked by police were widely shared across social media, sparking wide-spread outrage.

Ms Epstein said protesters were there demanding to speak with Governor Nixon during a demonstration calling for him to de-escalate his response to riots in Ferguson, which has seen the area placed under a state of emergency and the National Guard deployed.

After refusing to move away from the door, Ms Epstein said St Louis police “arrested us without further ado, handcuffed us, put us in paddy wagons to the station, booked us, released us, and charged us and gave us a court date.”

The increasing militarisation and the presence of the National Guard has seen tensions between protesters and authorities flare in Ferguson, leading President Obama to warn: ""There is no excuse for excessive force by police.""

Ms Epstein told The Independent that one of the main issues involved it the riots is the police in Ferguson, who have used tear gas and rubber bullets during the unrest.

""From the beginning, they were inciting the demonstrators who were demonstrating peacefully to become violent so that the police can become more violent in return,"" she said.

“The police and the guards need to be pulled out and they need to leave it to the people there to sort out. As long as you have riot police and riot gear and military equipment and lethal weapons - that is not going to lead to peace.

""It has to stop, because more lives are going to be lost, more people will be injured and more property will be damaged. It accomplishes nothing""

Anger rose again this week after an independent pathologist hired by the Brown family determined the teenager had been shot six times, including twice to the head. The family’s lawyer, Daryl Parks, suggested that the 18-year-old was killed at the moment he was already in a position of surrendering before the police officer.

“Michael Brown was walking down the street with his friend and police said get off the street and get onto the sidewalk,” said Ms Epstein. “They said they would continue walking and then that’s when the violence started.

“You don’t have to shoot to kill because someone was walking down the street. The officer didn’t know that Michael Brown was a suspect in an alleged robbery, he was merely shot because he was not obeying and walking on the sidewalk.”

Mr Brown was shot and fatally wounded on 9 August by police officer Darren Wilson, who is currently suspended with full pay. His death has heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department.

Ms Epstein added: “There are certain stereotypes with male African Americans walking down the street, who immediately become a suspect just by walking. When I walk down with my white skin I am privileged and no one questions me.

“I hope there will be change, change not only in Ferguson because what is happening there is happening all over the country – racism is alive and well and I think we need as a nation to look at ourselves and we need to change our ways. Violence only begets violence.

A student with a football tackle build. Just one of the 100 or so in his senior class at Normandy High, a struggling school that had lost its state accreditation and, along with it, a measure of its pride, in an area already beset by challenges.

In his photo, Brown barely smiled, his green mortarboard tilted back on his large head, a red sash around his shoulders – a slight bravado that, his teacher noted, might have obscured how difficult reaching this moment had been.

Michael Brown officially graduated on 1 August, later than some and months after the photo was taken. He still had credits to earn then. He was in an alternative learning programme, a way to help the students facing the longest academic odds.

But he got his diploma. And 10 days after that, he was to start at a local technical school to learn how to fix furnaces and air conditioners.

“He’d accomplished it,” teacher John Kennedy said. “In the last two months, Mike was there every doggone day and giving it his full effort.” “He was a gentle giant,” said Charles Ewing, Brown’s uncle.

Last Saturday, as Brown walked down a street with a friend, the 18-year-old was fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, a working-class suburb north of St Louis. Brown was unarmed.

What happened during the unidentified police officer’s a confrontation with Brown and his friend remains unclear.

County police and the FBI have announced separate investigations. But doubts in the local community about whether the shooting was justified quickly boiled over, leading to days of rallies and unrest, including angry confrontations between protesters and police, nighttime scenes made hazy by tear gas and shouted slogans.

Now Brown is part of a renewed national discussion about how police treat minorities, especially young black men.

President Obama on Tuesday offered his “deepest condolences” to Brown’s family, who is now represented by the same attorney used by the family of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager gunned down by a Neighbourhood Watch volunteer in 2012.

The Rev Al Sharpton came to St Louis; social media and talk shows swirled with anger aimed at both Brown’s death and the violent demonstrations that followed.

On Tuesday night, the authorities in Ferguson braced themselves for another round of violence. Flights were banned from operating below 3,000 feet over the city, at the request of county police. A police spokesman said a helicopter had been shot at multiple times and that the flight ban is “to provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities”. The ban may also preclude the hovering of news helicopters.

The official police investigation, a standard reaction to any officer-involved shooting, was moving slowly, said Brian Schellman, a county police spokesman. Three days after the incident, detectives still had not talked with many “critical witnesses”.

“They’ve reached out to numerous people who have been unwilling or unable to talk with them,” Mr Schellman said.

Police detectives have tried “numerous times” to talk with Dorian Johnson, Brown’s friend who was with him when the shooting occurred and who, since then, has given several press interviews.

While Ferguson police have said Brown pushed the officer as the patrolman was trying to exit his car and then struggled with him over his gun, Johnson has said the officer was the aggressor. The officer, according to Johnson, shot Brown while still inside the vehicle, then emerged and fired multiple times.

“We want to talk to him,” Mr Schellman said. “We have to talk to him.”

Ferguson police had planned to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, but they reversed this decision on Tuesday as “threats [were] being made against all Ferguson officers on social media sites”, the city’s police spokesman, Timothy Zoll, said in an email. There is no timetable for when the officer’s name could be released, he said.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Michael Brown’s family, said releasing the officer’s name could help ensure peace on the streets of Ferguson.

In Ferguson, residents with signs gathered at the site of the shooting in the early afternoon, prompting honking horns and cheers of “hands up, don’t shoot”.

In nearby Clayton, several hundred people marched downtown and descended on the county prosecutor’s office. “I need justice for my son,” Michael Brown Sr said to the press on Tuesday.

The town where Brown died has 21,000 residents. The poverty rate is about twice Missouri’s average. There are challenges. But it is also home to the world headquarters of Emerson Electronics, a $24bn company, and Express Scripts, which employs thousands in the St Louis area.

Black residents make up about two-thirds of Ferguson’s population. In the 2000 census, whites held a slim majority. Meanwhile, the city’s police force remains overwhelmingly white.",0,150,"The gentle giant was walking down a street as a white officer fired from a police car, says his friend",NA

Pictures of heavily armed police advancing on unarmed demonstrators, officers dismounting from armoured vehicles and residents fleeing tear gas have been seen around the world.

This military-grade equipment was not made available to the Ferguson police department at the start of the unrest following 18-year-old Michael Brown's death on Saturday, however, it was in fact gathering dust at St Louis county HQ.

Officers in the town are just one of hundreds of law enforcement agencies to have taken advantage of a federal programme called 1033, which stems from a 1990 law (the National Defence Authorisation Act) passed by Congress to help law enforcement agencies combat drug-related activities.

It is now mainly used by the Department of Defence to pass on surplus military equipment, and in total $4.3billion worth of arms and vehicles have been acquired by 8,000 police forces and other departments in the US, including $449million in 2013 alone.

The {Defence Logistics Agency}<hyperlink=”http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/default.aspx”> is responsible for these ""disposition services"" but does not reveal precisely which forces have acquired what equipment.

But, for example, Fairmont police department, which serves a population of 7,000 in northern Georgia, has bought - at a greatly reduced rate - 17,145 items from the Pentagon, while 50 officers in Oxford, Alabama, have $3million worth of military equipment at their disposal, including M-16s and an armoured vehicle.

The state patrol in landlocked Nebraska meanwhile has three amphibious eight-wheeled tanks.

The gradual militarisation of police in the US is something to be extremely concerned about, claims Radley Balko, Washington Post reporter and author of Rise of the Warrior Cop.

""It is a mentality that sees the people they are supposed to be serving not as citizens with rights but as potential threats,"" he told NBC News.

""If you look at the racial makeup of Ferguson, Missouri, it is about 67 per cent black. 52 of the 55 police officers at the Ferguson police department are white.""

Dorian Johnson, 22, who was with Brown at the time of his death, said the pair had been walking in the middle of the street when a police officer in a car reportedly told them to “get the f**k on the sidewalk”. 

A struggle near the officer’s car followed, with Johnson reporting that Brown was shot at close range. “The whole time [the officer] was holding my friend until the gun went off,” Johnson told {MSNBC}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”>.

Johnson and Brown started running away when Brown was shot a second time in the back. Following this Johnson says Brown turned around with his hands up and said “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!” after which the office reportedly shot him several more times.

This version of events has been corroborated by several other eyewitness accounts, although police from Ferguson - the working class, mostly black St. Louis suburb where the incident took place – maintain that Brown was killed following a struggle for the officer’s gun.

The police have also confirmed that Brown was shot multiple times, with St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar reporting that the teenager, who was in the area visiting his grandmother, was hit “more than just a couple but I don’t think it was many more than that.”

The identity of the officer involved has not been revealed and is currently on paid leave for the investigation into Brown’s death.

In the cases of Rodney and Duggan the police officers in question incorrectly thought that the suspects were going for their guns. The officer who shot Michael Brown claims he thought that Brown was attempting to grab his firearm.  Zimmerman knew that Martin didn’t have a gun.  He just feared he was going to beat him up.

But what is common throughout all of these cases is that the officers all felt they used justifiable force because either their own lives or those of the public were in danger, even though it later transpired that the Black suspects were unarmed.

Usually when these stories come out, the Police issue a statement saying that the deceased had been previously {suspended from school for smoking weed}<hyperlink=”http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trayvon-martin-update-school-marijuana-suspension-no-criminal-record/”>, or was a {member of a notorious gang}<hyperlink=”http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-25363828”>, or had been {resisting arrest}<hyperlink=”http://www.examiner.com/article/putting-the-shooting-of-oscar-grant-into-perspective”>, or exchanged fire with officers. Quite often, as the details of the case reveal themselves, and the families of the victims campaign for justice, some of these ""facts"" seem more like part of a larger smear campaign to justify the Police's actions.

But whether the suspects are criminals or not, is not the point.  The important fact here is that unarmed men are being executed in the streets, by those entrusted to enforce the law.

Why is this happening? I don’t think it is simply a case that all of these white officers are racist and want to put as many Black men in the ground as possible. They may have genuinely felt that that the suspects were a deadly threat.  But that has less to do with the individual circumstances, and more to do with their own preconceptions.

All too often, what these cops are reacting to is not the black man they see in front of them, but rather the stereotypical image of Black men that they carry in their heads.  An image formed from an amalgam of vicious heavyweight boxer and convicted rapist Mike Tyson, gangster rapper and self-confessed former drug dealer 50 Cent, and photo-fit pictures of various Black muggers and rapists that used to regularly feature in tabloid newspapers not so long ago.  In other words, the Bogey Man. 

Hence the heavy handed, militarised response of the Ferguson police, to the public demonstrations that followed Brown’s death. The (majority white) local police saw this, not as (majority African-American)  local residents exercising their democratic right to protest, but as marauding Blacks on the rampage, that needed to be pacified with tear gas and rubber bullets.
 
If you came face to face with the bogey man, of course you’d be scared. If you had a gun, naturally you’d reach for it.  And it’s only after the ambulance has taken the body away, and the mother has given a tearful interview to the news cameras, that it’s revealed that the suspect did not in fact have a gun on him.  And what you thought was a hardened killer about to embark on another murderous rampage, was in fact just an innocent college kid on his way back partying with his friends, or from visiting the corner store for a pack of Skittles.

When split second decisions need to be made in unfamiliar situations, you fall back on preconceptions – on stereotypes. We all do it.  We all judge books by their covers.  But when armed police officers fall into this cognitive trap, Black men often end up dead.",0,195,"The police who shoot unarmed black men might genuinely feel threatened, but that's down to their own preconceptions",NA

But the broader lessons of the incident, which has sparked three nights of rioting and disorder, are not. The residual poison of racial segregation and discrimination has still not been purged from American society.

Only three decades ago, Ferguson, the suburb in question, was overwhelmingly white in population. Today, black people outnumber white people by almost three to one. Yet the local political and law-enforcement structure remains dominated by whites, to the point that of the suburb’s 53 police officers, only three are black. Stir in the habit of police (not only in Ferguson but in towns and cities across the US) to stop and arrest black citizens disproportionately, and throw in the pent-up resentment in the black community at this practice, and the events in Ferguson were an explosion waiting to happen.

Sadly, moreover, they are all too familiar. The arrest and beating of the black construction worker Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers in 1991 led ultimately to the California city’s worst riots in half a century. Over the years, similar incidents have generated racial tension and anger, most recently the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, by a neighbourhood-watch guard at a gated community in Florida. The name of Michael Brown must now be added to this list.

Indubitably – and as the election of a black president testifies – the US has made great strides in the past half-century towards achieving racial equality. Less so, however, in the field of policing. The looting and vandalism that occurred in Ferguson are plainly wrong. But as Martin Luther King also observed, “a riot is the language of the unheard”.",0,17,NA,Author just listed as editorial

In the letter, published in {Time}<hyperlink=”http://time.com/3136685/travyon-sybrina-fulton-ferguson/”>, Sybrina Fulton offers to “share my continuing journey as you begin yours” and expresses her “hate” for the fact that Brown’s relatives “must join this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence”.

Ms Fulton writes: “I wish I had a word of automatic comfort but I don’t. I wish I could say that it will be alright on a certain or specific day but I can’t. I wish that all of the pain that I have endured could possibly ease some of yours but it won’t.”

Police and protesters have clashed almost nightly in the US city since the black teenager was shot by police officer Darren Wilson, 26, on 9 August. The shooting heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department.

Civil rights activists have compared the shooting to other racially charged cases, particularly the death of Martin - the unarmed black teenager was shot by neighbourhood watch organizer George Zimmerman, who was later acquitted of murder.

In her letter Ms Fulton focuses on all young victims of gun violence and emphasises the need to seek justice “regardless of race, ethnicity or gender”.
She writes: “Our children are our future so whenever any of our children – black, white, brown, yellow, or red – are taken from us unnecessarily, it causes a never-ending pain that is unlike anything I could have imagined experiencing.

 “Further complicating the pain and loss in this tragedy is the fact that the killer of your son is alive, known, and currently free. In fact, he is on paid administrative leave.”

Ms Fulton adds in her letter: “I will support you and your efforts to seek justice for your Michael and the countless other Michaels & Trayvons of our country. The 20 Sandy Hook children. Jordan Davis. Oscar Grant. Kendrick Johnson. Sean Bell. Hadya Pendleton. The Aurora shooting victims.

Demonstrations have blown up each night nearby. But inside there’s WiFi and outlets, so it’s common for reporters to gather there.

That was the case Wednesday. My phone was just about to die, so as I charged it, I used the time to respond to people on Twitter and do a little bit of a Q&A since I wasn’t out there covering the protests.

As I sat there, many armed officers came in — some who were dressed as normal officers, others who were dressed with more gear.

Initially, both Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post and I were asked for identification. I was wearing my lanyard, but Ryan asked why he had to show his ID. They didn’t press the point, but one added that if we called 911, no one would answer.

Then they walked away. Moments later, the police reemerged, telling us that we had to leave. I pulled my phone out and began recording video.An officer with a large weapon came up to me and said, “Stop recording.”

I said, “Officer, do I not have the right to record you?”

He backed off but told me to hurry up. So I gathered my notebook and pens with one hand while recording him with the other hand.

As I exited, I saw Ryan to my left, having a similar argument with two officers. I recorded him, too, and that angered the officer. As I made my way toward the door, the officers gave me conflicting information.

One instructed me to exit to my left. As I turned left, another officer emerged, blocking my path.

“Go another way,” he said.

As I turned, my backpack, which was slung over one shoulder, began to slip. I said, “Officers, let me just gather my bag.” As I did, one of them said, “Okay, let’s take him.”

Multiple officers grabbed me. I tried to turn my back to them to assist them in arresting me. I dropped the things from my hands.

“My hands are behind my back,” I said. “I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting.” At which point one officer said: “You’re resisting. Stop resisting.”

That was when I was most afraid — more afraid than of the tear gas and rubber bullets.

As they took me into custody, the officers slammed me into a soda machine, at one point setting off the Coke dispenser. They put plastic cuffs on me, then they led me out the door.

I could see Ryan still talking to an officer. I said: “Ryan, tweet that they’re arresting me, tweet that they’re arresting me.”

He didn’t have an opportunity, because he was arrested as well.

The officers led us outside to a police van. Inside, there was a large man sitting on the floor between the two benches. He began screaming: “I can’t breathe! Call a paramedic! Call a paramedic!”

Ryan and I asked the officers if they intended to help the man. They said he was fine. The screaming went on for the 10 to 15 minutes we stood outside the van.

“I’m going to die!” he screamed. “I’m going to die! I can’t breathe! I’m going to die!”

Eventually a police car arrived. A woman — with a collar identifying her as a member of the clergy — sat in the back. Ryan and I crammed in next to her, and we took the three-minute ride to the Ferguson Police Department. The woman sang hymns throughout the ride.

During this time, we asked the officers for badge numbers. We asked to speak to a supervising officer. We asked why we were being detained. We were told: trespassing in a McDonald’s.

“I hope you’re happy with yourself,” one officer told me. And I responded: “This story’s going to get out there. It’s going to be on the front page of The Washington Post tomorrow.”

And he said, “Yeah, well, you’re going to be in my jail cell tonight.”

Once at the station, we were processed, our pockets emptied. No mug shots. They removed our restraints and put us in a holding cell. Ryan was able to get ahold of his dad. I called my mom, but I couldn’t get through. I couldn’t remember any phone numbers.

We were in there for what felt like 10 or 15 minutes. Then the processing officer came in.

“Who’s media?” he asked.

We said we were. And the officer said we were both free to go. We asked to speak to a commanding officer. We asked to see an arrest report. No report, the officer told us, and no, they wouldn’t provide any names.

I asked if there would ever be a report. He came back with a case number and said a report would be available in a week or two.

“The chief thought he was doing you two a favor,” he said.

The killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by 28-year-old Darren Wilson has sparked volatile demonstrations in the town of Ferguson, Missouri, and heightened tensions between the city’s majority black community and its majority white police force.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

On Sunday afternoon, a group of around 100 counter-protesters, all but one of whom were white, picketed against what they regarded as biased reporting of Brow's death. They gathered outside the local KSDK-TV station in St Louis, which had broadcast images of Wilson’s home. 

The station later removed the footage from its website and apologised “to our audience, to the surrounding neighborhoods, to the greater St Louis community and to the officer for our mistake”, the Guardian reported.

The protests was organised via a pro-Wilson Facebook page which was established on Saturday and had garnered over 25,000 ‘likes’ by Monday evening (GMT).

Tweets from the scene show t-shirts featuring a police officer badge embossed with the slogan: “Officer Darren Wilson I stand by you” alongside the date the teenager died. Selling for $7 each, the 55 t-shirts quickly sold out, according to the Huffington Post.

The protesters also passed around a card, in which they wrote messages of support for the officer.

“He was doing his job,” said Kaycee Reinisch, 57, of Lincoln County, Missouri told the Guardian on Sunday.

“And now because of public uproar in Ferguson, he is being victimised. He is being victimised by the whole city, the state and the federal government.” Reinisch said she had relations in law enforcement who would be “frightened to do their jobs” if Wilson were punished for the incident.

Michael Brown, 18, was shot yesterday afternoon as he neared the home of his grandmother, Desiree Harris, in the town of Ferguson.

Angry residents convened into the night, shouting “kill the police” and at the height of tension police backup from 60 other units were called. Shots were also heard.

In a press conference today, St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said that the shooting of Brown followed an altercation with police, including the struggle for a gun.

The constable in question had had an encounter with two people, he said, one of whom allegedly assaulted and pushed the unnamed officer back into the patrol car.

There was then a tussle for the police weapon, with one shot fired in the car, before the officer exited the vehicle and shot at “a subject”. The officer has been put on paid administrative leave.

Eyewitness Piaget Crenshaw said that Brown was running away from police with his hands held in the air when he was shot multiple times, according to New York Magazine.

The residents of Ferguson, which is roughly 10 miles north-east of St Louis, are predominately black, and the local chapter of a civil rights group has called on the FBI to investigate the incident.

John Gaskin, a member of the St Louis County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) said: “With the recent events of a young man killed by the {police in New York City}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/nyregion/staten-island-man-dies-after-he-is-put-in-chokehold-during-arrest.html”> and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization.”

He said that stronger powers should get involved “to protect the integrity of the investigation.”

A memorial has since been set up in the middle of the road, where the teenager - who was black - died, while Ms Harris said that her grandson “never even got into a fight”.

Around 100 protesters took to the streets, with some chanting “No Justice!

Around 250 demonstrators were stopped by police from entering the road where Mr Brown had been on the way to visit his grandmother in the suburb of Ferguson.

A wall of armed police formed a barricade across Florrisant Street, where protests had flared up the previous nights, leading to looting and vandalism by small groups on Sunday.

Officers ordered protesters to “get out of the road or face arrest” before firing teargas, rubber bullets and baton rounds into the crowd.

Photos showed SWAT teams in military-style uniforms pointing guns at protesters and some individuals were seen hurling missiles and teargas cannisters back at the police line.

Some raised their arms above their heads and repeated what has become a defining slogan: ""Hands up, don't shoot.""

As the crowds were dispersed shortly after midnight, another man was shot close to the scene of Mr Brown’s death.

Police said teams had been responding to reports of shots being fired and men armed with guns wearing ski masks.

He was shot while allegedly pointing a handgun at an officer, police said, and was in a critical condition in hospital.

President Obama promised a full investigation by the US Department of Justice into Mr Brown's death and the FBI has also stepped in.

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions,"" he said.

""I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.""

Friends and family of Brown held a peaceful church vigil on Tuesday night, after his father pleaded for an end to the violence. Standing with supporters, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, Michael Brown Sr. said he wanted justice for his son but wanted it ""the right way.""

""I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,"" he said, wearing a T-shirt showing his son's baby picture. ""No violence.""

At another church gathering with dozens of clergy members and officials, the Governor of Missouri Jay Nixon urged calm “in the face of crisis"".

“We stand together tonight, reeling from what feels like an old wound torn open afresh,” he said.

“A wound that hadn't quite healed right in the first place, and now the pain is just as searing as when the injury first occurred.”

Eyewitness accounts have contradicted the police department's account of events, which said Mr Brown was shot after a struggle for an officer's gun.

Dorian Johnson, 22, said he had been walking with his friend in the middle of the street when a police officer in a car reportedly told them to “get the f*** on the sidewalk”.

A struggle near the officer’s car followed, with Mr Johnson reporting that Mr Brown was shot at close range.

After being shot in the back as he tried to run away, he said his friend turned around with his hands up and said “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!” but the officer reportedly shot him several more times.

Mr Johnson's version of events has been corroborated by several other eyewitness accounts, although police from Ferguson maintain that the teenager was killed following a struggle for the officer’s gun.

There is no security or police video footage of the incident, according to police.

Mr Brown's death has exposed deep racial and economic fault lines in the community.

Out of 53 officers in the Ferguson - a working class, mostly black suburb - only three are black and officials said the city has had trouble recruiting and retaining black officers.

The identity of the officer involved, who witnesses said was white, has not been revealed and is currently on paid leave for the investigation.

Offering his condolences to the family of 18-year-old Michael Brown, the US President nonetheless called for calm after two nights of violent protests, looting, injuries and arrests across the Ferguson suburb of St Louis where the incident took place.

The police in St Louis County say that Mr Brown was shot during a struggle inside a police car, but they have not said why he was initially detained and have gone back on an agreement to name the officer involved.

Their official account contrasts sharply with that of one witness interviewed on local media who said that the teenager had been putting his hands up to surrender when he was killed.

 “I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,” Mr Obama said in a statement.

“We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds,” he said. “Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.”

  

Several hundred protesters appeared to heed the calls for non-violence late on Tuesday evening, chanting “hands up, don't shoot” and “no justice, no peace” during a tense stand-off with riot police supported by armoured vehicles near the site of Mr Brown's death.

Speaking at a church vigil alongside the civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton, the teenager’s father Michael Brown Sr said he wanted “no violence”, adding: “I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way.”

Activists repeated their demands for authorities to make public the name of the officer involved. The police had said they would release the officer's name on Tuesday, but according to local media reports changed their minds over fears of retaliation.",0,0,"A no-fly zone has been put in place over Ferguson, Missouri, as police helicopters try to control protest",NA

Michael Brown, 18, died after being hit multiple times in the suburb of Ferguson in St Louis on Saturday on the way to his grandmother’s house, provoking angry confrontations between officers and members of the community.

Police said Mr Brown and another man were involved in a scuffle with an officer, who shot the teenager after an alleged struggle for a gun.

It was not clear if the teenager was the man who struggled with the officer but police confirmed he was unarmed.

Around around 100 protesters took to the streets on Sunday, with some chanting “No Justice! No Peace!”, while others held up their hands saying “Don’t shoot me!” as armed officers looked on.

Later in the day, thousands packed the suburb in St Louis where he died in a vigil.

Small groups were seen afterwards looting a supermarket, breaking into shops along a main road near the shooting, smashing car windows and carrying away armfuls of stolen goods.

Television footage showed streams of people walking out of an off-licence carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters were standing on police cars or taunting officers standing around in riot gear.

The killing drew criticism from civil rights leaders, who compared it to the 2012 shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighbourhood watch member, who was acquitted of murder charges.

George Zimmerman had followed Mr Martin without orders and said he shot the teenager, who was black, in “self-defence”, despite him being unarmed.

John Gaskin, from the St Louis branch of American civil rights group NAACP, said: “We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement.”

James Knowles, the mayor of Ferguson, said a small group of people were creating a “huge mess” on Sunday.

“Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help,” he told KTVI-TV.

“We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbours. There's nothing productive from this.

“We understand people want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out.

“We're going to obviously try to urge calm.”

There were no reports of injuries by Monday morning but authorities had been alerted to “widespread” property damage.

The second person involved in the confrontation where Mr Brown was killed has not been arrested or charged.

Tom Jackson, the chief of Ferguson Police Chief, told KSDK-TV there was no apparent video footage of the shooting from a nearby apartment complex, from any police dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department has purchased but not put into use.

Mr Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said he had graduated from school and was about to enter a local university.

She said she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue her son with a baton or taser, and she said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

“I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,” she said, fighting back tears.

The race of the officer involved in the shooting has not been disclosed but authorities said he had been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years and has been placed on paid administrative leave.

Independent,indep42,http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/will-the-wound-of-racism-ever-heal-in-america-9672634.html,Will the wound of racism ever heal in America?,Bonnie Greer,08/15/2014,03/23/2016,"The fatal shooting of a black teenager by the police is an old tale, archetypal in its power to tap into a trauma never far beneath the surface of black American life.

The latest version of this old wound opened up at {high noon last Saturday in Ferguson}<hyperlink=”http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/this-is-why-people-are-angry-in-ferguson-missouri-after-michael-brown-shooting-9669203.html”>, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. While most of St Louis County is white, Ferguson, a town of 21,000, is predominantly black (“relatively stable, working – a middle-income community,” according to crimes and trends expert Richard Rosenfeld, a professor at the University of Missouri-St Louis).

Black people were once a minority there but the demographics have shifted in the past decade as white families moved further away – “white flight”. Ferguson’s leadership and police have remained predominantly white. Out of 53 police officers, three are black. And while blacks make up 63 per cent of the city’s population, they account for 86 per cent of traffic stops.

The details of Michael Brown’s death are in dispute. Witnesses say that he and a friend were walking home when they were stopped by a police officer for walking in the middle of the street; that the teenager’s hands were in the air when the last of several shots were fired. The police say he was shot during a fight over the officer’s gun. The following day, the St Louis County Police said Michael was unarmed but that he physically assaulted one of the police and during the struggle the teenager reached for the officer’s gun.

And so the archetype, the old tale, plays out. Michael’s parents demand justice; a candlelit vigil erupts into violence; the FBI opens a civil rights inquiry into the shooting; St Louis County Police begins an investigation; the President calls for calm; a moment of silence is held all over America with (predominately young) people, transcending race and class, city and suburb, all in this moment standing in silence with their hands up behind signs that read: “Hands Up! Don’t Shoot!”

And there is the oldest, most poignant part of this tale: a black mother, this time Michael Brown’s mother, recounting her version of “black male life is cheap”. She said to the local TV station KMOV: “Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many. Because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they don’t got nothing to live for anyway. They say: ‘They’re going to try to take me out anyway’.”

Black men and brown men are criminalised in America from the moment they come into contact with the powers-that-be, whether they are schools, work, or other institutions. It doesn’t matter. The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has said that black and Latino students in general are more likely to have less experienced and lower-paid teachers, and are more likely to be suspended from school .

Black boys and Latino boys are more likely to be accused of “attitude”. This bleeds into the criminal justice system. This “burden of bias” is borne by the victim, not the perpetrator. Mothers and fathers often ask how is it possible to tell a boy to do right when there is little or no reward from the “system” and the nation that he’s a part of. And if you think that’s an overstatement, all a black boy has to do to see what might await him is look at the treatment meted out to the President of the United States .

Barack Hussein Obama was elected President twice by the people of the United States, in democratic and free elections. But there is one media outlet, one television channel which could lead you to believe that there is something wrong, something illegitimate about the man, and by extension the electorate that brought him to high office.

I’m talking about Fox News, whose campaign of hatred and vitriol began when it appeared that Mr Obama might actually become President of the United States, after his defeat of Hillary Clinton in the primaries in the summer of 2008. I watched it happen.

I stumbled on Fox News one summer in 2007 while I was setting up a new television set. At first I thought it was a spoof, a kind of Saturday Night Live during the day. There was a woman calling people on the left “retards”, as an animation of an American flag waved gently in the breeze on the lower right of the screen. As I watched closely, I realised – like Mia Farrow’s character in Rosemary’s Baby as she was being assaulted by the devil – “This is no dream! This is really happening!”

Up until the end of the President’s campaign for re-election in 2012, I watched Fox News every day, and most of its programming. I witnessed Glenn Beck’s first broadcast, and watched as the self-proclaimed “rodeo cowboy” became the rallying point for some deeply disturbing theories about the President.

The mild end of his following formed into what became the Tea Party. The wilder shores of his audience consisted of “Illuminati” conspiracy theorists, and further out than that, people who would not have been given air-time anywhere else on the planet – people who created a growing sense that the President was an “Other”; a Muslim “Manchurian Candidate” nurturing an Islamic cell right inside the White House. He was commander-in-chief of a Muslim Third Column and, by the way, he was actually born in Kenya.

Beck didn’t expostulate these things himself, but his show became an Agora for those who did. As the Obama presidency proceeded, Fox News became more comment than news. And why not? Comment is its bread and butter, its reason for existing. In the beginning, the First Lady was attacked for saying – somewhere – that white people were “downright mean”. They played that tape over and over until it dawned on them that Michelle Obama was actually quite popular.

You would have thought the killing of Osama bin Laden, America’s Public Enemy No 1, would have been given some sort of kudos from Fox. But instead, it accused the President of taking the glory away from the Seals who did the actual deed; an absurd comment to make but one that found traction with viewers.

Fox is reporting on the Michael Brown shooting, making sure that “unarmed” is on the screen whenever his name appears. But what you get in the background on continuous loop is the night the town erupted; shots of a group of largely pompous prats calling themselves the New Black Panther Party; and black folks who can assure one and all that “guns are not the problem” in relation to the growing militarisation of the police in America.

Fox News as a business isn’t about hate. It’s about money – revenue – and there’s plenty of that among its disgruntled, angry, frightened and, in some cases, very hateful audience – over-65, mainly white – who have made Fox News No 1 on cable.

Fox News is cheap to have, easy to access, and full of people like Karl Rove who, in the guise of being an “expert” (you can still find his meltdown live on TV, the night of the President’s election, on YouTube) uphold their prejudices and help the “Stop The World I Want To Get Off” generation sleep at night.

Fox News is also the go-to-station for those who see black people, Muslims, Latinos, anybody who’s not them, as the Other, the Alien Force. Only on Fox will you see time given to people who espouse views close to what is called Christian Zionism. In the guise of talking about the crisis in the Middle East, what they are actually campaigning for is the End Time, Armageddon, the Second Coming – all neatly disguised as “Comment”.

And so the ground is laid; the template set, a picture drawn of an America out of control and black people – non-white people – in general as part of the problem. If the police of Ferguson are Fox News watchers, they’d see the world around them, the growing black population, as something that needed to be controlled, contained, culled.

I worry now for my elderly uncle, my brother, my brothers-in-law, my nephews; my great-nephews. I worry for my friends. I worry about the President of the United States, rapidly ageing before our eyes. Who knows what mail he receives, what threats?

Fox News is not the fount of all evil, but it looks the other way as America’s darkness emerges. It gives that darkness succour and space. It makes the unsayable and the unspeakable – unsayable and unspeakable for the sake of sheer civility– legitimate.

It turns the First Amendment into a loaded gun, something to blow away those it does not like, those it does not want to be accepted. It is helping a great nation – a nation with the highest of aims – turn itself into a cauldron, an abyss. It has made that night in November 2008, when a young black man and his family stood on a platform and thanked the nation for the “American Dream”, into a kind of lie.

No, Fox News hasn’t created all of this. But it’s there at the feast. As the US rages, clawing at its own flesh. You can catch it all – “fair and balanced”, of course – on Fox News, broadcasting in any bus station you care to choose, on your way to that Promised Land. Free of “Them”.",0,139,Black and brown men are criminalised in America from the moment they come into contact with the powers-that-be,NA
