{President Obama}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2011/11/21/barack-obama-1991-television-commercial-surfaces/""> held a news conference Thursday afternoon calling  for all to take a step back and to  take a look at what it would take to move forward. The President says the Department of Justice and the FBI are independently investigating the death of Michael Brown. Mr. Obama said he has spoken with Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to express concern about the violence, saying the Governor is a good man. “There is never an excuse for violence or to use the death of Mr. Brown as a cover for vandalism or looting nor should the police mistreat citizens or bully and arrest journalists who are doing their jobs.” He added, “Now is the time for healing, hope and calm.”

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who has been the public face of the city torn by Saturday’s death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, told reporters that he understands what it looks like in Ferguson, and it is “not good.” He says there are meetings to evaluate tactics and wants protestors to stop the violence. He says the healing will be a long process and asks everyone to “tone it down.” Regarding the high level of conflict, Chief Jackson said he was satisfied that nobody has gotten hurt or killed in the climate of chaos that exists. He says police will facilitate Thursday night protests and asks that the demonstrators realize that the police will be exercising calm.

Two-thirds of the 21,000 residents of Ferguson are black, while all but three of the police force’s 53 officers are white.

Al Sharpton spoke this morning by phone to St. Louis County Police Chief John Belmar. After a candid exchange, Sharpton has called on the Department of Justice and others to monitor what is going on in Ferguson, Missouri, on the ground after a night where police arrested reporters and others and tear-gassed people protesting. Sharpton further announced that representatives of National Action Network (NAN) that have been on the ground since the weekend and local leaders that live there will be in a 10am meeting this morning with local police on this matter.

Senate leader Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement regarding the events  in Ferguson, Missouri: “It is hard to think that the scenes unfolding in Ferguson are taking place in an American city in the year 2014. The nation’s eyes are on the city of Ferguson, and we will be watching closely. The public deserves a full disclosure of the facts surrounding the heartbreaking death of Michael Brown and the events that followed. Every community in America deserves equal justice and equal protection under the law.”

Attorney Malik Shabazz, speaking on behalf of the Washington D.C.-based Black Lawyers For Justice! says, “We are representing the injured and arrested demonstrators involved in the Michael Brown case and assembling a class action lawsuit against the Ferguson Police Department and the City of Ferguson Missouri. People who were demonstrating peacefully have been tear-gassed, assaulted, humiliated and ran off the street, and they were given no warning to disperse, and they were attacked.”

Louis City Alderman Antonio French, who has been among the citizen journalists documenting the aftermath, had been arrested, according to NBC affiliate KSDK. French’s prolific social media use has been credited with helping keep the spotlight on Ferguson and the Michael Brown story.

On Wednesday night, Gov. Jay Nixon tonight issued the following statement on events in Ferguson, Missouri:

“The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans. While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern. I have been closely monitoring the situation and will continue to be in communication with local leaders, and I will be in north St. Louis County tomorrow. As Governor, I am committed to ensuring the pain of last weekend’s tragedy does not continue to be compounded by this ongoing crisis. Once again, I ask that members of the community demonstrate patience and calm while the investigation continues, and I urge law enforcement agencies to keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press during this difficult time.”

On Wednesday night, two reporters working for the Huffington Post and Washington Post were reportedly assaulted and arrested by police. Here is HuffPo’s statement on the matter: “We are relieved Ryan Reilly and Wesley Lowery are safe, but we are disturbed by their arrest and assault.”

Ryan was working on his laptop in a McDonald’s near the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, when police barged in, armed with high-powered weapons, and began clearing the restaurant. Ryan photographed the intrusion, and police demanded his ID in response. Ryan, as is his right, declined to provide it. He proceeded to pack up his belongings but was subsequently arrested for not packing up fast enough. Both Ryan and Wesley were assaulted.

Compared to some others who have come into contact with the police department, they came out relatively unscathed, but that in no way excuses the false arrest or the militant aggression toward these journalists. Ryan, who has reported multiple times from Guantanamo Bay, said that the police resembled soldiers more than officers and treated those inside the McDonald’s as “enemy combatants.” “Police militarization has been among the most consequential and unnoticed developments of our time, and it is now beginning to affect press freedom.”",13,60,NA,NA
Grio,grio2,http://thegrio.com/2014/08/16/news-alert-state-of-emergency-curfew-declared-for-ferguson-mo/,"One shot seven arrested overnight in Ferguson, MO",NBC News; The Associated Press,08/16/2014,09/22/2016,"Gunshots and tear gas were fired overnight in the St. Louis suburb gripped by protests over the death of an unarmed black teen, officials said. Violence broke out after about 200 people defied a midnight curfew for the town of Ferguson, Missouri.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson said one person was shot and is in critical condition at the hospital. Seven people have been arrested, Johnson said.

Tear gas and tactical units were deployed — despite earlier pledges to shift from a militarized response to the protests. Johnson defended the move, saying authorities feared for officers’ safety and that a police car was shot at. “Tonight’s response was a proper one,” he said, adding that he was “disappointed” that violence broke out on the city’s streets (NBC News).

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency Saturday and imposed a curfew in the St. Louis suburb where a black teenager was shot to death by a white police officer a week ago.

Nixon said that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow a handful of looters to endanger the community. The curfew will run from midnight to 5 a.m.

“We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching,” Nixon said. “We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.”

Tensions in Ferguson flared late Friday after police released the name of the officer who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown and documents alleging Brown robbed a store before he died.

Nixon also said the U.S. Department of Justice is beefing up its investigation of the {shooting}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2013/09/17/african-american-mass-shooters/"">.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said there were 40 FBI agents going door-to-door, starting Saturday, talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting.

Nixon and Johnson spoke at a church in Ferguson, where they were interrupted repeatedly by people demanding justice and objecting to the curfew.

Johnson assured those in attendance that police would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to observe the curfew.

“You saw people sitting in the street, and they had the chance to get up,” he said. “And that’s how it’s going to continue.”

Brown’s death had already ignited several days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But Friday night marked a resurgence of unrest.

Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly.

The officer who killed Brown was identified as 28-year-old Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints filed against him.

The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson’s whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley asked Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster on Friday to take over the case, saying he did not believe McCulloch could be objective. Koster said Missouri law does not allow it unless McCulloch opts out, and McCulloch spokesman Ed Magee said the prosecutor has no plans to surrender the case (The Associated Press).",75,153,NA,NA

With journalists getting caught in the crossfire, they are no longer only covering protests but becoming part of a narrative that seems to point towards excessive militarization and heavy-handed police tactics.

Things came to a head on Wednesday when two reporters, {Wesley Lowery}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/6000785/wesley-lowrey-and-ryan-reilly-arrested""> of the Washington Post and {Ryan Reilly}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/ryan-reilly-ferguson-arrest_n_5678528.html""> of the Huffington Post, were arrested and assaulted after a heavily armed SWAT team invaded a local McDonald’s.

According to a HuffPost official statement, Reilly was detained, “for not packing up fast enough.” The Washington Post also called the arrest “illegal” and an “assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news.”

Following their release, both journalists talked about being roughed up and painted a grim picture of aggressive, military-style tactics, which were partly {caught on camera}<hyperlink=""http://www.mediaite.com/online/watch-wapos-wesley-lowery-posts-video-of-his-arrest-in-ferguson/"">. Outrage over the incident spilled into both the media and social networks.

In another episode, citizen journalist {Antonio French}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/14/antonio-french-ferguson-arrest-released-police/14064687/""> was jailed for 24 hours, charged with unlawful assembly. There have also been other allegations of police using intimidation tactics, threats of arrest, and claims of imminent violence to keep press away from covering the story.

“I think it’s very disturbing that the police in St. Louis County, Ferguson, are so out of control that they’re even arresting reporters who are just doing their job,” said {NABJ President Bob Butler}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/BobForNABJPrez"">.

“The biggest concern is if they’re treating reporters this way, I shudder to think how they’re treating citizens in St Louis County when the cameras are not there.”

Elizabeth Matthews, a reporter from NBC affiliate {KSDK}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/tv-crews-hit-by-bean-bags-tear-gas/211122826"">, has also been on the receiving end of a frightening confrontation with police in Ferguson. On Wednesday, Matthews and two photojournalists were in a quiet residential area in Ferguson working on an unrelated story about the school district.

She said that while they were sitting in clearly marked “live” media trucks, police approached them with “guns drawn.”

“We were in a very quiet area,” said Matthews. “They came over to us, guns drawn, probably 20 or so officers, which is a scary thing. My hands go immediately in the air and I said ‘I’m media, I’m media.’”

“They said we’re here. We heard you were in distress. Well, we never put out a distress call; I don’t know where that’s coming from. They basically said, ‘we’re forcing you out of the neighborhood.”

The incident happened around the same time an {Al Jazeera America}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/raw-video-of-al-jazeera-america-crews-hit-with-tear-gas/211079049""> camera crew was overcome with tear gas fired near their vehicle in Ferguson. Moments later, police took down the crew’s light kit and pointed their camera towards the ground.

“Al Jazeera is stunned by this egregious assault on freedom of the press that was clearly intended to have a chilling effect on our ability to cover this important story,” the network said in a statement.

Press freedom is an important premise of a democratic society, as are the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.

Indeed, the ugly scenes coming out of Ferguson are concerning. The most poignant visual images surfacing are of police in riot gear firing smoke bombs and tear gas at demonstrators: powerful images that do not belong to Middle America but a war-zone.

Protesters are concerned that justice will not be served and angry that the name of the police officer (who we know now to be Darren Wilson) that shot and killed the 18-year-old was not released.

{Trea Davenport}<hyperlink=""https://treadavenport.carbonmade.com/about"">, a publicist and reputation management expert, says police in Ferguson need to act swiftly to repair their damaged public image.

“While tensions are at their zenith and emotions raw, it is understandable that Ferguson law enforcement are reacting to immense pressures,” she said “However, their mishandling of critical constituencies — the press — is by far among the least savory instances of the intimidation of the media in recent history.”

“A swift, transparent and humble PR strategy is vital at this point. Without it, the downward trajectory of their external reputation maybe beyond mending.”",2,45,NA,NA

In light of the fatal {shooting}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2013/09/17/african-american-mass-shooters/""> of Michael Brown, an unarmed teen killed by police in the Missouri town — and the violent, militarized overreaction by law enforcement to peaceful protesters and journalists on the ground — attention is focused now on how Obama will respond.

At a {Monday press conference}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/ferguson-obama-eric-holder-110104"">, the president spoke about the hurt Ferguson is facing and announced Attorney General Eric Holder will go to Ferguson. To be sure, there are calls for the president to go to Ferguson in person.  MSNBC guest host {Michael Eric Dyson}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/18/critics-obama-should-step-up-and-use-his-bully-pulpit-on-ferguson/""> said Obama needs to “step up to the plate and be responsible.”

On Face the Nation, Dyson added:

""It is not enough for him to come on national {television}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2010/03/02/slideshow-the-best-black-sitcoms-of-all-time/#slideshow-best-black-sitcoms-coverjpg""> and pretend there is a false moral equivalency between police people who are armed and black people who are vulnerable constantly to this. He needs to use his bully pulpit to step up and articulate this as a vision, not necessarily in terms of public policy alone, because Eric Holder is doing a tremendous job in filling in those gaps, but we need presidential {leadership}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2011/01/17/slideshow-the-top-25-most-influential-black-american-leaders-of-all-time/#s:malcolm-x-and-martin-luther-king-jpg-2"">.

Holder is expected to arrive Wednesday, but is that enough?  There are pros and cons for the president making a personal appearance in that strife-torn part of the country, whose local tragedy has national and even international implications.

PROS

For Obama, the pros of visiting Ferguson are clear.  The Missouri town is around 70 percent black, one of the foremost constituencies in Obama’s base.  His presence on the ground would be met by a positive reaction from African-Americans, who want to be assured the president is thinking about them and addressing their concerns.  Further, President Obama could help ease tensions and quell the disturbance by virtue of his mere presence there.

Face time goes a long way, and with the largest and most powerful bully pulpit in the nation, if not the world, the president is uniquely positioned to speak his mind and have it mean something, shape the course of events and sway public opinion.  {Harvard}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2012/07/26/black-women-making-their-mark-in-space-and-science-slideshow/#jeanette_j_epps_phd_recently_graduated_from_astronaut_candidate_training""> law professor Charles Ogletree believes it is time for the president to speak up and say we cannot allow more black boys to be shot and killed by police.  “I think he would be pilloried, but I think he has to speak out.  In the time he spoke about Trayvon Martin, you heard the real Barack Obama speaking from the bully pulpit about what it means to be a black man,” Ogletree said on The Reid Report.  “He said, ‘I was like Trayvon Martin when I was 17.’  He talked about  women clutching their purses who were white.”

At the very least, having the president in Ferguson would represent potent symbolism.  And yet, symbolism means a lot when there are sharp social divisions, and the presence of a leader can potentially make a difference in bringing clarity and resolution and ultimately bringing about change.

Such an appearance is made to order for Obama, a former community organizer, civil rights attorney and constitutional law professor.  Moreover, this is his second term in office, and now is the time to begin to cement his legacy on civil rights and criminal justice.  The Obama administration has spoken out on voting rights, has fought the conservative assault on civil rights and has called for reforms in {drug policy}<hyperlink=""http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2014/04/obama-plans-clemency-hundreds-perhaps-thousands-people-sentenced-drug-law-violations""> and a review of the federal death penalty.  Now that the national spotlight is placed on the militarization of local law enforcement — with {proposed legislation}<hyperlink=""http://thehill.com/policy/defense/215160-lawmaker-drafting-bill-to-stem-flow-of-tanks-and-m16s-to-police""> to reverse the trend and Obama noting the potential {bipartisan support}<""http://www.msnbc.com/up/watch/bipartisan-calls-to-demilitarize-police-318777923728""> for demilitarization of the police — a trip to Ferguson could pave the way for a popular policy initiative.

In addition, although he was cited for being risk averse to speaking out on race, particularly in his first term, President Obama is less encumbered by political considerations in his second term in office.  Past presidents such as Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson enhanced their image through their willingness to insert themselves in civil rights issues and engage with local officials, leaders and residents.  The White House can be a bubble, but the president can resist and counter the image of appearing aloof and distant.

And some would argue that Missouri officials, through their actions, overreactions, missteps and omissions, have bungled up things in a major way.  Despite what Ferguson Mayor James Knowles says, his city is racially divided.  And this is a particularly egregious case in which a white cop shot and killed an unarmed young black man.  Further, that the FBI is conducting its own independent investigation in the Brown shooting is proof the White House has no faith in the efforts of state and local officials in the Show Me State.

CONS   

On the other hand, there are possible pitfalls to an Obama trip to Ferguson.

By inserting himself into the controversy in an overt way, President Obama could receive political blowback from his detractors, who will claim he should not get involved in a local issue and rather should allow the legal process to handle things on its own.

Further, Obama’s conservative critics may attempt to label him a “black president” who is too biased in favor of African-American issues as opposed to other concerns.  To some degree, the president is caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place when it comes to his critics in GOP and tea party circles, those who will accuse him of being “too black,” even as his base pushes him to do more.  And while the Republican opposition may accuse Obama of slacking off and {taking too much vacation}<hyperlink=""http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/ken-walshs-washington/2014/08/07/obama-to-vacation-republicans-to-grumble""> — ignoring {his predecessor’s leisurely pursuits}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-presidential-vacations/2014/08/15/2aa969c6-2311-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?utm_term=.99fb0a2547b3""> — they will find fault with him for taking action, or too much action, on civil rights, {Obamacare}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2013/10/10/conservatives-compare-obamacare-to-slavery/"">, the stimulus, and anything with which they disagree.

An argument can be made for President Obama to skip Ferguson entirely and opt simply for the Holder visit.  After all, the attorney general has street cred in the civil rights community.  Moreover, as a representative of the president, {Holder’s self-proclaimed role}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/when-holder-will-say-what-obama-will-not""> is to “talk about things the president can’t talk about as easily” — particularly matters of race or a pending federal investigation where Obama prefers to remain mum or vague.  With Holder playing the “bad cop” to Obama’s “good cop,” the president is able to advance certain values and policies while not personally putting his face in the local situation.",140,5544,NA,"(5.5k on FB, 44 on Twitter)"

Yesterday, the Country Grammar emcee made up for lost time by walking with protesters in support of the protests with his fellow Missourians.

Though the majority of the crowd was happy for Nelly’s presence, things took a turn when the 39 year old rapper addressed the crowd with a bull horn, urging citizens to have a plan. In series of tweets from journalists on the scene, it seems that message generated a lukewarm response.

Grio,grio6,http://thegrio.com/2014/08/14/military-policing-ferguson/,Military policing and jackboots in Ferguson – an America with a paramilitary police culture,Will J. Wright,08/14/2014,09/22/2016,"The images from Ferguson are alarming — heavily armed police officers dressed in battle fatigues facing off with demonstrators, launching an anti-riot ordinance. Police kicking in doors, in what appears to be the militarization of America’s police force. In an economy that is hard-pressed to provide street lights in some communities, or build new schools, or keep youth athletic programs open, police forces have tanks, grenade launchers and sub-machine guns.

When did we go to sleep to wake up to an America with a paramilitary police culture with fascist tendencies? Where does all of this hell-spawn weaponry come from, and why is it trained on stifling dissent with tactics used on battlefield enemies regardless of whether such force is called for? And how long must police step over the line before something is seriously done?

In June, the {American Civil Liberties Union}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/news/aclus-report-police-militarization-finds-weapons-and-tactics-war-used-disproportionately?redirect=smart-justice-fair-justice/aclus-report-police-militarization-finds-weapons-and-tactics-war-used""> released a report that showed local police forces militarizing at an alarming rate using such tactics disproportionately against people of color. “We found that police overwhelmingly use SWAT raids not for extreme emergencies like hostage situations but to carry out such basic police work as serving warrants or searching for a small amount of {drugs}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2012/04/20/slideshow-the-top-10-potheads-in-hip-hop/#bone-thugjpg"">,” said Kara Dansky, Senior Counsel with the ACLU’s Center for Justice. “Carried out by ten or more officers armed with assault rifles, flashbang grenades, and battering rams, these paramilitary raids disproportionately impacted people of color, sending the clear message that the families being raided are the enemy. This unnecessary violence causes property damage, injury, and death.”

As the “{War on Drugs}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/12/police-militarization-9-11-september-11_n_955508.html"">” waged in the ‘80s, police forces began to gear up with weapons to match the opponents they faced. This started the trend for more firepower and body armor. But it was not until the tragedy of September 11, 2001, that the federal government considered an internal threat that merited such intense consideration. Federal grant money was issued to cities that were considered high risk for terrorist activities, allowing them to buy tactical gear and armored vehicles.

A {New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=3""> analysis of Pentagon data shows how the police are arming themselves for worst-case scenarios that admittedly may never happen. Since 2006, the police in six states have received magazines that carry 100 rounds of M-16 ammunition, which allow officers to fire continuously for three times longer than normal. Twenty-two states obtained equipment to detect buried land mines.

Attorney General Eric Holder today said of the violence in Ferguson, Missouri, “At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.” But it was during the Obama administration, according to Pentagon data, that police departments received tens of thousands of machine guns; nearly 200,000 ammunition magazines; thousands of pieces of camouflage and night-vision equipment; and hundreds of silencers, armored cars and aircraft.

The olive drab-clad and black-helmeted cops who appeared to run roughshod over demonstrators in Ferguson wore no identifying patches or nametags. The ACLU cautioned that, “At every level — from the police to the state governments to the federal government — there is almost no record keeping about SWAT or the use of military weapons and vehicles by local law enforcement.” In addition, the report recommends that state legislatures and municipalities develop criteria for SWAT raids that limit their deployment to the kinds of emergencies for which they were intended, such as an active shooter situation.”",10,1425,NA,"(1.4k on FB, 25 on Twitter); Previously contained 2 additional photos that are no longer available.

(AP) — The police department in a St. Louis suburb where a man was shot and killed by a police officer is asking protesters to gather only during daylight.

Ferguson has been the site of nightly protests and unrest since 18-year-old Michael Brownwas killed during a confrontation with an officer on Saturday.

In a news release issued today, the department asked that all people who assemble to pray or protest do so in “an organized and respectful” manner and disperse well before evening to ensure the safety of participants and the community.

Grio,grio9,http://thegrio.com/2014/08/19/obama-addresses-unrest-in-ferguson/,President Obama addresses unrest in Ferguson,Josh Lederman; Associated Press,08/19/2014,09/22/2016,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When racial tensions erupted midway through his first presidential campaign, {Barack Obama}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2011/11/21/barack-obama-1991-television-commercial-surfaces/""> came to Philadelphia to decry the “racial stalemate we’ve been stuck in for years.” Over time, he said, such wounds, rooted in America’s painful history on race, can be healed.

Six years later, the stalemate suddenly seems more entrenched than ever. As Obama pleads for calm and understanding in Ferguson, Missouri, he’s struggling to determine what role — if any — the nation’s first black president can play in defusing a crisis that has laid bare the profound sense of injustice felt by African-Americans across the country.

As Obama sought to strike the appropriate tone Monday, he appeared to be trapped between the need, as president and commander in chief, to stand up for the government’s right to ensure law and order, and the inclination, as an African-American, to empathize with those whose say the killing of an unarmed black man just goes to show how blacks are treated differently by police.

“In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,” Obama said at the White House, in his most expansive comments to date about the fatal {shooting}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2013/09/17/african-american-mass-shooters/""> of 18-year-old Michael Brown just outside St. Louis.

But while Obama lamented the disproportional apprehension of young {black men}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2013/09/25/black-men-take-to-bikes/#allen_hill_taking_a_break_from_a_weekend_ride"">, he pointedly argued that’s not solely the fault of overzealous cops. Police officers must be honored and respected for the difficult job they perform, Obama said.

“There are young black men that commit crime,” the president said. “We can argue about why that happens — because of the poverty they were born into and the lack of opportunity or school systems that fail them or what have you — but if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted, because every community has an interest in public safety.”

It’s a delicate balance that’s likely to leave no one fully satisfied.

Aiming to reassure edgy Americans that the federal government is fully engaged, Obamaannounced that Attorney General Eric Holder would travel Wednesday to Ferguson to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown’s death. Obama said he also spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who has deployed National Guard units, and urged him to ensure the use of those units is limited and constructive. “I’ll be watching over the next several days,” the president said.

Obama also called for the U.S. to reassess the militarization of local police departments that have purchased military gear from the Pentagon. Federal grants for such equipment have come under intense scrutiny amid the alarming images of armored vehicles and tear gas canisters filling the streets of an American suburb.

“There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement,” Obama said. “We don’t want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions.”

Yet for all the talk of procurement and sentencing disparities and police tactics, Obama has steadfastly avoided personalizing this latest bout of racial friction.

Unlike in 2013, when Obama declared that slain teen Trayvon Martin “could have been me,”Obama has been careful not to describe Brown’s death through the lens of his own experience as an African-American.

And unlike in 2009, when Obama exacerbated tensions by saying police acted “stupidly” by arresting a black {Harvard}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2012/07/26/black-women-making-their-mark-in-space-and-science-slideshow/#jeanette_j_epps_phd_recently_graduated_from_astronaut_candidate_training""> University professor at his own home, this time Obama is leaving the fault-finding to investigators. Obama said Monday he has to be careful about appearing to put his thumb on the scale by weighing in while a federal probe is underway.

Witnesses have said Brown’s hands were above his head when an officer shot him repeatedly on Aug. 9 in Ferguson. But police have said the officer was physically assaulted during a struggle over his weapon. Meanwhile, the aggressive police response to the subsequent protests has drawn criticism from across the U.S.

Obama’s impassive response to the unrest in Ferguson contrasts with a second-term approach in which he generally has been more willing to engage on issues of race. In his remarks Monday, which came during a brief break from Obama’s two-week vacation on Martha’s Vineyard, the president pointed to his signature initiative, My Brother’s Keeper, which aims to bring government, business and nonprofit groups together to empower young minorities to pursue a better future.

“We’re making some significant progress as people of good will of all races are ready to chip in,” Obama said. “But that requires that we build and not tear down, and that requires we listen and not just shout.”",16,45,NA,NA

(AP) — St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar says the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown came after an altercation with police.

Belmar said at a news conference Sunday morning that a Ferguson Police officer had an encounter with two people. He says one person allegedly pushed the officer back into patrol car and assaulted the officer.

He says there was a struggle over the officers’ weapon and one shot was fired in the car. The officer then got out of his vehicle and shot at “a subject.”

He says the man suffered more than a couple gunshots, but “not many more than that.”

(AP) — The fatal {shooting}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2013/09/17/african-american-mass-shooters/""> of a black teenager by police sent hundreds of angry residents out of their apartments Saturday in a St. Louis suburb, igniting shouts of “kill the police” during a confrontation that lasted several hours.

A St. Louis County chapter of the NAACP called for the FBI to look into the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Brown’s grandmother, Desiree Harris, said she saw him running in her neighborhood Saturday afternoon when she passed him in her car. Just minutes later, after she returned home, she heard a commotion and went outside to check on it. Less than two blocks away, she found Brown’s body.

“He was running this way,” she said. “When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn’t tell me nothing.”

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported several distraught relatives were outside talking with neighbors, including Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, and stepfather, Louis Head. Head held a sign that read: “Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!”

A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting at the request of the local department, confirmed a Ferguson police officer shot the man. The spokesman didn’t give the reason for the shooting. St. Louis County police said a large crowd confronted officers following the shooting, yelling such things as “kill the police.”

John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, said the FBI should get involved “to protect the integrity of the investigation.” He alluded to the 2012 racially-charged shooting of a 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of {murder}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2013/08/30/tamron-hall-talks-deadline-crime-and-opens-up-about-her-sisters-murder/#52886333""> charges, as well as the death of a New York man from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes on the street.

“With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers … this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,” Gaskin said.

Gaskin said officials in the organization spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who told them teenager had been shot twice.

By early Saturday night, dozens of police cars remained parked near the shooting scene as mourners left votive candles, rose petals, a large stuffed animal and other remembrances at a makeshift memorial in the middle of the street. At the height of the post-shooting tensions, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents, about two-thirds of whom are black.

Harris said her grandson had recently graduated high school and was looking forward to the future, including possibly attending college.

“My grandson never even got into a fight,” she said. “He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.”

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told the Post-Dispatch that the officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave.

“We are hoping for calm and for people to give us a chance to conduct a thorough investigation,” Jackson said.

Gaskin said the angry crowd was reacting to a “trauma.”

“Anytime you have this type of event that’s taken place, emotions are going to run high,” he said. “But for 600 people to gather around an area to see where a man is lying in the street, that means something happened that should have not happened.”",33,7499,NA,"(7.4k on FB, 99 on Twitter)"

Police violence occurs against an unarmed black man. The black community is outraged.  The anger leads to more violence, except this is self-mutilation: local businesses get smashed and looted.  The city tensely awaits the next act in the play.

Of course, the headlines can’t give you the backstory – that narrative that drives this cycle of violence – partly because it’s assumed we know that story already but partly because knowing the story – and how it keeps repeating, doesn’t change the facts.

The latest installment in our refusal to overcome violence, racism, or police brutality occurred Sunday in Ferguson, Missouri.

A candlelight vigil was being held for Michael Brown, an 18-year old who had been slain in an altercation with police the night before.

While many were there for a peaceful vigil, some used the excuse of grief to cause mayhem, smashing windows and breaking into local stores around the area.  No injuries or deaths were reported in the violence.  Some of the stores affected included AutoZone, Family Dollar, Walgreens, Taco Bell, QuikTrip, and a Phillips 66 station, among others.

Details of the incident which led to Brown’s death are unclear, with eyewitness reports varying greatly from the accounts of the police.

The police say that Brown, while unarmed, had been struggling for one of the police officer’s guns prior to the {shooting}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2013/09/17/african-american-mass-shooters/"">.  Witnesses to the scene say that the youth had his hands in the air while fleeing from the police car and was shot in the back.

Showing just how much things have changed in the media landscape since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles, another example of community violence following perceived injustice behind police violence, the St. Louis County Police Department put out a message on Facebook yesterday, the day after the shootings and the same day they held a press conference.

The message read:  “The FBI will be contacted today and notified of the incident.  If they choose, they may conduct a separate use-of-force investigation on this incident directly with the Ferguson Police Department.”

Such a message seems designed to pre-empt the implications laid out by Lesley McSpadden, the mother of the slain boy.  She reminded reporters that her son was due to start college next week and wondered aloud why police didn’t use Tasers or clubs to subdue her son.  Her remedy to the situation was clear:

I would like to see him [the officer in question] fired.  I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty.

Twenty-two years ago, Rodney King tearfully asked why we couldn’t all just get along.  The question is a fair one and implies its own short-term solution: a peace without understanding.

Whether the verdict of a potential case that follows this incident pleases either side in this tragedy is unclear. What is clear is that we still have to confront the realities of our shared history together, namely the ongoing problem of confrontations between young {black men}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2013/09/25/black-men-take-to-bikes/#allen_hill_taking_a_break_from_a_weekend_ride""> and the police and the corresponding deficit of {leadership}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2011/01/17/slideshow-the-top-25-most-influential-black-american-leaders-of-all-time/#s:malcolm-x-and-martin-luther-king-jpg-2""> among the black communities in which violence occurs as a response to injustice, perceived or actual.

Until cooler heads encourage and lead, we will continue to have senseless reactions like those we saw last night in Ferguson.

We can only hope there will not be more riots and violence in the days to come and that the community can start to come together and try to heal, even as it vigorously seeks justice and truth.",51,92,NA,NA

Jackson identified Darren Wilson as the officer who fatally shot Brown last Saturday just after noon. In addition to revealing Wilson as the shooter, Jackson also released an incident report and other documents implicating Brown as a “robbery suspect” for an incident that occurred just minutes before his death.

The report states that Brown took Swisher Sweet cigars without paying and later had a confrontation with a store employee before exiting from the store. Dorian Johnson was with Brown at the time and confirmed to {MSNBC.com’s Trymaine Lee}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ferguson-police-name-michael-brown""> that Brown took the cigars without paying.

But how were the two incidents related?

At a second press conference Friday afternoon, Jackson said the officer who stopped Brown was unaware he was a suspect in the incident and engaged with him because Brown and Johnson were walking in the middle of the street.

Many Ferguson residents questioned the timing and purpose of the “robbery” information.

“If he did it, then he should be taken into custody – not shot,” said Alvari Edwards, a Ferguson resident for more than 15 years. “I don’t condone the way some of us here have responded to these events, but it’s not right what they’re doing. Because of some cigars, he had to die?”

Edwards son, Damon Roberts Jr., held a sign near his mother that said: ‘I Am Mike Brown.’ The young boy joined dozens of other protestors who lined W. Florissant Avenue near the Quik Trip store that was destroyed last Sunday night.

“To me it looks like, the authorities are trying to protect the suspect instead of the victim,” said Carl Walton who lives St. Louis. “You cannot justify killing a young unarmed man. They took justice in their own hands.”

Walton has a barbershop called So Flyy Hair Gallery. He said the conversations at the Gallery lately have been troubling.

“I’m not sure that everyone involved in this investigation wants justice to be served,” Walton said. “We need some action done.”",21,1616,NA,"(1.6k on FB, 16 on Twitter)"

“We see that there’s tape, that they claim they got a tape that shows there was some sort of strong-armed robbery,” said Freeman Bosley, Johnson’s attorney. “We need to see that tape; my client did tell us and told the FBI that they went into the store. He told FBI that he did take cigarillos, he told that to the DOJ and the St. Louis County Police.”

In an interview earlier this week, Johnson described the events of the shooting but did not mention that he and Brown had been in a convenience store just before, or that Brown had stolen anything.

According to the police report, the officer who shot Brown was responding to a description provided by police dispatch searching for a suspect in the robbery nearby. The officer was identified as Darren Wilson, who is white, and has been on the police force for six years. He is currently on paid administrative leave.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who made the details public Friday morning, declined to answer questions from the media but said he would provide an update later in the day.

“The [officer’s] name in and of itself doesn’t let us know a whole lot,” Bosley said. “The next step is: what do we know about the officer? We’d like to see his personnel file and if any disciplinary action has been taken against him, and how long he has been an officer.”

In his brief appearance before the media, Jackson said that no disciplinary action had been taken against Wilson. Brown was not believed to have a criminal record, either.

Residents of Ferguson had been demanding the release of the officer’s name and details about the shooting. Many questions {remain unanswered}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/michael-brown-shooting-questions-unanswered""> regarding Brown’s death.

I wrote about the disparities of how rigorously those deaths are investigated, prosecuted and sentenced based on their socio-economic and physical characteristics. I said plainly that our justice system has a race, a gender and an income and uses those things — consciously and unconsciously —  to place a value on human life.

The same is true for American media and how we chose to cover those deaths — on the right and the left. All too often, personal ideology fueled by socialization is the determining factor.

That writing was never more relevant than it is this today. Put simply, we assign moral judgments based on that information and our ideological perspective, and that, in turn, forms our assessment of what justice — civil and criminal —  looks like.

It also matters what the shooter is wearing — especially if it is a police uniform. Reasonable doubt almost always tilts in favor of those wearing blue. If you are shot by a police officer, rightly or wrongly, the assumption is you were doing something wrong. Your presumption of innocence evaporates. How you see this depends largely upon the quality of the relationship your community historically has had with law enforcement.

Yesterday morning, as Ferguson, MO police chief Tom Jackson stepped to the podium and released the name of the officer who shot 18 year old Michael Brown, for a moment, many felt some sense of relief. Local residents and reporters covering the incident had demanded transparency. However, Jackson’s stated timeline pointed to a “strong arm robbery” previously unreported by media and inferred that it led to Officer Darren Wilson confronting Brown on the street.

He took no questions.

In an information package given to attending press, Brown was named as a suspect in that robbery. Still photos taken from surveillance footage included show a large black man apparently committing an assault. Police say they identified that person as Brown after the {shooting}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2013/09/17/african-american-mass-shooters/"">. Yesterday, the lawyer for 22-year-old Dorion Johnson — the second young man on the scene — said Johnson admitted to federal investigators that he was with Brown in the convenience store and that a pack of “rellos” was taken. I met and spent a great deal of time with Johnson and his lawyers, and I believe him — about the store encounter, about the shots fired.

It’s worth noting that it took nearly a week to receive this information. Transparency is not only about the integrity of content but the timing of its release.

What concerned me immediately was this: Did Wilson suspect Brown of the robbery when he saw him walking with Johnson and, if so, why were they simply told to get out of the street? Are those the words of a man who suspects that another has allegedly just committed a robbery and assaulted a store clerk? Furthermore, did Wilson radio dispatch about those suspicions prior to engaging Brown?

The answers to those questions came quickly. Chief Jackson said on camera in a second press conference today that Wilson did not know about the robbery and thus did not regard Brown as a suspect when he was stopped. They were stopped solely for jaywalking, according to Jackson.

The question then becomes: Why was information about the robbery released simultaneously with the officer’s identity if not to establish probable cause? Why was it worth knowing, if not to cast doubt on the morality of Brown? Did he steal from the store and push the clerk out of his way? Yes. Does that mean he was also hostile toward the officer? That is for a jury to decide. But Jackson clearly believed that assessment was better made by the general public without legal context. He blamed media inquiries for the release of the store tape.

However, a St. Louis-based attorney told me last evening that the surveillance video released was “non-responsive” to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or Sunshine Law requests generated by the media. Most tellingly, members of the press did not know about the robbery until yesterday morning when Jackson announced the timeline and did not specifically request any information associated with it. Brown is allegedly shown on the tape stealing the carton of cigars and shoving the cashier as he exited the store. Despite what Chief Tom Jackson said, according to the Mound City Bar Association, the FOIA requests were specific to the shooting incident. Further, CNN reported this morning that the tape was released over the clear objections of the Justice Department, which warned the information could renew tensions in Ferguson.

Unfortunately, they were right. Tensions flared again last evening, and some stores were looted. Peaceful protesters stood guard over many retail outlets in an attempt to hold the line. Community leaders and elected officials are now calling for Jackson’s resignation. Questions surrounding his motives for releasing the surveillance tape remain.

However, the real question is: Did Brown deserve a death sentence for jaywalking? What did he do, if anything, out there on Canfield Drive to spur the officer’s deadly response? It is worth knowing many shots were fired, from what distance and what was Brown doing when each of the shots was fired. Thanks to science and witnesses, this is knowable information. The answer means the difference between a “clean” shoot and a {murder}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/2013/08/30/tamron-hall-talks-deadline-crime-and-opens-up-about-her-sisters-murder/""> charge.

Despite the absence of an onboard dash camera, something else is knowable: The first shot came from inside the police car. According to police statements and independent eyewitnesses, there was a struggle. Brown was either attempting to get away or grab the officer’s gun when he was first shot. Wilson exited his vehicle and gave chase. A second volley of shots was fired as Brown ran away. Witnesses say Wilson was running and shooting. One bullet was found lodged in a neighbor’s apartment.

At least one bullet, I am told by lawyers connected with the case, hit Brown in the back.

Witnesses on the scene say Brown stopped, turned around and raised both hands in a universal sign of surrender. “I don’t have a gun,” he reportedly said. A third volley of shots was fired.

Brown was hit multiple times and died at the scene. He was unarmed.

Videotapes show Brown lying there in the street, uncovered, with no medical attention for hours. At some point, according to the incident report, an officer compared surveillance photos obtained from the store to Brown and determined he had committed the convenience store robbery. Despite official police statements, witnesses say rather than summon an ambulance, a black SUV arrived to take the body away. The officers on the scene, it should be noted, never checked for a weapon or to see if Brown was responsive. They knew Brown was unarmed. And they knew he was dead.

For those who had always believed Brown to be a “thug” and a “thief,” news of the robbery was all the validation needed. To hear them tell it, the African-American community has no right to be outraged with the lack of transparency in the shooting of an unarmed person when “black on black crime” is so prevalent. Such arguments are meant to deflect and marginalize. They are designed to protect a narrative that criminalizes black life and justify over-policing policies like stop-and-frisk.

Are there hustlers out there who use cases like this to further their own prominence and line their pockets? Sure. And there are just as many who make a living marketing racial animus cloaked in concern for the greater good. The sad fact is that business model works both ways. Both take advantage of confirmation bias, fanning the flames of our collective fears, imbued by socialization. I have little patience for either.

The fact is most crime is intra-racial. You are far more likely to be victimized by someone who looks like you.

If we accept that Brown was, in fact, the person captured on video stealing a $50 box of Swisher Sweets and pushing the clerk (and I do), does that justify his death? Does shoving a smaller, unarmed store clerk mean that you will attack a clearly armed and trained police officer? Does the tape justify the first shot, those that followed or the last?

If we accept each and every element as described by police as fact, what then justifies shooting Brown when he was standing with both hands in the air? Officer Wilson may never face charges in this case. Whether he faces a criminal trial and/or departmental discipline remains to be seen. Like Brown, Wilson deserves every legal benefit due process affords. If and when he does stand trial, he will be able to mount his own defense. He deserves to tell his side of the story, and he deserves an impartial, untainted jury — unsoiled by a video tape that was released outside of a courtroom and without context.

He’s been a staple at protests and demonstrations since Thursday — walking side by side with residents who feel Michael Brown was wrongfully killed at the hands of police.

Sunday, Johnson continued to endear himself to those still outraged by his death. Speaking at a “unity rally” at Greater Grace Church, Johnson apologized on behalf of the law enforcement community and offered his direct support of Michael Brown’s family.

He then delivered what sounded more like a sermon than a message.

“When this is over, I’m going to go into my son’s room … my black son,” Johnson said to applause. “[He] wears his pants sagging, wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arm … but that’s my baby.”

Thousands attended the rally in Ferguson Sunday, and hundreds more were reportedly gathered outside the church.
