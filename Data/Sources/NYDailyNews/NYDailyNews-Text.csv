Jay Nixon.

As canisters flew through the air about 50 minutes into the curfew, someone hurled a Molotov cocktail at the side of a local store, igniting a small fire.

Clouds of smoke had filled the street when a group of other protesters raced toward the store, Chop Suey, and stomped out the fire.

Cops in riot gear were hanging back as the demonstrators slowly advanced along W. Florissant Ave. at about 12:30 a.m. local time.

But 15 minutes later, cops threatened to move in.

“This is the police,” an officer announced into a bullhorn. “You are violating the state-issued curfew. You must disperse immediately or you will be subject to arrest.”

A moment later, the first canister flew, followed by a dozen more.

A citizen “peacekeeper” had earlier implored the mob of protesters to go home.

“They are gearing up,” the man said, referring to the police. “Please go back. We are going to see something we have never seen before.”

The tense standoff came hours after Nixon declared a state of emergency and announced a curfew from midnight until 5 a.m. to quell the chaos roiling Ferguson.

“We cannot allow the ill-will of the few to undermine the goodwill of the many,” Nixon said. “We cannot have looting. We can’t have people fearful.”

But Nixon was shouted down at a raucous news conference inside a church, as angry residents demanded the arrest of Police Officer Darren Wilson.

“We want justice!” they roared.

Frustrated by the heckling, Nixon turned to Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, the 27-year lawman he put in charge of calming things down.

“Yelling at each other is not going to solve things,” Johnson said. “We will be in this together.”

But Johnson had trouble controlling the angry crowd Saturday night, which continued to demand justice for Michael Brown.

As the minutes ticked down to midnight, a heavy rain fell and the crowd of protesters thinned out.

But others were milling around outside under the watchful eye of cops in riot gear, vowing to defy the curfew order.

“We not going anywhere,” one man yelled toward cops, a bandanna covering his face.

In one extraordinary encounter, Johnson stood toe-to-toe with a protester who had moments earlier been shouting angrily at the cops.

“I have the same questions you have,” Johnson told the man as part of a five-minute speech. “I guarantee when the day is over, when we are all back in our homes, the answers that we look for today are going to make our lives better and our communities better.”

“I salute you, sir,” the appeased demonstrator said.

Johnson said early Sunday, after the streets had calmed, that seven protesters were arrested and charged with failure to disperse.

The response by police, Johnson said, was due to reports of a shooting and potential burglary by armed men at Red BBQ. Tear gas was deployed after police heard reports of armed men in the restaurant — the gas was not used to enforce the curfew, Johnson said. Red BBQ was at the corner of W. Florissant Ave. and Canfield Drive, the street where Brown was killed by Wilson.

One person was shot near the location and was in critical condition early Sunday, Johnson said. A police car was also targeted by the shooter. No arrest in the shooting has been made after the gunman was observed running off.

Earlier, a group of Black Panthers led protesters in a chant calling for Wilson’s head. 

“What’s his name?” they shouted.

“Darren Wilson,” came the reply.

“How do we want him?” they shouted.

“Dead,” replied several protesters.

Meanwhile, {Yahoo News published the first photo}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/photos-ferguson-officer-darren-wilson-received-police-award-earlier-this-year-021255893.html""> of Wilson. The photo shows the officer sporting a blond buzz cut as he received a commendation in February for “extraordinary effort in the line of duty.”

It was not clear what Wilson did to deserve the honor. A Facebook photo shows the 28-year-old cop shaking hands with Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson.

Wilson’s father, according to Yahoo, posted a message on Facebook last week asking for prayers for his son — though not by name.

Another photo emerged Saturday, this one tragically showing Brown’s lifeless body splayed out on the street with a paramedic kneeling at his side and an officer looking on.

Business owners in Ferguson were cleaning up Saturday after peaceful protests Friday gave way to a flurry of looting once most of the demonstrators had gone home. The anger boiled over again after Jackson released surveillance video linking Brown to a robbery that happened shortly before the deadly Aug. 9 shooting.

Just after midnight Friday, some 200 demonstrators pelted the troopers with rocks and other objects. When the troopers backed off, some emboldened troublemakers targeted Ferguson Market and Liquor — the business from which Brown allegedly stole a $48.99 box of Swisher Sweets cigars.",NA,1498,NA,NA
NYDailyNews,nydn2,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/man-shot-arrested-protesters-police-ferguson-clash-violence-article-1.1906387,"Michael Brown was shot 6 times, independent autopsy reveals, as police fire tear gas at protesters in Ferguson, Mo.",Corinne Lestch; Bill Hutchinson; Kenny Bahr,08/18/2014,02/10/2016,"An independent autopsy conducted Sunday showed Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager killed by a white cop in a St. Louis suburb, was shot six times, including twice in the head.

The autopsy performed by famed forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden at the request of Brown’s family also showed all the bullets struck the teen from the front, the New York Times reported.

One shot hit him in the top of the head, indicating he was bent forward, said Baden, though he declined to draw a conclusion about the position.

But the number of shots will likely inflame tensions.

“In my capacity, I would say, ‘You’re not supposed to shoot so many times,’” said Baden, who retired from a position as the forensic examiner for the New York State Police in 2011.

Baden, also the former New York City medical examiner, told the Times that Brown was shot from a distance, explaining that no gunpowder suggesting point-blank gunfire was found on Brown’s body.

Brown was shot four times in his right arm and twice in the head, including once in the right eye, Baden said. He said some bullets entered and caused multiple wounds before exiting Brown’s body.

“People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day 1,” Baden told the Times after performing the autopsy. “They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.”

Baden announced his results as another night of unrest in the streets of Ferguson, Mo., saw police in riot gear shoot tear gas at protesters to clear the streets.

After a week of protests that escalated into violence, including one man critically wounded early Sunday, the police captain appointed to restore calm to a blood-soaked St. Louis suburb apologized.

“I wear this uniform, and I should stand up and say, ‘I’m sorry,’” said Capt. Ron Johnson, the Missouri State Highway Patrol officer appointed by the governor last week as tensions escalated over the Aug. 9 police killing of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Johnson issued his apology — and earned cheers — at a rally hosted by the Rev. Al Sharpton at Greater Grace Church in Ferguson. The apology came after Sunday morning violence — including police use of tear gas, which Johnson had initially promised would not continue.

“I will stand to protect you,” Johnson said. “I will protect your right to protest.”

Hours later, however, chaos again broke out on W. Florisant Ave., the scene of earlier protests. A St. Louis County Police dispatcher reported that protesters had taken over a McDonald’s restaurant and workers had locked themselves into freezer units for safety.

There was also an unconfirmed report on the same police band radio that an officer had been wounded in a shooting.

Police moved in to break up the crowd with more tear gas, about two and a half hours before the start of the night’s midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew.

In a press briefing shortly after 1 a.m. Monday in Ferguson, Johnson said cops began employing tear gas after reports of shots fired and Molotov cocktails being hurled around 9 p.m.

He suggested the violent incidents were pre-planned, organized acts caused by a few people amid the otherwise peaceful protests. ""We had to act to protect lives and property,"" Johnson said.

Johnson knew of two or three people who were injured in shootings, and a number of people were arrested for ""failure to disperse,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon signed an executive order calling for assistance from the Missouri National Guard, CNN reported early Monday.

The violence came after a church rally where Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson was again criticized for releasing a surveillance video that allegedly showed Brown stealing cigars from a convenience store moments before he was shot by Officer Darren Wilson.

Jackson initially said Wilson knew Brown was a suspect in the shop robbery only to backtrack later. Activists say Jackson was trying to “smear” the 18-year-old black victim, who was slain by the white cop.

“How can the young folk in the city believe in a system that would try to spit on the name and character of a young man who hasn’t even been buried?” asked Sharpton, who called the death “a defining moment in this country.”

“Michael Brown Jr. will be a defining moment on how this country deals with policing and the rights of its citizens,” Sharpton said Sunday night.

Nixon also accused law enforcement of trying to “besmirch” Brown when they linked him to the robbery.

“It had an incendiary effect,” the Democratic governor said on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” adding that his office was not made aware of the decision to release the video.

“I do think it flamed it back up and has caused us to have to deal with some of that,” he said.

Wilson was also dealing with backlash. In a Facebook post apparently written by the officer, he announced he had deactivated his account “due to a number of threats.”

On Sunday, federal authorities said a new autopsy would be performed “by a federal medical examiner,” Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.

“This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,” Fallon continued, adding that officials will still take into account the autopsy done during the state probe.

The peaceful rally came hours after a night of mayhem in which a man was shot following a confrontation between police and protesters who refused to abide by the state-mandated curfew.

Authorities have not identified the victim in the incident early Sunday, but they do not believe it was a police-involved shooting.

Officers from the Missouri State Highway Patrol, St. Louis city and county police, dispersing tear gas, bounded into the hostile area on armored vehicles to break up the mass, and seven people were arrested.

Shortly after midnight Tuesday, police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters, and two men were taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds.

The nation’s top lawman was dispatched to violence-scarred Ferguson, Mo., as a disturbing new video surfaced Monday of a white cop standing over the body of an unarmed black teenager he had shot to death moments earlier.

President Obama announced Monday he was sending Attorney General Eric Holder to Missouri on Wednesday, as the National Guard began patrolling the St. Louis suburb, which has been racked by confrontations between demonstrators and police — including a new round early Tuesday.

""The night began peacefully, but there is a dangerous dynamic in the night,"" said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol  at 2:25 a.m. Tuesday.

""Please protest during the daytime hours,"" he said, before confirming that two men had been shot, four police officers were injured by thrown rocks and bottles, 31 people had been arrested and two fires were set.

While Ferguson residents took to the streets again to protest the killing of Michael Brown, 18, Obama said that though the majority of residents have been peaceful, a “small minority are not.” Saying that he understands their rage, Obama added that “giving in to that anger by looting and carrying guns and attacking police undermines justice.”

Obama said he hoped that “a fair and just process” in investigating the shooting would lead to a “fair and just outcome.”

The President also said he wanted to walk a fine line until all the facts were in on Brown’s death.

“I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed,” Obama said.

The commander-in-chief noted that local police departments have been using federal grants to arm themselves; he said law enforcement spending should be reviewed nationwide. “There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred,” Obama said.

The FBI has launched a civil rights investigation into the Aug. 9 killing, and the Justice Department is monitoring the case.

Meanwhile, an independent autopsy conducted by the forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden cast doubts on police accounts of how Officer Darren Wilson, 28, fatally shot Brown.

“There weren’t any signs of a struggle,” said Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner.

Brown appears to have been shot at least six times from a distance, and all but one shot to the top of his head were most likely survivable, Baden said. That shot pierced his skull at an angle that suggests Brown was bending over, he said. “He did not suffer,” Baden said.

Also, most of the bullets appear to have struck Brown in the front of his body, Baden said.

One of the wounds on Brown’s right arm “could have occurred when he was putting his hands up,” said Shawn Parcells, a Kansas-based pathologist who assisted Baden. Several witnesses have said Brown had his hands in the air in a sign of surrender when Wilson shot him dead. “It verifies that the witness accounts were true,” argued Brown family lawyer Benjamin Crump. “He was shot multiple times in broad daylight.”

But neither Crump nor the pathologists could offer an answer when outspoken community leader Shirley Davis asked why — given the autopsy results — the St. Louis County prosecutor has not charged Wilson with a crime.

“It was murder, it was murder,” Davis said. “It was blatant. This is sad. This could be anyone’s child.”

The Justice Department is planning to do its own autopsy.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson contends Wilson fired after he was pushed into his police cruiser by the 6-foot-4 Brown, and the doomed teenager tried to take the officer’s gun.

On Monday, a woman identifying herself as “Josie” and saying she was a friend of Wilson, called a Sacramento, Calif., radio station to give the officer’s version of events. The caller told KTFK that Brown “bum-rushed” Wilson and that the officer fired. But a woman who videotaped the aftermath of the tragic encounter from her apartment balcony told CNN on Monday that Wilson tried to pull Brown into his cruiser, and Brown fled.

Piaget Crenshaw, whose video shows Wilson standing in the street over Brown’s body, said the teenager appeared to be grazed by a shot and then “turned around and was shot multiple times” by Wilson. In the video, Crenshaw can be heard saying, “God bless his soul, the police shot this boy outside my apartment.”

The police chief’s early refusal to release details of the deadly confrontation — or the officer’s name — sparked several days of rage in Ferguson.

The Washington Post — citing an anonymous source “familiar” with the St. Louis County medical examiner’s findings — reported that Brown had “marijuana in his system.”

So far county Prosecutor Robert McCulloch, who is expected to convene a grand jury this week, has not released the medical examiner’s report.

Wilson has not been charged with a crime, and is on paid leave.

Jackson fanned the fury in mostly black Ferguson by initially saying Wilson knew Brown was a suspect in the shop robbery — and later backtracking from that claim.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon then accused law enforcement of trying to “besmirch” Brown by linking him to the robbery.

Crump said the Browns sought Baden’s help because they don’t trust McCulloch.

Baden spoke after Nixon lifted the curfew, which had been in place in Ferguson for two raucous nights, and sent in the National Guard to restore order.

Jay Nixon on Sunday accused law enforcement in the tense St. Louis suburb of Ferguson of trying to “besmirch” Michael Brown when they linked the unarmed 18-year-old shot dead by police last weekend to a robbery in the area.

“It had an incendiary effect,"" the Democratic governor said on CBS show “Face the Nation” of Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson’s decision on Friday to release a video that allegedly showed Brown, just before he was fatally shot by police, stealing a box of cigars from a nearby convenience store.

“When you release picture and you clearly are attempting to besmirch a victim of a shooting, shot down in his own street, a young man and at the same time you’re releasing information to try to make it, to tarnish him, then properly, there was a lot of folks that were concerned about that,” Nixon explained, adding that his office was not made aware of the decision to release the video. “I do think it flamed it back up and has caused us to have to deal with some of that.""

Jackson released the video at the same time he released the identity of the officer who shot and killed Brown, leading many to believe that local law enforcement were trying to sabotage Brown’s character.

Violent clashes between protesters and police have continued in the eight days since Brown, who is black, was killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in the majority-African American suburb of Ferguson.

St. Louis County police at first responded with heavy-handed tactics and military gear and machinery that many, including Nixon on Sunday, have said inflamed the situation.

“All of us were thunderstruck by the pictures we saw, I mean, the over-militarization, the MRAPs rolling in, the guns pointed at kids in the street,” Nixon said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “All of that I think instead of ratcheting down, brought emotion up.”

After several days of violent protests, Nixon brought in the Missouri State Highway Patrol to leading the effort to keep peace in the area, putting in charge Capt. Ronald Johnson, who is black and from the area.

But the scene remained delicate Saturday.

""There's a tremendous amount of angst about the facts in this case,"" Nixon said on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" ""Thousands of people spoke last night, thousands of people marched and not a single gunshot was fired by police last night,” he added about what he perceived as Saturday’s improved situation.

Nixon has imposed a midnight curfew in the suburb but wouldn’t say Sunday when officers might lift it.

“We can't be distracted from the longer pitch here,” he said. “And the longer is to make sure that these dual investigations, the Justice Department and the local prosecutor, to get to justice, that they are thorough and done.”",NA,711,NA,NA

It was the worst of Ferguson.

In a local church, people gave a standing ovation on Sunday afternoon to Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol.

But hours later on W. Florissant Ave. — near where Officer Darren Wilson killed unarmed Michael Brown with six bullets — Johnson was seen as the enemy.

The difference is as clear as day and night.

On Sunday afternoon, after a week of tears and tear gas, rioting and looting, the city of Ferguson needed a hero to cheer.

So at 3 p.m., people packed the Greater Grace Church to hear firebrand Rev. Al Sharpton address a rally for justice.

“I want to hear what he says about the cop who shot Michael Brown,” said Minister Margie Binion, who was a nurse for 25 years before going legally blind. “About five years ago, a Ferguson policeman comes to the door of one of my patients, looking for her teenage grandson. He was a very nasty, very belligerent, very angry young policeman. His name was Darren Wilson. So when I heard he was the one who did the shooting, I wasn’t at all surprised.”

In a town of 21,000, the world is very round and extremely small.

“I have three sons aged 25, 23 and 18,” adds Shalita Winters. “Shariff is 18, a month younger than Mike Brown. His killing made me extremely upset. Each time I became pregnant, I prayed for a girl because I did not want to raise black men in this country. They never get the benefit of the doubt by the police.”

So she came to hear Sharpton, hoping he might help bring change to Ferguson’s police department that has just three black cops on a force of 53 in a town that is two-thirds black.

The church soon overflowed with like-minded frightened mothers of young black men, spilling into the lobby and 2,000 strong out onto the church grounds to hear Sharpton and Martin Luther King III.

Sharpton gave a passionate speech — but he had the misfortune of following Capt. Johnson who had walked to the stage and said, “My heart goes out to Mike Brown’s family. I’m sorry.”

It was an extraordinary moment as this native son in his always crisp police uniform apologized to the parents of a black teenager killed by a white policeman.

The people of Ferguson rose to their feet and exploded in applause. They needed a hero.

But by 11 p.m., and a mile away, a small band of protesters again clashed with Capt. Johnson’s highway cops.

Police claim they were assaulted. They responded with tear gas.

The disparity in attitudes between the church people and a minority of street people might support the theory that the violence has been initiated by a small band of hard-core outside agitators. Some are ghoulish looters exploiting a human tragedy.

In Greater Grace Church, Shalita Winters and every other mother stood and applauded Capt. Johnson.

“He’s my nephew,” said Brenda States. “Ron has always been so strong. After his own brother died in a motorcycle accident, he had the strength to deliver the eulogy.”

“He’s my cousin,” added Brenda McNairy. “I grew up with Ron Johnson as a role model. Ron was always the one to smooth out family feuds. Now he’ll do that for Ferguson.”

Even Sharpton gave Ferguson’s new top cop his props.

“We heard tonight from Officer Johnson,” Sharpton said. “We’re not anti-police. We don’t think they’re all so bad.”

He was right.

In a town torn apart by a police killing, the church people of Ferguson rose to their feet on Sunday to give a standing O to a policeman.

Here is her account:

I was walking toward the police on Florissant Ave. with my hands in the air to signal I was not a threat. Suddenly an officer pointed a rifle at my face.

“Get on the ground!” he barked.

“Put it on the ground,” he then ordered, seeing I was holding one camera and had another slung over my shoulder.

The gun was still trained on me.

""Put your hands behind your head,"" he said. ""You’re under arrest for curfew violation.”

I was on my knees with my hands behind my head near the QuikTrip store. The cop took my hands, one at a time, and placed them behind my back. Then he slapped on plastic handcuffs.

It was about 1 a.m., one hour after the curfew Missouri’s governor ordered took effect amid a state of emergency. Most of the night's protesters had left, dispersed by smoke bombs and tear gas and teeming rain.

“What are these?” the cop asked.

“My cameras,” I replied.

He took my equipment and my cell phone as tear gas swirled around me, rain poured down and two other people were similarly detained.

“I have a press pass,” I told him. “Look under my poncho.”

Al Sharpton accuses Ferguson, Mo., police chief of 'smear campaign' against Michael Brown",Erik Badia; Corky Siemaszko,08/16/2014,02/12/2016,"They’re trying to do to Michael Brown what they did to Eric Garner — “smear” his name.

The Rev. Al Sharpton hurled that accusation Saturday against the Ferguson, Mo,. police chief — and linked the killing of Brown by a Missouri cop to the chokehold death of Garner at the hands of an NYPD officer.

“It’s the epitome of an insult to the people of this country that law enforcement smear a young man before we can even bury him,” Sharpton said of 18-year-old Brown at the National Action Network headquarters in Harlem.

“They did the same thing to Eric Garner. The first thing they did was try to put out Eric's record.”

The Brown family cried foul after Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson revealed that the doomed teenager had been suspected of stealing a box of cigars just 20 minutes before he was killed last Saturday.

Jackson admitted later Friday that Officer Darren Wilson did not know Brown was a robbery suspect when he stopped him for walking in the street and shot him.

Sharpton said Jackson was trying to take the onus off Wilson when he released video and a police report that names Brown as a “strong-arm” robbery suspect.

“First of all, what does that have to do with him being killed?,” Sharpton said of the cigar-stealing allegation.

“Are you telling me now that you have the right to run somebody down and kill them over three or four cigars, is that what you're telling me?”

Jackson, who also identified Wilson by name for the first time since the Brown killing, insisted he released the robbery evidence after repeated requests from reporters.

Garner’s family accused the NYPD of blaming the victim after it was revealed that the Staten Island dad had a lengthy rap sheet for mostly minor offenses. He was killed when cops tried to arrest him for peddling unlicensed cigarettes known on the street as loosies.

The Medical Examiner has ruled Garner’s death of July 17 a homicide and Officer Daniel Pantaleo is now riding a desk as the Staten Island prosecutor weighs whether to charge him with a crime.

Sharpton also took the opportunity to rail against Police Commissioner Bill Bratton’s “broken windows” approach to policing, which critics say unfairly targets minorities.

“There is a connection” between Brown and Garner, he said. “Both of them were victims of this aggressive policing of alleged low-level crime. There ain't no difference between dealing with looseys and dealing with telling kids to get out of the street.”

Bratton insists the strategy is effective and denies that it targets any particular group.",NA,194,NA,NA

When I arrived at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport on Thursday, workers at the rental car counter were debating the fatal shooting of Michael Brown.

“Tony probably won’t talk to me for a year,” said one female worker to my counterman, “just because I told him let’s wait until we have all the facts before we condemn this cop who did the shooting.”

Ferguson was a town on the precipice. The QuikTrip store had been torched. Looters smashed the windows of the local chop suey and barbecue joints. Elderly women lamented being held prisoners in their own homes by tear gas. Citizens, whites and blacks, demanded to know the name of the cop who shot 18-year-old Brown.

You could almost hear the ticking of a time bomb ready to explode Ferguson into the kind of rioting we have not seen since Los Angeles erupted after the cops who beat Rodney King were found not guilty.

Then one man with a beating heart beneath the shiny star on his breast came to a Ferguson under siege and turned it into a lesson in American civics.

Before night fell on Thursday, Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol had been given superseding jurisdiction of Ferguson by Gov. Jay Nixon, marginalizing Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson.

Chief Jackson on Friday finally named Darren Wilson as the cop who shot Brown, and then released a surveillance video reportedly showing Brown snatching a $48.99 box of cigars from Ferguson Market and Liquor and shoving a storekeeper.

Jackson would admit later that Wilson did not know about the robbery when he killed Brown after stopping him for “walking in the street and blocking traffic.”

I stood outside the 911 Hair Salon watching this deeply moving tableau of peaceful dissent borrowed from the best days of the transformative 1960s.

“I just hope it lasts,” said Eliard Lay, 35, of Ferguson. “I hated the looting as much as I hated what the cops did. This right here tonight is cool. But if we want change, it has to last after Mike Brown is buried and y’all are gone. It’s good that Gov. Nixon and Jesse Jackson and Ron Johnson came here.

It didn’t last. By midnight, many of the peaceful protesters had gone home.

Then after midnight came the looters, a tiny percentage — amid the good citizens — of common criminals who couldn’t care less about Brown or a better Ferguson. They broke into at least five stores. Some of the remaining protesters formed a human barricade of citizens and police in front of Ferguson Market and Liquor to prevent the looting.

They did.

Capt. Ron Johnson was tapped by Missouri’s governor to settle things down in a St. Louis suburb that was rocked by five nights of violence after an unarmed black teenager was killed by town cop Darren Wilson.

“We are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we’re in this together,” Ferguson told furious residents after he got the nod Thursday. “I understand the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling, and our officers will respect both of those.”

And with those words, Johnson was able to accomplish what dozens of cops in riot gear were unable to do — get Ferguson through a night without fighting in the streets.

Johnson’s approach is “a model of community-based policing,” said Attorney General Eric Holder.

Johnson continued to soothe and console Friday after the Ferguson police chief angered residents by revealing 18-year-old shooting victim Michael Brown was being sought for a robbery when he was killed Saturday.

“In our anger we have to make sure we don’t burn down our own house and go down there and vandalize our own buildings,” he said.

Johnson assured the crowd he would meet with the chief — and in person.

“We don’t live in a perfect state,” Johnson told one resident and then hugged her.

Johnson, 51, is no stranger to Ferguson. He grew up there. And like most of the residents, he is black.

Outraged over the heavy-handed tactics of local police, Gov. Jay Nixon ordered them to stand down and sent in Johnson and his state troopers.

A 27-year veteran of the force who commands Troop C, which covers 11 counties and the city of St. Louis, Johnson immediately ordered officers to ditch the armor, put away the tear gas and park the SWAT trucks.

Then Johnson joined the demonstrators and started marching with them.

“I’m not afraid to be in this crowd,” he said.

He assured the disbelieving that there would be justice for 18-year-old Michael Brown.

“I’ve got a son that deals with the same thing,” he told one black man who complained about white police officers hassling him for no apparent reason.

Johnson, a married father of two, said Friday he would continue his soft strategy for making Ferguson safe.

“Last night you saw me out there communicating and respecting; that is what law enforcement is supposed to do,” he said. “You’re going to see a bunch of smiles, a bunch of hugs, that’s what you’re going to see from me.”",NA,125,NA,NA

Ron Johnson marches with protesters in Ferguson as law enforcement scales back on day 5 of turmoil after Michael Brown shooting ,Sasha Goldstein,08/14/2014,02/12/2016,"They’re standing together in Ferguson.

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol walked along with protesters Thursday down Ferguson, Mo. streets as law enforcement tried a different tact in dealing with unrest stemming from the police-involved shooting Saturday.

“It means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence,” Johnson, who is black and a native of Ferguson, said at a press conference Thursday as it was announced the highway patrol would take over security operations in the besieged city of some 20,000 people outside St. Louis.

By 5:30 p.m. local time, Johnson was backing up his claim. He walked surrounded by protesters yelling, “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” as they walked to the spot where 18-year-old Michael Brown was gunned down by a Ferguson police officer Saturday afternoon.

“I’ve assigned all police assigned to this detail to take their gas masks off,” Johnson told reporters at the march, {tweeted Wesley Lowery, a Washington Post reporter arrested Wednesday covering the turmoil.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/WesleyLowery""> “I’m not afraid to be in this crowd today, that’s why I walk up front (in the march). Hopefully, (there will) be some healing.”

The fifth day of peaceful protests came after the public criticized the St. Louis County police department’s heavy-handed approach to dealing with masses of residents and media. Several arrests were reported and police — in riot gear, heavily armed and driving SWAT vehicles — used tear gas and smoke bombs to try and disperse crowds around 9 p.m. Wednesday. Images stunned Americans, many of whom chimed in to say the suburban scene was more reminiscent of an overseas war zone.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon promised a new approach Thursday when designating the highway patrol as the lead law enforcement agency in the town.

The change will ensure “we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately,” Nixon said.",NA,3357,NA,NA
NYDailyNews,nydn11,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/darren-wilson-identified-killed-18-year-old-michael-brown-article-1.1904539,"Ferguson cop Darren Wilson didn’t know Michael Brown was robbery suspect at time of shooting, chief admits as teen's backers cry character 'assassination'",Meg Wagner; Joe Kemp; Corky Siemaszko,08/16/2014,02/12/2016,"Backers of a black teenager killed by a Missouri cop accused the officer’s boss Friday of trying to “assassinate” the youth’s character by linking him to a robbery.

Officer Darren Wilson had no idea 18-year-old Michael Brown was a suspected robber when he stopped the teenager and his pal, the chief later admitted.

“They were walking down the middle of the street, blocking traffic, that was it,” said Ferguson, Mo., police chief Thomas Jackson.

The theft of a $48.99 box of Swisher Sweets cigars from a convenience store “had nothing to do with the stop,” the chief said.

The embattled chief dropped that bomb after he identified Wilson by name almost a week after a fatal shooting that sparked several days of rage in the heartland.

Wilson, 28, just happened to be in the area “because he was on a sick case,” he said.

A four-year veteran of the force, Wilson is “a gentlemen, a quiet officer,” the chief said.

Then Jackson released video surveillance footage and a police report that named Brown as a suspect in a “strong-arm” robbery that happened less than an hour before the deadly encounter.

Brown’s supporters immediately cried foul.

“It’s bad enough they assassinated him, and now they’re trying to assassinate his character,” Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump said.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been advising the Brown family, said Jackson was waging a “smear campaign.”

Jackson insisted there was nothing fishy about why he was releasing the evidence against Brown now.

“I’ve been sitting on it,” he said. “I held it for as long as I could.”

Residents of Ferguson, a mostly black suburb of St. Louis that has long been at odds with the town’s mostly white police force, weren’t buying it.

“He stopped the wrong one, bottom line,” Tatinisha Wheeler said at the QuikTrip store that was burned by looters earlier in the week.

Outside, a dozen protesters began marching and chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!”

Capt. Ron Johnson of the state Highway Patrol, who was tapped by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday to restore law and order in Ferguson, said he intended to talk to Jackson about his decision to identify Brown as a robbery suspect on the same day he ID’d Wilson.

“I want to get a clear understanding about why that occurred,” he said.

The surveillance video Jackson released shows a man who bore a resemblance to Brown shoving the store’s clerk and stealing the cigars.

The yellow socks on the suspect in the video appear to match those Brown was wearing when he was killed.

Freeman Bosley, a former St. Louis mayor and the lawyer for Brown’s friend, 22-year-old Dorian Johnson, confirmed the slain teen took the cigars.

“My client did tell us — and told the FBI — that they went into the store,” Bosley said on MSNBC. “He told the FBI that he did take cigarillos. He told that to the DOJ and the St. Louis County Police.”

The whereabouts of Wilson, who witnesses have described as white, was not known but it was believed he left the area long before his name was revealed.

Jackson said Wilson suffered facial injuries in his struggle with Brown that required hospitalization.

Wilson stopped Brown and Johnson a minute after noon Saturday, the police report says.

“After viewing Brown and reviewing this video, I was able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect in this incident,” the report states.

What happened when Wilson caught up to Brown is the subject of a criminal investigation headed by St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch. The officer has not been charged with a crime.

The FBI is also conducting a civil rights probe of the shooting. And the U.S. Department of Justice is monitoring the case.

Jackson maintains Wilson fired after one of the two men shoved him into his police cruiser and went for the officer’s gun.

In the struggle, at least one shot was fired inside the car before the fighting spilled onto the street where Brown was shot multiple times, according to police.

Johnson, who has not been charged with a crime, claims Brown was “shot like an animal” in the back after Wilson ordered them to get on the sidewalk. He said Brown had his hands up in the air and told the cop he was unarmed.

Jackson’s refusal to release Wilson’s name fanned the fury in Ferguson. He said the department had been hit with death threats and that he wanted to protect the officer.

Angry residents said Jackson was trying to protect a bad cop, and they took to the streets.

Ferguson and county cops unleashed a barrage of tear gas and rubber bullets on the demonstrators. They also arrested a pair of reporters covering the mayhem.

Shocked by violence and the arrests of the journalists, President Obama and other officials condemned the clashes.

Nixon ordered local cops to stand down and replaced them Thursday with Johnson and the state troopers — over the objections of McCulloch.

Demonstrators returned to the streets, but there was no repeat of the violence, vandalism and looting that rocked Ferguson on previous nights.

“All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,” demonstrator Pedro Smith said. “This is totally different. Now we’re being treated with respect.”

Meanwhile, state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, a St. Louis Democrat, asked that McCulloch be replaced with a special prosecutor.

“This racially charged climate demands an independent investigation, and to be perfectly blunt, the African-American community has no confidence that your office can carry out an impartial investigation and prosecution,” Nasheed wrote.

The lawmaker cited McCullochs’ decision not the charge police officers accused of killing two unarmed African-American men in 2000.",NA,2678,NA,NA
NYDailyNews,nydn12,http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-ferguson-mo-learn-nypd-howard-safir-article-1.1906084,"Cops in Ferguson, Mo., could learn from NYPD's handling of police misconduct, former police commissioner says",Howard Safir,08/17/2014,02/12/2016,"The deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner once again bring a national focus on the role of police and alleged police misconduct.

While each case has sparked outrage and demands for justice, Ferguson, Mo., has seen riots, looting and the controversial deployment of a militarized police response, and New York has seen angry but peaceful protests. There are reasons for the difference.

As Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s longest-serving police commissioner, I was the city’s top cop during two horrific incidents: the sodomy of Abner Louima and the killing of Amadou Diallo. The Louima case was clear criminal misconduct by a number of officers. The Diallo case was a series of tragic events and misjudgments that led to the killing of an innocent man. I believe that the way we handled both incidents, and the way that the NYPD still deals with these types of events, are among the principal reasons why law and order are maintained when the public is outraged in New York.

While in Ferguson there appears to have been little or no planning for such an event and the Ferguson authorities are thus playing catchup after appearing tone deaf, in New York we have plans and resources in place for rapid and thorough investigation, community outreach and crisis communication.

The human, personal and rapid response by city and police leadership is just as critical. When these incidents occur, the police chief or commissioner and political leader must immediately and personally reach out to the community and the family of the individual killed and assure them that justice will be done -- regardless of whether the facts of the case, when they come out, exonerate or lead to the discipline, dismissal or criminal prosecution of the officers involved.

Giuliani and I visited Louima in the hospital the day after we became aware of the assault. In addition to two human beings in positions of authority visiting a victim, we let Louima know that the NYPD would immediately and effectively respond to the crime.

We aggressively investigated and assisted the prosecutors in seeing that the officers who assaulted Louima were prosecuted and convicted. We helped break the so-called Blue Wall of Silence, and one of the main witnesses in that case was a police officer.

And we also very quickly brought a group of community leaders together and asked them to help us devise a plan to improve police-community relations.

This group included our harshest critics and we worked in conjunction with them and members of all communities participating to ensure that our plans were not cosmetic but substantive to our daily operations. The result was the Courtesy, Professionalism and Respect Program that retrained all of our 41,000 police officers in how to more effectively interact with the diverse public that is serves. As a result, despite high-profile incidents and procedural enhancements making it easier and more efficient to file a civilian complaint, civilian complaints actually went down during my four-year tenure as police commissioner.

The mayor and I attended Diallo’s service at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York. Although we were greeted with hostility at the mosque — primarily by protesters organized by Al Sharpton’s National Action Network — I believe we sent a clear message of our concern for the family.

In the case of Diallo, we also quickly and comprehensively investigated the incident, communicated with the public and facilitated PEACEFUL demonstrations in front of One Plaza that lasted for over six months. We sent a clear message that those only interested in violence, looting and mayhem would be dealt with quickly and decisively. I have not seen that message delivered in Ferguson.

Police Officers must make split second decisions, often in life threatening situations. Most of the time they are right, and the reduction in violent crime over the last 20 years proves that. Where they are wrong and make errors in judgement they should be retrained. Where they commit crimes they must be prosecuted.

The demonstrators gathered in Harlem; Union Square; Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn; and Jamaica, Queens, for a moment of silence at 7 p.m. in support of protesters 1,000 miles away in Ferguson, Mo.

“I’m a parent and grandparent — I could not imagine if that was my child or grandchild,” Toni Arenstein, 64, of Chelsea said in Union Square, of Michael Brown, 18, who was shot to death Saturday by a white cop in Ferguson.

The international hacker collective Anonymous sent out a call on the Internet for a “day of rage” to coincide with a National Moment of Silence across the nation Thursday.

More than 100 rallies were held throughout the country, including protests in Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

The protests came a day after police in riot gear fired tear gas and stun grenades to break up a protest in Ferguson, where some people hurled bottles and Molotov cocktails at officers.

After congregating in Union Square, protesters began marching uptown, collecting supporters along the way. By the time they reached Times Square, demonstrators numbered in the low thousands.

Cops put up barricades on Seventh Ave. and formed a line to stop the crowd from marching north on Broadway.

Five protesters were arrested and charged with resisting arrest, inciting riot, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct, according to the NYPD. Their names had not been released early Friday.

Nearly 200 protesters gathered in Morningside Park in Harlem, where they lit candles to remember victims of police brutality. Among those at the demonstration was Denisha Jingles of Ferguson, Mo.

“That is my home. Seeing what our men go through daily, it’s not fair,” Jingles said. About 300 protesters formed a peaceful circle in Fulton Park in Bedford-Stuyvesant, as cops stood at a distance.

“We have to stand and fight here right now!” one woman screamed as helmeted cops moved in to disperse a demonstration over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Several hundred demonstrators packed the main street in Ferguson, Mo., holding up their hands in surrender pose and chanting “Stand Up! Don’t Shoot!”

A team of officers wearing riot gear and toting shields stood about 100 feet from the protesters.

Just after 9 p.m., cops issued several warnings over a loudspeaker, saying, “You are being ordered to leave now! If you don’t leave peacefully, there will be arrests.”

Someone in the defiant crowd threw a bottle at the police line. Cops responded by firing tear gas canisters and flash grenades that sparked and emitted ear-splitting booms.

“We’re not dogs, so what the hell you’ve got those whipping sticks for?” one man shouted at police. “Because you want to whip us like dogs.”

Another protester pointed his finger at a cop and hollered, “If I’m going to go, I’m taking one of you with me!”

Gunshots were also heard, apparently fired by protesters at the police. One bullet whizzed by the head of a Daily News reporter. Tear gas billowed over W. Florissant Ave., Ferguson’s main drag, where the protesters gathered before sunset.

Police Chief Tom Jackson had suggested a voluntary sundown curfew on protesting after looting and violence followed Saturday’s shooting of Brown.

During the chaos to break up the demonstrations, a reporter for The Washington Post and another for the Huffington Post were briefly placed under arrest when a half-dozen cops stormed a McDonald’s.

“It was tense,” said Wesley Lowery, the Washington Post reporter who was detained, adding that police slammed him against a soda machine and slapped plastic cuffs on him. Lowery and Ryan Reilly, the Huffington Post reporter, were both released without being charged.

Earlier Wednesday, protesters gathered in front of the QuickTrip on W. Florissant, a store that was looted and set ablaze on Sunday.

“The whole damn system is guilty as hell!” the crowd chanted at cops standing behind their shields. SWAT officers stood atop two armored vehicles and pointed .40-caliber automatic weapons mounted on tripods at the demonstrators.

The tense standoff came after a hacker collective posted recordings of police radio chatter in the moments after Brown’s death on the Web on Wednesday.

Moments after the unidentified Ferguson cop killed Brown, a county police dispatcher reported an urgent request from an officer in trouble.

“Need assistance with crowd control,” she said in the recordings. A short time time later, the dispatcher reported an “officer-involved shooting” but added, “Be advised. This information came from the news.”

Thirty minutes later, it was all hands on deck.

“Attention, all cars. Be advised we are switching over to the riot channel,” she said.

The apparent confusion was revealed in recordings that Anonymous obtained and posted Wednesday. The effort is part of the hacker group’s “Operation Ferguson” to make sure that Brown’s death is investigated.

The group is also trying to unmask the white officer who fired the fatal shots. Chief Jackson has refused to identify the cop because of threats against his life.

The tapes were unveiled on the same day that Brown’s pal Dorian Johnson — who claims the teen was “shot like an animal” after the cop told him to get on the sidewalk — met with police and FBI investigators.

Johnson said the cop grabbed Brown around the neck and tried to pull him through the window of his cruiser.

“He says, ‘I’ll shoot,’” said Johnson. “A second later, the gun went off and he let go. That’s how we were able to run at the same time.”

Johnson said he ducked behind a car, but one of the officer’s shots hit Brown in the back.

“My friend started to tell the officer that he was unarmed and that he could stop shooting. Before he could get his second sentence out, the officer fired several more shots into his head and chest area.

What prompted the Ferguson officer to open fire wasn’t immediately clear.

Multiple witnesses told KMOV that Brown was unarmed and had his hands up in the air when he was cut down.

The officer “shot again and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air,” said witness Dorian Johnson. “He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.”

“Please don’t shoot me,” they hollered. “Please don’t shoot me.”

Dozens of officers, backed by a SWAT vehicle, moved in as the crowd swelled.

Louis Head, Brown's stepfather, held a sign that said: ""Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!”

“I think I got their trust and I’ll do everything to maintain that trust,” Johnson said Thursday night.

And he vowed to a celebratory crowd: “The gas masks are off. Won’t come back.”

As part of the new openness, Ferguson police officials plan to release the name Friday of the officer who shot Brown, according to a report.

Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the county police, defended Wednesday’s use of tear gas, stun grenades, rubber bullets, and other hardware they’ve gotten from the Pentagon to keep protesters in line.

“In talking to these guys, it is scary,” Schellman said of the officers. “They hear gunshots going off, and they don’t know where they’re coming from.”

But Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said, “We need to demilitarize this situation.”

Nixon’s move came after President Obama said he was “deeply disturbed” by the chaos in the St. Louis suburb.

“I know that emotions are raw in Ferguson,” he said. “But let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.”

Obama condemned attacks by demonstrators on police trying to maintain order in the tense town. But he added there was “no excuse” for police to use excessive force against demonstrators — or for cops to be “arresting journalists for trying to do their jobs.”

The President was referring to the arrests of reporters from The Washington Post and Huffington Post who were detained briefly Wednesday by a half-dozen cops who stormed a McDonald’s for reasons still unclear.

In New York, Mayor de Blasio said he was “troubled” by the violence in Ferguson. Noting the lack of disturbances after a Staten Island dad was killed July 17 when a cop used a chokehold, the mayor said New York has the tradition “of respecting and properly managing peaceful protest.”

“I’m not an expert on Missouri, but we have a very different reality here,” he said.

The mayor spoke out after the hacker collective Anonymous posted the name of an officer the group blames for Brown’s death. The Daily News did not publish it because there has been no official confirmation that it’s accurate.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson has steadfastly refused to release the name of the cop — a six-year veteran witnesses have described as white — citing death threats as the reason.

Jackson’s decision, however, has incensed Ferguson residents who charge the officer is benefiting from a double standard. They suspect the chief is protecting a “bad cop.”

The ACLU on Thursday filed a suit demanding that the St. Louis County Police release the incident report of Saturday’s shooting.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been consoling the Brown family and is planning a rally Sunday in Missouri, called on the Justice Department to monitor the way police are handling the crisis.

“Even if we disagree, this climate is not good for anyone and is dangerous for everyone,” Sharpton said in a statement.

The chaos in Ferguson may not be over any time soon. St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch has warned it could be several weeks before the investigation wraps up and authorities decide whether to charge the officer.

The FBI has also launched a civil rights investigation into the killing. And the Brown family has asked for a second autopsy — this one monitored by the Justice Department.

Ferguson continued to be a war zone Thursday. As night fell, protesters once again began to gather. It remained to be seen whether there would be a repeat of Wednesday’s chaos, during which cops in riot gear clashed with hundreds of angry demonstrators, some of them hurling bottles and Molotov cocktails.

Jackson has maintained the cop shot Brown after he or Dorian Johnson, a friend he was walking in the street with, went for his gun. He said the officer was hospitalized with facial wounds. But he has also acknowledged there is no video footage of the shooting.

Johnson claims his pal was “shot like an animal” after the cop told him to get on the sidewalk. Johnson said the cop struggled with Brown and shot him in the back. As Brown tried to say he was unarmed, Johnson said, the officer fired more shots into his head and chest.",NA,577,NA,NA

Both are tall and slightly heavyset black teenagers from Ferguson, Mo., on the outskirts of St. Louis.

But Randolph is quick to answer how he would like to be described: ""As a human being,"" he said.

""He reminds me of myself,"" he reflected in the home he shares with his grandmother and extended family, a week after the shooting and as neighborhood protests continued. ""It could have been me. It could have been my cousins. Because we walk down that street every single day.""

Brown was fatally shot on a Ferguson street last week by Police Officer Darren Wilson, who was identified by name for the first time Friday. Police also said Brown was a suspect in a convenience store robbery that happened less than an hour before the encounter with Wilson, but Police Chief Thomas Jackson later said the officer didn't know about the robbery when he stopped Brown and a friend for allegedly blocking traffic.

Witnesses have said the teenager was unarmed and was holding his hands up when he was shot up to eight times.

Protests have erupted in the town of 21,000 people in the days since Brown's death, prompting an officer from the state's Highway Patrol to take over security operations after local police were criticized for their handling of tense clashes with demonstrators.

Since the protests began, Kenneth Randolph has been walking the mile from his house to the QuikTrip convenience store — which was burned and looted Sunday and serves as a base for media and activists — often joined by his cousins. Like many community members, he calls for police reform, and he labels Brown's death murder.

""People have their different ways to reacting to certain things,"" he said. ""Some people pray, some people assemble, and some people go and take action. I'm the type to pray and the type to assemble. But I will not retaliate. I think it gets us nowhere.""",NA,201,NA,NA

Obama has been involved in other high-profile cases with racial overtones: the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watchman and the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates.

MICHAEL BROWN

In the wake of the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, police from multiple departments in riot gear and with military equipment have clashed with protesters nightly. In his first public comments on the case, Obama said there is ""never an excuse"" for violence against police and similarly ""no excuse"" for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to jail protesters for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.

TRAYVON MARTIN

After the unarmed teenager was shot on a rainy night in February 2012 in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., Obama said ""this could have been my son."" A jury acquitted neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman of all charges in the shooting of 17-year-old. Obama said after the verdict that ""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago."" The case led Obama to deliver an extensive reflection on race that was all the more notable because it came from a president who largely has avoided tackling the issue, even as he is dogged by it.

HENRY LOUIS GATES

In July 2009 Obama said police in Cambridge, Mass., had ""acted stupidly"" by arresting the black Harvard professor in his own home after investigating a reported burglary. Amid criticism from police officers and others, Obama said he should have used different words. He then brought Gates and the arresting officer, Sgt. James Crowley, who is white, to the White House for a beer in the Rose Garden.",NA,57,NA,NA
NYDailyNews,nydn22,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/hamill-people-ferguson-justice-article-1.1904440,"Hamill: To the people of Ferguson, justice is not about black or white",Denis Hamill,08/15/2014,02/15/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The two women were friends from work. Laura, 27, is white, and Kat, 23, is black, and they came to Ferguson from their jobs at Half and Half in downtown St. Louis on Thursday evening to protest peacefully for justice.

“We want the name of the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown when he had his hands up in the air released,” says Kat, referring to the Saturday killing of an 18-year-old black man that led to protests, looting and police tear-gassing protesters.

“Then we want him arrested,” says Laura.

A magenta sun descended over this normally tranquil community of single-family homes and manicured lawns, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black and the immaculate winding streets are patrolled by a 53-member police force — of which only three officers are black. The loud horns of passing traffic began to blare on Ferguson’s main drag, Florissant Ave.

“Most of the young white people I know in St. Louis are as outraged as the black community,” says Laura. “The racism here is from the police.”

“And when people came to protest (Wednesday), the same police force that killed Michael Brown fired tear gas into the crowd,” says Kat. “It looked like a scene from Baghdad. Plus, after they kill Michael Brown, they search all of his social media postings and post only those shots that portray him as some sort of hoodlum. We want justice.”

“Justice has no color,” says Laura.

On Florissant, a caravan of horn-honking cars proceeded up to Greater St. Mark’s Baptist Church for a rally, and a stream of protesters held their hands up the way they said Michael Brown did on the day he was shot. As they passed the boarded-up fast food joints and auto parts stores, they chanted “No justice! No peace!”

Standing on the sidewalk near Nesbit Drive, Joetta Umana watched with her neighbor Jewel Washington.

“I have lived in Ferguson for 21 years,” says Umana. “I have never seen anything like ... Wednesday night, when police fired the tear gas. They told us to go indoors. One said to me, ‘Why do you want to be out anyway?’ I told him because I live here and Michael Brown lived a block away.""

“The only time I ever saw anything like this was when I was a schoolgirl in Alabama, when Rev. Martin Luther King was marching,” she says. “They attacked his marches with fire hoses and dogs and tear gas, too. But that was 1965 in Alabama. This is 2014 in St. Louis. It’s outrageous. They made us prisoners in our own homes.”

“That tear gas really stung the eyes and made you choke really bad,” says Umana.

“I’m against the violent ones, the looters,” says Washington. “I bring my car to the auto mechanic whose window they broke. I shop at the Quik Stop. But that was Monday and Tuesday. (Wednesday) night they were peaceful, and then they used the tear gas. It was terrible. I had my 30-year-old grandson at my house, I wouldn’t let him go outside. You can lose a son or a grandson.”

In 2014, with the first black President two years into his second term, suddenly Ferguson, Mo., becomes the new Selma. Umana and Washington agree Obama could never have won without tens of millions of whites voting for him.

“That’s true,” says Umana. “But it only takes a few, a handful, to ignite the racism again.”

“I lived here 21 years, too, and I never knew that Ferguson only has three black officers,” says Washington. “Now that just isn't right.”

By night’s end, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson had taken over Ferguson security, ordered cops to bag the gas masks, and then marched with the protestors. Authorities also said they would release the name of the cop who killed Michael Brown.

This helped ease tensions. But it didn’t end them.

On Nesbit Drive, Kat and Laura walked toward their car to go to another rally in Smith Square in downtown St. Louis. There, young people, black and white, many from George Washington University, would be signing a petition asking for justice in the Michael Brown case.

“It’s not about black and white,” says Kat.

“It’s about police abusing their power,” Laura says as the women head downtown, with night falling like a shiver across Ferguson.",NA,26,NA,NA
NYDailyNews,nydn23,http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ferguson-glass-darkly-article-1.1908084,"Ferguson, through a glass darkly",Harry Siegel,08/18/2014,02/15/2016,"The glossy pictures and gritty livestreams of the post-apocalyptic night battles in Ferguson, Mo. — where the national press has parachuted in to cover the heavy-handed, to say the least, police response to the protests sparked after a cop shot an unarmed teen — are both horrifying and familiar.

The protesters — most of them peaceful, a minority of them decidedly not — squaring off after dark against heavily armed agents of the state look a lot like those in Tahrir Square, Gezi Park, Zuccotti Park (which I covered for months) and on and on.

The connection clicked when I saw that Tim Pool, who made his bones as the guy with a camera strapped to his head covering Occupy Wall Street is in Ferguson now for Vice, streaming the action there.

This is, apparently, what street protest looks like now. And it looks much the same regardless of the underlying issue. It’s captivating to see in real time, but often sheds more heat than light.

I haven’t written about the killing of Michael Brown, and I’m not going to now, because I’m in New York City, and won’t pretend to be an expert on policing or race relations in a town in a state I’ve never set foot in. Because authorities have tried to hold off on even such basic things as the officer’s name and how many shots were fired, the facts are still emerging. From what’s known, the police have a lot to account for.

What I can say is that in an era of ubiquitous cameras and instant posting, the cost of state violence has gone up as more of it is captured on camera (see: Eric Garner).

Those who believe policing is inherently racist, oppressive or both have many more compelling images to make that case than they did even 10 years ago. And for better and worse, the mainstream media no longer controls whether or not graphic violence is seen, or in what context (see: Israel).

In this new era of images, the same backdrops and scenes keep repeating, as the players — elected officials, police, protesters, activists, anarchists and journalists — test tactics on one another, in a all-ways game of cat-and-mouse. It remains to be seen if these conflict images will hold their power as they become more common sights.

Covering Occupy, it was difficult not to get caught up in the urgency and intensity of each faceoff with the NYPD, as rumors flew fast and furious and the threat of police violence loomed large. In my weeks there, I was cursed at, hit with fists and sticks, knocked down, threatened with arrest and, along with the harmless people I was writing about, chased around the city by a helicopter , my feet bleeding.

Throughout, reporters and activists alike were drawn to chaos and conflict, which paid off in striking imagery, social media and press attention and other forms of cred.

The more transactional forms of this — writer Keith Gessen squeezing a 6,000-word New Yorker screed from a 32-hour arrest — were obvious, but many were not, as the line between reporting and propaganda thinned and smeared. And that line meant little to the police, who treated reporters as protesters and protesters as criminals.

The police are doing that now in Ferguson, where President Obama himself has twice reminded them to respect the press, who they have been arresting, intimidating and otherwise trying to discourage in ways that only bring on more coverage. In fact, it was the brief arrest of two Washington reporters that turned mostly black protests in a mostly black town from a story to the story.

The reporters there mostly come out at night, even as most of the protesters go home. Yes, the remaining ones facing off with militarized cops and now the National Guard warrant coverage. But a lot gets missed when everyone keys in on dramatic scenes of unrest porn (which the police have been all too happy to help provide).

“What was very different is that very few people lived near Zuccotti,” said Guardian columnist Steven Thrasher, who’s just back from Ferguson and who I covered Occupy with in 2011 for the Village Voice. “In Ferguson many people were out because this is where they live” — including children there because school was cancelled — “they weren’t pilgrimaging to it.” And, of course, many more of the protesters here are black.

“I think it’s important to see these men fighting for their right to be out — but there are people who enjoy seeing on their TV angry young black men fighting on the streets,” he said. “What’s not being seen is the black mothers and college students out each day distributing drink and food, the families and men protesting silently for the most part.”

As dusk falls, you see “a lot of teenagers and young men come out, and some older women still walking around with water, trying to encourage them to leave.”

“When tragedies happen,” he said, “you usually see lots of reporters talking to children about the trauma, but not here. Young boys and girls are taking all this in, many with a lot of fear. ”

When the press moves on, they’ll still be there. If only that made for a better story.",NA,121,NA,NA

Raymond Kelly said violence rocking Ferguson, Mo., might have been avoided if local law enforcement had starting releasing details earlier about the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

“Right now, it feels as though the young man had no weapon — he was shot six times — and the officer is being protected by other officers,” said Cedric Antonio Kyles, better known as Cedric the Entertainer.

Cedric, who was born in Jefferson City and grew up not far from Ferguson in Caruthersville, told CNN that local law enforcement fanned the anger by not arresting Officer Darren Wilson for killing 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9.

“Why can't they get to the results or to the bottom line of this nine, 10 days later?” he said. “If this was a regular citizen, and they knew exactly who it was, he would have been arrested immediately.”

Cedric said he feels for the Brown family because he has a 13-year-old son who is likely to find himself dealing with white police officers at some point in his life.

“Even if you comply, that person still has the right — or feels he has the right — to dictate his authority any way he pleases at any time,” he said.

Cedric gave a shout-out of support to his friend, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who has been struggling to quash the violence that has rocked the St. Louis suburb for more than a week.

Jay Nixon deployed the National Guard to try to keep peace in tense St. Louis suburb Ferguson, which has been ravaged by protests and rioting in the days since a white police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, an allegedly unarmed black teenager.

It might have seemed an extreme move to deploy military personnel to that volatile situation, but governors in the U.S. have a long history of summoning the National Guard to help quell significant local emergencies.

In Ferguson, the National Guard was brought in only after security in Ferguson continued to deteriorate. At first, St. Louis County Police were charged with maintaining order. But their militarized response of aggressive tactics and heavy weaponry further angered not only local residents, but also people across the nation who were monitoring the situation.

Nixon then charged the Missouri State Highway Patrol to lead efforts to maintain the peace in the torn suburb. But after just a few days of relative improvement, chaos again broke out, prompting the embattled governor to play his only remaining card: bringing in the National Guard.

And on Monday, Nixon did exactly that, deploying Missouri Guardsmen from the state's reserve to help protect the police command posts.

The move represented one of the only real actions Nixon could take to personally improve the security in Ferguson, military affairs expert Jim Craig explained.

""A governor who wants to act doesn't have a lot of other tools at his disposal,"" said Craig, an associate professor of military and veterans studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel. ""But one he does have, to demonstrate that 'this is important,' 'this needs to get better,' is the National Guard.""

The National Guard, a collection of reserve military units controlled by each state and a handful of U.S. territories, is a valuable resource for many governors because Guard soldiers are not just well trained in security and policing, but also have the ability to help orchestrate natural disaster relief missions, Craig said.

As a result, governors across the nation have increasingly relied for domestic missions on Guard units, which are, at their core, state units, but can also be deployed domestically by the President  — although this is rare.

In just the past few weeks, the National Guard was deployed in Hawaii by Gov. Neil Abercrombie to provide security after a slew of tropical storms left thousands of residents without power; and in Texas, where Gov. Rick Perry sent 1,000 troops to the Mexico border to help state law enforcement tighten border security.

In neither situation, as is the case in Ferguson, did the Guard have arrest powers.

Nevertheless, it's always a significant development for the National Guard to become involved in local affairs, especially for a civil disturbance.

""You can think of the big ones — especially Katrina. It just doesn't happen that often for the Guard to be called up for a domestic purpose,"" Craig said, alluding to some of the more infamous occasions Guardsmen have been called upon for help.

In 2005, then-Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco deployed the Louisiana National Guard to respond to the deteriorating security situation in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina — one of the largest deployments in recent years.

Many high profile deployments, however, have suggested that a fairly obvious relationship exists in the U.S. between National Guard involvement and poor race relations.

In 1968, for example, multiple state governors summoned the National Guard to help quell rioting that broke out across the U.S. after Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.

In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson called in the Alabama National Guard to help allow civil rights protesters peacefully march from Selma to Montgomery after their earlier attempts were violently quashed by state troopers.

And in 1992, the last time the National Guard was federalized by a president, George H.W. Bush deployed California National Guardsmen to keep order in Los Angeles after the Rodney King riots broke out.",NA,32,NA,NA

The video alleged that after Brown was shot and killed Saturday, police officers refused to move his body for 15 hours.

""The police have clearly crossed a line in the sand,"" the video's robotic narrator said.

The hacking group called on Missouri's government to enact laws mandating proper police conduct and limiting unchecked power.

The violent street protests started after Brown was killed Saturday while walking home with his friend Dorian Johnson. An officer pulled up next to the two and demanded they ""get the f--k on the sidewalk,"" Johnson told MSNBC.

When the friends continued walking, the officer got out of his car and grabbed Brown's neck. As Brown tried to struggle away, the officer pulled a gun and shot the teen, Johnson claimed. The cop fired more fatal shots as the two unarmed friends tried to run away, he said.

The Ferguson Police Department was scheduled to release the name of the officer involved in Brown's death Tuesday, but pushed back identifying the cop due to threats against the department, such as the Anonymous video.

“I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,” a grieving Lesley McSpadden said Sunday.

McSpadden hired Florida attorney Benjamin Crump, who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed teen whose death at the hands of a neighborhood watchman shocked the nation, a spokesman for the lawyer told the Daily News.

The family’s outrage and the hiring of a high-profile lawyer came as police defended themselves on Sunday.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the officer was attacked after he encountered Brown and another person Saturday afternoon in front of an apartment complex in Ferguson, Mo.

As the unnamed cop exited his squad car, one of the men pushed him back inside, where there was a struggle over the officer’s weapon, Belmar said. At least one shot was fired in the car, hitting no one.

The cop jumped out of his car and gave chase, striking Brown “more than a couple times” about 35 feet from the car, Belmar said.

All of the shell casings at the scene matched bullets from the officer’s gun, Belmar said.

“The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,” he said, adding it is unclear which of the men was struggling with the cop.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the second person with Brown has not been arrested or charged.

As the law enforcement officials addressed the media at a local firehouse, hundreds of protesters chanted outside, “Don’t shoot!” Later, some marched inside the adjacent police building.

Following a vigil, some looting and vandalism broke out in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb. Several dozen protesters faced off with police in riot gear.

A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he had instructed lawyers in the department’s Civil Rights Division to monitor developments in the case.

And the Rev. Al Sharpton announced that he planned to visit the area at the request of Brown’s family to ensure a fair investigation.

Relatives continued to express disbelief at the killing.

“My grandson never even got into a fight,” said grandmother Desiree Harris. “He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.”

Local news reports said Brown was set to start college Monday.

“My son just turned 18 and graduated high school, he didn’t bother nobody,” the distraught McSpadden told KSDK, a St. Louis station. ",NA,806,NA,NA

Members of {Middle Collegiate Church}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/MiddleCollegiateChurch/timeline""> assembled at the church’s altar Sunday morning, lifting their hands in the same gesture of surrender that witnesses say Brown assumed before he was hit by six bullets March 9.

“We surrender but we do not give up,” {prayed Rev. Adriene Thorne}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzXFggVvA6U&feature=youtu.be""> during the church’s demonstration of “faithful disobedience.”

Thorne also prayed for the safety of the young black men who are members of congregation.

“We pray ... that we will not read in the paper one more week of one more brown child being shot,” Thorne said.

Centuries before the gesture became a symbol of racial tensions in Ferguson, the orans position was actually an ancient gesture of prayer. It is still used in the liturgies of some Catholic or Orthodox churches. Charismatic churches also use the gesture as a sign of supplication towards God.

Senior Minister Rev. Dr. Jacqui Lewis says she believes faith communities have an important role to play in racial reconciliation.

“At the core of almost every major religion is the sense of peace-making,” Lewis told The News. “It is an important part of our faith practice.”

Lewis hopes that demonstrations like this will lead to more investigation and clarity about what exactly caused Brown’s shooting.

“We are calling for people of faith to peaceably protest until the officer in question is suspended, a thorough investigation is conducted, and Michael Brown’s death is explained,” Lewis said.

In the past, Middle Collegiate Church has posed in hoodies to protest Trayvon Martin’s shooting. They have also turned guns into garden tools to speak out against gun violence.",NA,20,NA,NA
NYDailyNews,nydn32,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/expert-police-response-ferguson-long-impact-article-1.1904489,Expert: Police response in Ferguson will affect community for years,Eugene O'donnell,08/15/2014,02/17/2016,"Many of the most tragic riots in American history have taken place in the aftermath of a police encounter with a citizen. And a very poor relationship between the police and the community makes the task of restoring order more difficult as police credibility and trust are in limited supply.

The insertion of the state police into Ferguson, Mo., is based on the complete meltdown that town has suffered in its relationship with the ordinary patrol cops. It is also likely that state police have better training and experience at crowd and disorder control. Of course, there is always a risk sending a group of officers into a community in which the police are unmoored.

When disorder erupts, there is no police department in the country that can claim an unblemished record. Former NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly was excoriated for what some saw as over-the-top policing of the 2004 Republican convention protesters, while then-LAPD Chief Bill Bratton’s officers were accused of doing too little too late at a MacArthur Park rally. And these are two of the nation’s premier departments — far more experienced than Ferguson’s 53 cops.

It is typically necessary to demonstrate a zero-tolerance approach to acts of violence and acts of looting. At the same time, people need to be able to say what they want to, including criticizing the police. Getting demonstration and looting responses right will have an impact on police community relationships in years to come. There is a dilemma for the police in coming on too strong, especially using armored personnel carriers and SWAT teams. But similarly, the police cannot be paralyzed in the midst of this turbulence: That could further cost lives and hurt the well-being of innocent residents and business people.",NA,17,NA,NA
NYDailyNews,nydn33,http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sharpton-seeks-justice-missouri-shooting-article-1.1901597,Rev. Al Sharpton on trail of justice in Missouri shooting,Juan Gonzalez,08/13/2014,02/17/2016,"Al Sharpton has seen the same tragic tale so many times over the decades he could recite the entire sequence from memory:

It always begins with an unarmed black or Hispanic male killed by cops during an arrest for some minor infraction.

Which is why Sharpton on Tuesday was in Ferguson, Mo., the St. Louis suburb rocked by angry protests and minor looting last weekend after local cops shot to death an 18-year-old black man they had stopped for walking in the street.

The dead teen, Michael Brown, was scheduled to start college this week. The unarmed Brown assaulted an officer, cops say, a version several witnesses dispute.

There was no video here, like there was when Eric Garner died July 17 on Staten Island. That footage captured Garner being asphyxiated from an illegal chokehold by one of several cops arresting him for peddling loose cigarettes.

Sharpton went to Missouri at the request of Brown’s parents, to give national voice to the rage of Ferguson’s black community. Left unsaid was how his presence could also channel that rage into peaceful cries for justice.

His trip came only days after he changed plans for a big Aug. 23 civil rights march over the Verrazano Bridge to demand that the cop who fatally choked Garner, Officer Daniel Pantaleo, be indicted for homicide.

After vowing to lead thousands in a marathon walk over the Verrazano, Sharpton switched instead to a bus and car caravan, with a much shorter march to the site of Garner’s death.

Some news reports claim the reverend caved to pressure from Gov. Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio. But several sources in the coalition of civil rights and labor groups co-sponsoring the march say it was the unions, especially 1199 SEIU, that persuaded Sharpton to modify his plan.

“It would have been a logistical nightmare to walk over that bridge,” one union leader said.

Sharpton realized the controversy was becoming a diversion.

“Some people were trying to make the issue whether we walked or rode across the bridge,” Sharpton told me, “instead of focusing on Eric Garner.”

The kind of senseless police crackdown on blacks and Hispanics that ended in Garner’s death is what de Blasio vowed to end as a mayoral candidate. To his credit, the mayor has reformed stop-and-frisk policies and welcomed stronger oversight of policing practices.

But his police commissioner, Bill Bratton, still clings to a policy of constant arrests in minority communities for quality-of-life crimes. During Bratton’s first six months, the NYPD arrested 117,336 people for misdemeanors, nearly 90% of them black and Latino, according to a study the nonprofit Police Reform Organizing Project released this week.

That’s up slightly from the 117,104 misdemeanor arrests in the same period last year under former Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.

Even for misdemeanor marijuana possession, nearly 90% of those arrested are black and Hispanic. Who in their right mind believes white youth don’t smoke marijuana?

“They seem to believe a kid in the South Bronx who smokes marijuana will grow up to be a criminal, but a kid who does it in SoHo or Columbia University, it’s just recreational use,” Sharpton said.

Stop-and-frisk may have been “reformed,” but racial profiling persists. That is why Sharpton will march on Staten Island on Aug. 23. And why the family of Michael Brown is now expected to come from Missouri to join the protest.",NA,204,NA,NA

Steve King,Victoria Johnson,08/14/2014,02/17/2016,"U.S. Representative Steve King said the African-American community should “settle down” and “straighten up and fly right,” after protests, riots and mourning ensued in wake of an unarmed black teenager who was fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson.

King {also told the conservative news website, Newsmax,}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nApmxuOJlY#t=15""} that he “rejects race-based politics,” and that doesn't see the need to discuss the concern of racial profiling by the Congressional Black Caucus.

“I've seen the video. It looks to me like you don't need to bother with that particular factor (racial profiling) because they're all appear to be of a single origin,” King said during the four-minute interview on Newsmax. “I think we are all God's children and we should be held to the same standard and the same level of behavior.”

The Iowa Republican, known for his outrageous rhetoric, also criticized President Obama's response to the crisis in Ferguson.

“The President should just be the moral leader at this point and call out the community to settle down,"" King said. ""I'm not hearing that happen.”

King, who called the situation ""pretty close to anarchy,"" also mentioned a video he saw on Twitter that he ""thought was a good message.""

""He called upon them all to settle down and said 'I'm getting tired of this. I'm tired of you burning down our communities, my communities' and essentially said straighten up and fly right,"" said the video King attributed to an African-American man.

J.D. Hayworth, the host and interviewer in the Newsmax video, noted that the gun store and tattoo parlor had not been damaged in the midst of the looting, and King was willing to offer his theory on why.

“They're not going to loot the gun store because there's someone in there with one,” King continued. “I'm not sure why they're not looting the tattoo parlor except that might have some of the strongest, friendliest relationships there.”

During the interview King never referenced, Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager whose death sparked the anger and protests in the Ferguson community nor was there a mention of the militarized-style tactics — such as tear gas — used by the police on Missouri residents and journalists.

Brown, 18, was he was shot and killed by a police officer on Saturday. A witness in the case told local media that Brown raised his arms to police to show that he was unarmed before he was killed. Police say there was struggle for a gun that was in the police car before the officer shot Brown.

In a statement on Thursday, President Obama said “there is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,” and that “there's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.”",NA,53,NA,NA

The chief of the Ferguson Police Department opted Tuesday not to release the officer’s name after the department was deluged with death threats.

“If we come out and say ‘it was this officer,’ then he immediately becomes a target,” Chief Tom Jackson said. “We’re taking the threats seriously.”

Jackson did not delve into the details of the threats against the six-year veteran who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown on Saturday — and who is now on paid administrative leave.

But the chief spoke out after Ferguson was rocked by another night of violent protests — and after some 100 demonstrators marched on the St. Louis County courthouse Tuesday chanting “Hands up! Don’t shoot!”

Witnesses have said that Brown was holding his hands up in surrender when he was shot. And the Browns’ family lawyer said the teenager was shot up to eight times.

“I don’t want to sugarcoat it,” said Benjamin Crump. “He was executed in broad daylight.”

Meanwhile, President Obama weighed-in with condolences and calls for peace in the mostly black town.

“I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,” he said in a statement. “We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.”

While the Rev. Al Sharpton was in Ferguson meeting with Brown’s parents, the FBI launched a civil rights investigation.

The U.S. Department of Justice is also monitoring a case that Brown supporters have likened to that of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teen who was killed by a security guard in an Orlando, Fla.-area housing development.

Crump also represented the Martin’s parents.

Brown, who was supposed to start college this week, was walking to his grandmother’s home with pal Dorian Johnson when they ran into the police officer.

In their initial report, police said the officer opened fire when one of the teens pushed him into his cruiser and went for his gun.

Johnson told MSNBC and other news outlets a different story. He said the white officer drove up to them and barked, “Get the f--k on the sidewalk!”

When the friends continued walking, the officer got out of his car and grabbed Brown’s neck, Johnson said. And as Brown tried to struggle away, the officer drew his gun and shot the teen.

“I saw the barrel of the gun pointed at my friend,” he said. “Then I saw the fire come out of the barrel.”

Johnson said when they tried to run, the cop fired again.

Brown threw his hands up, and yelled, “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!” Johnson said.

Another witness, Phillip Walker, told the Associated Press he was on his porch and said Brown was killed by a white officer as he “was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued.”",NA,134,NA,NA

NYDailyNews,nydn37,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/hamill-michael-brown-famous-wrong-reasons-article-1.1905509,Hamill: Michael Brown is famous for all the wrong reasons,Denis Hamill,08/15/2014,02/17/2016,"FERGUSON, MO. — Joanna Gary parked her red Toyota Corolla on Canfield Drive and walked in the morning sunshine to a sidewalk memorial to her cousin Michael Brown, 18, who was killed by Police Officer Darren Wilson six days earlier.

“I came to say a prayer for him,” she says, standing over a mound of votive candles, floral bouquets and Teddy bears. “I know he went straight home to God. He was a quiet, very caring guy. He loved his music. Mike didn’t talk much. He expressed himself in his rap music. He recorded his songs in his grandmother’s house just up the block. Otherwise, he was kinda shy, always took a step back before talking.”

The description didn’t match the intimidating man in the red St. Louis Cardinals baseball hat, white T-shirt and khaki shorts on a convenience store surveillance tape strong-arming a much smaller storekeeper as he marches off with a box of cigars. That tape was released by Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson only a half-hour earlier at a press conference, claiming the robber was Michael Brown.

Jackson also identified 28-year-old Darren Wilson as the cop who shot and killed Brown.

“I think the timing is a little bit suspicious,” says Joanna Gary. “The Ferguson police refused to name the cop for a week. Then they release this video the same day they release the cop’s name. The day after Capt. (Ron) Johnson of the highway patrol, who is black, took over command from Chief Jackson, who is white? That doesn’t smell right.”

Capt. Johnson, who assumed state police control of security in Ferguson on Thursday night, would say later that Chief Jackson never gave him the courtesy of consulting him before releasing the robbery video.

Richard Davis, 27, says cops had other options.

“I heard the gunshots that night,” Davis says. “I live across Canfield, up the block, and I heard pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Six at least. Now look, Michael Brown was a big black man, like me, and many people might have been intimidated by his size. If that’s him in the video, what he did was wrong. But if you stop him, and he’s unarmed, you can tase him, handcuff him, arrest him, bring him before a judge. No way should an unarmed man be shot dead over a box of cigars.”

According to Chief Jackson, Wilson didn’t even know about the cigar robbery when he stopped Brown for blocking traffic on the street where he lived in this town of 21,000.

Somehow that simple pedestrian traffic stop ended with Wilson shooting an unarmed teenager dead in a fusillade of police bullets.

“I was in my car with my husband and my three kids coming up Canfield Drive that night,” says Casey Fielder, 25, pushing her three daughters all under age 4 in a big wide stroller. She pauses outside Brown’s grandmother’s house, posted with a sign: “Privacy Please.”

“We were the first car stopped by other cops who’d rushed to the scene,” she says. “Michael Brown lay there in the street, blood gushing from his head and body. My husband and I were horrified. We shielded the kids’ eyes.”

She said her husband, who like her is white, later wondered aloud if he would have been shot dead if he’d been unarmed when stopped by a white cop.

“We both said ‘no,’ ” she says. “That’s why I marched with our neighbors against this excessive-force killing.”

At his memorial, a steady stream of locals came to lay flowers and say prayers for Brown.

“I have this theory that this cop who killed Mike must have had a bad day in his personal life,” says Joanna Gary, his cousin. “And he took it out on Mike. Because that’s no way to kill someone. When his hands are up. Unarmed. Shoot him maybe eight or 10 times. Crazy.”

She walked to her red Corolla, the back window scrawled with a message: “RIP Mike, Gone Too Soon, Love You.”

“Two days earlier Mike asked me for a ride like he always did and told me that the world would soon know his name,” Gary says. “That his mom and grandmother would never have to worry about money again. He meant from his music. Two days later he was shot dead by this cop. Now the whole world knows about Michael Brown.”",NA,470,NA,NA

Bringing in the big guns, quite literally, after that, and pointing them at residents and reporters, was unacceptable.

Yet it took six days for Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to take command from the local police departments that have made the inner-ring St. Louis suburb look and feel like a war zone.

And that long for President Obama to pull himself away from his vacation and say that the FBI and Department of Justice were looking into Brown’s killing, and to ask for calm and restraint on all sides.

Yes, a handful of protesters have behaved badly, with looting on one night and a very few throwing flaming bottles at the police. Inexcusable.

Still, no officer has been badly hurt and the response — resembling something out of a bad action movie, and including a clampdown on peaceful protest — has been wholly out of proportion.

Cops have pointed sniper rifles at citizens with their hands up, as witnesses said 18-year-old Michael Brown’s were when he was gunned down. No. That is the surest way to inflame a crowd, not calm it.

They have arrested reporters trying to report the news — on charges of “loitering” at a McDonald’s. Fired tear gas and rubber bullets with little evident provocation and in residential neighborhoods. Used loudspeakers to order people to stop filming these acts.

No, no, no.

Those convinced of the perfidy of police officers have seized on it all to cry out that cops writ large are racist and running amok.

Wrong. New York City police, the numbers tell us, have grown increasingly restrained in firing their weapons or otherwise using deadly force.

The terrible tragedy of Eric Garner’s death doesn’t change that fact.

They also really ought to compare the Missouri mess to the official response to Garner’s killing, in which the officer was quickly named and suspended and now will have the due process he is entitled to, and where citizens exercising their rights to protest have been treated with the respect they deserve.

Said New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton this week, speaking about police shootings: “They will never go away; that’s the nature of our lives, unfortunately. The idea is how you prevent them from happening and how you deal with them when do occur.”

The agency announced it was investigating the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown a day after what was supposed to be a peaceful candlelight vigil turned into a night of mayhem and looting.

Nearly three dozen people were arrested after an angry crowd looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted police officers in Ferguson, Mo. And on Monday, a second night of unrest saw dozens of people again protesting, with police in riot gear firing tear gas and rubber bullets as officers tried to clear the streets of people still reeling from the shooting.

A member of Brown’s family denounced the lawlessness.

“I just want everyone to know and understand that the stealing and breaking in stores is not what Mike will want, it is very upsetting to me and my family,” an unidentified cousin said in a statement released to KTVI television. “Our family didn’t ask for this, but for Justice and Peace.”

Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police, which is leading the investigation, also called for calm.

“I understand that the public has a right to be skeptical,’ he said. “But I would also ask the public to be reasonable because it takes a long time to make sure we do this investigation the right way.”

Belmar also announced that the autopsy showed that Brown had been “struck several times by gunfire” but declined to identify the officer who shot him.

The chief said only that he was a six-year veteran who has been placed on administrative leave.

Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI's St. Louis field office, insisted the anger in the streets played no role in their decision to investigate. She said Brown’s death was already on their radar.

The U.S. Department of Justice is also monitoring a case that Brown supporters have likened to that of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teen who was killed by a security guard in an Orlando, Fla.-area housing development.

Brown was also walking home from a convenience store when he was killed Saturday.

His buddy Dorian Johnson told WALB-TV a police officer pulled up in a cruiser and told them to get out of the street and to walk on the sidewalk.

 Johnson said they kept walking, so the officer pulled up, got out of the car, and started shooting. He said they took off running.

“Once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and he started to get down,” Johnson said. “But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.”

Johnson insisted they did nothing wrong.

“We wasn’t causing harm to nobody,” he told the TV station. “We had no weapons on us at all.”

Balmer declined to discuss Johnson’s account. But previously the chief said the officer opened fire after one of the men pushed him into his squad car.

“It is our understanding at this point in the investigation, that within the police car, there was a struggle over the officer's weapon,” Balmer said.

Meanwhile, police set up road blocks to keep gawkers away from the looted stores.

“Right now, the small group of people (is) creating a huge mess,"" Mayor James Knowles told local TV. “Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors. There's nothing productive from this.""",NA,570,NA,NA

“The police officers weren’t violent or anything like that, but they put the handcuffs on me pretty tight,” the St. Louis grandmother told The Daily News on Tuesday — a day after she was arrested.

“I have been arrested before,” she said. “The bruises will go away.”

A German Jew who fled to England as a child before World War II erupted — and whose parents and other relatives were murdered by the Nazis at the Auschwitz death camp — Epstein is a longtime political activist.

Most recently, Epstein has taken part in numerous protests against the Israeli bombing of Palestinians in Gaza.

On Monday, Epstein said she was in downtown St. Louis to protest Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon’s decision to send the National Guard into Ferguson, Mo.

“We were hoping to get him to de-escalate the violence,” said Epstein. “We believe they are inciting the peaceful demonstrators to become violent.”

Epstein said she “hadn’t given a thought to being arrested.”

But just before the protest march kicked off, Epstein said “somebody announced there would be arrests and they asked me if I was willing to take that risk.”

“I said yes,” she said. “It was very spontaneous.”

Epstein said they marched over to a government building and began demanding to speak with Nixon. She said the cops said no and threatened to arrest them if they didn’t scram.

“In the past my heart would pound a mile a minute,” she said. “This time I was very calm. The police told us to move and we refused. So they arrested us.”

Epstein said the officers treated them professionally.

“They have a job to do and they did what they had to do,” she said. “They handcuffed us, drove us to the station, and charged us with failure to disperse.”

Epstein, who lived in New York when she first emigrated to the U.S. in 1948, said she has protested against what she sees as injustice “since I was a teenager.”

“I didn't think I would still be doing this when I was 90,” she said. “But we have to stand up for what’s right.”",NA,433,NA,NA

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is using the mayhem in Missouri, which erupted after an unarmed black teen was killed by a cop, as an excuse to slam the U.S.

“Racial discrimination's still a dilemma in US,” he tweeted Friday. “Still ppl are unsecure for having dark skins. The way police treat them confirms it.”

“Look at how US govt treats black community!” Khamenei wrote in an earlier Tweet. “It's not about 50-100 years ago but it's about today!”

But a few Tweets later, Khamenei was back to bashing Iran’s favorite target — the Jewish state.

“Brutal treatment of black ppl isn’t indeed the only anti-human rights act by US govt;look at US’s green light to #Israel’s crimes,” he wrote.

The bearded cleric followed that up with this Tweet.

“Look what Zionists have done to #Palestine over past decades & govts claiming2 support #HumanRights remained silent/supported.”",NA,134,NA,NA

President Obama was back at the White House on Monday, interrupting his vacation to tend to Iraq and other matters he was already dealing with on Martha's Vineyard.

Iraq and the crisis in Ferguson, Mo. were the primary topics during a curiously quickie return that ends with resumption of his vacation Tuesday.

The return was all scheduled well in advance of the decision to resume airstrikes in Iraq, and before the shooting death of an unarmed black teen in Ferguson.

But Obama has of late been chided for golfing and fundraising amid disarray around the world. His day in Washington seemed bent on demonstrating that even on vacation, he’s doing the people’s business.

""Obama presumably wants to avoid the mockery Bill Clinton got for doing polling over where he should vacation,"" said Andrew Rudalevige, a Bowdoin College political scientist.

""And I do think presidents are in a tough spot; they need some time for decompression, and that doesn't really happen even on 'vacation.' Nancy Reagan said something like 'presidents don't get a vacation, only a change of scenery.""

""Still, even I think that there is such a thing as enough golf, and we do have the right to expect presidents to 'pay it forward' during their term,"" he said.

Rudalevige said he sees Obama as confronting three groups when it comes to the tension between his duties and his desire to get away.

There are those ""who think Obama is golfing while Syria/Gaza/Kurdistan/Ferguson burns, but who already think he's worthless.""

Then there are ""Obama's allies, who realize he can do his job from anywhere these days."" That's akin to how supporters of President George W. Bush responded to criticism of his spending so much time on his Texas ranch.

Finally, there's the rest, or the bulk of the nation, who are more concerned with their own summer vacations, and getting in their last rounds of golf and time at the beach, before school starts.

""The question for the White House is when the third group starts to tune in,” the academic said. ""Indeed, would the president have made as many statements from the White House as he's made from the Vineyard?""

So after listening to a jazz concert and having a late dinner Sunday evening, Obama took Air Force One back to the capital.

But on Tuesday he's back on his flying fortress to return to Martha's Vineyard for sun, fun and perhaps more meetings on Iraq, Ukraine, Gaza and Ferguson, Mo.",NA,18,NA,NA

Outrage over 18-year-old Michael Brown's violent death over the weekend wasn't confined to St. Louis — nor did it stop at his death.

Many were upset with how news outlets portrayed Brown, who was unarmed, after a cop shot and killed him Saturday in Ferguson.

Young African-Americans started posting two pictures of themselves to Twitter — one more wholesome than the other— with a simple question: ""If they gunned me down, which picture would they use?""

The hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown exploded in popularity along with the argument that the media routinely vilifies black youth.

[tweetbegin 498662185757720579 tweetend]

[tweetbegin 498641196839735297 tweetend]

Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who is known for his reporting on NSA surveillance, {celebrated the hashtag}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/499149033206980609""> as ""a brilliant and powerful use of social media.""

Witnesses say Brown had his hands raised in a clear sign of surrender when the cop pulled the trigger repeatedly.

His family hired attorney Benjamin Crump, who represented the relatives of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teen who died at the hands of former neighborhood watch member George Zimmerman in February 2013.

“It is not about getting angry, it is about us getting justice for Michael Brown,” {Crump told ABC News.}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/officer-shot-unarmed-missouri-teen-michael-brown-identified/story?id=24929787#""> ""Their baby was executed in broad daylight.""

Many Americans feel that justice was not served when Zimmerman was found not guilty of second-degree murder in July 2013.

The death and subsequent acquittal sparked a national debate on racial profiling.

The pictures of Martin and Zimmerman used in the news also stirred controversy. At the time, people sympathetic to Martin or Zimmerman argued that the other was portrayed more favorably.

Zimmerman's supporters said that more liberal outlets tried to make him seem like a racist; whereas, the Martin family's supporters said that more conservative outlets tried to make the teen look like a ""thug.""

[tweetbegin 498677095187623936 tweetend]

Brown recently graduated from Normandy High School and was preparing for college in the fall. He wanted to pursue a career as a heating and air conditioning engineer.

Neighbors described Brown as quiet and respectful.

Sharon Johnson, 58, who lives in the area, said that he was a ""good boy"" who ""was never in trouble"" and would regularly stop by to chat.

""We talked about how when you turn yourself to the Lord you feel so good and good things come your way,"" she told The Associated Press. ""He had a more mature mind than a little boy's mind.""

Looting broke out Sunday night following a candle-light vigil to honor the young man. The following night, tensions rose again between a group that had gathered to protest Brown's death and police.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said some people threw rocks at police officers and gunshots were fired from the crowd. Officers responded with tear gas and ""beanbag rounds"" intended to stun them, he said.

Police told the crowd to go home but authorities had blocked off the exit streets, an Associated Press photographer said.

About a fourth of those annual incidents — about 96 a year, or two every week — involve a white officer and a black victim, {USA Today reported.}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/police-killings-data/14060357/"">

The report tracked ""justifiable"" homicides between 2005 and 2012, but only 750 out of a possible 17,000 law enforcement agencies contributed to the study, meaning the database could underreport the deaths.

On top of that, the statistics are not audited by any outside group, meaning the agency's count of ""justifiable"" deaths don't match up to other independent statistics.

Of the documented cases, nearly a fifth — 18% — of blacks killed were younger than 21 years old. Only 8.7% of whites included in the report were under 21.

While the FBI continually tracks these numbers, this latest report comes as news of a Missouri teen's death has sparked riots in St. Louis and around the country.

Brown's friend who witnesses the shooting maintained that Wilson shot Brown as the friends were casually walking down the street. The cop demanded the two walk on the sidewalk instead of the road, and when they didn't obey, he grabbed Brown by the neck and shot him, Dorian Johnson said.

The incident sparked four nights of violent protests, where rioters looted stores, burned buildings and allegedly attacked police. Officers used rubber bullets and tear gas to quell the rowdy crowd. The protests became more peaceful overnight Thursday after city patrol duty was transferred from local police to state highway officers.

Bronx: I am outraged that police in Missouri have provoked rioting in the protests over unarmed black teen Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson. Having overly aggressive, heavily armed, military-geared police along with armored trucks out on the streets was a heavy-handed attempt to intimidate people who are justifiably upset over the senseless and unexplained shooting death of Brown. It was the constitutional right of people to be able to assemble in groups to protest, regardless of the time. Are white people — with the exception of a news media reporter in a McDonald’s — the only ones able to express their constitutional rights without being harassed by police? I am surprised that some media talking heads aren’t blaming Rev. Al Sharpton for this, since he seems to be the fall guy for all anti-police activity. I am all for the police doing their jobs. But they need to do it in a fair and respectful manner. Kevin Valentine

Single standard

Staten Island: In his statement regarding the tragedy in Ferguson, the President says that public officials must be held to a high standard, be open and honest in their investigations and be held accountable. He called for a thorough investigation by the attorney general and the U.S. attorney. I can only hope he would set the same standards for himself and his administration with regard to the scandals that surround him. R.A. Lessin

Farewell, Robin

Ledyard, Conn.: If I can borrow from the movie “Good Will Hunting,” I would like to say something to the friends and family of Robin Williams: It’s not your fault. May Robin rest in peace. Lisa Allen

We were blessed by his life

St. Albans: Robin Williams was one of the greatest comedic actors of his generation. He entertained fans of all ages. He will be sorely missed by his family, his friends and all of his adoring fans. Hey, Robin, try not to tickle God’s funny bone. Rest in peace. My favorite movie was “Mrs. Doubtfire.” His charitable work for the homeless and the military was an inspiration to me to help my fellow man. Leslie Langer

No respect

New Castle, Del.: I saw your cover page of Robin Williams on Aug. 13 and let’s just say I’m appalled and disgusted by it! Why use the word “hanged,” as if he were hanged by a lynch mob? Why not just say he committed suicide — and celebrate the life of a man who touched so many lives with his talent and was loved by so many? Joseph Mascara 3rd

Ditto

Bronx: Congratulations on one of your most disturbing front pages. What happened to “R.I.P. Robin,” or maybe some words from one of his many admirers? This man gave so much, and you chose to sensationalize his death. All that extra crap surrounding his photo could have been saved for inside pages. Thank God, Lauren Bacall died from natural causes! R.I.P., Lauren. Marge Forsberg

Oops

Great Neck, L.I.: Lauren Bacall’s death at 89 was sadly overshadowed by Robin Williams’ suicide. But surely the Daily News could have taken a few minutes to find out that she starred in “Designing Woman” with Gregory Peck rather than “Designing Women” with Cary Grant. Wendy Penner

More memories

Brooklyn: On March 28, 1974, I went to A&S to buy a birthday present and couldn’t leave without a custard downstairs in the basement. I had vanilla with either chocolate or strawberry topping. I forgot to add I was nine months pregnant. My husband heard a whoosh-like sound, saying, “Wait, what was that?” My water had broken. He said, “Put that down, you’re going to the hospital.” I said, “I’m finishing this first.” All he said was that it “looked like Niagara Falls.” I never forgot the night my water broke and where I was. Maxine Bernardo

Just desserts

Bayside: When I was 11 years old in 1958, my mother would go shopping at the Hicksville mall, and we’d always stop by the Gertz department store and get its delicious custard with chocolate syrup. It’s what made shopping a pleasure in those days. You can’t get that buying through the computer. Robert Jampol

A big plus for Queens

Manhattan: Sen. Tony Avella’s Aug. 4 Be Our Guest ,“City overlooks law in Willets Point project,” failed to make mention of the extensive public planning process and broad community support behind the Willets Point redevelopment project. The project was approved by an overwhelming majority of the City Council and is backed by a wide array of stakeholders, including the community board, labor unions and local community groups. Most important, this $3 billion investment will reverse 100 years of pollution by cleaning up 23 acres of contaminated land and creating more open space. The project will bring thousands of well-paying jobs to Queens and will build a new community out of an area that has been neglected for far too long. This plan went through a transparent approval process and is going to deliver fundamental improvements to Willets Point that have been needed for decades. Jesse Masyr, Queens Development Group

Simple facts

Brooklyn: To Voicer Rev. Stanley Williams: If Eric Garner had not been breaking the law and had not resisted arrest, he most likely would be alive today. Theresa Colgan

Parents, the key ingredient

Dumont, N.J.: For a long time, I have been reading that the school system is in poor shape. Naturally, the ones getting the blame are the teachers. I finally had to ask myself, where are the parents? I graduated public high school in 1964, thanks not only to my teachers, but also my father. If I was disciplined by my teacher, I couldn’t go home and complain to my father because I knew what his response would be: “If she did, she probably had reason, but I will talk to her at the next meeting.” Throughout the years, there were always parent-teacher meetings — meetings my father would never miss. Seeing how kids dress for school is also surprising. We didn’t have to wear uniforms, but there were dress codes. It seems these days the kids are in charge. How are teachers supposed to do their jobs if they don’t have the backing of the parents? I can’t say my father always agreed with the teacher, but because of these meetings he would always hear the situation from me and the teacher and then be able to make the right decision. One thing we were always told before the year started was the teacher was to be respected. Toni McLaughlin

Hopeless

Plainview, L.I.: The Knicks’ 82-game schedule for their 2014-15 season has just been released, and the best thing about it is that so far they remain undefeated! Richard Siegelman

Make it safe for bikes

Manhattan: Why are bicyclists forced to ride in the streets? They should be afforded the same protection as pedestrians. Do we force pedestrians into the street? Bicyclists are unprotected and at the mercy of dangerous motorists. In truly advanced nations, bicyclists are afforded the same protection as pedestrians and are not forced to risk their lives. Bicyclists ride side by side with pedestrians within marked boundaries — yes, on sidewalks in addition to completely segregated bike lanes that are omnipresent in Holland, Denmark and Sweden. One is better off risking a fine, even multiple fines, than risking one’s life or permanent injury on the unforgiving streets of Manhattan — where beating a red light is a sport for many drivers, as is talking on the phone while going down the road next to poor bicyclists who can only hope they won’t get hit. Point this out to the cop who tickets you as part of the crackdown, and while they write your ticket, presto, another car goes through a red light while speeding. Roland A. Carlstedt

Pushers and lookers

Jamaica: I keep rereading Voicer Kitty Hughes’ response to my suggestion to look before crossing the street, and I can’t make sense of it. I’m trying to save people’s lives, and you’re telling me that strollers have been around for a long time. I know for sure that a really long time ago, parents weren’t pushing their strollers into the streets while on cell phones paying absolutely no attention to their surroundings, putting the children and themselves in danger.

“Right now, we’re taking a cautious approach with him, which is a smart approach,” Ryan said. “We’ll see how he progresses.”

Saunders, a fourth-round pick, was headed south near the team’s camp at the intersection of Park Ave. and Florham Road. He began to turn left when he experienced his medical problem, at which point the vehicle “did not make a full turn and proceeded on an angle across the north lanes of Park Ave., striking the curb,” according to the police report.

Saunders drove off the road, his car coming to rest in high grass at 7:50 a.m.

“He could tell you a lot better than I could about what happened and how he is and all that kind of stuff,” Ryan said.

Saunders did not make the trip to Cincinnati for the Jets’ preseason game against the Bengals Saturday night. Ryan noted that he will not play Friday night against the Giants.

REX DEFENDS WILSON
Ryan remains in defensive back Kyle Wilson’s corner.

“I think this will be his finest year,” Ryan said.

Wilson has endured his share of ups and downs in his first four seasons, and he drew heat once again for his part in Bengals wideout Mohamed Sanu’s 43-yard touchdown catch Saturday night in Cincinnati. Ryan noted that Wilson provided proper coverage underneath on the play, and remained optimistic about his development. “He did a tremendous job on some of the other plays,” Ryan said. “He’s playing with more confidence than I have seen him play with in the past.”

FERGUSON SIMPLY ISN’T NYC

Despite the Rev. Al’s attempt to roil unrest after the killing of Eric Garner, New York City has remained calm. This is due in part to Mayor de Blasio’s actions despite back-stabbing by Sharpton, and also because the NYPD and city government are racially reflective of the city.

In Ferguson, so-called minorities are the majority: 67% black residents, with 50 white cops and three black cops.

Why did authorities bring out the heavy artillery like they were fighting ISIS? Why didn’t officials reach out to the real community leaders first? Pastors, the guys who organize Little League, community activists, teachers?

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson has been the only sane voice in the worsening situation, and his speech should go down as one of the great ones in American history. Anger is quelled with dignity, not duplicity. Is this Ferguson, 2014 or Mississippi, 1962?

OUCH TO ALIMONY

Divorce lawyers want me dead like a rat in the street. Big deal. I’d be worried if Putin or the Pope wanted me dead.

After Sunday’s anti-alimony Robin Williams column, they complained that women who have given up their educations so their husbands can get educated deserve to be “maintained” for as long as they want, so they can go back to school after a divorce.

Really? The second wife of Williams was his kid’s nanny-turned-producer on his films.

What was she going to go to school for?

It’s 2014, do you know what time it is?

Women must take care of their own educations before they worry about their husbands’ schooling, and men should do likewise.

Reality check: 40% to 50% of marriages end in divorce!

Only bookies — and divorce lawyers — get rich from suckers who take odds like these.

Richard Loredo, Parker's former co-worker, {told the newspaper}<hyperlink=""http://www.vvdailypress.com/article/20140813/NEWS/140819920""> the police version of the story was ""totally wrong; that's just not Dante.""

""Dante's not a burglar ... You can see how well his kids were raised,"" Loredo said. ""He was a good dad. For the police department to portray him like that is…unfair.""

A message left with the Daily Press newsroom early Friday wasn't immediately returned. 

Police said it took multiple deputies several minutes to get Parker under control. One of them suffered bruises on her arms during the struggle.

After he was cuffed and placed in a squad car, Parker began sweating and breathing heavily, police said.

Paramedics were called and he was rushed by ambulance to Victory Valley Global Hospital.

Authorities said Parker was conscious but hazy when he arrived at the hospital. He died a short time later as doctors were treating him.

The Riverside County Coroner's Office will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death.

Loved ones said the bearish pressman was the lynchpin of his large family, which included a wife, four daughters and a son, as well as siblings and cousins who lived in the area.

""We do everything together, as a family,"" his sister, {Youree Stewart, told NBC Los Angeles.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Man-Dies-in-Deputies-Custody-After-Being-Hit-With-Taser-271144901.html""> ""He's a big part of our family. He's really going to be missed.""

Co-workers said Parker struggled with his weight and had picked up biking in an effort to shed pounds.

""He had been riding his bike for years with his wife or one of his kids,"" another Daily Press pressman, Ronald Bantug, {told the newspaper.}<hyperlink=""http://www.vvdailypress.com/article/20140813/NEWS/140819920"">

""He'd do jumping jacks on breaks out by the freeway or run laps around the building.""

His cousin, Ge'shun Harris, told the Daily Press, ""He was big, like a defensive end in football.""

""I understand that he was big and intimidating, but whoever called the police was wrong, because I don't believe he was doing such a thing,"" Harris said.

The sheriff's homicide unit was investigating Parker's death, authorities said.

None of the officers involved in the confrontation was identified.

Parker's death comes amid a national uproar over police use of force following the deaths of two men in New York in Missouri.

In New York, a possible federal investigation was brewing into the death of Staten Island dad Eric Garner, who died in June after a cop put him in a chokehold during an arrest attempt.

And in suburban St. Louis, the town of Ferguson has seen four straight nights of violent clashes between protesters and police over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, an unarmed black man who was shot by a local cop on Saturday.

Parker would have turned 37 on Thursday.

""Dante was a good man, a family man who just wanted to provide the best he could for his wife and kids,"" Harry Pontius, who was Parker's boss at the Daily Press, said in a statement.

""He'll be extremely missed.""",NA,371,NA,NA
NYDailyNews,nydn51,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-heading-back-washington-rare-vacation-break-article-1.1906457,"Obama heading back to Washington, D.C. in rare vacation break ",The Associated Press,08/17/2014,02/19/2016,"President Barack Obama is getting off the island.

In a rare move for him, the president planned a break in the middle of his Martha’s Vineyard vacation to return to Washington on Sunday night for unspecified meetings with Vice President Joe Biden and other advisers.

The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions.

Part of the decision appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises.

Yet those crises turned the first week of Obama’s vacation into a working holiday. He made on-camera statements on U.S. military action in Iraq and the clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri. He called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas.

“I think it’s fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that’s why you’ve seen the president stay engaged,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.

Obama is scheduled to return to Martha’s Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend.

Even though work has occupied much of Obama’s first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island.

He also attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan’s wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

That get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama’s vacation. Just as Obama was arriving on Martha’s Vineyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest criticism of Obama’s foreign policy.

Clinton later promised she and Obama would “hug it out” when they saw each other at Jordan’s party. No reporters were allowed in, so it’s not clear whether there was any hugging, but the White House said the president danced to nearly every song.",NA,8,NA,NA

Officers said the force wouldn't release any autopsy findings until later in the investigation — a move meant to protect witnesses' testimony from being ""tainted,"" {LAPD's Andrew Smith told KPCC.}<hyperlink=""http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/08/18/46063/ezell-ford-lapd-places-security-hold-on-autopsy-fo/"">

The department wants to get ""clean interviews"" with witnesses, Smith said, adding he fears that releasing the findings could encourage witnesses to ""use information from the autopsy to give credibility to their story.""

It's unclear how long the results will be concealed.

The blocked findings enraged activists who say Ford was gunned down while complying with police. Witnesses said the 25-year-old, who suffered from mental health issues, was already on the ground when police shot him three times.

Ford was taking medication for diagnosed schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, relatives said. Police and neighbors knew about those issues, they said.

{Demonstrators rallied Sunday}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/hundreds-protest-lapd-shooting-unarmed-black-man-article-1.1907132""> demanding a complete investigation into Ford's death.

But police have a different story. Officers said Ford was aggressive when they stopped him for an ""investigative stop"" and tried to grab a gun from one of the cops.

Activists have drawn parallels between Ford's case and that of 18-year-old Michael Brown, whose death has sparked nights of violent protests in Ferguson, Mo.

Brown was shot and killed by Officer Darren Wilson just two days before Ford was killed. Witnesses said the cop gunned him down while the teen's hands were over his head. Ferguson police maintained that either the 18-year-old or his friend tried to grab Wilson's sun before the fatal shots were fired.",NA,51,NA,NA

The video {was posted by LG Kern,}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/lgkern2""> an organization dedicated to spreading awareness for LGBT rights in Iran, features a man in police uniform showing off wild dance moves with another man at the {Stockholm Pride Parade 2014 on Aug. 2.}<hyperlink=""http://www.stockholmpride.org/en/Pride-Parade/Pride-Parad-2014/"">

The two men's crazy moves together included the dancer in a white shirt and Afro swinging his leg over the officer's head. The cop, who was not armed as he contorted his body, seemed to have been with a group of similarly dressed officers who were marching together in the parade.

The festival, which organizers say is the Scandinavia's biggest pride parade, included about 60,000 participants and drew a crowd of about 600,000 people.

This year's theme of the event was ""everyday life"" and participants were told to interpret it in their ""own special way.""

""With this theme, we also want to highlight the importance of Pride - that it's still very much needed, as the heteronorm still stands strong in our society,"" the organizers said.

Some commenters on the video have also remarked they were happy to see a white officer and a black male embracing that theme and dancing together after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Mo., cop Darren Wilson has strained race relations.",NA,95,NA,All three links embedded in the text are no more available.
NYDailyNews,nydn54,http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/cops-movie-review-article-1.1902112,‘Let’s Be Cops’: movie review,Jordan Hoffman,08/13/2014,03/04/2016,"You have the right to remain silent and, for much of ""Let's be Cops,"" you will be.

This alleged comedy takes a long time before it gets its first laugh in. The first half is a complete slog and the ending is insulting, but there are a few semi-arresting sketch comedy moments.

Ryan (Jake Johnson of TV's ""New Girl"") and Justin (Damon Wayans Jr., also on ""New Girl"") are a pair of L.A. dimwits who can't catch a break. Ryan still lives in the shadow of his high school football days; Justin is an insecure, wannabe video game creator. After they leave a college reunion costume party in disgrace, they discover that when they're dressed as the police, people — especially ladies — start treating them differently.

First as a goof, then as some sort of revenge against society, Ryan and Justin run around enjoying the unearned respect they get from fake badges and guns. The movie starts to hum during sequences at clubs and on lighthearted domestic calls, but it quickly gets weighed down, and ultimately sinks, when an Albanian mob scheme pop up.

The movie's at its best giving its characters room for shtick. Straight-laced Wayans forced to take a hit of crystal meth and Keegan-Michael Key as a thuggish rasta are highlights that cut through the boring plot and overbearing final act of hokey redemption. But these moments are not enough to merit chasing down a ticket.

There's also the issue of bad timing. It's impossible to watch ""Let's Be Cops"" and its jokes about abuse of police power while the nation is dealing with recent events in Staten Island and Ferguson, Mo. A different movie — not a comedy — could analyze America's obsession with gun culture, violent videogames and authority. That's not the movie ""Cops"" director Luke Greenfield wanted to make, however, so these serious themes just lurk behind the attempted laughs.",NA,20,NA,NA
