Many in the crowd wore goggles or painters’ masks, concerned about another round of tear gas. I asked Rodgers if his yellow shower cap was for a similar purpose. “Nah,” he says. “I just put in a curl.”

“The police just be on you pretty much just to be on you, man,” Rodgers said. He doesn’t drive, so he relies on public transit and rides from friends. But he says most of his buddies usually won’t drive into Ferguson. “We ain’t going out there, man,” they tell him. “We ain’t going out near Ferguson.”

After days of violence following the shooting of an unarmed, black 18-year-old named Michael Brown by a police officer, tensions between law enforcement and protesters calmed somewhat on Friday. On Thursday, Governor Jay Nixon made a long-overdue intervention in the situation: The man he placed in charge of the police on the scene, Ron Johnson, is an African American State Highway Patrol captain who grew up in the area and still lives nearby. Johnson marched with, spoke with, and hugged protesters. The few police who showed up at Thursday night’s demonstration wore normal uniforms. They left their gas masks at home.

But the purpose of the Ferguson protests was not to win the right to protest, as renewed tension has shown. On Friday, the police department identified the white officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson, but they also released surveillance video allegedly showing Brown participating in a “strong-arm robbery” minutes before the shooting, causing a fresh wave of outrage in the community. The autopsy still has not been released. By early Saturday morning, ""protesters barricaded a major thoroughfare and police officers in riot gear quickly responded, prompting a standoff,"" {The New York Times reports}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=b-lede-package-region&region=lede-package&WT.nav=lede-package&_r=1”>. The case—and the pain it has caused—is far from being resolved.

In part, this may be because one of the most significant underlying causes of the unrest hasn’t been addressed: allegations of racial profiling.  

The civic infrastructure of Ferguson has not kept pace with its shifting demographics. In 1990, the town was three-quarters white. Twenty years later, white people made up only 30 percent of the population.

Now, Ferguson’s population is two-thirds black. Its more-than-50-person police force includes just three black officers. In 2013, black people accounted for 86 percent of all traffic stops and 92 percent of searches and arrests.

Ferguson’s figures are not much different than many municipalities in the St. Louis area—and they’re actually better than the statewide average. But residents say profiling in the city is severe.

Anthony Johnson lives in the Canfield Green Apartments, where Mike Brown lived and where he was gunned down in the street. Tattooed below Johnson’s right eye is a pair of tear drops, a tribute to his parents. His father was shot and killed when he was 10. His mom died in a car accident on Mother’s Day. Standing on the lawn of the apartment complex, he said police harassment is a regular part of life here. Cops often stop him on the street and ask where he’s going. Sometimes, they’ll pick him up by mistake, looking for a different black man. He knows not to walk around the neighborhood after a certain time at night, to avoid being stopped, interrogated, and asked for identification. “Why should I have to show ID if I’m just walking down the street?” he asked. “It just don’t make no sense. It’s sad that it took an incident like this to shed some light on the Ferguson police.”

One particularly appalling incident came in 2009, when Ferguson police picked up a 52-year-old named Henry Davis, as recently {reported by The Daily Beast}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html”>. He was arrested by mistake. The warrant had been for another man with the same last name. But rather than police setting him free, Davis was charged with “property damage” because he had bled on an officer’s uniform.

On Monday night, there was a second, less publicized police shooting in Ferguson. A man allegedly pulled a gun on an officer and was shot multiple times. He ended up in critical condition.

Martez Little, 24, was at the scene. Now he has a large bruise on his left cheek and scratches all across his chest. He says police punched him, smacked him with a gun, and dragged him on the ground. Little says he wasn’t carrying a weapon and hasn’t been in much trouble with the law. A search of state records shows traffic tickets and some family-court cases, but no felonies or violent crimes.

How often does he get stopped by police? “Plenty of times,” Little says. “They’re always stopping my car. My car is known out here… The only thing I ever been locked up for is traffic tickets.”

At a recent community forum, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged that problem, saying his department is working on the issue. It’s a vicious cycle, he said: People get a few traffic tickets and can’t afford to pay the fines; eventually a warrant is issued and an arrest is made; a court date is missed, and on and on…

Grazida King came to Thursday’s march with his two sons, ages 9 and 11. He wanted to prove that protests can be peaceful and show his boys that it’s important to stand up for your beliefs. “I’ve been profiled before,” he says. “We call it driving while black, just pulled over for no apparent reason.” He worries about his sons having the same problem. He tries to raise them the right way, but feels like he shouldn’t have to train his children on how to avoid being harassed by police.

In addressing the crowd, even Johnson, the highway patrol captain, said he knows how it feels to be profiled. “When I was 18, I knew there were times when I was driving in my car and had to turn around,” he says. “It needs to change. It’s gotta change today.”

You will see a version of Ferguson, in other words, that looks nothing like the Ferguson that has come to national attention this week. This Ferguson bears little resemblance to {#ferguson}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23Ferguson&src=tyah”>.

But #ferguson, in many ways, has.

As the Ferguson protests get national attention, though, it's worth remembering that the tragedy that brought the hashtag could have happened in many other American cities. ""It just happened to be Ferguson,"" says Terry Jones, a professor of political science at the University of Missouri in St. Louis. 

But it happened to be Ferguson, Jones also points out, because of a host of reasons that have to do with history and geography and politics. I spoke with the professor this afternoon, asking him to help explain those reasons and put them into context. What follows is a transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for clarity and length.  

We are a border city. Missouri was a slave state that stayed in the Union; it did not experience Reconstruction. Immediately after the Civil War, it passed a host of Jim Crow laws, and added Jim Crowism to its Constitution and created a legacy of racial injustice. St. Louis—the white St. Louis—was and is slow to acknowledge the realities that are associated with that. 

So some of the events here go back 200 years or more. Unfortunately, it takes tragedies like this to remind St. Louis that it still has some significant elements of racial injustice with which it needs to deal. 

What are those elements? 

It's across the spectrum: economic disparities, educational disparities, health care disparities. This metropolitan area ranks among the worst in terms of disparities between African-Americans and caucasians across all measures of quality of life. 

Why is that, in particular? 

First of all, we have some company, unfortunately. A Cincinnati or a Louisville would be in a similar situation in terms of the slave history and segregationist legislation. History matters here, very much—and I think more so than people appreciate—because it created the steep hills that need to be climbed in order for people to overcome past injustice. It's what makes us distinctive compared to either a Southern city such as Atlanta or a Northern city such as a Minneapolis/St. Paul or a Cleveland. 

But I think it's a mistake to have the underlying causes of this incident focused on the city of Ferguson itself, as opposed to the entire St. Louis metropolitan area. This incident could have happened anywhere in St. Louis. It happened to happen in Ferguson. There's nothing special about Ferguson that makes it stand out from the rest of the metropolitan area. In DC, it could have happened in Prince George's County; it could have happened in Alexandria. 

What do you think of the way the national narrative is playing out, especially as it relates to the politics of Ferguson? 

I think it's a bit unfair to treat Ferguson as ""Ferguson,"" as opposed to Ferguson as exemplary of any suburb in the St. Louis metropolitan area. And indeed, ironically, if I had to score the suburbs in the metropolitan area that have racially mixed populations in terms of the progressiveness of their elected officials, Ferguson would score at or near the top in terms of being sensitive to that and trying to maintain a high degree of racial harmony. Ironically, and tragically, that didn't happen here. 

But a white police officer could have shot an African-American young man just about anywhere in the metropolitan area, and I think we would have seen the same sort of reaction. The probability of it happening is almost evenly spread over the metropolitan area. It just happened to be Ferguson. 

That doesn't relieve Ferguson of responsibility, but the narrative should not be, ""It's not St. Louis, it's Ferguson. That's the problem.'"" Each municipality, and each area of St. Louis, should be looking at Ferguson and saying, ""There but for the grace of God goeth us. It could have happened here.""

We've spent most of our adult lives in New York, and most of that time in New York living in Harlem. I love Harlem for the same reason I love all the hoods I have lived in. I walk outside in my same uniform, which is to say my same jeans, my same fitted, my same hoodie, and feel myself washing away, disappearing into the boulevard, into the black and (presently) the brown, and becoming human.

There have been young people fighting outside my window for as long as I can remember. I was no older than five sitting on the steps of my parents' home on Woodbrook Avenue watching the older boys knock shoulders in the street—""bucking"" as we called it then—daring each other to fire off. From that point on I knew that among my people fisticuffs had their own ritual and script. The script was in effect that evening: show cause (some niggas jumped me in the park), mouth off (I ain't no punk), escalate (wait right her son, I'm bout to get my shit). 

My wife wanted to know what she should do. She was not worried about her own safety—boys like this are primarily a threat to each other. What my wife wanted was someone who could save them young men from themselves, some power which would disperse the boys in a fashion that would not escalate things. No such power exists. I told my wife to stay inside and do nothing. I did not tell her to call the police. If you have watched the events of this past week, you may have some idea why. 

Among the many relevant facts for any African-American negotiating their relationship with the police the following stands out: The police departments of America are endowed by the state with dominion over your body. This summer in Ferguson and Staten Island we have seen that dominion employed to the maximum ends—destruction of the body. This is neither new nor extraordinary. It does not matter if the destruction of your body {was an overreaction}<hyperlink=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Amadou_Diallo”>. It does not matter if the destruction of your body resulted {from a misunderstanding}<hyperlink=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bell_shooting_incident”>. It does not matter if the destruction of your body springs from foolish policy. Sell cigarettes without proper authority and your body can be destroyed. Resent the people trying to entrap your body {and it can be be destroyed}<hyperlink=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Dorismond”>. Protect the home of your mother {and your body can be destroyed}<hyperlink=”http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-city-reaches-2m-settlement-shooting-unarmed-brooklyn-man-article-1.1865665”>. Visit the home of your young daughter {and your body will be destroyed}<hyperlink=”http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0106.coates.html”>. The destroyers of your body will rarely be held accountable. Mostly they will receive pensions. 

It will not do to point out the rarity of the destruction of your body by the people whom you pay to protect it. As Gene Demby has noted, destruction is merely the superlative form of a dominion whose prerogatives include friskings, detainings, beatings, and humiliations. All of this is common to black people. All of this is old for black people. No one is held accountable. The body of Michael Brown was left in the middle of the street for four hours. It can not be expected that anyone will be held accountable.

We are being told that Michael Brown attacked an armed man and tried to take his gun. The people who are telling us this hail from that universe where choke-holds are warm-fuzzies, where boys discard their skittles yelling, ""You're gonna die tonight,"" and possess the power to summon and banish shotguns from the ether. These are the necessary myths of our country, and without them we are subject to the awful specter of history, and that is just too much for us to bear.

James Poulos is trying admirably to get at this, noting that we fear Lincoln's awesome prophecy. But even Poulos {can't quite escape}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-real-nightmare-of-ferguson.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thedailybeast%2Farticles+%28The+Daily+Beast+-+Latest+Articles%29”>:

We know that America is exceptional in one key respect—we came to democracy without much bloodshed. Around the world, from Hungary and Russia to Iraq and Nigeria, we see the dream of peaceful democratization dragged again and again to what the philosopher Hegel called the slaughter-bench of history. Racial strife and murderous governments, not liberty and democracy, are the rule in history, the established pattern. We know that, mercifully, democratization scourged us only once in ferociously modern style: during the Civil War.

The last sentence here nullifies the first. Some 600,000 Americans—2.5 percent of the American population—died in the Civil War. What came before this was a long bloody war—enslavement—against black families, black communities and black bodies. What came after was a terrorist regime which ruled an entire swath of this country by fire and rope. That regime was not overthrown until an era well within the living memory of many Americans. Taken all together, the body count that led us to our present tenuous democratic moment does not elevate us above the community of nations, but installs us uncomfortably within its ranks. And that is terrifying because it shows us to be neither providential nor exceptional, and only special in the subjective sense that our families are special—because they are ours.

My family lives in Harlem. My wife did not call the police. An older head told the angry boys that they needed to take it somewhere else, which they did. Black people are not above calling the police—but often we do so fully understanding that we are introducing an element that is unaccountable to us. We introduce the police into our communities, the way you might introduce a predator into the food chain. This is not the singular, special fault of the police. The police are but the tip of the sword wielded by American society itself. Something bigger than Stand Your Ground, the drug war, mass incarceration or any other policy is haunting us. And as long we cower from it, the events of this week are as certain as math. The question is not ""if,"" but ""when.""

The mayhem puts at risk peaceful protesters, whose frustration at local authorities is fully justified, as well as many good police officers who'd rather be anywhere else. Some have asked the majority of residents with peaceful intentions to call off protests and vigils after dark. The request is understandable—as is the refusal of outraged citizens who feel a moral and civic obligation to persist in their activism. Well-intentioned people on both sides feel they cannot in good conscience back down, yet they are unable to control the bad elements in their midst. 

It is a perilous moment—and politics offers one way forward.

In The Guardian, Gary Younge, who sympathizes with the protesters in Ferguson,{observes}<hyperlink=”http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/18/ferguson-violence-martin-luther-king-michael-brown”> that the highly charged scene there attracts ""opportunists, macho-men and thrill-seekers as well as the righteously indignant and politically militant."" (The military atmosphere created by police helps attract the thrill-seekers.) He adds that Ferguson is ""a mostly black town under curfew in which the {entire political power structure}<hyperlink=”http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html”> is white,"" and that some riot because doing so is ""the crudest tool for those who have few options. By definition, they are chaotic. Rich people don’t riot because they have other forms of influence. {Riots are a class act}<hyperlink=”http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/nov/14/france.eu”>.""

One can imagine how some Ferguson residents would conclude that they have no form of influence except taking to the streets each night. Yet given the passionate mobilization that is taking place each day, it is realistic to imagine the protesters successfully ousting the whole leadership structure of the city. Even observers who are critical of the street activism following Michael Brown's killing agree that Ferguson's leaders have been egregiously incompetent in their response. They've clearly lost the confidence of the people they represent, and only in part because, {as the New York Times puts it}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/us/ferguson-mo-complex-racial-history-runs-deep-most-tensions-have-to-do-police-force.html?_r=0”>, ""Although about two-thirds of Ferguson residents are black, its mayor and five of its six City Council members are white. Only three of the town’s 53 police officers are black.""

This is a historic failure of leadership. So recall the mayor. Recall the city council. Elect new officials who will fire the police chief.

The most potent and direct method for addressing this disparity—the ballot box—has gone unused, so far. ""Turnout for local elections in Ferguson has been poor. The mayor, James W. Knowles III, noted his disappointment with the turnout—about 12 percent—in the most recent mayoral election,"" the Times adds. ""Patricia Bynes, a black woman who is the Democratic committeewoman for the Ferguson area, said the lack of black involvement in local government was partly the result of the black population’s being more transient in small municipalities and less attached to them."" What better opportunity to change that unfortunate pattern? This is a historic failure of leadership. Recalls were created for moments like this one.

So recall the mayor. Recall the city council. Elect new officials who will fire the police chief. Success is not guaranteed, but it is quite plausible and perhaps even likely. The whole lot of them could be tossed out.

My reading of {the relevant Missouri law}<hyperlink=”http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/c000-099/0770000650.htm”> suggests the legal requirements could be met easily. Incompetence is grounds for recall. If city leaders in Ferguson don't now qualify as incompetents, who ever would? And as a Daily Kos author {noted}<hyperlink=”http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/08/14/1321528/-Time-for-a-recall-in-Ferguson-MO#”> days ago, ""Petitions must include the signatures of 25% of registered voters, which should not be too hard to do at this point."" That would trigger a recall election. Turnout would presumably be high. Many blacks have been disenfranchised due to past convictions and attempts by GOP state legislators to depress voter turnout, but with this momentum, that obstacle isn't insurmountable. 

A successful recall of Ferguson's mayor and city council is the best outcome I can imagine from a protest movement that is justifiably angry, but uncertain about how to achieve its goals and at risk of losing public support if the streets turn more violent. Protesters want transparency in the investigation into Brown's death, accountability for the police department, and an end to leadership that demonstrates such disregard and seeming contempt for the city's black people. Perhaps existing pressure on city leaders, or appeals already made to the Department of Justice, will help advance those goals—but while more night protests would seem to offer scant hope for additional gains, replacing the city's elected leadership would advance the protesters' goals directly and dramatically. The effort would be nonviolent, it might well increase civic participation for years or even generations to come, and if successful, it would send an inspiring message to those who feel powerless: that a system very much stacked against them is still a far more powerful weapon than a molotov cocktail. 

Forget pressuring Ferguson's intransigent leaders and facing off against its policemen. Just replace them. Elect new leaders who pledge transparency on the matter of Brown's death and aggressive reforms of a police department that needs an overhaul. To abandon night protests and begin gathering signatures is not backing down. It is shifting a righteous battle to terrain more favorable to victory. It is the worst nightmare of Ferguson leaders: Rather than watching their underlings fire tear-gas canisters at protesters, they'll watch, powerless, as they're fired.

Cole released a disconsolate homage to Michael Brown. Since its upload to the music-streaming site SoundCloud, ""Be Free"" has already been played almost half a million times.

In keeping with its soul as a real-time protest song, the recording is raw to the point you can hear papers shuffling, the turning pages of a musical score that would typically be edited out. Ben Sisario at The New York Times {drew}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/arts/music/j-coles-be-free-spreads-around-the-world-in-hours.html”> a parallel to Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young's ""Ohio,"" which in 1970 took weeks to reach the public.

Better than describing the song, here it is.

As protest songs go, this is less a call to action than to empathy. Cole sounds exhausted. Accompanying the song's release, his only comment was a brief written passage in which he recalls the wide-eyed idealism of being in college, driven to change the world:

""There was a time in my life when I gave a fuck. Every chance I got I was screaming about it. ... But soon life hits you. ... We become distracted. We become numb. I became numb. But not anymore. That coulda been me, easily. It could have been my best friend. I’m tired of being desensitized to the murder of black men. I don’t give a fuck if it’s by police or peers. This shit is not normal.""

""That coulda been me"" {resonates for Cole}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/JColeNC/statuses/499615515779035136”>, but for most of the country the notion is abstract. So there's this song, the protests, as revitalization of will to consistently feel injustice when it's not so overt that it makes the front page, and when it doesn't feel like it could have been us. The protest song is about not going numb, {not changing the subject}<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/08/black-people-are-not-ignoring-black-on-black-crime/378629/”>.

TheAtlantic,atlantic6,http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/how-much-racial-profiling-happens-in-ferguson/378606/,How Much Racial Profiling Happens in Ferguson?,Alexis C. Madrigal,8/15/2014,2/29/2016,"In 2013, the Ferguson Police Department made 5,384 stops and 611 searches. 86 percent of the stops and 92 percent of the searches were of black people. Only 67 percent of the town's population is black. 

The racial disparity captured by these numbers is unacceptable, but it is not as easy to make sense of the injustice as it might seem. Are they solely a reflection of racist law enforcement actions?

UCLA's Center of Policing Equity has been called into dozens of police departments across the country to help them understand problems like this. And each situation is different.

""If you imagine that there is racism in law enforcement—and I don’t have to imagine, I’ve seen it, it definitely exists—there must also be racism in housing, employment, and education,"" said Phillip Atiba Goff, co-founder and president of UCLA's {Center for Policing Equity}<hyperlink=”http://policingequity.org/”>. ""We don’t know when the disparities we see in law enforcement are from the actions of law enforcement or if the disparities are picking up on bad things before contact with law enforcement.""

When staffers from the Center of Policing Equity go into a police department, they talk with community advocates, police officers, and the people of the city—all of whom provide important information about law enforcement behaviors. What they find is communities who have for generations felt like they're not being policed but occupied. And yet, at the same time, they find the ""vast majority"" of police officers and executives trying to do the right thing. 

The problem of racism both includes and goes beyond what a police department does. Sometimes, a police department has bad numbers because the police engage in racist actions, and other times, the number of stops and arrests the police make are a symptom of ""America’s inability to make better our history of racism and oppression,"" as Goff put it.

In Ferguson, there is one clear sign in the data that the police might be at fault for Ferguson's racially skewed stop-and-search statistics. Despite the racial disparity in stops, the Ferguson police department was more likely to find ""contraband"" on the white people they stopped and searched than on the black ones. ""If your stops of black folks are less efficient than your stops of white folks,"" Goff said, ""then you want to look at that and make it stop.""

But to go beyond these simple measures takes careful analysis. ""In St. Louis County and St. Louis City, those chiefs brought us in and said we have these data, and we’ve talked to a bunch of groups, and we want the experts to figure it out,"" Goff said. ""Well, the experts are in the process of figuring it out. It’s not like it’s cut-and-dried, we got the data and therefore we know it’s profiling. That’s just not true.""

One thing hampering the efforts to tease apart the general legacies of racism and the specific actions of police departments is the lack of national data for comparing one department to another. 

So, the Center for Policing Equity is creating The Justice Database, a national catalog of police behavior—including stops and the use of force. They've received more than $1 million from the National Science Foundation, Department of Justice, and several private foundations to create the aggregated national data.

The Center is pioneering what they call ""evidence-based social justice,"" applying quantitative methods to difficult, seemingly intractable social problems.

What’s not is the way conservatives have reacted.

For decades, from George Wallace to Richard Nixon to Ronald Reagan to Rudy Giuliani, conservative pols have responded to conflicts like Ferguson in the same way: support the cops, paint your liberal opponents as soft on black crime, and reap a vast harvest of white working-class votes. Forty, 30, 20, or even 10 years ago, the idea that a leading Republican presidential candidate would react to a violent confrontation between police and black demonstrators by {insisting that}<hyperlink=”http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”> “we must demilitarize the police” and bemoaning the fact that “our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences” would have been inconceivable. 

In explaining Senator Rand Paul’s response to Ferguson—and the {growing skepticism}<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/03/the-republican-partys-pot-dilemma/284289/”> of tough-on-crime policies among leading Republican politicians today—commentators often cite the libertarian attitudes of younger voters and the GOP’s desperate need to change its image among African Americans and Latinos. But reaching out to these constituencies by shifting GOP policies on crime would be impossible if it produced the kind of furious backlash among conservative activists that Republican politicians have endured for trying to change their party’s policies on immigration.

Why can Paul get away with it? Because of one of the most fundamental, and underappreciated, shifts in the American political landscape: the decline of crime. From the late 1960s, when violent crime began to rise, through the mid 1990s, when {it began to fall}<hyperlink=”http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm”>, crime was among the most potent issues in American politics, and a key factor in pushing political discourse to the right.

In the two decades since Clinton's tough-on-crime policies, violent crime has dropped, and public attitudes have softened.

In 1968, Richard Nixon {ran an ad}<hyperlink=”https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=463009976107”> consisting solely of a middle-aged white woman walking alone a dark and deserted street as the narrator declared, “Crimes of violence in the United States have almost doubled in recent years. Today a violent crime is committed every sixty seconds.” 

In 1988, {Republicans made}<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmwhdDv8VrM”> Michael Dukakis’s furlough program for state inmates—and the image of convicted murderer Willie Horton, a black man who did not return from a furlough and committed rape and armed robbery—a key element of their assault on the Massachusetts governor.* During that year’s debates, CNN’s Bernard Shaw asked Dukakis whether he’d want the death penalty for a man who raped and murdered his wife. (The question is virtually inconceivable today.) When Dukakis gave {an unemotional and statistics-laden answer}<hyperlink=”http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1844704_1844706_1844712,00.html”>, some pundits declared his candidacy over.  

When Bill Clinton ran four years later, he was so determined to avoid Dukakis’ fate that in late January 1992, with the Iowa caucuses only days away, he flew back to Arkansas to preside over the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a man so mentally impaired that during his last meal he asked guards to save his pecan pie for “later.” Upon becoming president, Clinton signed a crime bill that rescinded the right of inmates to receive Pell Grants for university education, created “boot camps” for delinquent minors, allocated large sums for new prisons, and made 60 new offenses eligible for the death penalty.

But in the two decades since, violent crime has dropped and dropped. As a result, public attitudes have softened. {The percentage of Americans}<hyperlink=”http://www.albany.edu/sourcebook/pdf/t2512013.pdf”> who favor the death penalty for murderers, which hit 80 percent in 1994, fell to 60 percent last year. Even more importantly, crime has virtually disappeared as a political issue. In 1994, {according to the University of Albany}<hyperlink=”http://www.albany.edu/sourcebook/pdf/t212012.pdf”>, 37 percent of Americans cited crime or violence as the “most important problem facing the country.” By 2012, it was 2 percent. 

It’s not that many of the white conservatives who once voted Republican because of their fear of crime no longer harbor racialized fears about illegality and public disorder. They still do. But to a large degree, those fears have shifted from black crime to Latino immigration. And this shift has given Paul and other Republicans the space to challenge harsh police tactics and sentencing policies without incurring the wrath of their party base.

In intriguing ways, Rand Paul in 2014 is the mirror image of Bill Clinton in 1992. Clinton won white votes by confronting their stereotype of Democrats as soft on black crime. Paul is trying to win black and other minority votes by confronting their stereotype of Republicans as indifferent to white racism. By 1992, the rise of crime had made liberal Democrats so desperate that they were willing to accept Clinton’s embrace of policies that made them uncomfortable. Today, demographic change is making some conservative Republicans desperate enough to accept Paul’s embrace of policies that make them uncomfortable. If Republicans are smart, they will heed the shifting politics of crime and follow Paul's lead.

When stores are looted and molotov cocktails thrown, it is common and just for law-enforcement officials to identify perpetrators once things have quieted down.

It is less common for officials to pore over video tapes looking for misbehavior among their own. Yet doing so is arguably more important to upholding law and order.  

And there's already a lot of illustrative footage out of Ferguson.

CNN's Jake Tapper put together a short feature on the looting of immigrant-owned stores. As you can see in the video below, the faces of several perpetrators are exposed via surveillance cameras:

I'm confident in the ability of the U.S. justice system to prosecute crimes like that. But what about when an officer of the law is caught on video doing what, at the very minimum, appears to be a crime? Consider {Missouri state law}<hyperlink=”http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/misdemeanor-assault-missouri.htm”> (emphasis added):

A person is guilty of assault in the third degree if he:
attempts to physically injure another person or recklessly causes physical injury to another
negligently causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon
purposely threatens another person, causing that person to feel afraid that he is about to suffer serious physical injury
recklessly engages in conduct that creates a grave risk of death or serious physical injury to another person
intentionally engages in physical contact with another that the victim finds offensive or provocative, with knowledge that the victim will find it offensive or provocative, or
knowingly engages in offensive or provocative contact with an incapacitated person.
(Mo. Ann. Stat. §565.070.)

Now watch this video footage of a police officer advancing on a member of the media—reportedly with a weapon drawn, although that isn't visible in the shot—and audibly threatening to ""shell"" the cameraman if he doesn't turn his light off immediately (presumably with a tear gas or smoke canister, although that isn't entirely clear):

If an armed, black protestor in Ferguson approached a journalist as he broadcasted and threatened to shell him if the he didn't turn off the light on his camera, there's little doubt that authorities would track down the protestor, investigate, and more than likely charge him with a crime.

When order is restored in Ferguson and the prosecutions begin, the fate of this officer will be instructive. If he escapes investigation, it will be another sign that, in Ferguson, there's not even the pretense of equality between black men and white policemen. The way the department treats this officer, who threatened and antagonized a person engaged in a legal activity, will be a clear illustration of how the city sees its authority figures—and, perhaps, why its citizens don't trust them.

Driven by martial rhetoric and the availability of military-style equipment—from bayonets and M-16 rifles to armored personnel carriers—American police forces have often adopted a mind-set previously reserved for the battlefield. The war on drugs and, more recently, post-9/11 antiterrorism efforts have created a new figure on the U.S. scene: the warrior cop—armed to the teeth, ready to deal harshly with targeted wrongdoers, and a growing threat to familiar American liberties.""

Before this transformation, even the most egregiously abusive police officers were dressed and outfitted like civilian lawmen. The image above, for example, is a statue in Birmingham, Alabama, meant to capture the essence of Civil Rights-era police abuses.

With that in mind, take a look at {the powerful photograph}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-police-cite-safety-risk-in-decision-not-to-name-officer-in-shooting.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=LargeMediaHeadlineSum&module=photo-spot-region&region=photo-spot&WT.nav=photo-spot&_r=0”> that Whitney Curtis took for The New York Times in the Missouri towns where residents are protesting the killing of an 18-year-old shot to death by police as he walked to a convenience store. As I write this item, the image is leading the newspaper's Web site:

Of course, not every police officer in Ferguson is dressed that way.

But those three officers are dressed and outfitted such that they could as easily be storming into an ISIS safe house in Iraq. Actually, they are on the streets of an American city, clad in combat gear, squaring off against a nonviolent protestor in a t-shirt and jeans with both of his hands raised over his head. It is easy to see how visuals like these could dissuade people from taking to the streets to assemble in protest of police shootings, as is their moral and Constitutional right. 

A handful of protestors in Ferguson, Missouri have reportedly thrown rocks at police, a wholly unjustified act that ought to result in their arrest and prosecution, if the perpetrators can be identified. But in the image above, the camouflage pants and assault rifles are hardly there to protect against thrown rocks. If the police were dressed as civilians, but with helmets and shields, that would be more understandable. The other bit of necessary context: as mostly black protesters face these pseudo-military troopers to protest what they believe to be a civil rights violation, they're staring at another police excess that disproportionately affects people like them. As the ACLU {noted}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf”> in its report on police militarization:

The use of paramilitary weapons and tactics primarily impacted people of color; when paramilitary tactics were used in drug searches, the primary targets were people of color, whereas when paramilitary tactics were used in hostage or barricade scenarios, the primary targets were white. Overall, 42 percent of people impacted by a SWAT deployment to execute a search warrant were Black and 12 percent were Latino. This means that of the people impacted by deployments for warrants, at least 54 percent were minorities.

Of the deployments in which all the people impacted were minorities, 68 percent were in drug cases, and 61 percent of all the people impacted by SWAT raids in drug cases were minorities. In addition, the incidents we studied revealed stark, often extreme, racial disparities in the use of SWAT locally....

The image in the Times photograph is particularly stark, but is depicting something that happens daily in cities all around the United States with little pushback. Community policing is impossible when officers dress up as occupying soldiers. But there is little chance that this pernicious trend will end anytime soon.

We’ve been through this so many times. Brown, from all reports, was a good kid who had just graduated from high school and was about to enroll in college. But young black men are automatically assumed to be dangerous thugs—and are not given the benefit of the doubt that young white men are accorded. This is racist and wrong, and it must change.

But we should be just as outraged over Knijah’s death—and just as determined that this kind of killing should never happen again.

The entire Prince George’s County police force—not just the homicide division—has been working long hours to try to find Wallace and is motivated by what a police spokesman called a “{sense of moral outrage}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/manhunt-continues-in-weekend-slaying-of-3-year-old-knijah-bibb/2014/08/12/8bd1fece-223b-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html”>.”

That feeling should be universal. The near-constant background noise of black-on-black violence is too often ignored. Yet it continues to claim victims at a rate that our society should consider outrageous and unacceptable.

There are a number of things wrong here. To the extent that killings by the police generate more outrage, it is completely understandable. Police in America are granted wide range of powers by the state including lethal force. With that power comes a special place of honor. When cops are killed the outrage is always different than when citizens are killed. Likewise when cops kill under questionable terms, more scrutiny follows directly from the logic of citizenship. Great power. Great responsibility.

More importantly Robinson's claim is demonstrably false.

It is not ""black on black crime"" that is background noise in America, but the pleas of black people.

There is a pattern here, but it isn't the one Eugene Robinson (for whom I have a great respect) thinks. The pattern is the transmutation of black protest into moral hectoring of black people. Don Imus profanely insults a group of black women. But the real problem is gangsta rap. Trayvon Martin is killed. This becomes a conversation about how black men are bad fathers. Jonathan Martin is bullied mercilessly.

The politics of respectability are, at their root, the politics of changing the subject—the last resort for those who can not bear the agony of looking their country in the eye. The policy of America has been, for most of its history, white supremacy. The high rates of violence in black neighborhoods do not exist outside of these facts—they evidence them.

This history presents us with a suite of hard choices. We do not like hard choices. Here's a better idea: Let's all get together and talk about how Mike Brown would still be alive if Beyoncé would make more wholesome music, followed by a national forum on how the charge of ""acting white"" contributes to mass incarceration.

The journalists, the Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery and the Huffington Post’s Ryan Reilly, were only detained for about 15 minutes before being released, but the incident provoked widespread outrage over the Ferguson police’s increasingly brutal tactics.

It was also illegal.

The arrest and intimidation of journalists for documenting the events in Ferguson is particularly disturbing because it interferes with the ability of the press to hold the government accountable. But actually, anyone—journalist or otherwise—can take a photo of a police officer.

Citizens have the right to take pictures of anything in plain view in a public space, {including police officer}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/photographers-what-do-if-you-are-stopped-or-detained-taking-photographs?redirect=free-speech/know-your-rights-photographersl”>s and federal buildings. Police can not confiscate, demand to view, or delete digital photos. Private property owners can set different rules for recording, but it did not appear from Lowery’s account that the McDonald’s manager was objecting to his video recording.

Some states take issue with video recordings because of their audio element—they claim that the sound recording is akin to surreptitiously eavesdropping on a phone call. (In fact, some states are using this provision {to prosecute people}<hyperlink=”http://gizmodo.com/5553765/are-cameras-the-new-guns”> who post video clips of police abuse.) However, Missouri {is not one of those states}<hyperlink=”http://www.aapsonline.org/judicial/telephone.htm”>. There, you only need the consent of one party to a conversation to hit “record,” and Lowery was that one party.

Police officers frequently ignore these laws. “There is a widespread, continuing pattern of law enforcement officers ordering people to stop taking photographs or video in public places, and harassing, detaining and arresting those who fail to comply,” {wrote ACLU policy analyst Jay Stanley}<hyperlink=”https://www.aclu.org/news/you-have-every-right-photograph-cop?redirect=free-speech/you-have-every-right-photograph-cop”> in 2011, pointing to a rash of photographer arrests and detentions that year.

For those who want to document police activity without risking arrest, media attorney Richard Goehler has this advice, {via Poynter}<hyperlink=”http://www.poynter.org/2010/what-to-do-when-police-tell-you-to-stop-taking-photos-video/103712/”>:

It has also doled out more than 400 other armored vehicles, 500 aircraft, and 93,000 assault rifles.

As The New York Times {reported in June}<hyperlink=”http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=0”>, the Defense Department has been making use of unused military equipment by giving it to local precincts.

This is despite the fact that violent crime in the U.S. has steadily plummeted since 1993. Between 1993 and 2012, the violent-crime rate dropped by nearly 50 percent.

Yet today, local police—in cities and small towns across the country—are increasingly loaded for bear. How did this militarization of the police force come about? It all seems to have started with an obscure section in a defense bill passed more than 20 years ago.

In 1990, Congress passed a National Defense Authorization Act with a clause allowing the ""transfer of excess personal property"" from the Defense Department to local law enforcement—otherwise known as {Section 1208}<hyperlink=”https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/hr2461/text”>. The clause was included in response to the {surge of violent crime}<hyperlink=”http://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537”> and the War on Drugs in the late 1980s. (It's worth noting that at the time, both chambers of Congress were controlled by Democrats.)

Here's the full language of the Section 1208:

SEC 1208. TRANSFER OF EXCESS PERSONAL PROPERTY
(a) TRANSFER AUTHORIZED.—
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject to subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense may transfer to Federal and State agencies personal property of the Department of Defense, including small arms and ammunition, that the Secretary determines is—
(A) suitable for use by such agencies in counter-drug activities; and
(B) excess to the needs of the Department of Defense.
(2) Personal property transferred under this section may be transferred without cost to the recipient agency.
(3) The Secretary shall carry out this section in consultation with the Attorney General and the Director of National Drug Control Policy.
(b) CONDITIONS FOR TRANSFER.—The Secretary may transfer personal property under this section only if—
(1) the property is drawn from existing stocks of the Department of Defense; and
(2) the transfer is made without the expenditure of any funds available to the Department of Defense for the procurement of defense equipment.
(c) APPLICATION.—The authority of the Secretary to transfer personal property under this section shall expire on September 30, 1992.

The transfer program does not foist armored vehicles upon local precincts—asThe Times {explains}<hyperlink=”http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=0”>, ""the pace of transfers depends on how much unneeded equipment the military has, and how much the police request."" And for local police departments with tight budgets, the free gear can be a welcome windfall. But it can also mean a disproportionately armored police force in a town of, say, {21,000}<hyperlink=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson,_Missouri”>.

The Pentagon's transfer program may have been a direct outgrowth of the War on Drugs, but as Alec MacGillis wrote in {The New Republic}<hyperlink=”https://newrepublic.com/article/119081/militarized-police-response-michael-brown-protests-911-legacy”> on Thursday, it's not the only cause of heightened police militarization. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 led to a heightened state of security in the U.S., and that has trickled down to local law enforcement.

On a national level, the current Congress may be expected to reverse the actions of 1990. On Thursday, Sen. Rand Paul {wrote a column in Time}<hyperlink=”http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”> chastising the use of excessive force in Ferguson.

""Police officers risk their lives every day to keep us safe, and any time a young man loses his life in a confrontation with law enforcement, it is tragic.""

We still don't know all the details of what happened Sunday night between a Ferguson police officer and 18-year-old Michael Brown. What we do know is that the police response has made the safety of its own forces a No. 1 priority.

Back in June, a Missouri police captain {told The Times}<hyperlink=”http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=0”> that civilians should be fine with police militarization, so long as it means their public servants are being kept safe.

It doesn't take an expert to see that Ferguson authorities reacted in exactly the wrong way. But experts understand exactly why their behavior was so counterproductive and how they could've easily brought about a much better outcome.

They are hardly the first police agency to bungle mass protests in this way, after all. Lessons have been learned elsewhere. They're just lost on the vast majority of Americans, including those in law enforcement. The {whole article}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/08/14/after-ferguson-how-should-police-respond-to-protests/”> is worth your read. 

Balko draws on the work of a pioneering police chief, Jerry Wilson, explaining his belief that ""an intimidating police presence didn’t prevent confrontation, it invited it. That didn’t mean he didn’t prepare, but he put his riot-control teams in buses, then parked the buses close by, but out of sight of protesters. Appearances were important."" He explains the errors police officers made during the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle. Another source, who works for the Dallas Police Department and is writing a post-graduate thesis on policing and protest, Major Max Geron, explained that police interacting with protestors should ""come to an agreement about what’s expected, what’s allowed, and most important, you want to reach an agreement about what won’t be allowed,” but should avoid arbitrary prohibitions, like a demand that protestors disperse at a particular time—a tactic used in Ferguson—because it needlessly provokes rebellion and interferes with the right to protest even when no laws are being broken.

The article continues:

Geron also emphasizes personalization, pointing out that when police show up in full riot garb, especially gear that covers their faces, they dehumanize themselves to protesters. This is especially dangerous when the protests are against the police themselves, as was the case in Ferguson. “You make all of your officers look like one another. To the protesters, to the people, your officers are no longer individual human beings with faces. You’ve just made each of them a faceless symbol of the police institution that the protesters are reacting against.”

There's a lot more to the article—like I said, read the whole thing. Balko concludes by noting that there is not, in fact, ""a zero-sum relationship between officer safety and less aggressive, less militaristic more community-oriented policing."" Police can make themselves less safe by being overly aggressive and militaristic.

All I'd add is that prior to this week's events in Ferguson and the press's unusual response to them, most police officers received from their subculture and American culture generally the most counterproductive message possible: that extreme aggression and overt militarization confers upon them safety, respect, and esteem. In fact, it has allowed them to tap into the esteem previously reserved for U.S. troops. Policemen doing so quickly became normalized in scenes playing out across the country, mostly unnoticed. Let's take an example at random. On March 23, 2012, the Minnesota Wild, a National Hockey League team, were playing at home. The ceremonial puck drop before the game unfolded as in the photo at right.


That is not a special forces soldier dangling from the roof of the arena in camouflage. As Reuters explains, ""Minnesota Wild center Mikko Koivu hands a puck to officer Joe Reginek of the St. Paul Police SWAT team for a ceremonial puck drop after Reginek rappelled to the ice from the rafters."" This stunt was conceived by all parties with the expectation that it would delight the crowd and generate nothing but positive press. And that's exactly what happened. Those in the arena who didn't hear the announcement over the loudspeaker doubtless thought that theywere watching a young enlistee back from fighting in Afghanistan or soon to deploy abroad. 

Another example: Redwood City, California has a population of 79,000. In 2011 and 2012 it reported zero murders. Here is the Redwood City Police Department SWAT team training in 2013:

How their green camouflage would aid them in a real urban school shooting is hard to fathom (as is the utility of their obscured faces in a scenario where the school shooter in question acquired the same outfit and face mask that they wear). Of course, they're unlikely to face a school-shooting scenario, but they surely don't let their outfits and equipment collect dust. Who in Redwood City has been exposed to them? The question is never asked when the training session is written up and photographed by news agencies who don't see anything worthy of inquiry. 

And note that, contrary to some press reports, this trend predates the September 11 terrorist attacks. Here's a photograph from 1997 of two Los Angeles police officers:

Wouldn't it be fascinating to know how many times that M-16 has been fired in the intervening years, and in what circumstances? 

The trappings of a military force doesn't just affect how the policed see those policing. It affects who decides to be a police officer. I grew up 10 minutes from Newport Beach, California, one of America's wealthiest and safest cities. Knowing what it's like I can't help but laugh at its police recruitment video, and the wildly misleading impression it gives recruits of what the job will be like:

As Balko says in {yet another vital piece}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/04/16/the-disturbing-messages-in-police-recruiting-videos/”>, this reflects what leadership in that department regards as the kind of police work that it wants to emphasize and glorify. Community policing, helping people, and deescalating conflict are nowhere to be found. After featuring videos from around the United States that were just as bad or worse, he included a rare example of a good police recruiting video.

Consider the difference in the applicant it is trying to attract:

The officers in that latter video will strike most people in this article as the ones they'd want policing their neighborhood. But their type is not venerated in the movies or television shows that we watch. Neither is it lauded in most American police departments. There are training methods, cultural conceits, and a martial culture that America uses to surround those we send abroad to kill declared enemies. And when police departments and officers adopted that same culture to prepare and surround those meant to protect and serve on America's streets, we thought it was cool.

And if history is any indicator, it will happen again unless we reform our nation's law-enforcement policies now.

As the tragedies have multiplied—the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown; the deployment of military vehicles and rubber bullets to disperse protesters; the arrests and teargassing of journalists and citizens for exercising their constitutional rights of free assembly and speech—the callous disregard for human dignity displayed by the Ferguson police has raised alarms both nationally and internationally.

Last week, as these tragedies began to unfold, the United Nations was reviewing our nation's compliance with the {Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination}<hyperlink=”http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx”>, also known as CERD. CERD is an international treaty the United States ratified in 1994, formally committing to reduce racial discrimination within our borders. Trayvon Martin's mother and Jordan Davis's father were in Geneva telling their stories of how racial bias in our criminal-justice system contributed to the recent shooting deaths of their children. International experts gathered in Geneva also had many questions about the situation in Ferguson.

This is not the first, second, or even the 10th time that tragedies like those in Ferguson have occurred. In just the few days following the shooting in Ferguson, New Orleans police shot Armand Bennett, an unarmed 26-year-old black man, in the head. On the other side of the country, Los Angeles police fatally shot Ezell Ford, an unarmed 25-year-old black man with a mental disability, three times. These deaths happen regularly and continuously. The majority do not draw the national attention bestowed on Michael Brown or the 1999 New York police shooting of Amadou Diallo, but that alone doesn't make them any less tragic or outrageous.

Police are charged with serving and protecting the community. But as the community reacted to this tragedy with a peaceful demonstration of anguish, the police responded with excessive military-style force—treating the demonstrators as adversaries, not as neighbors. The wrongheaded decision to use tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse peaceful demonstrators, most of whom were people of color, stems from deep and tragic roots that include the 1965 Bloody Sunday march in Selma, Ala.

The lingering and toxic racial disparities that have shaped our society have also distorted our ability to respond to them. If police departments haven't yet learned lessons from Selma or New York City, we must take swift action to write them into law. Racial profiling is an ineffective law-enforcement practice that violates the human rights of the people targeted. There are concrete steps that the Justice Department and Congress can take to outlaw it.

{Federal guidance from the Justice Department}<hyperlink=”https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2010/12/15/guidance_on_race.pdf”> prohibits some federal law-enforcement officials from engaging in racial profiling some of the time. It does not apply to state and local police, who are more likely to engage in routine law-enforcement activities, such as the traffic and pedestrian stops that have led to recent shootings. The guidance doesn't prohibit profiling on the basis of religion (for instance, policing that targets Muslims and Sikhs), or national origin (for instance, policing that targets Mexicans or people of Middle Eastern descent). The Justice Department's guidance also includes broad and vaguely worded exemptions for ""national security"" and ""border integrity,"" matters that render it entirely inadequate to protect a broad cross-section of communities.

About five years ago, the Justice Department announced an incremental step toward updating this guidance by creating a working group of various agencies to review these concerns. America is still waiting for the results of this long overdue review.

When the review is released, the Obama administration should act on the working group's recommendations immediately. Congress could pass the {End Racial Profiling Act}<hyperlink=”https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1038”>, which would prohibit the use of profiling on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion by all law-enforcement agencies. The bill has been introduced several times by Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., but continues to languish without any serious congressional action in either chamber.

We applaud Attorney General Eric Holder for opening an investigation into the shooting. But moving forward, the Justice Department should more proactively exercise its broad jurisdiction to investigate, prosecute, and cut funding to local police forces engaging in excessive use of force.

Here is why: Profiling results in a loss of trust and confidence in law enforcement. In the incidents that claimed the lives of Brown, Bennett, Ford, and Diallo, racial profiling appears to have led to death. Fortunately, there are also proven steps that local law enforcement can take to prevent these tragedies from recurring. For example, local law enforcement can build relationships of trust with residents and hire officers who live in the communities they police.

Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. History may be repeating itself yet again in Ferguson, but we should do all we can to prevent these tragedies from continuing to occur.

The officer was identified by Ferguson police Friday morning as Darren Wilson, a six-year veteran of the force. Officials also released police reports and surveillance-camera photos that showed Brown as the primary suspect in a strong-arm robbery of a convenience store sometime before he was shot and killed Saturday afternoon.

But Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Friday afternoon that the robbery and Wilson's encounter with Brown on the street were separate, unrelated incidents. Thomas said that Brown and another man police believe was involved in the robbery were ""walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic,"" prompting Wilson to stop them.

Jackson said that Wilson was not aware Brown was a suspect in the robbery when the officer approached and stopped Brown.

Officers found evidence of merchandise that was reported stolen by the convenience store on Brown's body following the shooting, Jackson said. Dorian Johnson, the man police have said they believe was Brown's accomplice in the robbery, has been cleared of criminal wrongdoing, Jackson said.

In an {interview}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”> with MSNBC on Tuesday, Johnson described witnessing the shooting of his friend.

Armored trucks {""intended for an overseas battlefield,""}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html”> M-16 rifles and grenade launchers have become everyday tech in local police departments across the country.

Although military technology has arguably given law enforcement an unreasonable amount of power, there is another piece of technology that could help restrain the militarization of America's police in the future: a camera.

Ferguson police reportedly ordered civilians to turn off cameras and recording devices on Wednesday. But what would have last night looked like if the police had to wear their own devices?

In 2012, Rialto, a small city in California's San Bernardino County, outfitted its police officers with small Body Cams to be worn at all times and record all working hours. The {$900 cameras weighed 108 grams}<hyperlink=”http://www.parsac.org/parsac-www/pdf/Bulletins/14-005_Report_BODY_WORN_CAMERAS.pdf”> and were small enough to fit on each officer's collar or sunglasses. They recorded full-color video for up to 12 hours, which was automatically uploaded at the end of each shift, where it could be held and analyzed in a central database. 

When researchers studied the effect of cameras on police behavior, the conclusions were striking. Within a year, the number of complaints filed against police officers in Rialto fell by 88 percent and ""use of force"" fell by 59 percent. “When you put a camera on a police officer, they tend to behave a little better, follow the rules a little better,” Chief William A. Farrar, the Rialto police chief, told the {New York Times}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/us/in-california-a-champion-for-police-cameras.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0”>. “And if a citizen knows the officer is wearing a camera, chances are the citizen will behave a little better.”

The Rialto Study now serves as a centerpiece in the national debate about arming police officers with recording devices, and other California units are {leading the charge}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/us/in-california-a-champion-for-police-cameras.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0”>. But there remain concerns about the practice, which break down across three categories: cost, rights, and the study's veracity.

At $900, the devices employed in Rialto would rack up a prodigious cost for cities like New York, which employs 35,000 police officers. (That's $31 million in police cameras.) On the other hand, as a Washington, D.C., report {pointed out}<hyperlink=””>, such devices would also save money, not only by reducing lawsuits against the police force but also by helping the force to dismiss cases in court with digital evidence proving that police acted appropriately. Allegations of excessive or unnecessary force; unlawful stops, searches, or frisks; unwarranted arrests, tickets, threats, or traffic stops; and disrespectful demeanors or profanity would all {""be easier to resolve with the use of video footage}<hyperlink=”http://policecomplaints.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/office%20of%20police%20complaints/publication/attachments/Final%20policy%20rec%20body%20camera.pdf”>,"" the city concluded.

An area of greater concern for many civilians might be privacy. Do Americans really want police officers taping events that happen in public places or recording information in people's homes, even when they enter legally? As one report on body cameras {wrote}<hyperlink=”http://policecomplaints.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/office%20of%20police%20complaints/publication/attachments/Final%20policy%20rec%20body%20camera.pdf”>:

There are hidden social and ethical costs to the inescapable panopticonic gaze itself. If BWCs become common, it means more electronic surveillance, more digitized tagging of individuals, and arguably more challenges to privacy rights.

Finally, Rialto is a small city, with a population of just 100,000, and there are reasonable concerns about grafting the findings of a one-year study onto the the rest of the country. In the study, complaints about officers declined from 24 to 3. Yes, that's a 88 percent decline. But it's also a numerical decline of 21, which sounds less impressive.

Last night's shock-and-awe campaign against the citizens of Ferguson was a noxious stew of racial resentment, overreaction, under-preparedness, and a militarized police unit. A camera pinned to a shoulder is not going to fix all of these problems. But it does offer a simple technological solution to America's warrior-police problem, which has been exacerbated by all the wrong technology. Something has to police the police.

Our holy place was Sportsman’s Park, the brooding, gothic pile of steel on St. Louis's North Side, where the city’s two professional baseball teams, the Cardinals and the Browns, played. From the outside on a dark night, the ballpark loomed up like a cathedral, a study in hooded arches. At first you glimpsed only flashes of green sliced by rusting steel columns. It took a minute to adjust to this—baseball was still in black and white on television, and here was a new world of blinding whites and greens. The chalky basepaths and the balls themselves seemed to be an unworldly, incandescent white.

The crowd was white, too—except for one section, the pavilion in right field. There, a phalanx of black faces looked back at us with what I imagined to be stony stares, pebbles on a green lawn, facing the concrete of all colors. Black people were limited first by law and then by custom to sitting only in the right-field stands. I remember wondering what they thought of this arrangement. Perhaps they did not find it unusual. St. Louis was then—and still is—{one of the most segregated cities in America.}<hyperlink=”http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Data/Report/report2.pdf”>

This sad history came to mind this week as St. Louis erupted in protests and looting following {the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown}<hyperlink=”http://www.thewire.com/national/2014/08/protests-turn-into-looting-after-shooting-of-unarmed-black-teenager/375848/”> in the North Side suburb of Ferguson. Brown, a college-bound student, was shot to death by a police officer even though he was apparently unarmed. Soon after the shooting, the protestors were squaring off against police lines; after lining up, the protestors turned their backs on the officers in a symbolic gesture. It was like being in Sportsman’s Park, with black and white crowds facing off across an abyss.

There is no large city in America more burdened by racial tension and mutual suspicion than St. Louis. The racial and economic problems that have beset America’s cities are particularly intense in my hometown. Despite the city’s large black population, the single black person I met during my childhood in the 1950s was my parents’ housekeeper, Willie Brown. She would arrive at our house once a week and go to the basement to change into her maid’s dress. St. Louis is the city that produced Miles Davis, Chuck Berry, and Josephine Baker. Yet when Michael Brown died, white and black residents quickly drew back to their default positions of mutual distrust: Black people took to the streets to express their anger, while white citizens expressed dismay at the chaos.

There are echoes of this throughout the city’s history. Almost a century ago, on July 2, 1917, the Illinois city of East St. Louis erupted into a week-long race riot—the worst in American history, with an estimated 300 deaths. The precipitating event was a rumor that a white man had been killed by a black man—a mirror of Michael Brown’s death.

In 1949, just a few blocks from my beloved Sportsman’s Park, the echo appeared again. Here stood the largest public swimming pool in the nation: Fairground Park Pool, opened in 1913. It had limestone-and-brick bathhouses and a circular pool that was 440 feet across. Nineteen lifeguards watched over the thousands of swimmers who came every day.

In those sweltering, fetid summers before air-conditioning, the pools were always crowded. Though it was a municipal facility and theoretically open to all, Fairground Pool was in practice an all-white, segregated preserve. But as the city's black population slowly began to expand into the North Side, pressure built to allow access for all. In 1949, a new Democratic mayor, Joseph Darst, took office in St. Louis. Elected on the coattails of another popular Missourian, Harry Truman, Darst put his campaign manager, John O'Toole, in charge of the city's pools and parks. O'Toole said he ""could see no basis for keeping Negroes out of the pools. They are citizens like everybody else and have every legal right to enter any public facility."" O'Toole announced that Fairground Park Pool would be open to all on the first day of the season, June 21.

Belatedly recognizing the potential for tension, Darst attempted to convince the city's TV stations and newspapers to play down the story. The Post-Dispatch buried it, but the Globe-Democrat splashed the news across its front page: ""Pools and Playgrounds Opened to Both Races."" When the pool opened that afternoon, about 30 black and 200 white swimmers lined up, eyeing each other nervously. As the swimmers entered and played uneasily in the water, maintaining careful distance from one another, a large, unruly crowd of white people gathered outside the gates of the pool, ""nearly all of them carrying baseball bats, sticks, and clubs,” according to an oral history of St. Louis in the collection of the city’s Mercantile Library. A half-dozen police officers arrived and began escorting away the black people who were leaving the pool. But they made no effort to disperse the crowd. A few older men began haranguing the teenagers: ""You want to know how to take care of them niggers? Get bricks and smash their heads."" As evening approached, groups of white people began threatening black people who approached the pool and randomly beating those who were leaving, chasing them and shouting, ""There're some niggers!"" One besieged black youth pulled a knife and beat a 20-year-old white cement-company worker. Police rushed to his rescue.

By the evening, the crowd had grown to 5,000, swollen by baseball fans arriving for the Cardinals' game against the Giants that night. The riots only got worse—they did not stop until after midnight. Miraculously, no one died—though ten black people and two white people had been hospitalized.

One of the African American swimmers at Fairground Pool that day, Walter Hayes, later recalled, ""I never knew that hatred actually traveled in waves. I could feel and see those hate waves, similar to heat waves coming at you on a hot, sunny day in a desert, coming from the crowd. It was an eerie feeling.""

Then, and now, the root cause of the violence was segregation. During and after the Depression, thousands of African American families had migrated up the Mississippi to St. Louis. The New York Times editor Gerald Boyd, who grew up in the city, remembered, “Blacks filed off the highways and out of the train depots into slums that were already brimming with new transplants. Jobs were plentiful in huge plants producing everything from beer to bricks, from shoes to steel. But not everyone found work, and in close quarters, crime and illness were on the rise.”

Virtually all of the area's major retail businesses were downtown—retailers had not yet followed the white community to the suburbs—so the center city was the only place to shop. But black people were routinely refused service at the lunch counters at department stores, dime stores, and drugstores. At some places, African Americans were allowed to eat—but only if they were standing up. They called it “vertical segregation.""

At movie theatres like the rococo Fox Theatre, black people were allowed in only one week a year, called Brotherhood Week. Blacks were not welcome at all in the Forest Park Highlands, the amusement park where my friends and I spent summer afternoons. They could ride city buses, but the schools were segregated. The ballpark itself was an island of green surrounded by one of the largest pockets of poverty in the city. When the young piano prodigy Bobby Short first played for a week at the St. Louis Theatre in 1937, he had to eat in his dressing room because the nearby restaurants would not serve him. When I met Short years later, and we talked about his time in St. Louis, he did not mention this experience.

In recent years, African-Americans have slowly moved out of the inner city into the ring of suburbs that surrounds St. Louis. But even there, the city’s historical pattern of racial separation prevails in the rigidly monochromatic suburbs. Michael Brown died in Ferguson, where blacks represent two-thirds of the population of 21,000—but only three of the 53 police officers.

This is what race looks like in the usually warm-hearted city where I grew up, what race has looked like for decades. As William Faulkner famously wrote, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”

This Ferguson, Missouri episode is obviously about race, and is (another) occasion for pointing readers to Ta-Nehisi Coates's powerful ""{Reparations}<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/”>"" article. It is also about how we govern ourselves, and about how far the ramifying self-damage of the post-9/11 era has gone.

""Self-damage""?

In Compton, the local police union says its officers are hardly alone in seeking such weapons:

Currently, the following School Districts authorize their Police Officers to deploy these weapons; Los Angeles School PD, Baldwin Park School PD, Santa Ana School PD, Fontana School PD, San Bernandino School PD.

The police union goes on to {defend}<hyperlink” http://laist.com/2014/08/18/compton_school_police_will_be.php”> the semi-automatic rifle for campus police officers:

If we encounter an active mass murderer on campus with a rifle or body armor, our officers may not adequately be prepared to stop that suspect. School Police Officers will undergo a training course, followed by a shooting proficiency test on a firing range and a written exam. The rifles are designed for increased accuracy and use rifled ammunition than can pierce body armor. The safety of our Students, Staff, and Parents are very important to us.

 In a recent New York Times item, Ross Douthat rebutted just that sort of argument.

He {says}<hyperlink”http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/arms-and-the-cop/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0”> of school shootings:

...the evidence that such sprees are sharply increasing is {shaky and debatable}<hyperlink” https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/12/17/graph-of-the-day-perhaps-mass-shootings-arent-becoming-more-common/”>, and the evidence that a more militarized police is necessarily crucial to stopping such killers seems thin as well. In Sandy Hook, for instance, the killer committed suicide about ninety seconds after the cops arrived; in Aurora, the killer surrendered to police; at Virginia Tech, the killer shot himself rather than engage with police. (At Columbine, things were more complicated: there were cops surrounding the school who didn’t fully engage until the SWAT teams arrived, which could be a case that the average cop should be trained more like a SWAT member … except that then the SWAT teams moved extremely slowly through the school as well, because even heavily armed and armored cops can be—understandably—loath to rush in without knowing how many active shooters they’re facing.)

From the D.C. sniper (picked up at a rest stop) to the Isla Vista killer (dead by suicide after a car chase), there just aren’t that many recent cases where a spree killer has gone down, Symbionese Liberation Army-style, after a long siege or in a hail of bullets that only a militarized police unit could deliver, or where specialized equipment has made all the difference to the cops. It’s much more common for such killers to either take their own lives or surrender, and when they’ve been stopped by {return fire from cops, }<hyperlink” http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/07/us/california-college-gunman/index.html?hpt=hp_t2”> it’s usually been {regular police units}<hyperlink” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lake_shootings”> rather than SWAT teams that have done the necessary work.

None of this means, again, that SWAT teams shouldn’t exist; it should just cast doubt on the idea that every police department needs SWAT equipment and lots of it, and that arming them accordingly will make all the difference when a psychopath comes calling. 

The campus officers in Compton are expected to be trained and have the new weapons within a month. And the nationwide trend of militarized police officers continues, even in schools with heavily armed city and county police agencies nearby. It's easy to imagine a lot of areas where extra training would benefit Compton's school resource officers—and hard to imagine AR-15 training is high on the list.

(The New York Times has a {good rundown}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-missouri-town-under-siege-after-police-shooting.html”> of what we know for certain about Brown's death so far.)

What is not up for debate, however, is that since he was shot to death on Aug. 9, Brown has been the subject of character assassination by the police and by the media.

""Gang signs""

After Trayvon Martin, an unarmed, black 17-year-old, was killed by a neighborhood watchman in 2012, commentators tried to justify his death with photos of Martin throwing up ""gang signs""—which amounted to photos of him {flipping off the camera}<hyperlink=”http://www.mrconservative.com/2013/07/21719-10-photos-that-show-the-real-trayvon-martin/”>, smoking, and wearing a backwards baseball cap—as evidence that Martin was a ""thug.""

Similarly, the shooting of Michael Brown by a law-enforcement officer has undergone media thuggification. A {tweet}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/498515338833567745”> from NBC News—which depicted an unsmiling Brown throwing a peace sign—sparked outrage among Twitter users, and led to the creation of the hashtag {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=”http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/if-they-gunned-me-down”> to ask, ""If they gunned me down, which picture would they use?"" In tweets, users juxtaposed edgier photos of themselves with more wholesome photos—in a {cap and gown,smiling with family}<hyperlink=”http://iftheygunnedmedown.tumblr.com/post/94854719278/alireza301-iftheygunnedmedown-which-pic-would”>, or in a {military uniform}<hyperlink=”http://iftheygunnedmedown.tumblr.com/post/94835146933/taketheshot-iftheygunnedmedown”>. The growth of the hashtag in the days after the shooting helped bring national attention to Brown's death.

Since its first tweet about the story, NBC has {illustrated its stories}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/LandLordBrasi/status/498625226133868544”> about Brown with a photo of him wearing headphones and a varsity jacket.

Robbery footage

The media's {distortion of black victims}<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/media-black-victims_n_5673291.html”> is nothing new. But rarely does the police department investigating a crime so thoroughly confuse the press about the context of a victim's death.

That is precisely what Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson appeared to do Friday. On that morning, Jackson called a press conference to release the name of the officer who killed Brown. Along with the officer's name—Darren Wilson—Jackson {released surveillance footage}<hyperlink=”https://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/ferguson-police-name-officer-who-killed-michael-brown-20140815”> from a strong-arm robbery at a convenience store, which allegedly showed Brown ""towering over"" the shop owner and stealing a carton of cigarillos (value: $48.99).

Naturally, the press had many questions about the robbery footage, but Jackson refused to take any questions. He instead asked reporters to ""digest"" the information and reconvene in the afternoon for another press conference at which he would take questions.

Many reporters assumed—not unreasonably!—that the robbery must have somehow directly led to Brown's shooting. And indeed, the media proceeded to speculate about how the robbery footage was connected to Brown's death for most of the day on Friday, until Jackson {revealed}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-chief-encounter-between-officer-and-michael-brown-did-not-relate-to-robbery/”> that the robbery was, in fact, in no way connected to Brown's shooting.

While it may seem that six hours is not enough time to mislead the public, it was ample time for national outlets to repeatedly play the footage, and treat it as a key factor in the case.

Brown's family {has said}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/statement-from-michael-browns-family-and-attorneys-beyond-outraged/”> that the piecemeal manner in which the police have released information about Brown suggests an attempt to craft a narrative that would ultimately justify his death.

Marijuana in his system

On Monday, an anonymous source familiar with the investigation into Brown's death {told The Washington Post}<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/county-investigation-michael-brown-was-shot-from-the-front-had-marijuana-in-his-system/”> that, at the time of his death, Brown had marijuana in his system.

Conservative thought leaders such as {the Drudge Report}<hyperlink=” https://twitter.com/DRUDGE_REPORT/status/501409931916877824”> and {Rush Limbaugh}<hyperlink=”501415421388791808http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2014/08/audio-rush-limbaugh-on-the-michael-brown-stolen-cigars-swisher-sweet-is-purchased-by-people-who-love-marijuana/”> seized on this new bit of information. But smoking pot is hardly a smoking gun, nor is it indicative of a criminal mind (as Coloradans and Washingtonians would attest). As some {pointed out}<hyperlink=” sbjHOBJzhb0https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedAndrew/status/”>, the past three presidents in office have all smoked marijuana. And even if Brown did suffer from some form of {Reefer Madness}<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=”>, marijuana can remain detectable in toxicology reports long after its effects have worn off.

As Nicole Flatow {points out}<hyperlink=”http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/18/3472567/the-racist-history-of-marijuana-character-assassination/”>, marijuana is often used to paint black victims as aggressive or paranoid—as George Zimmerman's attorney {argued about Martin}<hyperlink=”http://healthland.time.com/2013/06/02/viewpoint-from-aggressive-trayvon-to-laid-back-dzhokhar-marijuanas-changing-image/”>—while white victims who happen to smoke pot are often not as stigmatized.

Anonymous stories

Given the dearth of information about what happened on Aug. 9, the media has been scrambling for anyone who may have information on the shooting.

The latest information comes from an anonymous account by a woman who claimed to know Wilson. On Friday, the conservative talk-show host Dana Loesch {received an anonymous call}<hyperlink=” http://www.971talk.com/blogs/dana-show-blog/audio-demand/exclusive-caller-claims-be-friends-darren-wilson-knows-his-side”> from a woman going by the name ""Josie,"" who said she knew Wilson's side of the story.

She said she had heard the story on Facebook from Wilson's ""significant other."" Here is the entire transcript of what ""Josie"" told Loesch:

[tweetbegin 501444867600687105 tweetend] The problem with ""Josie's"" story, however, is that it closely resembles a Facebook post supposedly written by Darren Wilson, telling his side of the story. A CNN producer eventually {debunked the post as fake}<hyperlink=”http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/17/hoax-facebook-posting-from-darren-wilson-details-shooting/”>.

With no scheduled press conferences with Ferguson police on Monday, and Wilson himself having gone AWOL, national media turned back to Loesch's interview. To litigate Brown's shooting in the court of public opinion, national outlets like CNN {have started using ""Josie's"" story}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/DLoesch/status/501458515383558144”> to represent Wilson's point of view.

""Source w/detailed knowledge of investigation into shooting tells CNN account of caller to KTFK matches account of Officer Darren Wilson,"" CNN anchor Jake Tapper {tweeted}<hyperlink=” https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/501429393932431360”> on Monday.

According to CNN host {Don Lemon}<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lauf93kPVbY”>, ""a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation ... says that the account of a caller to St. Louis radio station KTFK matches the account of officer Darren Wilson as to what happened at the time of the shooting.""

So, ironically, CNN is now taking as fact an account that is essentially the same story it already debunked.

""For many conservatives, especially those of us living in nice, comfy suburbs, it’s hard to apply the 'power corrupts' doctrine to law enforcement because we’ve never seen corrupted enforcers of the law,"" he writes. ""We’ve never been wrongly arrested. We’ve never witnessed our children put in jail based on the false reports of police officers. We’ve never seen our neighbors beaten or tased without cause. And in the extremely unlikely scenario that a police officer drove into our neighborhood and murdered our unarmed friend in cold blood, we cannot possibly fathom a scenario where the justice system wouldn’t be on our side and where that police officer wouldn’t spend the rest of his life in jail.""

Personal experience shapes attitudes more powerfully than anything else. But it wasn't a run-in with the law that changed me. Video killed my trust in police officers. On March 3, 1991, or shortly thereafter, I watched a TV news report like this one:

Until that day, my 11-year-old's notion of race in America included an awareness of slavery, which seemed like ancient history; knowledge of Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks as venerated heroes from the distant past; and the Cosby family from the eponymous TV show, who established my notion of a contemporary black family. Then the Rodney King beating happened an hour's drive from my house, and less than six months later, after an overwhelmingly white jury acquitted the police officers who did the beating, the L.A. riots began. These events forced suburban Californians my age to confront parts of reality we'd never imagined. I couldn't grok why police officers would attack a man like that, or how a jury could acquit them, but I'd seen it with my own eyes. The incident didn't turn me against all law enforcement, but I started to believe that there were good cops and bad cops. Soon after, I was in the car with my mom when she got pulled over for a speeding ticket and wondered, slightly fearfully, if we'd get a bad cop. The officer turned out to be perfectly polite, of course. I didn't yet understand that he might or might not have behaved the same if we'd been a black family. 

As events in Ferguson, Missouri unfold, several observers have noticed that ""this time is different."" Unlike during past instances of police officers killing or assaulting young black men in suspicious though not yet demonstrably criminal circumstances, some prominent conservatives are doubting the official police narrative or criticizing their militarized response to protesters. Some attribute this to a growing libertarian influence in the GOP, and it's no accident that Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has offered [one of the strongest calls for police reform]<hyperlink=”http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”>.

My colleagues [Peter Beinart]<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/this-time-its-different-the-conservative-response-to-ferguson/378546/”> and [Ross Douthat]<hyperlink=”http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/trusting-the-police/?module=BlogPost-ReadMore&version=Blog%20Main&action=Click&contentCollection=Opinion&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body&_r=0#more-20279”> persuasively argue that falling crime has made the American public less inclined to reflexively side with police, which has changed political incentives. Douthat posits that this is a generational shift.

But when it comes to how reflexively or instinctively cops are presumed to be truthful and honorable, the importance of video shouldn't be discounted. A generation ago, footage of police officers in the Deep South turning snarling dogs and firehoses on Civil Rights protesters made a deep impression on my parents, even though they grew up a continent away in an overwhelmingly white suburb where their personal experiences would've made police behaving that way seem unfathomable. Watching Jim Crow's enforcers with their own eyes couldn't be ignored. If anyone thought in 1991 that such brutality was a vestige of the past, or something that could only happen among racist cops in the South, the Rodney King tape disabused them of that notion, kicking off an era of cheap, increasingly ubiquitous recording equipment that was bound to capture more police misbehavior.

Of course young people growing up with YouTube will trust police officers less. The many videos of brutality don't lie—and they confirm that, sometimes, cops do lie. 

Even more often, they hold their tongues.

It wasn't a run-in with the law that killed my trust in police officers—video did.

""Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances,"" Senator Paul wrote in his op-ed. ""There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement."" He went on to talk about police militarization. But there is another systemic problem in law enforcement. Even good people in uniform routinely fail to report on bad colleagues. They don't engage in certain unsavory behavior themselves. But when other cops do, they look the other way. Nearly every law enforcement agency in America has within its ranks an unofficial code of loyalty to good and bad officers alike.

This is evident in the Rodney King tape. As Peter Jennings said way back in 1991, it was ""a story that might never have surfaced if someone wouldn't have picked up his home video camera""—a judgment he rendered, and that we all know to be true, despite the fact that there weren't just five officers beating on King, there were also numerous other police officers standing around watching. This is a pattern that repeats itself again and again in documented instances of police abuse. My colleague Ta-Nehisi Coates has addressed [the canard]<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/08/black-people-are-not-ignoring-black-on-black-crime/378629/”> that black people ignore black-on-black violence. I'd only add that I've heard a lot more denunciations of black-on-black violence from black people, black leaders—hell, even black [rappers]<hyperlink=”https://vimeo.com/27788482”>—than I've heard rank-and-file police officers denouncing ""blue-on-black"" or even ""blue-on-white"" violence perpetrated by fellow officers. The only such statements I can ever recall came from police brass under political pressure to distance themselves from underlings caught misbehaving. I don't necessarily think police officers are less likely than people in other professions to tell on misbehaving colleagues. But the stakes are rather different, and their job is to enforce the rules, even when fellow officers break them.

Take another look at the police officer who pepper-sprayed the peaceful student protest at UC Davis. Eventually he lost his job for this act, after months of near universal denunciation. But instead of watching him this time, look at how many of his colleagues are standing around, some of them averting their eyes, none objecting:

Take another look at the moment when NYPD Deputy Inspector Anthony Balonga pepper-sprays a small group of captive women already corralled by other officers:

That is a man supremely confident that his nearby NYPD colleagues will neither stop him nor file a complaint about his abuse of protestors who posed no threat to anyone. But for the fact that he was caught on video he never would've been disciplined.

Heather MacDonald of City Journal, who has reported on police departments all over the United States, regularly assures readers that the NYPD is one of the best in the nation. Yet when NYPD officer Adrian Schoolcraft [spent months secretly recording evidence of legal violations and policy violations in the 81st precinct]<hyperlink=”http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/414/right-to-remain-silent?act=2#play”>, he wasn't documenting behavior that had already been reported to internal affairs and investigated. Other cops were likely bothered by misbehavior that was going on. But he was the only one to expose it. Other police officers knew that if they objected aggressively they'd be risking their jobs, or their status among fellow officers, or their chances for advancement, so they kept quiet. That doesn't make them bad people. It does make them an illustration of why police officers cannot be reflexively trusted by the public: powerful incentives regularly cause them to show greater loyalty to colleagues than the public, a pattern that exists in just about every institution. Police officers should be no more and no less trusted than Catholic priests, Penn State football coaches, or GM recall managers.

Yet they're often afforded a presumption that their version of events is true, no matter how many times individual cops are caught falsifying reports or lying on the stand. 

They knew that if they objected they'd be risking their jobs, status, or chances for advancement, so they kept quiet. They're not bad people, but it's why police officers cannot be reflexively trusted by the public.

In that item from The Federalist quoted at the beginning of this article, Hans Fiene urges conservatives who reflexively trust the police to show a bit more skepticism. ""Police brutality is not the Bogeyman,"" he writes. ""It’s not an urban legend witnessed by none but told by many. It’s not a myth created by a primitive tribe that is too simple to understand the true source of the brokenness in its communities. Black people believe in police brutality for the same reason they believe in rain—because they’ve felt it ... For those of us who have never experienced law enforcement corrupted by power, basic human decency should require that we try to understand and consider the perspective of those who have...""

That's true. But trusting that minority groups aren't fabricating police misconduct isn't even as necessary as it was for, say, the white suburbanite of 1985, limited by what he'd seen with his eyes, read in the local paper, or watched on CBS. Any doubt that excessive force by law enforcement is a widespread problem can now be laid to rest in a single hour with nothing more than access to YouTube.

Or [here]<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgg3C9bxGRw”>. If you keep searching, you'll come to the conclusion that this sort of violence is epidemic long before you run out of video confirmation. Then remember the vast majority of these incidents are never videotaped. 

The answer isn't to stop respecting all police officers, or to assume that any allegation of police misconduct is true. Even officers involved in suspicious killings, like the one in Ferguson, Missouri, deserve a fair hearing from the public. No one knows for sure what happened when Mike Brown was killed, and while the reaction of local police to protesters does not inspire confidence, the objective ought to be an impartial, accurate investigation by a credible, independent party.

But in the age of YouTube and Google, where police brutality can be seen from the comfort of one's home, along with documentation from dozens of serious law enforcement scandals, there is no longer any valid excuse for being blind to bad cops generally, or denying the possibility that an officer could have callously killed an unarmed man. 

In my generation, an increasing number of people will reach the conclusion that when a dispute arises pitting the word of law enforcement against the word of the policed, they ought to be on equal footing—disputes should be adjudicated by dispassionately weighing the available evidence, not reflexively giving police officers a benefit of the doubt that their profession, as a collective, has not earned (although you wouldn't know it from police brass, judges, and district attorneys). As the police continue to lose the trust of the public, due largely to documented instances of bad behavior by fellow officers, as well as law enforcement's longstanding inability to police themselves, I suspect that more and more good cops will be clamoring for cameras on their dashboards and lapels. Until then, citizens ought to record police during every incident as it unfolds. Doing so will bring vindication to good cops and indictments of bad cops.

This week, the company tested a change to its core product that could alter the service in a small but important way. [According to Mashable]<hyperlink=”http://mashable.com/2014/08/05/twitter-feed-friends-follow/#x7IdFLcW1PqZ”>, Twitter is altering the timeline of a small number of users, so that they see tweets from accounts they don’t follow.

Right now, users only see tweets for three reasons: They’re from an account that user follows; they were retweeted by an account that user follows; or they’re an ad. Now, a user might see tweets from an account that someone whom they follow follows, or a tweet that someone they follow favorited.

I can independently confirm this news because I am one of the users they’re testing on. Earlier this week, I was flicking through my Twitter timeline and found something odd: a tweet from a user I’d never seen before. A small line of text above the tweet informed me that it was there because a friend of mine favorited it. 

This new feature seems a big deal, because it alters the central conceit of Twitter. Right now, users only only see tweets from users you follow. This is seemingly the feature that made Twitter Twitter. As Mashable found, users already appear annoyed to be seeing tweets of ambiguous origin.

[tweetbegin 495793848480575489 tweetend] But users already see tweets from users they don’t follow. These tweets are ads. Twitter already accepts money to show users tweets from brands and personalities that they don’t follow, and while this method of display-ads-for-Twitter may frustrate users, but it’s the path the company has chosen.

No, this feature strikes me as a big deal because it breaks something that may seem less pressing: the fave. [As The Atlantic has previously documented]<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/the-farewell-fave-is-the-best-kind-of-fave/283136/”>, users hit the fave button for many reasons. A fave can mean “I agree,” “This made me laugh,” or “good chat.” Often, the only two users aware of a fave are the faverand the favee.

There have long been ways to see other user’s faves. The Discover tab in the company’s official mobile app, for instance, lists all the faves a certain user has made that day. But by and large, other people’s faves didn’t just pop up on your screen.

By transforming what a fave does, this feature fundamentally changes what a fave is. Users will have to adjust, and that process will exact communal costs. That’s fine—software changes, and social software is no different.

Back in April, Adrienne LaFrance and I wrote [a eulogy for Twitter]<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/a-eulogy-for-twitter/361339/”>. We argued not that the service was dead, but that it was almost completely changed from when we began to use it, shaped by a mixture of community and interface shifts that had altered its feel entirely. This is exactly the kind of feature we were talking about.

Twitter remains indispensable. I tried to take a complete vacation from it this month, but the protests and police brutality in Ferguson, Missouri, brought me right back. Many argue that it needs changes like this to attract a new set of users, and, indeed, its second quarter results showed promising user growth.

At some point in the future, though, its core product will be so altered by these changes that what we once called Twitter will no longer exist. ",50,NA,The company is now showing users tweets from accounts they don't follow. That’s a bigger deal than it seems. ,NA
TheAtlantic,atlantic25,http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/100-years-of-tear-gas/378632/,100 Years of Tear Gas,Anna Feigenbaum,8/16/2014,3/7/2016,"In August 1914, French troops fired tear-gas grenades into German trenches along the border between the two countries. While the exact details of this first tear-gas launch are fuzzy, historians mark the Battle of the Frontiers, as World War I’s first clashes between France and Germany came to be known, as the birthday of what would become modern tear gas.

This early tear gas had resulted from French chemists’ efforts, at the turn of the 20th century, to develop a new method of riot control while maneuvering around international treaty restrictions imposed on “projectiles filled with poison gas” by The Hague Conventions of 1899.

Designed to force people out from behind barricades and trenches, tear gas causes burning of the eyes and skin, tearing, and gagging. As people flee from its effects, they leave their cover and comrades behind. In addition to its physical consequences, tear gas also provokes terror. As Amos Fries, chief of the U.S. Army’s Chemical Warfare Service, put it in 1928, “It is easier for man to maintain morale in the face of bullets than in the presence of invisible gas.”

Today, tear gas is the most commonly used form of what's known in law-enforcement jargon as “less-lethal” force. Journalists file news stories of tear-gas deployment so regularly that pictures of smoke-filled streets have come to feel like stock photography—a theatrical backdrop of protest. Just this week, police in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson [deployed tear gas]<hyperlink=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/14/tear-gas-is-a-chemical-weapon-banned-in-war-but-ferguson-police-shoot-it-at-protesters/?tid=hp_mm”> to disperse crowds protesting the killing of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown by an officer. Desensitized to these images, people often forget that tear gas is a chemical weapon, designed for physical and psychological torture.

So how did this substance, first deployed in war, make it from the trenches to the streets?

The process began before World War I ended. While troops were still returning home, active and retired military officers began lobbying to keep their chemical-weapons inventions. Fries, who led the Chemical Warfare Service through much of the 1920s, was determined to redeploy the technology for everyday uses like controlling crowds and criminals. He enlisted fellow military veterans, now working as lawyers and businessmen, to reach out to the press and help create a commercial market for the gases.

In the November 26, 1921 issue of the trade magazine Gas Age Record, technology writer Theo M. Knappen profiled Fries, who, he wrote, “has given much study to the question of the use of gas and smokes in dealing with mobs as well as with savages, and is firmly convinced that as soon as officers of the law and colonial administrators have familiarized themselves with gas as a means of maintaining order and power there will be such a diminution of violent social disorders and savage uprising as to amount to their disappearance.” 

Knappen further explained to readers:

The tear gases appear to be admirably suited to the purpose of isolating the individual from the mob spirit … he is thrown into a condition in which he can think of nothing but relieving his own distress. Under such conditions an army disintegrates and a mob ceases to be; it becomes a blind stampede to get away from the source of torture. 

The psychological impacts of tear gas gave police the ability to demoralize and disperse a crowd without firing live ammunition. Tear gas was also ephemeral and could evaporate from the scene without leaving traces of blood or bruises, making it appear better for police-public relations than crowd control through physical force. By the end of the 1920s, police departments in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, San Francisco, and Chicago were all purchasing tear-gas supplies. Meanwhile, sales abroad included colonial territories in India, Panama, and Hawaii.

With this new demand for tear gas came new supply. Improved tear-gas cartridges replaced early explosive models that would often harm the police deploying them. Early innovators designed improved mechanisms for delivering tear gas, including pistols, grenades, candles, pens, and even billy clubs that doubled as toxic shooters. Tear gas soon became a weapon of choice for prison wardens, strike breakers, and even bankers. Tear gas-filled contraptions were fitted into vaults to stop robberies, and fastened onto the ceilings of prison mess halls to deter riots.

On July 29, 1932, in what Edgewood Arsenal, the U.S. military’s chemical research site, referred to in a memo as “a practical field test,” National Guard troops stormed the Washington, D.C. camps occupied by the “Bonus Army,” a group of veterans lobbying to receive their overdue wartime payments. During the forcible eviction that ensued, the troops fired tear gas into the encampment, engulfing it in smoke and fire. Two men were killed in the violence, and an infant child was said to have died of asphyxiation from inhaling tear gas. Though official reports of the incident claimed the baby died of natural causes, the Bonus Army only saw that denial as part of a government cover-up. The group’s ballad “[No Undue Violence]<hyperlink=”http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%2021/Brooklyn%20NY%20Weekly%20People/Brooklyn%20NY%20Weekly%20People%201932-1934/Brooklyn%20NY%20Weekly%20People%201932-1934%20-%200168.pdf”>” mockingly testified:

“We used no undue violence”—So, Baby Myers, be still!Though it isn’t quite plainTo your little brain,You were gassed with the best of will!

For the Bonus Army, tear gas became known as the “Hoover ration,” a further sign of growing economic disparity in America. But for police chiefs, business owners, and imperial consulates around the world, the eviction of the Bonus Army was a sign of the rapid damage and demoralization that tear gas could bring about.

Leading American tear-gas manufacturers, including the Lake Erie Chemical Company founded by World War I veteran Lieutenant Colonel Byron “Biff” Goss, became deeply embroiled in the repression of political struggles. Sales representatives buddied up with business owners and local police forces. They followed news headlines of labor disputes and traveled to high-conflict areas, [selling]<hyperlink=”https://archive.org/stream/munitionsindustr1114unit#page/n9/mode/2up”> their products domestically and to countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, and Cuba. A Senate subcommittee investigation into industrial-munitions sales found that between 1933 and 1937, more than $1.25 million (about $21 million today) worth of “tear and sickening gas” had been purchased in the U.S. “chiefly during or in anticipation of strikes.”

Leading American tear-gas manufacturers followed headlines of labor disputes and traveled to conflict areas, selling their products domestically and abroad.

Prior to World War II, Italy [used]<hyperlink=”https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=enSrAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA172&ots=RW07vlKA23&dq=vietnam+tear+gas&pg=PA3%23v%3Donepage&q=vietnam+tear+gas&hl=en#v=onepage&q=ethiopia&f=false”> tear and other poison gases extensively in its war with Ethiopia, the Spanish used them in Morocco, and the Japanese used them against the Chinese. Although Western nations did not engage in chemical warfare during World War II, the use and development of tear gases became even more widespread afterward. In Vietnam, the U.S. [fired]<hyperlink=”https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=enSrAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA172&ots=RW07vlKA23&dq=vietnam%20tear%20gas&pg=PA3%23v=onepage&q=vietnam%20tear%20gas&f=false#v=onepage&q=tear%20gas&f=false”> tear gas into Viet Cong tunnels; the gas also landed in bomb-shelter dugouts, asphyxiating civilians trapped inside. In 1966, the Hungarian delegation to the UN, backed by other Eastern European nations, put the matter on the international agenda. “The hollow pretexts given for using riot-control gases in Viet-Nam,” the Hungarians [argued]<hyperlink=”https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule75”>, “had been rejected by world public opinion and by the international scientific community, including scholars in the United States itself.” Hungary [called]<hyperlink=”http://www.state.gov/t/isn/4784.htm”> for the use of these chemical weapons in war to constitute an international crime.

Back in the United States, Vietnam War protesters faced tons of tear gas. In one of the largest deployments, California Governor Ronald Reagan ordered the National Guard to break up demonstrators in Berkeley’s Sproul Plaza in 1969. Helicopters carrying tear gas showered thousands of peacefully assembled students, as well as bystanders, including nursery-school children and swimmers in the university pool.

Meanwhile, France was busy expanding its use of new tear-gas formulas to quell student and worker uprisings that broke out in 1968. The French became so accustomed to facing tear gas that they trained residents in Derry, Northern Ireland to repel its effects during fighting in August 1969 between the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Catholic residents that came to be known as the Battle of the Bogside. This event marked the U.K.’s first civilian deployment of its new tear-gas formula—and brought the British military into Northern Ireland. 

In the 1980s, human-rights groups increased their monitoring of the use of tear gas and riot-control techniques in zones of conflict or protest. South Korea came under increasing international pressure for its [use]<hyperlink=”https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&dat=19870706&id=u61JAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mw4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=6756,2913177&hl=en”> of the chemical weapon against student protesters, as did Israel for deploying tear gas against Palestinians during the First Intifada. Between January 1987 and December 1988, the United States [exported]<hyperlink=”http://www.gao.gov/assets/220/211128.pdf”> $6.5 million worth of tear-gas guns, grenades, launchers, and launching cartridges to Israel. Rights groups recorded up to 40 deaths resulting from tear gas during the First Intifada, as well as thousands of cases of illness.

The tear-gas industry was transformed by the FBI's development of weapons-grade aerosol spray in the 1980s.

Tear gas was once again transformed by the manufacture of handheld aerosol sprays beginning in the 1980s, when chemical-agents expert and inventor Kamran Loghman worked with the FBI to develop a weapons-grade aerosol pepper spray—an alternative, faster-acting form of tear gas designed to be more debilitating to the target. By 1991, Loghman’s invention was on the utility belts of police across the United States. Soon after, similar sprays were developed in the [U.K. ]<hyperlink=”hyperlink=”http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0001900155014””> and France. It didn't take long before lawsuits arose, accusing police of harassment and, at times, torture. Between 1990 and 1995, more than 60 deaths linked to this “non-lethal technology” were [reported]<hyperlink=”http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-18/news/mn-14572_1_pepper-spray-manufacturer”> in the United States.

Harking back to its large-scale use during Vietnam War protests, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, police forces deployed tear gas en masse against anti-globalization demonstrators in Seattle, Vancouver, Prague, and elsewhere. Though the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention again confirmed an international prohibition on the use of tear gases in warfare, it made an [exception]<hyperlink=”https://www.opcw.org/index.php?eID=dam_frontend_push&docID=6357”> for their use in riot control by law-enforcement officials. Reporting on the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in 2001, Saul Hudson [wrote]<hyperlink=” http://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/Violence-mar-Quebec-summit-20010421”> for Reuters, “Eye-stinging tear gas floated through the sealed-off zone in the historic city and entered venue building vents, reminding the presidents and prime ministers that violence marring major summits has become as predictable as their closing statements.”

During the Arab Spring, Occupy, and anti-austerity protests of 2011, tear gas once more made headlines. Mass shipments entered Egypt, Bahrain, Yemen, and Tunisia, largely from Combined Systems Inc. in the U.S. and Condor Nonlethal Technologies in Brazil, while tear gas was also deployed to break up protests in the U.S. and across Europe.

Governments have responded by purchasing record amounts of non-lethal weapons.”

In the 100 years since it was first developed, tear gas, advertised as a harmless substance, has often proven fatal, asphyxiating children and adults, causing miscarriages, and [injuring]<hyperlink=”http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/reports/weaponizing-tear-gas.html?referrer=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/100-years-of-tear-gas/378632/”> many. The human-rights organization Amnesty International has [listed]<hyperlink=”https://www.amnesty.org/fr/library/asset/ACT40/002/2001/fr/96267802-dc5f-11dd-bce7-11be3666d687/act400022001en.html”> tear gas as part of the international trade in tools of torture, and Turkey’s medical association has [condemned]<hyperlink=”http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f3801”> it.

Yet while tear gas remains banned from warfare under the Chemical Weapons Convention, its use in civilian policing grows. Tear gas remains as effective today at demoralizing and dispersing crowds as it was a century ago, turning the street from a place of protest into toxic chaos. It clogs the air, the one communication channel that even the most powerless can use to voice their grievances.

In this way, tear gas offers the police a cheap solution for social unrest. But rather than resolve tensions, it deepens them. This week in Ferguson, police [fired]<hyperlink=”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-tear-gas_n_5671811.html”> tear gas into people’s backyards, [set it off]<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/relationships-and-special-occasions/parenting/aisha-sultan/the-end-of-childhood-how-the-violence-in-ferguson-will/article_2a764749-e202-5708-b5c9-2f32b0af47c0.html”> near children, and [launched]<hyperlink=”http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/08/us-police-fire-tear-gas-at-protesters-201481423942289865.html”> it directly at journalists. This treatment of a civilian neighborhood further damages the already highly fraught relationship between many Americans and those employed to “serve and protect” them. As those who signed declarations at The Hague back in 1899 knew, peace cannot be made through poison.

The question was put to New York Times Magazine readers by journalist Robert Draper, who has elicited disdainful responses from [Paul Krugman]<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/opinion/paul-krugman-the-libertarian-fantasy.html?_r=0”> of the Times, [Jonathan Chait]<hyperlink=”http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/america-is-not-turning-libertarian.html”> of New York, and [my colleague David Frum]<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/the-illusion-of-a-libertarian-moment/375844/”>. All three concur that the notion of a libertarian ascendancy is an unsophisticated, laughable fantasy. That's a vexing position to hear from this particular trio. If there is no real prospect of tomorrow's voters embracing libertarian ideas, let alone libertarians exercising meaningful power over policy, why have these three spent years dedicating countless hours, numerous articles in prominent publications, and tens of thousands of words criticizing, mocking, and vilifying libertarians, even as centrist elites carried out disastrous policies from Iraq to Wall Street? They're perfectly within their rights to proceed as though libertarianism is a political force that imperils us, or an obvious nonstarter, but it cannot be both.

I'd respectfully argue that libertarianism is neither dangerous nor doomed, and that people who think otherwise are misled by a double standard they use when analyzing this political faction. When they write about a ""libertarian moment,"" they act as if it would mean the immediate embrace of an extreme, ideologically pure version of a philosophy that most actual sympathizers embrace with pragmatic moderation. Yes, if the most radical faction of any ideology that has never before exercised power was suddenly put in charge, that might well end in disaster. But in the real world, libertarian ideas will only ever be implemented partially in a system of checks and balances where modest reforms are difficult to achieve, never mind sweeping, rapid changes. It's true, but trivially so, that neither a libertarian nor a liberal nor conservative utopia is coming. But liberals and conservatives exercise power regularly, so no one is under the silly illusion that their ascendance would entail a pure ideological program untempered by reality.  

""Is libertarian economics at all realistic?"" Krugman asks, as if the question is coherent. There are deep disagreements among libertarians about economic policy. There is never a moment when an entire economic philosophy comes up for a vote. It may just be that libertarian thinkers are correct on the merits of some policies, like rent control, and incorrect on others, like the gold standard, and that the prudent thing for a pluralistic society would be to adopt their best ideas and insights, rather than preemptively declaring all libertarian economic ideas unrealistic. 

Republican and Democratic politicians are constantly criticized for compromising their ideals. Yet many Americans imagine that a libertarian politician, if elected, would never compromise. History and incentive theory emphatically say otherwise. There are a lot of people, including commenters on this site, who laugh at Fox News' absurd characterizations of liberals, yet somehow cling to similarly cartoonish notions of what libertarians are. The danger libertarians pose to America is like the danger that sharks pose to humans: wildly exaggerated by a media that reports on extreme events as if they're typical and reacts to Atlas Shrugged in the same way shark-phobics reacted to Jaws.

Such is the context for the overheated responses when libertarian ideas are treated seriously. When Robert Draper, or a Reason magazine staffer, or other bearish commentators speak of a ""libertarian moment,"" they're not anticipating a Ron Paul-like figure ascending to the White House and ritually debasing the Federal Reserve, or the wholesale elimination of the welfare state, or a radical Libertarian Party presidential candidate suddenly breaking America's de facto system of two-party rule. The relevant question is whether younger voters will support policies and elect leaders that enhance liberty in comparison to the status quo. If that's what is meant by ""a libertarian moment,"" and it seems like a perfectly reasonable definition of the phrase to me, then we may indeed be witnessing one. 

Libertarians have already achieved a lot. Men are no longer arrested for having gay sex. There hasn't been another military draft. Public-housing projects and price controls were dismantled. 

I'd make a more modest claim: that the abject failure of Democrats and Republicans, including politicians enthusiastically supported by Krugman, Chait, and Frum—as well as the ambivalence people like them display to grave, widespread civil liberties violations, lawbreaking by government officials, and the power of the national-security state—has created an opening for libertarian-leaning independents to make gains with the public, if they can transcend the cult of personality that surrounds Ron Paul; avoid picking misguided, counterproductive battles like the one over raising the debt ceiling; and embrace a conception of liberty that isn't so narrowly focused on tax rates and property. There are problems with the libertarian movement, just as there are problems with the conservative and progressive movements. The best critiques of smart anti-libertarians like Krugman, Chait, and Frum shouldn't ever be thoughtlessly dismissed. Their critiques would improve libertarianism if taken to heart.

At the same time, libertarianism's critics error when they focus so much attention on Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement, the Libertarian Party, or pols like Paul. In the future, libertarian gains are likely to come when Republicans and Democrats, liberals, conservatives, and independents, co-opt their most popular ideas. That's how libertarian ideas have prevailed in the past, on issues as varied as deregulation of telecoms, free-trade deals that have lifted many out of poverty, and opposition to sodomy laws, book bans, and censored art. In his Times article, Draper commits a similar analytical mistake. He writes:

This is not the first moment that libertarians have claimed as their own. In 1971, The New York Times Magazine published on its cover [a 5,200-word article by two young authors]<hyperlink=”http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/01/10/91262822.html”> (one of them was Louis Rossetto Jr., later a founding publisher of Wired) who pronounced libertarianism “undoubtedly the fastest-growing movement in the country.” That same year, the Libertarian Party was formed; a year later, its 1972 presidential ticket of the philosophy professor John Hospers and the TV talk-show host Tonie Nathan received one electoral vote. Forty years later, little had changed. The Libertarian Party’s 2012 candidate, Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, spent a million dollars and received more than a million votes—a better showing than any of his party’s predecessors, but not good enough to even remotely sway either the presidential election or the terms of the national debate.

Actually, 40 years later, a lot has changed! Men are no longer arrested for having gay sex. There hasn't been another military draft. Public-housing projects and price controls were dismantled. Ron Paul literally did change the terms of nationally televised debates. That Gary Johnson did no better than John Hospers says very little save that third-party presidential candidates cannot win in our system.

Important libertarian victories are happening right now. Consider drug prohibition, which is being challenged in multiple states, as are draconian sentencing rules. Like gay marriage, criminal-justice reform seems poised to sweep the nation within a generation.

Frum reductively dismisses youth opposition to the war on drugs as ""social liberalism."" I disagree, but the self-perceived ideological affiliation of young people is beside the point. Drug reform has been a core goal of libertarians for decades. The war on drugs has done as much as any policy in modern U.S. history to erode the Bill of Rights, particularly the 4th Amendment, to squander taxpayer dollars, to militarize the police, and to empower murderous cartels abroad. The reforms we're witnessing constitute significant expansions of liberty.

Frum is a committed partisan, which I don't intend as an insult. Since leaving the Bush administration, he has offered intelligent critiques of the GOP, many of which would improve that party if more Republicans earnestly grappled with them. But Washington, D.C., insiders who've dedicated themselves to improving America through the mediating institution of one political party are often blind to different approaches. A substantive policy victory that does nothing to boost movement libertarianism, or the Libertarian Party, or a particular libertarian politician, or libertarianism's place within the Republican Party, may not seem like a ""libertarian moment"" or ""libertarian victory"" to an institutionalist like Frum. He may find libertarianism important only insofar as it affects the Republican Party.

If fewer people's doors are kicked in late at night by police officers dressed in combat fatigues, that's a libertarian victory. 

Yet many who think of themselvess as libertarians (or who are friendly to many but not all libertarian goals, like me) don't particularly care who is ascendant in Washington, or what party affiliation appears beside the name of a legislator. If fewer people are caged for inhaling the smoke of a plant, that's a libertarian victory. If fewer people's doors are kicked in late at night by police officers dressed in combat fatigues, that's a libertarian victory. If more cancer patients can legally obtain a substance that alleviates their suffering, that's a libertarian victory. If fewer assets are seized by police without proof of guilt, that's a libertarian victory. (Were I to embrace the rhetorical tactics of Paul Krugman, I might point to the war on drugs and ask, ""Is non-libertarain domestic policy at all realistic?"")

There are, I hasten to add, intense disagreements among libertarians about which future victories are most important. In Frum's article, he writes that ""young voters are more likely than their elders to believe that government should intervene in the economy to create jobs. They support government aid to education and healthcare more than any other age group. Their voting behavior tracks their values: Under-30s massively voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.""

He is right, of course, that young people are at odds with libertarians on various issues of importance to both groups. But America could be a much more libertarian country than it is even with more federal education and healthcare aid. The United States could be as libertarian as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek and still embrace a social safety net that involved coercive transfers to poor people. Efforts to provide equality of opportunity and a safety net do require the redistribution of wealth—but we're a society with wealth beyond the wildest dreams of even elderly Americans still alive today, and apart from the coercion inherent in any taxes, there are ways to deliver both of those goods without reducing liberty, which is why more libertarians ought to make peace with them.

Frum sees the fact that under-30s voted for Obama in 2008 as evidence that they weren't at all libertarian. [But based on the promises made in that election]<hyperlink=”http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/specials/CandidateQA/ObamaQA/”>, I'd argue that libertarians who supported Obama over McCain (as I did) acted perfectly reasonably, because I believe that a penchant for launching wars of choice, support for indefinite detention without trial, and an expansive view of executive power are far more ruinous to liberty than, say, favoring Clinton-era rather than Bush-era tax rates. There are libertarians who'd kick me out of the [Free State]<hyperlink=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_Project”> for such beliefs. (And fair enough. I'm a classical liberal who is happy to stay in California.) Other libertarians [would]<hyperlink=”http://www.cato-unbound.org/2014/08/04/matt-zwolinski/pragmatic-libertarian-case-basic-income-guarantee”> eagerly [endorse]<hyperlink=”http://reason.com/archives/2013/11/26/scrap-the-welfare-state-give-people-free”> a guaranteed basic income for every American if it could be severed once and for all from the coercive, metastasizing welfare state. They understand that the Iraq War cost far more in blood and treasure than any policy antiwar Democrats could've passed. A commitment to liberty and freedom precludes loyalty to either political party. Both perpetrate awful abuses. The GOP provides no real home for libertarians, who should engage with the two-party system opportunistically.

The United States is a big, sprawling, complicated nation that faces an array of complex policy challenges. Doctrinaire libertarians don't have all the answers any more than any other ideological faction. Insofar as they have an advantage over their more mainstream competitors, it springs from the law of diminishing returns: We've long since tried the most popular conservative and progressive ideas. 

Opponents of libertarianism, like Frum, try to ensure that libertarians will never come to power in part through legitimate critiques, but also by portraying centrist, libertarian-leaning Republicans as if they're radical extremists, even on policies where they're actually taking brave stances in opposition to the extremism of Republicans and Democrats. This is illustrated most clearly in the passage Frum writes about Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican with mild libertarian sympathies, and the filibuster he launched on the subject of drone strikes. 

The filibuster was a response to President Obama's radical, unprecedented claim that he is empowered to order, in secret, the extrajudicial assassination of an American citizen, without due process, even far from any battlefield or combat situation. Alarm at this extreme assertion of executive power was hardly a fringe position. Centrist newspapers editorialized against it. Numerous members of Congress expressed their displeasure, along with civil-liberties organizations on the left and the right.  But you wouldn't know that from Frum's distillation of the controversy:

Whereas ordinary conservatism emphasizes the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of government action, libertarianism presents government as alien and malign. When Rand Paul rose early in 2013 to deliver the longest talking filibuster since Strom Thurmond battled civil rights in 1957, he did so not to oppose some new bureaucracy or tax. No, Paul rose to denounce the supposedly looming danger of lethal drone attacks on ordinary law-abiding Americans. “I will speak today until the President responds and says no, we won't kill Americans in cafes; no, we won't kill you at home in your bed at night; no, we won't drop bombs on restaurants,” he said. Repeatedly, Paul insisted that he was not accusing President Obama of plotting the murder of American citizens. Equally repeatedly, however, he made clear that he considered the danger of presidential murder of people like himself real and imminent.

In fact, Paul never once claimed that the murder of people like himself was ""imminent."" What struck Paul—what ought to have struck us all—is that the Obama administration was so determined to maximize its discretion that it would not, up to that point, disavow the idea that it would strike an American citizen on U.S. soil. Paul was amazed that the White House wouldn't commit to so basic a limiting principle as that. Senator Ron Wyden, a progressive Democrat from Oregon, had the same question. ""I’ve asked you how much evidence the president needs to decide that a particular American can be lawfully killed and whether the administration believes that the president can use this authority inside the United States,” he said to CIA Director John Brennan. ”What do you think needs to be done to ensure that members of the public understand more about when the government thinks it’s allowed to kill them, particularly with respect to those two issues: the question of evidence and the authority to use this power within the United States?”

Far from suggesting that a U.S. senator like him might be killed by drone, Paul explicitly focused on the sort of American who is actually most vulnerable to the executive branch's disregard for the 5th Amendment. ""Nobody questions if planes are flying towards the Twin Towers whether they can be repulsed by the military. Nobody questions whether a terrorist with a rocket launcher or a grenade launcher is attacking us, whether they can be repelled. They don't get their day in court,"" Paul said. ""But if you are sitting in a cafeteria in Dearborn, Michigan, if you happen to be an Arab-American who has a relative in the Middle East and you communicate with them by email and somebody says, oh, your relative is someone we suspect of being associated with terrorism, is that enough to kill you?""

Law professor [Ryan Goodman]<hyperlink=”http://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.biography&personid=27772”>, co-chairman of the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at New York University, [found Senator Paul's questioning useful]<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/opinion/the-drone-question-obama-hasnt-answered.html”>. In a different way, Robert Gibbs, a senior adviser to Obama, justified Paul's line of questioning when he [suggested]<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/how-team-obama-justifies-the-killing-of-a-16-year-old-american/264028/”> the 16-year-old son of Anwar al-Awlaki, also killed in a drone strike, should've had a more responsible father if he didn't want to die. 

To defend the principle of due process against a president who asserts the power to kill in secret without charges or trial is not to present government as ""alien and malign."" It is to critique the fallibility of men who inhabit government, not government itself. It is an impulse shared by the framers of the Constitution, not the impulse of an anarchist. Paul understands what Frum is loath to acknowledge: that U.S. officials are capable of perpetrating horrific transgressions against civil and human rights when freed from the constraints of the law and Constitution. This ought to be clear to everyone who served in the same administration as numerous proponents of torturing prisoners, and John Yoo, who believes it may be legal for the president to order a child's testicles crushed.

For goodness' sake, Obama has already killed U.S. citizens with drone strikes, just not on U.S. soil. So it's obvious to Frum that a president can do this abroad—but discrediting even to imagine him doing it closer to home? 

If libertarians had wielded more power, America would not have passed the Patriot Act, started the phone dragnet, or allowed the Pentagon to send military equipment to police in places like Ferguson, Missouri. 

In Frum's view, asserting the power to order secret assassinations of American citizens isn't discrediting—an overseer objecting that that power could eventually be abused is discrediting. That's the sort of extraordinary deference to, and trust in, fallible yet extremely powerful elites that gives libertarians an opening with the public. With greater physical and social distance from elites, they're better able to see their flaws.

The opening may be too narrow to exploit. Libertarians may hurt their own chances by picking the wrong battles. The dumbest, most self-defeating things that libertarians do drive me nuts, too. But I wish them success. Going back to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when the present era in American politics began, George W. Bush-style conservatives and Barack Obama-style progressives have both been given opportunities to exercise power. The former launched a catastrophic war of choice that many libertarians opposed. The latter continued egregious abuses of civil liberties, from mass surveillance on Americans to indefinite detention without trial. They've both waged a ruinous war on drugs with no hope of success, made themselves beholden to crony capitalists, persecuted whistleblowers, and presided over civil-rights violations against one of America's most vulnerable minorities, Muslim Americans. (As a writer on the economics beat, Krugman can and does ignore the fact that politicians he supports have done all this, but that doesn't make it less true.) I have no illusions that the libertarian movement is a cure-all. It has ideological blind spots and dysfunction. I do think it can temper the worst excesses of an unaccountable elite, that its best ideas are worth trying, and that it will oppose the initiation of force.

I do think that, if libertarians had wielded more power in bygone years, America would not have passed the Patriot Act, started the phone dragnet, or allowed the Department of Defense to send military equipment to police in places like Ferguson, Missouri. 

On issues where libertarians have a somewhat realistic chance of winning over their fellow citizens—reining in the NSA, eliminating the most inane professional licensing laws, insisting on due process in the War on Terrorism, avoiding foolish wars of choice, ending the war on drugs, reducing the prison population and the militarization of the police—a ""libertarian moment"" would have a salutary effect on American life. Commentators like Frum, Chait, and Krugman don't see this in large part because, if their output is indicative of their beliefs and priorities, they aren't particularly troubled by NSA spying, or inane professional licensing laws, or civil asset forfeiture, or foolish wars of choice, or the war on drugs. For them, the path to a better America is further empowering an enlightened faction of technocrats within the political party to which they're loyal. On particular issues, their respective prescriptions are sometimes worth trying. But I notice egregious incompetence and abuses—and lots of innocents dying needlessly—on the watches of the leaders they've overzealously supported. Libertarians have concrete policy proposals to protect against such ills. One needn't embrace their entire philosophy to see the wisdom in them.",788,2600,"A Ron Paul utopia isn't in America's future. But the war on drugs could be ended, mass surveillance stopped, and liberty expanded in dozens of smaller but important ways. ",NA
