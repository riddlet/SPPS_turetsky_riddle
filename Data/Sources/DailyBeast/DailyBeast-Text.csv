How the Ferguson PD ran the town where Michael Brown was gunned down.

Police in Ferguson, Missouri, once charged a man with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms while four of them allegedly beat him.

“On and/or about the 20th day of Sept. 20, 2009 at or near 222 S. Florissant within the corporate limits of Ferguson, Missouri, the above named defendant did then and there unlawfully commit the offense of ‘property damage’ to wit did transfer blood to the uniform,” reads the charge sheet.

The address is the headquarters of the Ferguson Police Department, where a 52-year-old welder named Henry Davis was taken in the predawn hours on that date. He had been arrested for an outstanding warrant that proved to actually be for another man of the same surname, but a different middle name and Social Security number.

“I said, ‘I told you guys it wasn’t me,’” Davis later testified.

He recalled the booking officer saying, “We have a problem.”

The booking officer had no other reason to hold Davis, who ended up in Ferguson only because he missed the exit for St. Charles and then pulled off the highway because the rain was so heavy he could not see to drive. The cop who had pulled up behind him must have run his license plate and assumed he was that other Henry Davis. Davis said the cop approached his vehicle, grabbed his cellphone from his hand, cuffed him and placed him in the back seat of the patrol car, without a word of explanation.

But the booking officer was not ready just to let Davis go, and proceeded to escort him to a one-man cell that already had a man in it asleep on the lone bunk. Davis says that he asked the officer if he could at least have one of the sleeping mats that were stacked nearby.

”He said I wasn’t getting one,” Davis said.

Davis balked at being a second man in a one-man cell.

“Because it’s 3 in the morning,” he later testified. “Who going to sleep on a cement floor?”

The booking officer summoned a number of fellow cops. One opened the cell door while another suddenly charged, propelling Davis inside and slamming him against the back wall.

“I told the police officers there that I didn’t do nothing, ‘Why is you guys doing this to me?’” Davis testified. “They said, ‘OK, just lay on the ground and put your hands behind your back.’”

Davis said he complied and that a female officer straddled and then handcuffed him. Two other officers crowded into the cell.

“They started hitting me,” he testified. “I was getting hit and I just covered up.”

The other two stepped out and the female officer allegedly lifted Davis’ head as the cop who had initially pushed him into the cell reappeared.

“He ran in and kicked me in the head,” Davis recalled. “I almost passed out at that point… Paramedics came… They said it was too much blood, I had to go to the hospital.”

A patrol car took the bleeding Davis to a nearby emergency room. He refused treatment, demanding somebody first take his picture. 

“I wanted a witness and proof of what they done to me,” Davis said.

He was driven back to the jail, where he was held for several days before he posted $1,500 bond on four counts of “property damage.” Police Officer John Beaird had signed complaints swearing on pain of perjury that Davis had bled on his uniform and those of three fellow officers.

The remarkable turned inexplicable when Beaird was deposed in a civil case that Davis subsequently brought seeking redress and recompense. 

“After Mr. Davis was detained, did you have any blood on you?” asked Davis’ lawyer, James Schottel.  

“No, sir,” Beaird replied.

Schottel showed Beaird a copy of the “property damage” complaint.

“Is that your signature as complainant?” the lawyer asked.

“It is, sir,” the cop said.

“And what do you allege that Mr. Davis did unlawfully in this one?” the lawyer asked.

“Transferred blood to my uniform while Davis was resisting,” the cop said.

“And didn’t I ask you earlier in this deposition if Mr. Davis got blood on your uniform?”

“You did, sir.”

“And didn’t you respond no?”

“Correct. I did.”

Beaird seemed to be either admitting perjury or committing it. The depositions of other officers suggested that the “property damage” charges were not just bizarre, but trumped up.

“There was no blood on my uniform,” said Police Officer Christopher Pillarick.

And then there was Officer Michael White, the one accused of kicking Davis in the head, an allegation he denies, as his fellow officers deny striking Davis. White had reported suffering a bloody nose in the mayhem.

“Did you see Mr. Davis bleeding at all?”  the lawyer, Schottel, asked.

“I did not,” White replied.

“Did Mr. Davis get any blood on you while you were in the cell?” Schottel asked.

“No,” White said.

The contradictions between the complaint and the depositions apparently are what prompted the prosecutor to drop the “property damage” allegation. The prosecutor also dropped a felony charge of assault on an officer that had been lodged more than a year after the incident and shortly after Davis filed his civil suit.

Davis suggested in his testimony that if the police really thought he had assaulted an officer he would have been charged back when he was jailed.

“They would have filed those charges right then and there, because that’s a major felony,” he noted.

Indisputable evidence of what transpired in the cell might have been provided by a surveillance camera, but it turned out that the VHS video was recorded at 32 times normal speed.

“It was like a blur,” Schottel told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “You couldn’t see anything.”

The blur proved to be from 12 hours after the incident anyway. The cops had saved the wrong footage after Schottel asked them to preserve it.

Schottel got another unpleasant surprise when he sought the use-of-force history of the officers involved. He learned that before a new chief took over in 2010 the department had a surprising protocol for non-fatal use-of-force reports.

“The officer himself could complete it and give it to the supervisor for his approval,” the prior chief, Thomas Moonier, testified in a deposition. “I would read it. It would be placed in my out basket, and my secretary would probably take it and put it with the case file.”

No copy was made for the officer’s personnel file.

“Everything involved in an incident would generally be with the police report,” Moonier said. “I don’t know what they maintain in personnel files.”

“Who was in charge of personnel files, of maintaining them?” Schottel asked.

“I have no idea,” Moonier said. “I believe City Hall, but I don’t know.”

Schottel focused on the date of the incident.

“On September 20th, 2009, was there any way to identify any officers that were subject of one or more citizens’ complaints?” he asked.

“Not to my knowledge,” Moonier said.

“Was there any way to identify any officers who had completed several use-of-force reports?”

“I don’t recall.”

But however lax the department’s system and however contradictory the officers’ testimony, a federal magistrate ruled that the apparent perjury about the “property damage” charges was too minor to constitute a violation of due process and that Davis’ injuries were de minimis—too minor to warrant a finding of excessive force. Never mind that a CAT scan taken after the incident confirmed that he had suffered a concussion.

Schottel has appealed and expects to argue the case in December. He will contend that perjury is perjury however minor the charge and note that both the NFL and Major League Baseball have learned to consider a concussion a serious injury.

Schottel figures the courts might take the problems of the Ferguson Police Department as more than de minimis as a result of the protests sparked when an officer shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old named Michael Brown on the afternoon of Aug. 9.

“Your chances on appeal are going up,” a fellow lawyer told him.

At least one witness has said that Brown was shot in the back and then in the chest and head as he turned toward the officer with his hands raised. 

“I said, ‘Well, that doesn’t surprise me,’” Schottel told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “I said I already know about Ferguson, nothing new can faze me about Ferguson.”

Schottel has also deposed the new chief, Thomas Jackson, who took over in 2010. Jackson testified that he has instituted a centralized system whereby all complaints lodged against cops by citizens or supervisors go through him and are assigned a number in an internal affairs log. Schottel views Jackson as “not a bad guy,” someone who has been trying to make positive change.

“He wants to do right, but it was such a mess,” Schottel said Wednesday.

Jackson has seemed less than progressive as he delayed identifying the officer involved in the shooting for fear it would place him and his family in danger. Jackson would only say the officer is white and has been on the job for six years. This means that for his first two and most formative years the officer might have been writing his own force reports and that none of them went into his file. 

“It’s hard to get people to clean things up, especially if they’re used to doing things a certain way,” Schottel said.

On Friday, police finally identified the officer as Darren Wilson, who is said to have no disciplinary record, as such records are kept in Ferguson. We already know that he started out at a time when it was accepted for a Ferguson cop to charge somebody with property damage for bleeding on his uniform and later saying there was no blood on him at all.",NA,NA,NA,NA
DailyBeast,beast2,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/19/obama-loses-his-voice-in-ferguson.html,Why Won't Obama Go to Ferguson?,Stuart Stevens,8/19/2014,12/4/2015,"The president seems increasingly uncomfortable with the role of healer-in-chief. What happened to that hopeful, eloquent man we elected in 2008?

When President Obama finally came off the Vineyard and spoke out on the trauma that has transfixed America, he looked exhausted. In line with the “Do I really have to do this” tone that is increasingly his public persona, the president’s words seemed to make no one happy.

If a vacation on Martha’s Vineyard takes this much out of you, it’s clear why John Kerry sticks to Nantucket.

It’s tempting to pile on the president, but I’m sympathetic to his apparent hesitancy to grandstand at this terrible moment. Ferguson strikes me as an instance where it is far easier to do harm than to help.

But I think there is a valuable “teaching moment,” to borrow his phrase, in watching our first African-American president struggle with this racial tragedy. While there seems to be no data to suggest that race relations have improved under Obama—and perhaps they’ve gotten worse—I think the Ferguson crisis is a time when we are well served by having an African-American president in office.

If what is happening in Missouri had occurred under President Bush and Attorney General (and former Missouri governor) John Ashcroft, it’s inevitable that they would have been heavily criticized, and that there would have been a racial component to that criticism. It would have been all but impossible to avoid accusations that the anger among those in the streets of Ferguson was greatly increased by an out-of-touch white White House. Pundits would have weighed in “that as long as the powers that be in this country are white, it’s impossible for an African American not to feel isolated and alienated.”

And who knows, perhaps there would have been validity in some of that criticism. Having spent my life with presidents who looked like me, who am I to say what it must be like to be unable to imagine a president of one’s own race?

But on Monday, that was an African-American president at the White House podium who was announcing that his African-American attorney general would oversee the case. If nothing else, it forces us to move the discussion to more troubling issues than a solution afforded by who might win the next election.

I know a lot of Republicans and conservatives who were terribly sorry that John McCain lost but still felt better about America that an African American could win the presidency. Race was an essential element of the Obama narrative launched in his 2004 Democratic Convention speech. “My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation,” he declared, looking so young. “They would give me an African name, Barack, or ‘blessed,’ believing that in a tolerant America, your name is no barrier to success.”

That was the Barack Obama so many Americans fell in love with, a man who seemed to promise that if we could elect someone who described his very presence on the Democratic Convention stage as “pretty unlikely,” perhaps we could move beyond the past. Maybe it was that lost promise weighing on Obama as he spoke of Michael Brown, the exuberance of possibility faded into dispiriting reality.

Six years into the Obama presidency, it’s still true that no problem confounds America like black-white relations. In the country that defines itself by an assumption that no challenge is beyond our grasp, the quest for a post-racial society is like the elusive cure for an ever-transmuting disease. Great effort and time has produced grudging improvements in quality of life, but the sickness defies a cure. It is always there, ready to strike without warning.

Could Obama have done more to help heal the trauma of Brown’s death? He’s played a healing role well in the past. If the president had stepped in early and reassured the Brown family, Ferguson, and the world that a fair and impartial investigation was under way, it is difficult to imagine it not helping. That would have required putting his personal credibility on the line as president and, yes, as our first African-American president.

But clearly this president is uncomfortable in this role. For a political leader propelled to the heights by his ability to speak of race in transforming terms, he seems to have lost faith in his own voice.

There are 40-plus FBI agents working the Michael Brown case. As the son of a former FBI agent, I’ll choose to believe eventually there will come more clarity to those terrible few minutes. For all the talk of high-tech military gear, this began like a scene from long ago: two men, one pistol, six shots. One body. An American tragedy we know too well.",NA,NA,NA,NA
DailyBeast,beast3,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-real-nightmare-of-ferguson.html,The Real Nightmare of Ferguson,James Poulos,8/15/2014,12/4/2015,"Racial strife, paramilitary commandos, rampant injustice: What happened in Ferguson truly scared us because we see the chaos there as a preview of what could soon come to the rest of America.

It only took three days. On Day One, my Twitter feed—carefully curated since 2008 to deliver an all-encompassing stream of news and views—was acting as normal. Par for the course on Twitter, the early riots in Ferguson, Missouri, popped up in my feed shortly before the national news media picked up on the story.

On Day Two, the chatter surrounding the riots started to show up in the way that tends to signal to me that a Big Story is happening: it had started to consume the attention of both the professional media people and the professional music people who I follow.

Somewhere in the middle of Day Three, however, the story went viral. I don’t exactly mean that it “blew up on social media,” as we say, although that’s true too. My measure of virality on Twitter is simple: suddenly, almost everything else is crowded out and very nearly literally everyone is talking about the news event. Reporting it; linking to it; commenting on it; marveling at it; expressing shock and disgust about it.

Ferguson went viral in the way that’s familiar from our pop-culture nightmares about epidemics and disease—from the zombies of Night of the Living Dead to the Rage of 28 Days Later to the contagious outbreaks of, well, Contagion and Outbreak.

The Scourge of Ferguson was upon us.

Then some really remarkable things began to happen. On Day Four, Ferguson went even more viral. I was able to scroll through my feed and read nothing but tweets about Ferguson. But now, the idea of Ferguson had metastasized and spread, too. It wasn’t just about the shooting of Michael Brown. It wasn’t just about the additional crimes and looting that had sprouted up. It wasn’t even just about the sickening interplay between race and injustice.

It was also about Gaza. It was about the militarization of America’s police forces—a subject writers like Radley Balko had been pounding on for years, and which I had {written about}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/28/what-s-next-police-with-tanks.html”>, to positive but unemotional reaction, in June. Most of all, it was about a concept you don’t hear “normal people” use very lightly: something un-American.

The spectacle of Ferguson’s combat-equipped SWAT police force had struck a nerve. Moreover, the nerve it struck couldn’t be explained by the lame realities that can often abstract and generalize a story away from its moral and factual core. This wasn’t a case of ethical bandwagoning. “Caring about Ferguson” hadn’t turned into a First World problem or fashionable cultural checkbox.

People were really shaken. I realized that they were afraid.

Oftentimes public fear like this can be a self-indulgent kind of collective astral projection. As traumatic as it can be to watch localized tragedies and turmoil play out through the media, the kind of emotional communion made possible by instantaneous communication isn’t always good, and it isn’t always true. (The nightmare of Sandy Hook, for instance, summoned forth well-meaning but misbegotten initiatives that use fear to push bad policy, as Michael Bloomberg’s {Everytown}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/18/money-and-guns-how-we-escape-our-existential-dread.html”> program did.)

With Ferguson, however, the fear had arisen from something even more primal and politically relevant than the murder of innocent children by militarized loners.

Everyone had started reaching for cultural references to contextualize what was going on. Some mentioned Red Dawn. Others brought up The Purge. What instantly sprang to my mind was The Stand.

“Randall Flagg definitely in Ferguson rn,” I {tweeted}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/jamespoulos/status/499586260424749056”>, flashing back on the terrifyingly human devil figure that drove the narrative of Stephen King’s post-apocalyptic masterpiece. First introduced by King, Flagg sports, among other things, an anti-law enforcement button that read HOW’S YOUR BACON?

Much like the Man of Wealth and Taste who {narrates}<hyperlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBecM3CQVD8”> the Rolling Stones’ “Sympathy for the Devil,” Flagg, King explains, has the habit of popping up whenever and wherever society is ready to come apart. He is, as the sociologist Philip Rieff put it, a “scourge.”

Scourges, says Rieff, “are what they represent: wounds to the social organs which are themselves deeply disordered.” Scourges, he says, “are killers who act, momentarily, as agents freed from sacred order and its commanding truths.” Many, he says, are killer loners. “But they can be cultivated, grown, mass-produced; like dragon’s teeth.”

If that all sounds a bit abstract to you, consider Rieff’s next line—written, in all likelihood, at some point in the 1980s. “It is entirely possible that some young blacks are now being prepared to act as scourges of the unjust American social order.”

Americans—in and out of my Twitter feed—have begun to grasp that hideous possibility: that America has manufactured a violent and predominantly black permanent underclass, subjected to our malignant paranoia about crime, living slow-motion death sentences in ghettos from which no amount of presidential hope, change, or lecturing can release them.

Even more important, Americans have begun to understand that the scourge-ification of this underclass is inseparable from the realization of our worst collective nightmare—the scourging of America itself, the ruin of the promise of America that still strikes us in our gut as providential. The widespread belief, still largely subconscious or at least unspoken, that America is breaking, and that we deserve the suffering ahead.

This isn’t an abstract problem either. We know that America is exceptional in one key respect—we came to democracy without much bloodshed. Around the world, from Hungary and Russia to Iraq and Nigeria, we see the dream of peaceful democratization dragged again and again to what the philosopher Hegel called the slaughter-bench of history. Racial strife and murderous governments, not liberty and democracy, are the rule in history, the established pattern. We know that, mercifully, democratization scourged us only once in ferociously modern style: during the Civil War.

“Fondly do we hope,” Lincoln {said}<hyperlink=”http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres32.html”> in his Second Inaugural, “fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said ‘the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.’”

We do not want this to be true. This is what we fear: that America, despite its brilliance and its progress, is inescapably complicit in the sin of slavery and racism, bearing a moral debt that cannot be repaid but in suffering and blood—as such debts are paid so routinely around the world which we pride ourselves, however rationally, on standing so far above.

No amount of militarization can save us from such terrifying justice—the justice of what King has one unhinged survivor in The Stand call a “Killer God.”

“Does it have to go on and on until the earth belongs to the roaches? He’s no God,” the survivor screams. Discussing the passage, Ross Douthat has {observed}<hyperlink=”http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/02/stephen-kings-american-apocalypse”> that King terrifies us with a God “who is prepared to let his people perish for purposes beyond their understanding.”

But we understand. Dig down, and we know why our dark and twisted fantasies of a suffering, angry American underclass have finally come true. We know why our obsession with health and safety has manifested in a monstrous paramilitary that can swarm our streets in a heartbeat. If we are to be scourged, we know we are to blame.

Perhaps the shock of unity brought on by Ferguson will occasion our turn away from this path—if, we must add, there is still time.",NA,NA,NA,Many of the hyperlinks link to articles or tweets written by the author himself
DailyBeast,beast4,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/18/you-can-buy-body-cameras-for-ferguson-p-d.html,"If Ferguson P.D. Is Too Broke to Buy Body Cameras, Let's Do It fFor Them",Michael Daly,8/18/2014,1/6/2016,"For less than $400, the world could’ve known what transpired between Michael Brown and Officer Wilson.

For less than $400, the Ferguson Police Department could have equipped Officer Darren Wilson with a body camera such as is worn with great success in various police departments across the country.

And had Wilson been wearing one when he encountered Michael Brown, there would likely be little or be no question as to what exactly transpired.

The Ferguson Police do have two dashboard cams, but Chief Tom Jackson says he lacks the $3,000 per camera cost to install them.

As it is, the two forensic pathologists who performed an autopsy on 18-year-old Brown at the request of his family are saying that wounds from the six bullets that struck the teen could be consistent with more than one scenario.

The pathologists suggested at a press conference on Monday that Brown might have been shot while surrendering with his hands up.

But the pathologists allowed that at this point their examination of the wounds does not rule out the possibility that he was charging the police officer.

“There are a number of possibilities,” said Dr. Michael Baden, the former New York City chief medical examiner who conducted the autopsy.

Even after the eyewitnesses give their accounts—Monday, a {very convincing 19-year-old woman who was on her way to work came forward}<hyperlink=“http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2014/08/18/newday-intv-ferguson-shooting-crenshaw.cnn”> —and the officer gives his version, the question of what exactly happened may well remain in contention.

And that is where a body cam would no doubt have made all the difference.

The body cam generally favored by the police departments who use the devices is Taser’s Axon On. The company’s website touts the Axon On as ”an ultra-durable on-officer camera designed to balance both simplicity and performance.” 

“A 130-degree wide-angle lens, multiple on-body mounting options,"" the site adds, noting that it can be mounted on everything from a shirt pocket to a utility belt.

The price is $399, which means that all 52 officers of the Ferguson Police Department could be outfitted for under $20,800.

Wouldn’t you want one if were good and upstanding officer who was now patrolling Ferguson and became involved in a new incident?

Don’t you think the residents of Ferguson would feel safer if all the officers wore a body cam?

For four days Ferguson, Missouri has existed in various states of chaos, conflict, confusion and indignation over the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager killed by a cop Saturday night. Wednesday night was, for the most part, peaceful. But following a warning from police to protesters that public assembly should only take place during daylight hours, disorder took hold in the form of marching police, tear gas, rubber bullets and other ammunition of suppression. On this fourth day it was a scene that has become all too familiar for the residents of Ferguson.

“It’s not going to stop,” said Phil Bowdry, wearing a paper surgical mask tucked under his chin in preparation for the tear gas that still hung in the air nearly two hours after the climax of Wednesday night’s round of chaos. “This is just the beginning.”

Bowdry was at the protest with a man who identified himself only as Mike Brown, in solidarity with a phrase many protesters have chanted since the young man’s death: “We are Mike Brown.”

“Did the police get touched?” the anonymous man asked. “No. It was Mike who got gunned down by the police.”

That Brown was unarmed and, according to many on the streets of Ferguson, surrendering to police, is the {cause of rage here}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/11/what-you-gonna-do-kill-us-all-protesters-ask-ferguson-police.html”>.

A sense of calm materialized after Tuesday’s visit by Al Sharpton but that fell apart on Wednesday night. A local TV station had set up a live feed to capture the carnage, and national media outlets began to pay even greater attention to the situation in this small, St. Louis suburb, of which {an even more microscopic area}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/12/michael-brown-s-hometown-is-under-occupation.html”> is now ground zero for discussions of civil liberties, race relations and police power.

Bowdry and his friend, standing near the QuikTrip gas station that has become home to protests following Brown’s death, were far outnumbered Wednesday night by police who congregated across the street near SWAT trucks that have become a familiar part of the tense atmosphere here. More than a few times, the faces of Bawdry, a man picking up trash near the main protest area, and anyone walking down West Florissant Avenue were illuminated by spotlights from atop the SWAT vehicles.

Among the garbage was the typical detritus of public gatherings: water bottles, soda cans, candy wrappers. Also typical, at least for the past four nights here, were the plastic wrist-cuff ties, spent smoke bombs, tear gas canisters and rubber bullet shell casings. A man named Tom Tucker decided to start the clean-up. At one point, an officer across the street announced to his riot-ready companions: “he’s just picking up trash. He’s fine.”

“I’m just trying to clean up,” Tucker said. He might have work to do for the foreseeable future.

To refer to these nights of protest as clashes with police would be a misrepresentation of the situation. And to say the protests have turned violent would also be incorrect. No police have been harmed in any of the demonstrations that have taken place, mostly, in front of the QuikTime gas station, known on the streets of Ferguson as “the QT.” The Ferguson Chief of Police, Thomas Jackson, did, however, announce late Tuesday that the officer who killed Brown was injured in the alleged scuffle that led to the teen’s death. Whatever your term is, the unrest that has taken over this small city continued Wednesday night, with police {firing the ammunition}<hyperlink=” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO1SKC6dK7o&feature=youtu.be”> that could still be seen on Florissant as the midnight hour approached.

“I ain’t going to throw these away,” Tucker remarked to himself, touching signs previously held by protesters. The posterboards contained messages to police, and had been discarded on concrete barricades that have blocked entrance to the destroyed gas station since Sunday.

“They’re trying to sweep this under the rug, and the only thing you need to sweep things under the rug is time,” said the man calling himself Mike Brown. “Until Mike gets buried, I’ll be out here.

FERGUSON, Mo. — David Hoech was the last, and most unexpected, protester of the night. The 74-year-old Vietnam veteran drove 60 miles to Ferguson, where for the last three days unrest has gripped the town following Michael Brown’s killing by a cop. Hoech approached the line of police and SWAT vehicles in his sedan late Tuesday, turned around, and parked. When he opened the door, he leaned on his oxygen tank as police shone a spotlight on him. He walked across West Florissant Avenue, recently vacated by a large, boisterous, yet peaceful crowd that told police “We are Mike Brown.”

David Hoech also had something to say.

“The only thing that matters in all of this is that mother who lost her son,” he said not far from the police line. “I want to give her a hug and tell her I love her. I have four kids and eight grandkids and I haven’t had to bury any one of them. What she’s going through must be terrible.”

If Hoech had shown up hours before, the police response might have been different. Following earlier pleas for calm from the likes of Al Sharpton, the situation became charged just after 7 p.m. Tuesday. For the next three hours, a small group taunted law enforcement. Several times, young men approached police only to have red dots from sniper rifles painted onto their chests. At one point, however, police showed tremendous restraint when a car drove nearly to the line, only to turn around after panicked screams from the officers outfitted in riot gear.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said little about the situation and the specifics of Brown’s death, other than the fact the 18-year-old was shot “multiple times” and that the unnamed officer was injured in the face. Outside the St. Louis County Attorney’s Office on Tuesday morning, where a crowd had gathered in anticipation of a press conference held by law enforcement that never materialized, three young men stared down a wall of police holding signs that read “Am I Next?” One of them, Troy Jones, a 19-year-old aspiring photojournalist, remembered Brown from the scrimmage line.

“He was a good matchup,” Jones said of Brown, a defensive lineman for his high school football team.

Standing next to Jones was 18-year-old Gianni Cook, who said the town’s beef with the police wasn’t about race but restraint, or the lack thereof.

“Most importantly it’s about reining in these police officers,” he said.

Early-evening protests Tuesday prompted police to {shut down Florissant, a main drag in Ferguson}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/12/michael-brown-s-hometown-is-under-occupation.html”> that has been the center of clashes with police Monday night and looting on Sunday.

Just before 7 p.m. the protesters took to the street in front of the torched QuikTime gas station, chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot!” It’s the popular slogan referencing the belief that Brown was surrendering when he was gunned down. And for the second night in a row, the police tactic of cutting off the main protest area from the rest of the community initially backfired, drawing residents who learned of the cops in riot gear and the redirecting of traffic through word of mouth and rapidly spreading social media posts.

Unlike Monday night, when chaos didn’t rear its head until dusk, a police chopper and the heavy law enforcement presence that preceded it was hovering before the sun went down. But it didn’t last, with only small group staying in the area until just after 10 when they were joined by a marching band of mostly young black men, chanting “Hands up. Don’t shoot” and “No justice, no peace” and “We are Mike Brown.”

The crowd of more than 200 stared down a wall of riot police and said their piece, loudly and peacefully.

Police said nothing after initially warning the group to leave. 

Unlike the previous two nights not a single shot was fired.

“I came out here to say what’s right and what’s wrong, and this is wrong,” Sharon Whitaker said. The 57-year-old Gulf War veteran at one point knelt on the pavement in front of police, who were in a protective position behind two SWAT trucks. “We got to watch these kids die and it don’t make no sense. Just because they live in a certain neighborhood doesn’t mean they shouldn’t have a chance.”

Brown’s chance is a well-remembered memory here. He was to begin college on Monday but instead, as attorney Benjamin Crump noted at a press conference with Sharpton, Brown’s family was preparing for a funeral. The family has secured the services of Crump, who represented Trayvon Martin’s family.

Brown has taken on legendary status in Ferguson, as the spray paint marking the spot where he died indicates. “I am legend,” it reads.

While many are focused on seeking justice for Brown’s death, some, like Hoech, have said they want only healing and the mending of a community torn apart by the events of the past few days.

“I want to go back there and talk to the people,” Hoech told officers at the police line, eventually succeeding and becoming the only person allowed through all night. “This is America. I can go where I want to go. And if you’re going to shoot my ass, go ahead and shoot me.”

FERGUSON, Mo. — The people here don’t feel like they’re living in America’s heartland; they feel like they’re living in occupied territory.

The occupied land is small, virtually microscopic in comparison to the St. Louis metropolitan area. The neighborhoods off West Florissant Avenue, including the apartment complex where Michael Brown lived before he was gunned down by a policeman Saturday night, are where most of the city’s black population reside. Patrolling it is Ferguson’s police department of 55 officers, 52 of them white.

“It’s like the elephant in the room,” said Yusra, 45, of East St. Louis. “We are being occupied.”

“They say it’s the death of three men that started a chain reaction of death and destruction in Gaza,” she continued. “Will we as a people rise up like the people of Gaza? Will our community be bombed like last night with tear gas? That was a terrorist attack.”

On Monday, {police clashed with protesters who raised their hands in the air and yelled “Don’t shoot!”}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/11/what-you-gonna-do-kill-us-all-protesters-ask-ferguson-police.html”> The gesture has become a rallying cry for Ferguson’s black youth: it’s in reference to the assertion that Brown was on his knees, already shot twice and raising his hands in the air in a symbol of surrender, when the still unnamed officer killed the teen.

Posing for a picture with a group of friends, a line of riot ready police in the background, Miller Gardner held his hands in the air.

Initially reluctant to give his name due to his impending deployment for the Air Force, Gardner defied any negative repercussions that may come with him speaking out.

“It’s messed up they’re suited for war against civilians,” he said. “I’m not on that side and I’m in the military. They need to come on this side of the line.”

In a McDonald’s not far from Monday night’s protest zone, journalists gathered to sip drinks and use free WiFi Tuesday evening. As the national news broadcasts began, three young men sat down to eat, talking with a woman seated nearby. The topic of conversation is the only thing worth discussing here: Mike Brown, the cop who killed him, and the state of occupation.

“That’s the biggest problem of them all,” said Cory Black, one of the men inside the McDonald’s. “We don’t even know who all these officers are who are patrolling our streets.”

Forget all the officers, most people here just want to know the identity of the one who took Brown down, setting off Sunday’s looting, Monday’s clashes, and a national scandal by Tuesday that even saw President Obama weigh in.

Black wore a hat with his surname, the A formed by a depiction of the African continent. With him were Tyrone McDonald, dressed in fatigues and hiking boots, and Robert Henry, his hat bearing a blacked out American flag, hanging upside down. Their militarized garb reflected the atmosphere: West Florissant is a war zone.

“They just started saying to get out of the street or they were going to start shooting,” McDonald said of Monday’s protests. “That’s exactly what they did.”

For the third day protesters and residents made their voices heard. At a morning protest in front of a police-barricaded St. Louis County Attorney’s Office. On the steps of the old courthouse in the shadow of the arch where Al Sharpton addressed a media horde. And finally, fittingly, at the QuikTime gas station, destroyed by Sunday night’s looting. The “QT,” as its known is the heart of occupied territory. Yusra sat quietly there holding a sign.

“Mike Brown Is It Going Down Like Gaza?”

Protesters Ask Ferguson Police",Justin Glawe,8/11/2014,1/7/2016,"Despite appeals for calm from Michael Brown’s family, on Monday night the streets of Ferguson were bathed in tear gas and the crack of rubber bullets being fired.

FERGUSON, Mo. — After a day of mostly peaceful protests over the death of an unarmed black teenager on Saturday, young protesters and police clashed in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, as the sun set on this St. Louis suburb that is increasingly becoming the focus of national attention.

The second night of unrest followed the Saturday afternoon shooting death of 18-year-old Mike Brown by a cop who, residents and neighbors say, fired between seven and 10 bullets into his body, killing him and setting off a chain reaction that has the potential to become a case of national interest rivaling the death of Trayvon Martin.

By 8 p.m. Monday, police had blocked off a larger portion of West Florissant Avenue, the scene of looting Sunday night and protests all day Monday. With many residents approaching from the north, police began firing tear gas canisters to disperse the crowd and prevent vehicles from advancing. As acrid and stinging smoke filled the air, some expressed the rage and indignation that has been brewing since Brown’s death. “What you gonna do, kill us all? This ain’t the South,” one man screamed at police. “All you motherfuckers, this ain’t the South.”

SWAT teams moved in and tear gas canisters were heard from the perimeter of what had essentially become a militarized zone. Hundreds of police swarmed the area while young African-American men taunted them and refused to go home. Others walked with their hands in the air, mimicking the gestures of someone showing they were unarmed. There were unconfirmed reports of police firing rubber bullets into the crowds.

In one video posted online by {Antonio French}<hyperlink=” https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench”>, an alderman for the 21st Ward in St. Louis who was taking part in the protests, it appears a heavily armored policeman points a rifle briefly at the alderman and angrily waves him off.

Earlier in the day, Benjamin Crump, the attorney who represented Martin’s family, joined St. Louis-based attorney Anthony Gray and the Brown family at a press conference Monday evening. Packed into the humid worship room of the Jennings Mason Temple, Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, and his stepfather, Louis Head, pleaded for peace, while simultaneously calling for answers regarding Brown’s death.

""We want justice for our son,” Head said.

Prior to Crump’s press conference, Sabrina Webb, Brown’s cousin, made a similar plea in front of a gas station destroyed in Sunday night's madness.

“Can you really fight the police with just a 9mm?” she begged, referencing the reports of shots fired between police and protesters on Sunday.

Some in the crowd replied, “Yes we can!”

But Webb, a voice of reason among some of the more boisterous speakers, did repeat an unconfined rumor that Brown had been shot as many as 10 times.

“They emptied a whole clip into him,” she said. The police have said only that Brown was shot “multiple times.”

A popular story, and another cause of anger here, holds that Brown’s stepfather, immediately following the young man, went to a nearby store to make a sign claiming police had “executed” his son. When he returned, Brown’s body was still on the street uncovered. The claim by many is that for four and a half hours Brown stayed that way.

Also on Monday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation {announced}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2014/08/11/unarmed-teen-s-death-sparks-protests.html”> it would open an inquiry into Brown’s death, focusing on possible violations of civil rights.

Accounts of what led to the {shooting differ}<hyperlink=” http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/different-versions-of-the-encounter-that-led-to-a-fatal/article_29f84765-24f3-53bb-8ca3-77f780f79d8f.html”>. The only common element is that Brown was walking with another man when the pair were stopped by police. Some kind of altercation ensued, and Brown was killed.

The police say Brown went for the officer’s gun. Family members and community residents say he was shot in cold blood after escaping an officer’s arm around his neck, raising his hands to show he was unarmed.

{Described as a “gentle giant”}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/michael-brown-remembered-as-a-gentle-giant/article_cbafa12e-7305-5fd7-8e0e-3139f472d130.html”> in a St. Louis Post-Dispatch story about the killing, local residents have expressed incredulity at the police’s version of events. The consternation has been exacerbated by a lack of statements from police about the specifics of the altercation, and their refusal to release the name of the officer involved. That continued today.

“The community is pretty unified about what happened,” said 33-year-old Christopher Phillips, standing near a pile of stuffed animals tumbled against a post: a makeshift memorial that marks where Brown was gunned down.

And in the middle of the street, since cleaned of Brown’s blood, are the words “I Am Legend” in red spray paint.

Following Crump’s press conference, black community members and the national director of the NAACP, Cornell Williams Brooks, held a town hall meeting at the Murchison Tabernacle CME Church. Brooks {called for non-violent protests}<hyperlink=” http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/civil-rights-leaders-urge-calm-in-st-louis-suburbs-rocked/article_dc6fd411-b789-51d4-b974-ac4d4f96aba5.html”>.

Echoing the description of Brown as peaceful, Brooks said, “If Mike Brown lived his life non-violently, then we can carry out our campaign for justice non-violently.”

But that theme of peace fell apart at the seams as night fell. With police blocking off a large stretch of West Florrisant Avenue, including the main protest area in front of the destroyed gas station where Webb spoke Monday afternoon, chaos ensued.

Like the clouds of tear gas on the avenue, rumors continued to sting and swirl as they have since Brown’s killing, but Webb, Brown’s other loved ones, and the community were no closer to having any answers.

FERGUSON, Mo. — A small group of protesters, with outside agitators among them, defied a curfew here Saturday night, clashing with police a week after the shooting death of the unarmed Michael Brown at the hands of a Ferguson police officer. Seven people were arrested and one person was shot and critically wounded by an unknown gunman.

Members of the Revolution Club of Chicago helped to gin up support for resistance to the curfew, {imposed by Gov. Jay Nixon earlier in the day}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/16/missouri-governor-imposes-curfew-in-a-bid-to-halt-looting-and-restore-calm.html”> and set to begin at midnight. 

Shortly after 12 a.m. members of the group and residents advanced toward police, who for the first time since the introduction of Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson into this saga formed a line of riot-ready officers and SWAT vehicles. It was a scene that Nixon and other officials were hoping to avoid, but one that has become bizarrely familiar to residents here. 

After repeated warnings to disperse, police fired on the crowd, sending tear gas canisters clanking down the street as chaos ensued. Initially, some media outlets reported the police's assertion that the bombs were simply smoke grenades. But the situation on the ground told a different story. As protesters and a relatively small number of journalists scattered—many stayed in the police designated ""staging area"" a few blocks north of the protest zone—the telltale signs of tear gas began to take hold. 

A female resident was seen vomiting and was helped off the ground by a man. A photographer also lost his lunch due to the gas. Many were heard coughing and seen rubbing watery, stinging red eyes. For a chaotic stretch of about 20 minutes police fired at least two dozen bombs, their smoke taking over the area and sending residents into nearby neighborhoods. Then came the flanking attack.

From the north—opposite the area where many journalists sat, confined to the staging area by threat of arrest—a St. Louis County squad car approached. Seconds after it was seen, rubber bullets went flying in multiple directions, whistling through the air and ricocheting off buildings, cars, fences and the street. But just as suddenly as it appeared, the firing squad cars were gone.

The return of riot cops may have been prompted by gunfire. {There were media reports that at least one person was carrying a handgun}<hyperlink=” http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11039414/Ferguson-shooting-Police-clash-with-protestors-defying-curfew.html”>, resulting in the shooting of someone unrelated to the protests. That person is critically wounded, Johnson told reporters. Other reports said armed men had broken into a restaurant.  

That outsiders have inserted themselves into the situation may not be surprising. For a week now reports of a surprisingly hyper-militarized police force in this small suburb of St. Louis and a series of disturbing developments regarding Brown's death have captured the attention of the world. 

Prior to the latest round of this conflict Saturday night, representatives of another group, many of whom are not from Ferguson, played an entirely different role than the radical group from Chicago. The New Black Panther Party made their presence known Saturday night. Their leader, Malik Shabazz, implored protesters to abide by the curfew for hours preceding the violence. Group by group, Shabazz and his followers made their way up and down West Florissant Avenue, which by day is a fairly typical boulevard of strip malls and restaurants that has turned into a corridor of chaos several nights this week. In these somewhat random but methodical visits, Shabazz pleaded with protesters.

""They got a plan to slaughter us tonight,"" he told the crowd through a bullhorn.

Often, the groups Shabazz spoke to most fervently were comprised of young men, some with bandanas or other cloth covering their faces. These groups, Shabazz knows, are the ones coming out late at night, in some cases openly taunting police, looking for revenge over Brown's death, or just wanting to send a message to a police department they see as oppressive. 

""You got to promise that we get our justice,"" one masked youth told Shabazz.

Malik responded through the bullhorn, calling for the immediate indictment of Darren Wilson, the cop who shot and killed Brown.

It was a common sentiment, and one expressed by anguished residents at the governor’s news conference where he announced the curfew earlier on Saturday.

The media event quickly descended into shouts from the crowd that were met with frustrated looks from public officials. As with many situations here, the event was indicative of the level of conflict permeating this St. Louis suburb since Brown’s death last week.

Several people at the press conference called for the indictment of Wilson—a six-year veteran of the Ferguson Police Department. Residents and activists were so vociferous in their dressing down of Johnson and Nixon Saturday afternoon that few reporters were able to ask questions of their own. 

“Stop killing our people!” one man yelled.

At the time, Johnson said the police assigned to keep order would not enforce the curfew with the SWAT trucks and riot gear-equipped cops that have dominated front pages across the country since Brown’s death. But that is what happened. 

As the curfew time of midnight approached it began to look like the efforts of Shabazz, who said at the press conference earlier that he didn’t believe the curfew could be imposed without confrontation, wouldn't be enough. Instead of imploring protesters to leave, a young Black Panther—maybe aged 12—repeated the phone number of a friendly attorney to call should anyone be arrested. Seven were.

Regardless of whether they left, Shabazz had a message for the residents, activists, protesters and radicals who withstood a midnight downpour only to flee when tear gas came raining down on them.

""The world is watching,"" he told the crowd. ""And they love us.""

A curfew won’t fix that.

FERGUSON, Mo. — The response early Saturday to looting in Ferguson, Mo., was a mass exodus of police from the main protest area, which left a convenience store and other businesses wide open to theft and destruction. Now, the new game plan for protests over the death of unarmed teen Michael Brown that are expected to continue Saturday night is the polar opposite. 

Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency on Saturday and announced a curfew for parts of Ferguson, Mo., from 12-5 a.m. tonight in an effort to prevent the looting that occurred Saturday morning and restrain the heavy-handed police action that has been taking place all week in protests here.

“We won’t enforce [the curfew] with trucks. We won’t enforce it with tear gas. We're going to communicate and talk about (how) it's time to go home,” said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in the area after Nixon relieved the St. Louis County Police Department of their duties.

Johnson and the governor were repeatedly interrupted at the press conference by an angry and frustrated community. The media event quickly descended into shouts from the crowd that were met with frustrated looks from public officials. As with many situations here, the event was indicative of the level of conflict permeating this St. Louis suburb since Brown’s death last week.

Several people at the press conference called for the indictment of the officer who shot and killed Brown a week ago this evening — a six-year veteran of the Ferguson Police Department named Darren Wilson. Residents and activists were so vociferous in their dressing down of Johnson and Nixon Saturday afternoon that few reporters were able to ask questions of their own. 

“Stop killing our people!” one man yelled.

It’s unclear how Johnson and his forces — which continue to included officers from the St. Louis County and Ferguson police departments, among others — will enforce the curfew. But Johnson said it won’t be done with the SWAT trucks and riot gear-equipped cops that have dominated front pages across the country since Brown’s death.

Malik Shabazz, a member of the New Black Panther Party who are here in the hundreds, said what was likely on many people’s minds.

“I don’t believe that police can enforce the curfew without a confrontation,” Shabazz told Johnson as he stood behind a cluster of microphones.

Police avoided confrontation almost completely last night. Only one tear gas canister was fired by an officer after he felt threatened when three of his fellow officers were injured, Johnson said Saturday. After Mauricelm-Lei Millere, another New Black Panther Party member, implored a small group of protesters to go home in the wee hours of Saturday, police left.

That’s when the looting began. Several storefronts had already been shattered by that time. But Ferguson Market, now at the center of national attention since Police Chief Thomas Jackson announced it was the scene of a “strong-armed” robbery of which Brown was the alleged perpetrator, was the most heavily damaged.
Officers from multiple law enforcement agencies had left the area of the store after another lengthy protest over the death of unarmed teen Brown. 

Thursday night’s protests were peaceful following Johnson taking over as head of security after days of clashes that had seen dozens of arrests and the firing of tear gas, rubber bullets and flash grenades. The demonstrations were calm mainly thanks to Johnson, but he, the MSHP and several other police organizations still working to deescalate the situation here were nowhere to be found as masked looters — mostly young men — had their way with the store. 

On Friday morning, Jackson released Wilson’s name, along with the account of the robbery. Residents have been loudly and angrily calling for the release of the officer’s name since Brown’s death, which sparked almost a week’s worth of riots and disturbance and laid bare fault lines of race, police power and the worth of the lives of young black men in the United States.

But it was a matter of one step forward and two steps back. After the police released Wilson’s name, they also released photos they said showed Brown had robbed Ferguson Market of a pack of cigars before Wilson stopped and ultimately killed him.

This post-mortum attempt to paint Brown as a suspect angered the mostly black community of Ferguson. It was further exacerbated when Jackson said Wilson knew nothing of the alleged robbery. Any clashes or violence Saturday night will almost surely be rooted in the implementation of the curfew. 

Nixon said the curfew is necessary, despite the efforts of some Ferguson residents to prevent looting. Like Millere, small groups did attempt to protect the Ferguson Market and other stores Saturday night, but those efforts failed after police left and young men with their faces covered in bandanas lifted liquor, tobacco products and at least one cash register from the market.

“We also saw a pattern last develop last night when after hours of people protesting, small groups took to the streets, with the intent of committing crimes, and endangering citizens,” Nixon said. “That is unacceptable.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

FERGUSON, Missouri — Among the protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, a small group is causing most of the trouble, drawing attention away from the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown and toward the captivating images of tear gas smoke, fleeing residents and cops in battle gear that have become part of a huge international news story.

On Monday night the agitators had their way once again.

Joey Johnson, a member of the Revolution Club of Chicago, {did his best to incite a violent reaction from police}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench/status/501623329376464897”> not far from a group of men who worked to hold back others. After hours of walking in long, oval circles on sidewalks along West Florissant Avenue, (protesters weren’t allowed in the road by police until their numbers grew too great) a group of about 1,000 marchers approached a line of police in newly fallen darkness. Once there, in front of the largest gathering of media yet, some from the community worked to prevent confrontation. Johnson worked to do the opposite.

There was a scuffle near the front line of police in SWAT gear that nearly prompted the violent reaction many have come to expect after this chaotic week, and Johnson was in the middle of it. When he came out, Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who has been documenting the protests and was {arrested for “unlawful assembly}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/14/antonio-french-ferguson-arrest-released-police/14064687/”>,” was standing over Johnson. French did not look pleased.

The Revolution Club of Chicago, in concert with the Revolutionary Communist Party, has been in Ferguson since at least Wednesday. They aren’t the only ones who have been aggressive with police, but, perhaps as a response to the arrest of two of its members Monday afternoon, Johnson felt he had a point to make.

But he wasn’t the only one. The night once again ended in smoky chaos as a small group of protesters egged on police to the point of reaction. Some in that group were clearly {outsiders}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/17/street-battle-against-cops-again-in-ferguson-despite-midnight-curfew.html”>. Others were young men from the area, {their faces covered in bandanas}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/16/looters-break-calm-in-ferguson.html”>, ready for anonymous rampage.

Ronald Harris, who lives not far from {Ferguson Market and Liquor}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/uneasy-peace-in-ferguson-in-danger-after-slain-brown-named-as-suspect-in-robbery.html”>, considers himself part of the younger generation despite his 41 years. He said there are two groups of local protesters, divided by age.

“The older group, they’re all about prayers and peaceful marching. [They can] come out and march until their feet turn to blisters, but at night, keep your women and children at home,” he said, adding that the violence and clashes with police over the past week have been seen as acceptable among his friends. “Our generation is the one getting pulled over by police, getting harassed by police, getting killed by police.

“We’re out here every day.”

And they’ll continue to be.

“People are tired of this system of oppression,” he said.

That system, Harris said, on Monday extended to when, where and how protesters were allowed express their displeasure with police.

Monday brought even more restrictions for protest zone than has existed since Brown’s death last Saturday. And while police have rightfully been criticized for their heavy-handed approach to the protests that have gone on since Brown’s death, the intelligence they’ve gathered regarding some of the more riotous protesters has been correct. Those who wish to do physical harm to law enforcement are small in number, and subversive in tactics.

Eric Dix of the Revolutionary Communist Party was among them. “I have an ironic problem,” he said. “I can’t stand on my own two feet. I have to keep moving.” Hundreds of other protesters also had to keep moving or face arrest, so they marched. They went up and down Florissant, where demonstrations were at first riotous, then jubilant after a security takeover by Capt. Ron Johnson and his Missouri State Highway Patrol, and finally violent again, with residents and protesters fleeing from police tear gas and rubber bullets on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.

Still, the residents of Ferguson who have been enraged over Brown’s killing went home Monday night without getting what they wanted: the arrest and indictment of the officer who shot and killed Brown, Darren Wilson.

“We want Darren Wilson,” some shouted at police just before the multiple rounds of tear gas that ended Monday night’s protest were fired.

The police tactics employed Monday night were to control and contain, although there was no sign of the National Guard. Protesters were restricted to sidewalks, and journalists once again were confined to an area derisively referred to as “the playpen,” an area that included the parking lot of Ferguson Market and Liquor and a patch of grass in front of the McDonald’s where last week police pulled a catch and release on reporters Wesley Lowery and Ryan Reilly. The threats to members of the media continued Monday, culminating with the arrest and release of Getty Images photographer Scott Olson. At the QuikTrip gas station, broadcast news crews were told to leave Monday afternoon, and later in the evening CNN’s Don Lemon was threatened with arrest while reporting live.

The handling of the press, while increased in its forcefulness in the last two days, is consistent with the media’s treatment over the past week. Ostensibly for their own safety, police at times have refused access to the main protest zone, threatening arrest if journalists are found behind the lines.

But as the tear gas canisters were being fired Monday night, the number of protesters was nearly equaled by photographers in gas masks and smartphone-wielding reporters. Once again the focus of Tuesday’s papers and late Monday news stories focused on the sideshow, and not the burning questions surrounding the death of a young man who would have entered his second week of college today.

DailyBeast,beast13,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/16/looters-break-calm-in-ferguson.html,"Looting, Clashes Shatter Uneasy Calm",Justin Glawe,8/16/2014,1/16/2016,"Ferguson, Mo., had returned to a state of wary unease but early morning looting is likely to inflame things.

FERGUSON, Mo. — A man with a red bandana over his face loaded liquor bottles into a plastic bag early Saturday behind the counter of Ferguson Market and Liquor.

""Y'all don't think the police are going to come, do you?""

The answer was no. Officers from multiple law enforcement agencies had left the area of the store after another lengthy protest over the death of unarmed teen Michael Brown, who died after being shot by a cop in Ferguson, Missouri last Sunday. The store—named Friday as the location of a robbery that Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Brown carried out—remained vulnerable to looters as 5 a.m. came and went.

The past two nights of protests were peaceful following Gov. Jay Nixon's orders that the St. Louis County Police Department be relieved of their duties as head of security after days of clashes that have seen dozens of arrests and the firing of tear gas, rubber bullets and flash grenades. The demonstrations on Thursday and Friday were calm mainly thanks to Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, tapped by Nixon to lead police efforts here. Johnson, the MSHP and several other police organizations still working to deescalate the situation here were nowhere to be found as masked looters—mostly young men—had their way with the store. 

""Don't take a picture of me,"" one said.

It was a clear sign that after nearly a week of unrest, the anger local police hoped would abate with the release of the name of police officer who shot 18-year-old Michael Brown to death on Sunday remained.

Ferguson police officials on Friday released the name of the officer—Darren Wilson—who allegedly shot Brown to death in a disputed altercation, which has sparked almost a week’s worth of riots and disturbance in this St. Louis suburb and laid bare fault lines of race, police power and the worth of the lives of young black men in the United States.

But it was a matter of one step forward and two steps back. After the police released Wilson’s name, they also released photos they said showed Brown had robbed a nearby convenience store of a pack of cigars before Wilson stopped and ultimately killed him.

This post-mortum attempt to paint Brown as a suspect angered the mostly black community of Ferguson. It was further exacerbated when Jackson said Wilson knew nothing of the alleged robbery.

That puts the community and police back at square one, with the original story of Brown being stopped for jaywalking returning to the center of the controversy. That could result in an increased amount of anger on the part of protesters who, as they have for the last six days, gathered Friday night in front of the QuikTrip gas station destroyed in Sunday night’s looting to voice their dissent.

Johnson said the plan for Friday was the same as Thursday: let the protesters do their thing. 

“We’re going to have a good time tonight,” Johnson told CNN’s Don Lemon. The crowd around the pair cheered at Johnson’s statement.
 
Given the looting early Saturday morning, those words could come back to haunt him and the community.

About 1 a.m. reports of tear gas being fired by police began surfacing on Twitter. By 4 a.m., after police left the area, the lights were on inside the store and looters took their bounty. Boxes of Swisher Sweets, the same cigars Brown is accused of stealing, littered the floor. Liquor bottles clanked as raiders loaded them into bags. And a digital ringing, possibly from a security mechanism on the destroyed front door, made for an eerie background of white noise as young men with bandanas went about their business.

Earlier on Friday, Jay Kanzler, an attorney for the family that owns Ferguson Market and Liquor, the site of Brown’s alleged robbery, confirmed that theirs was the convenience store where police say Brown committed the robbery. The St. Louis County Police Department, the same organization relieved of its duties by Nixon after a national uproar following clashes with protesters Wednesday night, collected surveillance footage from the store Friday afternoon. The move was officially an execution of a search warrant filed Friday. The store remained closed, an employee there said. 

“Many of the customers know the owners of the market on a first name basis and vice versa,” said Kanzler. “Ferguson Market’s owners and employees, like everyone in this community, is saddened by what happened and wants to see this matter resolved on a peaceful basis and let justice take its course.”

By 6 p.m. yesterday, a crowd of hundreds had gathered and around the market. More than a dozen police cars were in the parking lot.

Dennis Banks, a Chicago comedian who works under the pseudonym Felonious Munk and who had come to take part in the protests, said the release of surveillance photos depicting a man police said was Brown accosting a store employee during the alleged robbery was unnecessary and did more harm than good.

“Is this something they’re doing pre-trial to taint a jury?” Banks speculated. “While that might work on a jury, it’s not working for the people out here. From last night’s almost festive mood it has shifted to a lot of angst and a lot of anger.”

Rumors have been circulating all week that Brown had stolen a pack of cigars from a convenience store not far from the Canfield Green Apartments where he lived. Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson, has repeatedly said the pair were stopped for jaywalking. The only thing that both sides agree on is that an altercation ensued, and Brown was shot multiple times. The number of bullet wounds is a matter of contention here. On the streets of Ferguson residents say Brown was shot as many as 10 times.

“Where are the pictures that show the commission of the crime?” said a woman who only identified herself as Ms. Jourdan. “What is this showing to the public and to the media? Why didn’t that packet include the picture of him laying down in the street in his own blood?”

Perry Jackson scoffed at the idea Brown stole anything, and said the young man’s life was worth far more than the cheap cigars many have speculated were the item he may have taken.

A 45-year-old Ferguson resident, Jackson said he knows at least one thing that will happen in the coming weeks.
“You know they’re going to come out and say he had marijuana in his system,” Jackson said. “Just like they did with Trayvon Martin.”

But then they named him as a suspect in a robbery, sparking fresh anger.

FERGUSON, Missouri — The Ferguson Police Department revealed the most pressing detail in the death of Michael Brown by releasing the name of the officer who killed the unarmed teen—Darren Wilson. But it may have undone the calming effect of yesterday by immediately naming him as a suspect in a petty robbery of a convenience store.

“A lot of the stakeholders had a big meeting conversation yesterday, and then yesterday evening,” Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson {told a St. Louis television station}<hyperlink=” http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/us/darren-wilson-identified-as-officer-in-fatal-shooting-in-ferguson-missouri.html”>, “and we made the determination that today is the day.”

But following the press conference, many were enraged at Jackson’s assertion that Brown was involved in an alleged robbery, prompting the deadly altercation.

A small group of protesters chanted “No justice, no peace” in the parking lot of the QuikTrip gas station, scene of the demonstrations that have taken place since Brown’s death on Saturday.

“It couldn’t be armed robbery because he didn’t have no gun. Where’s the weapon?” said James Sias. “We going to have to wait for the Justice Department now.”

Rumors have been circulating all week that Brown had stolen a pack of cigars from a convenience store not far from the Canfield Green Apartments where he lived. Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson, has repeatedly said the pair were stopped for jaywalking. The only thing that both sides agree on is that an altercation ensued, and Brown was shot multiple times. The number of bullet wounds is a matter of contention here. On the streets of Ferguson residents say Brown was shot as many as 10 times.

The anger at what many perceived as the Ferguson police’s attempts at justifying the shooting by alleging Brown was involved in a robbery could shatter the fragile peace that took hold last night after Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson took over security in the area.

{Last night, he did what no cop has done for the past five days:}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/an-uneasy-peace-falls-on-ferguson-after-local-cops-called-off.html”> He walked through a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters and answered their questions.

“Thank you for coming out here,” one woman told Johnson as he sat in a police SUV late Thursday, taking questions from protesters.

As Thursday night’s unexpectedly civil interaction continued, a woman toweled sweat off Johnson’s head.

Johnson’s visit marked an evening in which this St. Louis suburb, which had, for since Sunday night, been a scene of wrenching violence and become a symbol of explosive rage at what residents, most of them black, saw as unrestrained police brutality following the shooting death of Brown, drew back from the brink.

The hectic but peaceful protesters Thursday night seemed determined to take advantage of what Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and President Barack Obama said earlier in separate press statements. Namely, that the people’s right to peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances, shall not be met with tear gas and rubber bullets.
 
“This is currently my community and my home,” Johnson had said at a press conference earlier in the day on Thursday, shortly after being named to take over security in the area. “We need to break the cycle of violence … and build trust.”

But it wasn’t trust and understanding residents wanted to talk about on Friday morning. Instead, they discussed the new details in dense clumps, some especially incensed by the fact that police included surveillance photos of Brown in the convenience store in a press packet handed out to members of the media.

“Where are the pictures that show the commission of the crime?” said a woman who only identified herself as Ms. Jourdan. “What is this showing to the public and to the media? Why didn’t that packet include the picture of him laying down in the street in his own blood?”

Perry Jackson scoffed at the idea Brown stole anything, and said the young man’s life was worth far more than the cheap cigars many have speculated were the item he may have taken.

A 45-year-old Ferguson resident, Jackson said he knows at least one thing that will happen in the coming weeks.

“You know they’re going to come out and say he had marijuana in his system,” Jackson said. “Just like they did with Trayvon Martin.”

Jackson had another prediction: protests will continue tonight.

“I’m sure what they’re going to do is, they’re going to get out here early and get out in front of this,” Jackson said of police. “But it’s definitely going to be crowded. Tonight’s the night.”

FERGUSON, Mo. — Missouri State Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson did what no cop has done for the past five days on Thursday night: He walked through a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters and answered their questions.

“Thank you for coming out here,” one woman told Johnson as he sat in a police SUV late Thursday, taking questions from protesters and hearing their demands that the name of the officer who killed unarmed teen Michael Brown be released.

CNN reported that, according to its unnamed sources, the name would be released on Friday.

As the unexpectedly civil interaction continued, a woman toweled sweat off Johnson's head.

Johnson’s visit marked an evening in which this St. Louis suburb, which had, for the last four nights, been a scene of wrenching violence and become a symbol of explosive rage at what residents, most of them black, saw as unrestrained police brutality following the shooting death of Brown, drew back from the brink.

By 9 p.m. the crowd stood at more than 1,000, with not a single police officer in sight. The hectic but peaceful protesters seemed determined to take advantage of what Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and President Barack Obama said earlier in separate press statements. Namely, that the people’s right to peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances, shall not be met with tear gas and rubber bullets.

“This is currently my community and my home,” Johnson had said at the governor’s earlier press conference, shortly after being named to take over security in the area. “We need to break the cycle of violence … and build trust.”

He tried to do just that on Thursday, making two appearances at the scene of protests. At the first, around 5 p.m., he walked with protesters armed only with his sidearm. Notably absent were the heavily armed and armored cops of the Ferguson Police Department, whose heavy-handed, military-style tactics had seemed to make the situation so much more volatile over the last few days.

“I understand the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling,” Johnson had said, “and our police officers will respect both of them.”

His second appearance was late Thursday, where he met civility with his own.

“You can stay as long as you like,” he told protesters.

Johnson’s calming rhetoric appeared to be working after Wednesday’s night of violent confrontation between police and a crowd of local residents.

 “Last night was outrageous,” Sharonda Kyles said of the Wednesday night protests that devolved into tear gas-enveloped anarchy after the sun went down. “I think the police just wanted [the protesters] to leave, so they did whatever they had to do to make that happen.”

In between Johnson’s two appearances, however, things were tense. After his first appearance, as 6 p.m. came and went, crowds gathered at the QuikTrip gas station that looters had destroyed on Sunday. Law enforcement made an appearance just after 7:30 p.m., in the form of two St. Louis Police Department squad cars, but boos came from the crowd. Police left and didn’t return until Johnson’s second visit.

“That was a mistake,” Major Ronnie Robinson of the St. Louis Police Department told The Daily Beast. Following that brief and hectic moment, though, Robinson was hopeful.

“There’s some leaders out here we can work with,” he said, adding that much work remains to heal a city in tumult following Brown’s death. “There’s some deep-rooted issues here that we as a community need to deal with.”

In all, the atmosphere on Thursday night was one of tense wariness and expectation. Everyone was waiting. The protesters who had taken over a burned-down gas station. The crowd of journalists that had swelled to its largest number. The country. The world.

Not everyone, though, is convinced the change in police leadership will result in peace. Brittany Ferrell held a sign in the parking lot of the torched QuikTrip gas station. It read: “The last time they brought dogs and guns to a peaceful rally? Selma, 1963.”

“I think it is a very shallow gesture,” she said of Johnson’s appointment, while her 6-year-old daughter, Mackenzie Davis, circled. Ferrell dropped her daughter off with relatives, but planned on returning at 7 p.m. “I don’t think you should go tonight because the police are acting up,” Davis told her mother.

Ferrell, who flew in from her home in New York earlier in the day, however, called this a historic moment.

“On our way here I had to tell my daughter what she was about to see, what it’s like to have to fight for justice and not be afraid,” she said.

There are many people who have yet to be held adequately responsible in Ferguson, Missouri. America is starving for information from the higher-ups that allowed and condoned police brutality in Ferguson, and simultaneously calling for Michael Brown’s killer to be tried and punished accordingly. But amid this cry for justice and accountability is a stranger, less logical expectation of vocal activism and admonishment from the most visible members of the hip-hop community.

This misguided notion that hip-hop heavyweights aren’t doing enough was particularly apparent in the mass disappointment leveled at St. Louis rapper Nelly in the wake of the incident. Now, Nelly is not famous for his political activism or preoccupation with African-American issues. Nelly is “famous” for songs like “Hot in Herre” and “Air Force Ones.” While Nelly has made his name promoting Apple Bottom Jeans, not social justice, the fact of his blackness combined with his former zip code was apparently enough to make Nelly’s absence from Ferguson social media activism both apparent and abhorrent.

Nelly's initial silence was condemned and it was also packaged as part of a larger trend of accusations, as websites {criticized}<hyperlink=”http://blackamericaweb.com/2014/08/14/twitter-drags-nelly-for-ill-timed-tweet-phaedra-parks-meets-mike-browns-family/2/”> “most of hip-hop” for responding “more to the Robin Williams death than Mike Brown’s.”

Of course, this call for hip-hop artists to speak out comes from a completely sincere and rational place. Hip-hop isn’t just a historically black genre; it’s a historically political one. Famous hip-hop activists from {Tupac}<hyperlink=”http://hazlitt.net/feature/we-been-running-all-our-mothafuckin-lives”> to Common have long stood up against systemic racism, cycles of poverty and violence, and police brutality. The hip-hop community’s allegedly inadequate response to the injustices taking place in Ferguson feels like a reverberation of accusations that the genre is wandering further and further away from its deeply political and radicalized roots.

It doesn’t take a hip-hop historian to realize that the message isn’t what it used to be. In 1989, Public Enemy told us to “fight the power” in an incendiary track that combined rap and black church service vocal stylings, peppered with civil rights allusions and revolutionary rhetoric. Today, the hottest hip-hop hook in America is from Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy,” and even overtly political tracks like Kanye West’s “New Slaves” inevitably descend into name-dropping, sexual objectification, and amped-up bravado. 

Combine hip-hop’s apparent descent into apolitical commercialism with the inexplicable tragedy of Michael Brown’s death, and it’s not difficult to fathom why some fans are so disappointed in their favorite artists. After all, celebrities have hurried to take part in recent viral memes like the ALS Ice Bucket challenge, and have shared their remembrances of Robin Williams across various social media platforms.

It’s easy to see why, for example, Kanye West’s tweet regarding Robin Williams’ death served to highlight a perceived silence surrounding Michael Brown’s demise. After all, West famously spoke out against the government’s treatment of predominately African-American Hurricane Katrina victims back in 2005, declaring that “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” on national television. This history of articulation, much like Nelly’s personal ties to the St. Louis area, could be interpreted as a reason why West ought to be weighing in as the assumed value of an African-American life in America is once again being examined and interrogated across the nation.

When a celebrity speaks out about an important issue, it increases visibility—this is a good thing. Nevertheless, the expectation that every African-American star or hip-hop hero must weigh in on Ferguson is a problematic one. Demanding that every beloved black celebrity respond to this issue would be like asking every white celebrity to take to social media whenever a white person, be they a criminal or a victim, makes the nightly news. The next time a mentally unstable white man opens fire on the public, you can be sure that the judgment of the world will fall firmly on that individual, not on Lena Dunham for failing to release a cogent and heartfelt press release.

Expecting every black celebrity with a hit single or an extensive Twitter following to address Ferguson implies that Michael Brown’s murder is a minority issue instead of a human rights one. Furthermore, demanding that any one person who is not directly implicated in the atrocity weigh in on it anyway distracts from the brave protesters, articulate journalists, and passionate public figures who are voluntarily taking on the responsibility of ensuring that Michael Brown’s prematurely silenced voice is heard.

We all ought to play our parts in holding cops and officials accountable while furthering the national debate; whether or not Rihanna chooses to publicly take a stand is entirely irrelevant. The notion of checking off a laundry list of visible black celebrities for social media responses and condemning those who have yet to speak out is not only counter-productive—it’s part of the problem. 

On top of the inherent weirdness of demanding that every rapper take a stand on Ferguson, there’s the added fact that this backlash is almost entirely baseless. Members of the hip-hop community have actually been incredibly vocal on the topic of Michael Brown. The {notorious Nelly}<hyperlink=”http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6221770/nelly-talks-ferguson-setting-up-a-scholarship-in-michael-browns-name-we-need”> himself led a “Hands up, don't shoot” chant at a charity event in Los Angeles over the weekend; he’s also spoken with Mike Brown’s family and is working with them to create a Mike Brown Scholarship Fund to help send kids to college—a dream that Brown himself was tragically close to realizing.

Meanwhile, {Frank Ocean}<hyperlink=”http://frankocean.tumblr.com/post/94800672736/you-see-that-black-woman-standing-up-there-i”> took to Tumblr to voice his reaction to the ongoing atrocities, commenting on a screenshot of a Missouri press conference: “You see that black woman standing up there?… I wonder if I’m supposed to think Missouri’s gov’t is pro-black because of her being stood up there with those other black men…I wonder if she was off the clock while she stood up there. If she was off the clock...then I wonder if she was getting paid for her time off like the guy who shot Michael 8 times. What’s that guy’s name by the way?”

In a similar vein, Rapper Killer Mike posted a {photo}<hyperlink=”https://www.instagram.com/p/rkrM8xS1Mk/?modal=true”> of Michael Brown’s grieving parents on his Instagram, accompanied by a powerful essay in which he explained, “These two people are parents. They are humans that produced a child and loved that child and that child was slaughtered like Game and left face down as public spectacle while his blood drained down the street.” On Friday J. Cole released {“Be Free}<hyperlink=”https://soundcloud.com/dreamvillerecords/j-cole-be-free”>,” an ode to Brown that ends with the harrowing voice of eyewitness Dorian Johnson insisting “He turned around, put his hands in the air...He started to get down but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired several more shots, and my friend died.”

Talib Kweli, Juicy J, Erykah Badu, Common, and Young Jeezy have all taken to Twitter to voice their disgust with the crime and stand in solidarity; Jeezy and J. Cole are among the handful of celebrities who have visited Ferguson amid protests and riots.

Meanwhile, John Legend has taken up the mantle of most visible R&B activist, retweeting and authoring various opinions and insights. In a series of tweets last Thursday, Legend said, “I believe these cops are intentionally trying to inflame the situation. They want an excuse. Recall the local cop telling those ‘animals’ to ‘bring it’ on CNN…He wants a fight. Calling us ‘animals’ has been the language to justify slavery, Jim Crow and all manner of injustice. Dehumanization and racism go together.”

While the hip-hop community clearly has not been silent, it’s interesting to note that arguably the most vocal celebrity to emerge in the Ferguson debate isn’t a political rapper or activist artist but a Grey’s Anatomy heartthrob. Jesse Williams has been holding court on Tumblr and Twitter this past week, covering every aspect of Ferguson, from the initial incident to ongoing riots. Williams tweeted at CNN to “stop replaying completely irrelevant video: You are providing false context & running a marketing campaign for a murderer,” and he didn’t stop at that—he {appeared on CNN} to condemn the role that false media narratives play in the oppression of African Americans.

When we stop pointing fingers and assigning responsibility, it quickly becomes apparent that celebrity activism, with all its advantages and pitfalls, is alive and well in Ferguson, Missouri. Now it’s time to question the efficacy of this social media surge, and investigate whether this viral visibility can affect real life reform.

Victims of careless ‘dox’ attempts say the consequences are miserable.

Although the Web carries with it great collaborative potential, mistakes can be made in the heat of a crisis, especially when research is being led by amateurs. It is even worse when online actors “dox”—or publicly release the private information of—the incorrect person. As online social communities grow, bands of well-meaning users are increasingly trying to play detective to enforce a type of street justice—and about as often, they get it wrong.

The consequences can be miserable, as those affected tell The Daily Beast in interviews.

The misidentified Ferguson shooter

This week the nebulous hacker collective Anonymous released the name of a man they believed to be the shooter of Michael Brown, the teen killed in Ferguson, Missouri, last Saturday. They were flat out wrong. Not only did Anonymous issue the incorrect name, posting the information of a man who had never been a St. Louis police officer, but the vigilante hackers also acquired a false address. They posted the address of the man’s 48-year-old stepmother, Stephanie Warnack.

“Wow, this is not good,” she said, when informed by a {national reporter.}<hyperlink=” http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/08/14/twitter-anonymous-hacker-ferguson/14061923/”> She began to weep. “Now I have to defend myself and I didn’t do anything wrong.”

A harried-sounding woman answered the phone at a publicly listed number for Warnack on Friday. The phone had been ringing off the hook all morning, the woman told The Daily Beast, refusing to identify herself.

“Don’t call back again,” she warned.

{Twitter messages}<hyperlink=” https://twitter.com/Crypt0nymous/status/499935092496941056”> show there was some internal dissension among Anonymous hackers as to whether they had the correct name. Despite misgivings, some decided to release it anyway—with unfortunate results for those wrongly fingered as responsible for a police shooting that has led to widespread protests in the Missouri suburb.

The wrong Boston Marathon bombing suspect

In April 2013, Reddit users {began to speculate}<hyperlink=” http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/04/sunil-tripathi-sister-sangeeta-media-labelling-her-brother-bombing-suspect”> that one of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects looked like missing Brown University student Sunil Tripathi.

Online commenters remarked that the student bore a similarity to one of the suspects pictured in a picture released by the FBI. Their suspicions were solidified by a user who supposedly went to school with Sunil and wrote that she recognized him in the FBI photos.

So as they continued the search for their son and brother, the Tripathi family had to deal with a second, overwhelming ordeal: the flood of accusations and insults that comes with being associated with a violent, criminal act.

“We were already in a very tense and anxious state, having looked for Sunil for 32 days or so,” Judy Tripathi, Sunil’s mother, told The Daily Beast. “The whole night the phone was ringing off the hook with news reporters and nasty messages. It was devastating because we knew it wasn’t him, and we were so worried… It just seemed to be an epidemic.”

Of course, Tripathi had nothing to do with the bombing. His body was found after the Tsarnaev brothers were fingered as suspects in the bombings. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed during a shootout with police in a Boston suburb, and younger brother Dzhokhar is facing charges for his involvement in the attacks.

But before Sunil’s body was found, his mother was most concerned that the online speculation might cause someone to recognize him on the street.

“The thought of this misidentification and what anyone would do if they saw him, or what Sunil would feel if he got wind of this news, was beyond my imagination,” she explained. “It was just another horrible thing on top of everything else… it’s very unsettling, because it can happen again [to others].”

The general manager of Reddit later {apologized}<hyperlink=” http://www.redditblog.com/2013/04/reflections-on-recent-boston-crisis.html”> for the community’s inaccurate sleuthing, which “fueled online witch hunts and dangerous speculation.”

The impact of the error will stay with Sunil’s family for all time.

“When you Google his name, forever, it just pops up a million sources that are connected to the Boston bombing. When you’re trying to memorialize your 22-year-old, that’s very horrible. It’s had a very devastating long-term impact,” Judy Tripathi said. 

After Newtown: Adam Lanza, not Ryan Lanza

In December 2012, Adam Lanza shot more than two dozen people in what has come to be known as the Sandy Hook massacre. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, his brother Ryan was forced to defend himself online as commenters flooded onto his Facebook page. Ryan’s identification was found at the scene of crime.

“Everyone shut the f*** up it wasn’t me,” he {wrote on his page}<hyperlink=” http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2248327/Ryan-Lanza-Moment-brother-Adam-Lanza-saw-CNN-mistakenly-report-Sandy-Hook-shooter.html#ixzz3AUYKCZCg”>. “I’m on the bus home now it wasn’t me. IT WASN’T ME I WAS AT WORK IT WASN’T ME.”

So the elder brother, whose family member had just shot and killed his mother, along with 20 children at an elementary school, had to deal not only with the trauma of that nightmare, but also with defending his own reputation.

DailyBeast,beast18,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/after-a-night-of-relative-calm-have-the-ferguson-police-made-things-worse-again.html,"After a Night of Relative Calm, Have the Ferguson Police Made Things Worse Again?",Justin Glawe,8/15/2014,1/18/2016,"Ferguson, Mo., has returned to a state of wary unease after local cops both name the officer who shot Michael Brown to death and say Brown was a criminal.

FERGUSON, Mo. — After nearly a week of unrest, the anger local police hoped would abate with the release of the name of police officer who shot 18-year-old Michael Brown to death on Sunday remained.

Ferguson police officials on Friday released the name of the officer—Darren Wilson—who allegedly shot Brown to death in a disputed altercation, which has sparked almost a week’s worth of riots and disturbance in this St. Louis suburb and laid bare fault lines of race, police power and the worth of the lives of young black men in the United States.

But it was a matter of one step forward and two steps back. After the police released Wilson’s name, they also released photos they said showed Brown had robbed a nearby convenience store of a pack of cigars before Wilson stopped and ultimately killed him.

This post-mortum attempt to paint Brown as a suspect angered the mostly black community of Ferguson. It was further exacerbated when Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson knew nothing of the alleged robbery.

That puts the community and police back at square one, with the original story of Brown being stopped for jaywalking returning to the center of the controversy. That could result in an increased amount of anger on the part of protesters who, as they have for the last six days, gathered Friday night in front of the QuikTrip gas station destroyed in Sunday night’s looting to voice their dissent.

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Patrol, tapped by Gov. Jay Nixon to take over security operations, said the plan for Friday was the same as Thursday: let the protesters do their thing.

“We’re going to have a good time tonight,” Johnson told CNN’s Don Lemon. The crowd around the pair cheered at Johnson’s statement.

Also on Friday, Jay Kanzler, an attorney for the family that owns Ferguson Market and Liquor, the site of Brown’s alleged robbery, confirmed that theirs was the convenience store where police say Brown committed the robbery. The St. Louis County Police Department, the same organization relieved of its duties by Nixon after a national uproar following clashes with protesters Wednesday night, collected surveillance footage from the store Friday afternoon. The move was officially an execution of a search warrant filed Friday. The store will remain closed, an employee there said. More than a dozen police cars were in the parking lot as the crowd grew into the hundreds by 6 p.m.

Dennis Banks, a Chicago comedian who works under the pseudonym Felonious Munk and who had come to take part in the protests, said the release of surveillance photos depicting a man police said was Brown accosting a store employee during the alleged robbery was unnecessary and did more harm than good.

“Is this something they’re doing pre-trial to taint a jury?” Banks speculated. “While that might work on a jury, it’s not working for the people out here. From last night’s almost festive mood it has shifted to a lot of angst and a lot of anger.”

Earlier in the day, a small group of protesters chanted “No justice, no peace” in the parking lot of the QuikTrip gas station.

“It couldn’t be armed robbery because he didn’t have no gun. Where’s the weapon?” said James Sias. “We going to have to wait for the Justice Department now.”

Rumors have been circulating all week that Brown had stolen a pack of cigars from a convenience store not far from the Canfield Green Apartments where he lived. Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson, has repeatedly said the pair were stopped for jaywalking. The only thing that both sides agree on is that an altercation ensued, and Brown was shot multiple times. The number of bullet wounds is a matter of contention here. On the streets of Ferguson residents say Brown was shot as many as 10 times.

Still, Johnson had calmed things as of Thursday night. The hectic but peaceful protesters then seemed determined to take advantage of what Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and President Barack Obama said earlier in separate press statements. Namely, that the people’s right to peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances, shall not be met with tear gas and rubber bullets.

“This is currently my community and my home,” Johnson said at a press conference earlier in the day on Thursday, shortly after being named to take over security in the area. “We need to break the cycle of violence … and build trust.”

But it wasn’t trust and understanding residents wanted to talk about on Friday morning. Instead, they discussed the new details in dense clumps, some especially incensed by the surveillance photos of Brown in the convenience store in a press packet handed out to members of the media.

“Where are the pictures that show the commission of the crime?” said a woman who only identified herself as Ms. Jourdan. “What is this showing to the public and to the media? Why didn’t that packet include the picture of him laying down in the street in his own blood?”

Perry Jackson scoffed at the idea Brown stole anything, and said the young man’s life was worth far more than the cheap cigars many have speculated were the item he may have taken.

A 45-year-old Ferguson resident, Jackson said he knows at least one thing that will happen in the coming weeks.

“You know they’re going to come out and say he had marijuana in his system,” Jackson said. “Just like they did with Trayvon Martin.”

Jackson had another prediction: protests will continue tonight.

“I’m sure what they’re going to do is, they’re going to get out here early and get out in front of this,” Jackson said of police. “But it’s definitely going to be crowded. Tonight’s the night.”

Who knew that the police actions in a suburb of St. Louis of 15,000 people would suddenly reveal many of the deep fissures that have bedeviled America for a long time? 

Front and center, of course, is the issue of race, a constant in America since it decided to break away from the British Empire and to stand on its own 238 years ago. There is the tension over the militarization of local police, which has performed the amazing hat trick of uniting liberals, conservatives, and libertarians behind the notion that America has lost its damn mind. And finally, there is the trampling of the First Amendment when cops find that it is judicious and no one will care as long as the folks they are attacking are seen as worthless lawbreakers. 

It’s cute to think of the United States as a nation that has its stuff together and doesn’t have to contend with the kind of fighting in Israel and the Gaza Strip or the battles being waged in Iraq. No, Americans aren’t setting up IEDs and car bombs, or kidnapping hundreds of girls. But we are a nation at war with itself, and it plays out again and again when a Ferguson or a Bundy Ranch becomes a staple on cable news. 

Race. Enough with that post-racial crap. That was a media-driven line that never was real and was stupid in the first place. We have been long taught that the issue of race and slavery came to a boil when Abraham Lincoln was elected president, but Gerald Horne argues in {The Counter-Revolution of 1776: Slave Resistance and the Origins of the United States of America,}<hyperlink=” http://www.amazon.com/The-Counter-Revolution-1776-Resistance-Origins/dp/1479893404”> that the question of slavery was a driving force behind the Revolutionary War. Horne argues that with the abolition of slavery coming to fruition in England and among other British colonial holdings, the American colonies wanted to maintain the lucrative slave trade and thus chose to go to war in order to do so. 

Ever since, America has grappled with its race problem, so it’s not shock that Ferguson, Mo., a once all-white enclave, would all of a sudden be still dealing with race now that the city is two-thirds Black. 

Yes, Michael Brown was an 18-year-old black teenager shot and killed by a white Ferguson police officer. But the animosity between the community and law enforcement is nothing new. 

The family of Eric Garner is still trying to ascertain why a NYPD police officer used a banned chokehold to take him down, leading to his death. 

In Los Angeles this week, Ezell Ford was {gunned down,}<hyperlink=” http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-community-members-march-ezell-ford-20140814-story.html”> and he, like Brown, was unarmed. 

This feeling of anger and dissension between the police and African Americans is nothing new, and it’s not going to get better any time soon. 

Even Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who has made outreach to African Americans a cornerstone of his efforts the last several months, sees the connection. 

“Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention,” Paul {wrote}<hyperlink=” http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”> in an essay for Time: “Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.” 

But there are always silver linings. When Missouri’s Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon got lots of pressure to do something about the menacing Ferguson police, he replaced them with Missouri State Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson. He brought a deft touch in handling a powder keg, and overnight, reduced the boiling temperatures that was close to putting Ferguson on the path to a fiery explosion. 

Johnson, who grew up in the area, is African American. He knows what the protesters were thinking and feeling. But maybe if Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson didn’t have 50 out of 53 of his police officers being white, relations there might be a helluva lot better. 

Cops playing soldiers. Watching the Ferguson police with their armored vehicles and dressed like they were about to take down Al-Qaeda in Kabul shocked many people. But for a good portion of the nation, it was not stunning to see what has been described as the militarization of our police forces.  

The Department of Defense has used the nation’s surplus military equipment to outfit local agencies with the latest military hardware. So instead of the police mantra to “protect and serve,” it has evolved into something akin to “take down and destroy.”  

Whether it was the War on Drugs or the Patriot Act as the main culprit, the situation has gotten out of hand. When the media show the hyper actions of these wannabe soldiers, public perception changes. And with people from different ideologies realizing that something must be done, we might finally see Congress take substantive action. 

It’s First for a reason. When did Ferguson reach the tipping point that angered American officials so much they said new leadership was needed on the ground? The tear gassing of protesters assembled in the street and the arrest of journalists Wesley Lowery and Ryan Reilly. 

If there is one precious commodity for America, it is our touting of the First Amendment. Yet what we have seen in other cities played itself out in Ferguson: when facing bad news, authorities stop folks from protesting and shut out the media. 

A crew from Al Jazeera-America said they were targeted with tear gas, and we saw police dismantling their cameras and lights. Other journalists reported being accosted by police.

Bottom line: The First Amendment is there for our protection, and it deserves to be utilized by all. 

“The law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them,” Attorney General Eric Holder said in a written statement. “Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.” 

The anger in Ferguson only proves to all of us that as a nation, we have a lot of work to do to overcome our mistrust, our anger, our resentment and our fears. Only by confronting them can we change. Otherwise, we might as well prepare for another Ferguson, then another, and then another.

How this leads to dysfunction, racial tension, and a skewed justice system.

As we watch Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson {bumble his way through press conferences,}<hyperlink=” http://fox2now.com/2014/08/15/live-updates-ferguson-police-chief-tom-jackson-speaks-at-a-press-conference/”> let’s take a couple steps back and think about how this two-thirds African-American town has retained such a nearly complete all-white power structure. It is partly, as Slate {noted,}<hyperlink=” http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/08/14/ferguson_missouri_government_why_is_it_so_white.html”> a question of voting power, as whites are more entrenched and vote in greater numbers. But there’s a larger story here about race in America that involves the transformation of inner-ring suburbs over the last 30 years, and the response to that transformation, which have combined to create tensions that often rage in the suburban areas that surround our major cities. These tensions are almost wholly about race. Even more specifically, they are often about criminal justice, in ways that we may see play out in St. Louis County when the day arrives that Officer Darren Wilson goes on trial.

This story begins with white flight, which is well known—as blacks moved up to cities in the North from farms in the South at an astonishing rate in the 1950s and ’60s, they moved into inner-city neighborhoods, and the whites moved out. But then, in the 1980s, blacks, along with Hispanics and Asians, started moving out into the ’burbs, too. Affirmative action and public-sector unionization (say what you will about them!) lifted millions of African Americas into the middle class, and they could now afford a car and a garage to put it in.

The good news here: America became a little less segregated. {This study}<hyperlink=” http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Data/Report/report2.pdf”> by Brown University finds that segregation peaked between 1960 and 1970 and has fallen off, steadily but only gradually, ever since. The “typical white” today lives in a neighborhood that is 75 percent white (that figure was 88 percent 30 years ago). The “typical black” lives in a neighborhood that’s 45 percent black, 35 percent white, 15 percent Hispanic, and 4 percent Asian. But segregation scores in many big cities remain high. On a scale where any score above 60 is considered to indicate deep segregation, Detroit and Milwaukee are tied for worst, at 79.6 percent; then comes New York, Newark, Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami, Cleveland, and, in ninth position, at 70.6 percent, we find St. Louis.

So even as black people pushed their way out into the suburbs, they typically haven’t done so in large enough numbers to gain real political power. This means that while the political power in many cities is in black hands today, whites still tend to run things in the counties within which those cities rest. Thus, one sub-story of the last 20 or so years in America has been a quiet but constant power struggle between municipal and county governments over who has what authority.

Now, St. Louis County and St. Louis the city are a little different from the norm in this regard, since they split into two jurisdictions back in the 1870s, long before anyone was thinking about black political power. In fact, back then it was the city people voting to cut off having to pay for services for the county rubes (the city’s population then was almost exactly what it is today, 318,000; St. Louis County, about 25,000 then, is around 1 million today). Today, I’m sure the city would love to have that tax base.

So St. Louis is different in jurisdictional terms, but on a more emotional level, the same kinds of dramas play out that we see in other American cities that sit within larger counties. These counties have inner-ring and outer-ring suburbs, still further out exurbs, and even a few patches of farmland. Go look at a {map of Fulton County, Georgia,}<hyperlink=” https://www.maptechnica.com/us-county-boundary-map/county/Fulton/state/GA/countyid/13121”> which contains Atlanta, and see how large it is. The population of Atlanta is about 443,000. The population of Fulton County as a whole is 977,000, meaning that more than half the people live outside Atlanta proper. The same is true in Wayne County, Michigan, where about 700,000 live in Detroit but 1.1 million outside of it; in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, where 390,000 live in Cleveland and 875,000 outside of it; and dramatically so in Miami-Dade County, where 2.2 million live outside Miami and just 410,000 in it. Not every major American city is like this, but it’s fair to say that most are in similar situations.

This creates a fierce political competition between city and county governments and within county governments. Cities dominated their counties for decades, but no longer. The cold war—it’s hard to call it anything less—between north Fulton County (white) and south Fulton County (black) is legendary. The MARTA rail system, which started running 35 years ago and was from the very earliest planning phases, 10 years before that, designed to run up to north Fulton County and out into Cobb and Gwinnett and other regional counties, is only now just starting to inch its way up to north Fulton. People can make whatever excuses they want, but this two-generation delay has been {almost entirely about race.}<hyperlink=” http://thethirdrail.virginiapolicyreview.com/2014/02/12/marta-offers-equality-a-seat-on-the-bus/”>

Now let’s get to the matter at hand in Ferguson: criminal justice. The specific issue is that juries in the United States are drawn from county-wide population pools. This means, as the criminologist William Stuntz has observed, that people from large counties with exurbs and farms are often sitting in judgment of urban kids. Stuntz was a conservative, but an apostate who came to believe that the American criminal justice system was pretty much hopelessly racist. In his last book before his death, {The Collapse of the American Justice System,}<hyperlink=” http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-American-Criminal-Justice/dp/0674051750”> he noted that “counties that include major cities have a much higher percentage of suburban voters than in the past” and observed that this meant that black kids on trial were far less likely to get a jury that had any understanding of what their lives were like.

So let’s flip that in this case. Will a St. Louis County jury be likely to look sympathetically upon Michael Brown? Quite unlike the two-thirds black Ferguson, the county is 70 percent white. I’ll cast no aspersions on either Officer Wilson, innocent until proven otherwise, or the fine people of St. Louis County. I’ll just say that if William Stuntz were still alive, I have a sense of which outcome he’d be predicting.

DailyBeast,beast21,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/14/rand-paul-blame-big-government-for-ferguson.html,Rand Paul: Blame Big Government For Ferguson,Olivia Nuzzi,8/14/2014,1/25/2016,"The libertarian-leaning Kentucky senator said African-Americans feel “targeted” by militarized police responses, like the one in Ferguson, Missouri, over the death of teen Michael Brown.

Writing for TIME, Rand Paul—who is expected to mount a campaign for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016—{addressed}<hyperlink=” http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”> the crisis that has erupted in {Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=<” http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-chaos-is-only-just-beginning.html”>, in the wake of the shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown. Paul writes that due to the convergence of the “militarization of law enforcement” and the “erosion of civil liberties,” Americans, and particularly African-Americans—feel as though they are being “targeted” by the government.

“If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But I wouldn’t have expected to be shot,” he writes. “Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.”

Paul warns against a police state, noting that there “should be a difference between a police response and a military response,” and expressing concern that “the images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.”

Unsurprisingly, given his self-described “Libertarian-ish” limited-government leanings, Paul blames big government for the rise of militarized law enforcement.

As Slate’s David Weigel {notes}<hyperlink=<” http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/08/14/rand_paul_it_is_impossible_for_african_americans_not_to_feel_like_their.html”>, Paul uses the writings of three libertarian-leaning figures—Glenn Reynolds of Instapundit, Walter Olson of the Cato Institute, and Evan Bernick of the Heritage Foundation—to help make his case that “big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.”

Paul, who has reached out to black voters in speeches and through policy—he is currently working to overhaul the criminal justice system with Sen. Cory Booker, the New Jersey Democrat—took a much harder stance on Ferguson’s police response than fellow would-be 2016 contender Ted Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, who only went as far as to concede that “reporters should never be detained” and “civil liberties should be protected.”

But Paul was not alone in his bold response. Justin Amash, the libertarian-leaning congressman from Michigan, tweeted:

And then, fittingly, Amash retweeted Paul:

Just one thing: His supporters would prefer to remain anonymous.

A {support page}<hyperlink=” https://www.gofundme.com/SupportOfficerWilson”> for Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson, the man who {shot and killed}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2014/08/15/ferguson-policeman-s-name-revealed.html”> 18-year-old Michael Brown, has brought in more than $27,000 in the last day.

“We stand behind Officer Darren Wilson and his family during this trying time in their lives,” the GoFundMe page’s creators write. “All proceeds will be sent directly to Darren Wilson and his family for any financial needs they may have including legal fees.”

The page was {launched two hours before news broke that the first autopsy}<hyperlink=” http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html”> on Brown’s body showed the unarmed teenager had been shot at least six times, including two shots to the head.

Reached for comment, the administrator of the fundraising campaign, identified as Allison Wilson, asked The Daily Beast for privacy.

“We are not interested in speaking with the press at this time,” Wilson said. “Please do not attempt to contact myself or any member of my family. Thank you for your understanding.”

Wilson would not comment on whether she was related to Officer Wilson, and her Facebook page has since been disabled. As for why she publicized her email address on the fundraising page, Wilson said, “The email is for questions regarding how to donate or where donations can be mailed to.”

Her reticence is not uncommon among online supporters of Officer Wilson. A number of administrators of support pages for the officer on Facebook declined to speak with The Daily Beast, citing a fear of being a target of potential violence. Those who did shared their beliefs on the condition of anonymity.

“I don’t think an officer of his reputation would shoot an unarmed person for no reason whatsoever,” said one administrator in Ferguson who suggested The Daily Beast identify him as “Bossman.” His {page}<hyperlink=” https://www.facebook.com/I-support-Ferguson-Police-Officer-Darren-Wilson-827935940558777/”>, called “I support Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson,” has a great deal fewer likes than some of the better-publicized Facebook pages.

“People have the misconception that a police officer cannot shoot an unarmed person, but that’s simply not the case,” he said. “Especially if someone is trying to go for an officer’s weapon. Whether or not that actually happened is unknown, but I do believe he was acting in self-defense as officers are trained to do.”

The common theme among administrators of support pages for the officer is the notion that the shooting of Michael Brown was not racially motivated.

“I don’t think it was to begin with, but the black community has turned it into that as a crutch when there’s a lack of defense on their end,” the man who wanted to be called Bossman explained. “I don’t think people will bow down to it this time. Al and Jesse would never come out from cowardly hiding if it were a black cop and white offender.”

An administrator for the {closed 164-member group}<hyperlink=” https://www.facebook.com/groups/599915720125823/?ref=br_tf”> “We Support Darren Wilson” also suggested that the August 9 shooting initially had nothing to do with race.

“This has been made into a race issue,” she said in an email exchange with The Daily Beast. “It’s not a race issue. It’s a self-defense issue. I think there are influences making this worse instead of calming the situation.

“The riots are in my opinion are out of control. There can be peaceful protests. There is no reason for all this brutality. A town burning and people disregarding curfew and disrespecting the police and residents is incomprehensible.”

The perception that race is not a major issue in Ferguson appears to be common—at least among whites.

Just 37 percent of the white people surveyed in a {Pew Research Center poll}<hyperlink=” http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/”> released Monday believed that the shooting of Brown raised “important issues about race.” Among African Americans surveyed, that number was 80 percent. Similarly, 33 percent of white people surveyed believed that the police had “gone too far,” while 65 percent of African Americans believed that to be true.

In Ferguson, Joel Anderson of BuzzFeed {reports}<hyperlink=” http://www.buzzfeed.com/joelanderson/is-race-an-issue-in-ferguson-depends-on-who-you-ask#.apVNLWEbgZ”>, some white citizens are claiming the same thing: that Brown’s shooting was not predicated on race.

Still, one of Officer Wilson’s defenders said it might be too early to start raising money for him.

“As far as the GoFundMe, I think it was premature, meaning all the evidence and facts have not come to light,” the female administrator said. “If he is innocent, he will definitely need the help, but there is always a chance new facts may come to light.”

She said she believes Wilson acted in self-defense, but if she were convinced otherwise, she would close down her support group.
The other Facebook administrator echoed that sentiment.

“If it is true that [Michael Brown] had his hands up and was not posing a threat to the officer, then I will have to side with him,” he said.

At this stage, {according to a forensic pathologist}<hyperlink=” http://www.kmbc.com/news/lawyer-autopsy-shows-michael-brown-repeatedly-shot/27584030#!bFPjq7”> who assisted with the initial private autopsy, it is unclear whether Brown was shot with his hands in the air.

Two more autopsies will be conducted on Brown’s body in the coming days, one by local officials and the other by the Justice Department. And on Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder {will visit}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2014/08/18/eric-holder-heading-to-ferguson.html”> Ferguson himself.

FERGUSON, Mo. — Missouri Governor Jay Nixon called in the National Guard in the early hours of Monday morning after another night of protest descended into chaos with reports of gunfire, looting and Molotov cocktails. The latest clashes came as word began to spread through this St. Louis suburb that Brown was shot {as many as six times, including twice in the head}<hyperlink=” http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html”>.

Nixon said the National Guard was necessary ""in restoring peace and order"" to a suburb that has shaken with violence for more than a week. Considering, though, that police here have armed themselves with equipment more reminiscent of the military than small town cops, the National Guard may not be a huge change. Whether protesters will dare to hurl rocks and Molotov cocktails, at the Guards as they did on Sunday night according to the police, remains to be seen.

Many of the young men {who have taken to West Florissant Avenue to express their distrust and disdain of law enforcement}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/17/street-battle-against-cops-again-in-ferguson-despite-midnight-curfew.html”> had not yet heard the autopsy reports. Their rage will only intensified as the details are shared but when they return to the streets later today they will have a new, more formidable, adversary.

When The New York Times’ story on Brown’s autopsy dropped after 9 p.m., West Florissant Avenue was smoldering with anger caused by the teen’s death, and was once again joined by tears that came from round after round of tear gas fired by police. Law enforcement did issue warnings before firing Sunday night, which were for the most part ignored as they have been all week. There is a sense here that this is a last stand for a mostly black community that feels marginalized and brutalized by a mostly white police force. Simply put: Many here feel this is their ground. And they are not simply going to stand by and watch it be overrun by representatives of an organization responsible for what is considered here to have been a brutal and brazen daylight murder. For the past week and for the foreseeable future, Brown has become a legend.

“This is my motherfucking hood!” a man screamed as other residents attended to a woman who had injured her foot running from swirling tear gas smoke.

Residents and protesters have learned to prepare. As they walked toward the QuikTime gas station, burned beyond repair in last Sunday’s looting, they pulled bandanas over their faces and slipped on goggles to protect their eyes. There are constant questions: “Are you guys OK?” “Everyone over here all right?” “What happened?” There are innumerable statements and wishes: “Fuck the police!” “No justice, no peace!” And as goodbyes are shared, “Be safe.”

For many of the black residents of Ferguson, this is a police state in a city that already had a contentious relationship with law enforcement. Now, the real military is coming.

That decision may lift pressure from the shoulders of Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who has {led security efforts since being called in after police and protesters clashed Wednesday}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-on-edge-again-as-night-falls.html”>, drawing much of the national attention and media that have taken over what is, in relation to the larger metropolitan area, an {absolutely minuscule portion of land}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/12/michael-brown-s-hometown-is-under-occupation.html”>.

Johnson has been a relatively popular figure here, joining protesters in marches and walking up and down Florissant in an attempt to curry favor and support. A native of the area, Johnson has tried desperately to calm tensions here both in person and during media appearances. Prior to his arrival, there were virtually no efforts made to reach out to citizens and protesters. But when night falls, Johnson resumes his role as general of a force that continues to include officers from the St. Louis County and Ferguson police departments. If the captain could speak as honestly and forcefully as he did today at a church rally for Brown, the protesters might be less keen to riot.

“My heart goes out to you and I say I’m sorry,” he told the assembly at the Greater Grace Church. “I wear this uniform and I should stand up here and say I’m sorry.”

No such admission has not come from Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson police chief. He apparently defied the wishes of the Justice Department when he released surveillance footage that allegedly showed Brown robbing cigars from a gas station hours before he was shot. Jackson later admitted the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson, didn't know Brown was a robbery suspect when their altercation began.

Sunday night went much the same as Wednesday. When the police made their first major attempt to clear Florissant, many vehicles remained in the area, causing a chaotic traffic jam as an officer demanded over a bullhorn “Disperse now or you will face arrest or other actions.” Those in vehicles didn’t really have anywhere to go, but thanks to residents who directed traffic were able to clear the area fairly quickly. After that it was only those on foot who remained, daring police to come further. They did. Bit by bit. Sending protesters and residents racing northward while tear gas canisters chased not far behind.

The fleeing crowds included journalists documenting the situation. While the relationship between the two groups has been tense at times, that wasn’t the case on Sunday night. “Don’t let that shit run you off,” a resident said to a photographer as tear gas was fired in.

After a week of men, women and children staring down officers in battle gear, some of the protesters have started to speak in a martial tone. “This isn’t a defeat,” said one man near the QuikTrip gas station. “This is a tactical retreat.”

Later on Monday, it appears, the real military operation will begin.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Everyone is waiting. The protesters who have taken over a burned-down gas station. The crowd of journalists that has swelled to its largest number. The police who at 5 p.m. were nowhere to be seen. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson. The country. The world.

For the fifth night since the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, this St. Louis suburb is preparing for what could be a long night. Many are hoping the events of Wednesday night, when enormous plumes of tear-gas smoke enveloped protesters and chaos reigned, won’t be repeated.

Just after 5:30, hundreds of marchers walked south on West Florissant Avenue, the boulevard that has become a battleground since Brown’s death Saturday night. An indication of a change in tactics, and a possible preview of a peaceful night between police and protesters, the march was led by Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Gov. Nixon tapped Johnson, a black police captain who grew up in Ferguson, to take over security near the main protest zone. Johnson is the first cop not wearing riot gear and carrying an assault rifle to walk down Florissant in the past few days.

“We’re just going along with the new plan and hope it works,” said Capt. Norm Campbell of the St. Louis County Police Department, himself strolling down Florissant armed only with his holstered sidearm.

Not everyone, though, is convinced the change in police leadership will result in peace. Brittany Ferrell held a sign in the parking lot of the torched QuickTime gas station. It read: “The last time they brought dogs and guns to a peaceful rally? Selma, 1963.”

“I think it is a very shallow gesture,” she said of Johnson’s appointment, while her 6-year-old daughter, Mackenzie Davis, circled. Ferrell dropped her daughter off with relatives, but planned on returning at 7 p.m. “I don’t think you should go tonight because the police are acting up,” Davis told her mother.

One of the biggest crowds of the past five days had gathered by 6 p.m. Johnson stood in the middle of the street with other officers.

Ferrell, who flew in from her home in New York earlier in the day, called this a historic moment.

“On our way here I had to tell my daughter what she was about to see, what it’s like to have to fight for justice and not be afraid,” she said.
With dusk approaching, the massive crowd marched north on Florissant. Peace held. For now.",NA,NA,NA,NA

On Wednesday night, protests over the death of an unarmed teen devolved into chaos as the police force in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, fired rubber bullets and tear gas at {protesters and journalists}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/13/go-ahead-and-shoot-me-the-veteran-who-defied-ferguson-s-cops.html”> alike. The death of 18-year-old Mike Brown on Saturday triggered outrage in the town and beyond, where many suspect the recent high school grad’s death was racially motivated.

Details of the scene trickling in over social media painted a harrowing picture of a police force—armed in full combat gear with tanks in tow—unwilling to let reporters do their jobs. Al Jazeera journalists that attempted to set up a livestream of Wednesday night’s events had tear gas fired at them, followed by police dismantling their equipment. Reporters Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of The Huffington Post were taken into police custody and then, they say, released without explanation. Antonio French, a citizen journalist and alderman of the 21st ward in St. Louis, was also detained.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed a no-fly zone over the town because “we have multiple helicopters maneuvering in the area and we were having some problems with news aircrafts flying around there,” according to {one dispatcher}<hyperlink=”http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/12/3470567/why-theres-a-no-fly-zone-over-ferguson-missouri/”>.

As {some Iraq war veterans have noted}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-s-cops-are-armed-like-i-was-in-iraq.html”>, “in terms of its equipment, organization, and deployment methods, the Ferguson force looks more like an infantry or military police company in Iraq.”

In a news conference on Thursday, Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson defended the tactics used to control the crowds on Wednesday, saying that “gunfire” and “fire bombs” came from the protesters, prompting police responses “based on the threat of violence.” He did add that “we need to have everybody tone it down” and that authorities are “meeting to evaluate tactics.” 

Citizens of Ferguson and its surrounding cities reacted to news of the violence over social media, including {secret-sharing app Whisper}<hyperlink=”https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whisper-share-express-meet/id506141837?mt=8”>, anonymously venting their fears, frustrations, and even embarrassment at the events taking place.

DailyBeast,beast28,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/19/can-the-national-guard-really-help-calm-an-already-militarized-ferguson.html,Can the National Guard Really Help Calm an Already Militarized Ferguson?,Jacob Siegel,8/19/2014,1/27/2016,"Troops arrived Monday in a ‘limited mission’ to ‘provide protection.’ But will adding the real military defuse a situation many say has been inflamed by aggressive police?

Amid ongoing protests and violence in Ferguson, Missouri, Gov. Jay Nixon {ordered the National Guard}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/18/chaos-forces-missouri-governor-to-call-in-the-national-guard.html”> into the area after lifting a curfew in a bid to restore “peace and order.” But even advocates of using the National Guard like retired Gen. Russel Honoré, who commanded military forces during Hurricane Katrina, say an overly aggressive police response has contributed to the escalation of violence in the area.

The National Guard, whose troops arrived Monday in the suburb of St. Louis, was created to serve under both state and federal authority. (Disclosure: The author is an officer in the New York Army National Guard.) Acting under federal orders, soldiers are prohibited from policing U.S. citizens, but that’s not the case in Ferguson, where the Guard is acting under state orders and can operate in a law enforcement capacity.

For the moment, the Guard’s role seems designed to limit interaction between law enforcement and civilians in Ferguson.

Nixon {said in a statement}<hyperlink=” http://www.moguard.com/08-17-14-gov-nixon-statement-regarding-ongoing-situation-in-ferguson-and-role-of-national-guard.html”> Monday that the National Guard troops he called up would operate within a narrow scope. Guard soldiers will “provide protection, and ensure the safety of our Unified Command Center, which was the target last night of a coordinated attack,” he said. “The Guard will concentrate its resources on carrying out this limited mission.”

The National Guard force will be commanded by Army Gen. Gregory Mason but operate “under the direction of Colonel Ron Replogle of the Missouri State Highway Patrol,” the governor said. Guard soldiers in Ferguson will work “under the overall command of the Missouri State Highway Patrol.”

No details were provided about the size of the National Guard force or what types of units were being sent to Ferguson, but Nixon “has at his disposal something many other governors would love to have,” Gen. Honoré told The Daily Beast.

The governor has “two battalions of military police in the Missouri National Guard,” Honoré said. “He has a lot of things going for him to be able to pull together troops that are prepared to deal with any tasks he wants them to do in terms of law enforcement inside of state law.”

Missouri’s military police battalions likely have many experienced veterans from deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, but it’s unclear how much preparation they have to work inside the United States policing their fellow citizens. Aiding in domestic civil unrest is one of the doctrinal missions of the military police, but in many units it has taken a back seat in recent years to training for deployments overseas.

“That’s part of why they exist in the state,” Honoré said of the military police, “to provide military support to civil authority. Dealing with civil disobedience is one of the tasks.”

Since the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, sparked the protests and looting in Ferguson, a number of military veterans have criticized the military approach taken by local police. “In terms of its equipment, organization, and deployment methods, the Ferguson force looks more like an infantry or military police company in Iraq,” Phillip Carter, a former military police officer and Iraq veteran, {wrote}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-s-cops-are-armed-like-i-was-in-iraq.html”> in The Daily Beast. “Moreover, to a police force with such a military arsenal, every problem potentially looks like one that can be solved with military force.”

Honoré offered a similar assessment of the initial police response in Ferguson: “I don’t understand police pointing their weapons and looking through their sights into a crowd of civilians, and I don’t understand sending a SWAT team to the front line of a civil disturbance. They weren’t even dressed in riot control gear, they were dressed in assault gear like they were assaulting a building.”

“Yes, there were some people shooting,” Honoré said. “Yes, that threat was there, but from what I saw their tactics were in more of an assault mode than a crowd control mode.”

Now, with military forces stationed in Ferguson, albeit limited to defending the police command post for the time being, the balance has tipped. What once had the appearance of a military operation now has real soldiers on the ground.

The hope for people like Honoré and others who believe the National Guard is the best way to achieve peace in Ferguson is that the troop’s presence will help defuse the situation.",NA,NA,NA,NA

One U.S. military veteran says these tactics are wrong and will only make matters worse.

In Iraq, I led a motley crew of soldiers, civilians, and contractors, who lived outside the wire in downtown Baquba, advising the government of Iraq’s volatile Diyala province in 2005-06. My team drove Iraq’s roads, walked Iraq’s streets, and regularly encountered improvised explosive devices, small arms fire, mortar fire, and other dangers during that dark and deadly time in Iraq. We wore body armor, carried semi-automatic rifles and pistols, and drove in armored Humvees, sometimes with drones or helicopters above.
 
In other words, we served in one of Iraq’s bloodiest cities, during the most violent time of the war, with the same gear that a civilian police department is now using in the small American town of Ferguson, Missouri, to quell civic disturbances there. Our wars have come home.

American police have become increasingly militarized for decades, in a story told brilliantly by scholar Radley Balko in his {primer}<hyperlink=” http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Warrior-Cop-Militarization-Americas/dp/1610392116”> on the subject. However, for much of the past decades, paramilitary SWAT teams were balanced by community policing efforts, resulting in a mostly civilian, peaceful approach to law enforcement. 

Things began to change during the 1980s, when the nation’s leadership declared a “war on drugs,” and began to militarize its approach accordingly. Congress allowed the Pentagon {to give warfighting gear}<hyperlink=” http://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537”> to police departments, and also created a number of {exceptions}<hyperlink=” http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/10/A/I/18”> to the historical {rule}<hyperlink=” http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/18/I/67/1385” precluding military involvement in law enforcement. Police departments raced to apply for federal funding to harden their communities and police forces against an entire spectrum of threats not previously contemplated. Sophisticated command and control systems migrated from the military to law enforcement, alongside powerful surveillance and investigative tools first developed for the military and intelligence community.  Police departments {touted their use}<hyperlink=” http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/us/springfield-mass-fights-crime-using-green-beret-tactics.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0”> of military counterinsurgency techniques, learned from Army field manuals and returning veterans.  And, most recently, as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have wound down, the Defense Department has aggressively transferred {combat gear}<hyperlink=” http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=0”> to civilian law enforcement agencies at home – more than $400 million-worth in 2013 alone.  According to a USA Today {report}<hyperlink=” http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-michael-brown-militarization-column/14006383/”>, “police forces in the same county as Ferguson received advanced rifle sights and night vision equipment between 2012 and 2014.”

The net effect is a Ferguson police department in name only. In terms of its equipment, organization, and deployment methods, the Ferguson force looks more like an infantry or military police company in Iraq.  Its police wear the same body armor; carry the same semi-automatic M4 carbines and semi-automatic pistols; patrol in similar fire-team and squad formations; and employ similarly aggressive tactics towards a population perceived to be hostile.

Moreover, to a police force with such a military arsenal, every problem potentially looks like one that can be solved with military force. In hindsight, the Ferguson police department’s heavy-handed response to protests arguably caused the situation to escalate into the crisis that exists today. A lesser-armed police department might have used less confrontational, more community-oriented policing strategies to restore order, and been far more effective (and efficient) in the long run.

To be sure, there is a legitimate police purpose to much of this military gear. When used properly, body armor and other protective equipment enables police to use less force; similarly, non-lethal munitions can be effectively used to quell a crowd with far less force and suffering than the alternative.

But when used as in Ferguson, this military gear transforms the police department into an occupying army, and enables the police to act with such speed and violence so as to destroy any meaningful right to peaceably assemble or address grievances towards government.  The key difference lies in how the police choose to use this gear – whether as civilian police, or as infantrymen with badges. 

The great irony is that in Iraq, we rarely employed such hostile tactics, generally only using force when attacked.  As combat advisers, our mission was to build Iraqi police and government capacity, not to conduct offensive combat operations. We carried rifles, machine guns, grenades, and other firepower, and used it when necessary to fight al Qaeda in Iraq, Shiite militants, or others who attacked us. 

However, we sharply distinguished between the Iraqi civilians we were there to serve and protect, and those militants we sought to defeat (and sometimes kill or capture).  Towards the former, we adopted as friendly a posture we could, often removing our body armor and laying down our weapons in order to share tea or lunch, or doing whatever we could to show trust and build rapport.

If only the Ferguson police would learn from our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the paradox of force {stated so succinctly}<hyperlink=” http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/841519.html”> in the Army’s counterinsurgency field manual: “Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

We know in the world that surrounds us there are terrorists and there are home invaders, drug cartels, carjackers, knockout gamers, and rapers, and haters, and campus killers, airport killers, shopping mall killers and killers who scheme to destroy our country with massive storms of violence against our power grids or vicious waves of chemicals or disease that could collapse our society that sustains us all.

Oh wait, I'm sorry, there is a link to an article on the spike in gun sales in the area because of the unrest (Not that they're celebrating that!). {You can also find out}<hyperlink=” https://www.nranews.com/?grsl”> how U.S. gun owners see some conspiracy in President Obama's sanctions on the Russian AK-47 and how a veteran got kicked out of Great Adventure in New Jersey for wearing a t-shirt that said ""Keep calm and return fire."" (They offered to let him in with a different shirt, but he refused.) 

The National Rifle Association often claims it is {""America's longest standing civil rights organization""}<hyperlink=”http://web.archive.org/web/20140529184945/http://home.nra.org/”> but apparently these minor issues were more important than the murder of an unarmed teen by a policeman, and the subsequent attacks by a militarized force on unarmed Americans in a U.S. city. It is the exact nightmare the NRA has been predicting. And yet, the NRA professes no kinship for those being crushed beneath the jackboots. It seems the NRA is only worried about the civil rights of white people.

The smear came from what Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson did not say when he released a video and an incident report {implicating 18-year-old Michael Brown in a strong-arm robbery}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2014/08/15/cops-mike-brown-was-robbery-suspect.html”> minutes before he was shot to death by an officer who has finally been identified as Darren Wilson.

The report notes that a detailed description of Brown, right down to his yellow socks and red baseball cap, had gone out over the police radio.

Intended or not, the implication was that this had led Wilson to approach Brown and that the teen’s death had been related to the crime.

That suggestion was reinforced by Jackson’s decision to all but name Brown in the robbery immediately before he named Wilson as the cop who killed him.

Only after Jackson was accused of conducting a smear did he step back before the news cameras and say what he should have said hours before.

“The initial contact between the officer and Mr. Brown was not related to the robbery,” Jackson allowed. “[The robbery] had nothing to do with the stop.”
 
And, the encounter was apparently not a situation where an unsuspecting officer happened upon two robbers who were seeking to flee the scene. Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson were going down the middle of the block for everyone to see.

“They were walking down the street blocking traffic, that was it,” Jackson said.

The video from the robbery at Ferguson Market and Liquor, which even Johnson says shows him and the pal he called ”Big Mike,” does suggest that Brown was aggressive and something of a bully.

His size and bulk in relation to the shop clerk suggest that the officer he encountered minutes later might have felt threatened, especially if Brown did in fact try to take his gun, as some reports have suggested.

But the gun was in the officer’s hand when the fatal shots were fired and Brown was unarmed.

The police have not released any details of the shooting. The autopsy results have not been made public.

The official—and maybe even legitimate reason—for withholding those facts is that the case is still under investigation. But some of the same people who saw a deliberate smear in what Jackson failed to say early in the day question why even the smallest details of the robbery were released while none of the big questions about the shooting have been answered.

Jackson has said that he was compelled by the state “sunshine” law to release the video of the robbery as he identified the officer in the shooting.

“I had to,” he said.

He was more likely compelled by loyalty to his officers, who likely would have seethed if one of their own had been named in the shooting while the Brown’s role in a robbery had gone unpublicized.

In the mind of the cops, the robbery and the shooting were no doubt related on some level. To them, a perp is a perp is a perp.

That still does not explain and certainly does not excuse Jackson’s sin of omission in not making clear at the outset that the two incidents were not connected.

Unless this was in fact a deliberate smear, Jackson seems to have demonstrated a thoughtlessness that is especially troubling because he had seemed to be a progressive force since he was appointed in 2010, {modernizing and professionalizing the department}<hyperlink=” http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html”>.

In the report’s description of the suspect, a black heavy-set male is described as wearing khaki shorts, a white T-shirt (Brown was wearing similar clothing at the time of his death) and a Cardinals baseball cap (Brown was not wearing a hat when he was shot). The report alleges that Brown stole a box of Swisher Sweet cigars from the convenience store, after which the store clerk tried to stop him. The suspect then grabbed the clerk by the shirt and “forcefully pushed him back into a display rack.”

However, in an afternoon press conference, police chief Thomas Jackson said the two incidents (the robbery and Brown's death) were unrelated. The officer who shot Brown was unaware of the robbery, Jackson said—instead, he stopped Brown and a friend because ""they were in the middle of the street, blocking traffic."" 

Darren Wilson has been identified as the police officer who shot Brown to death. Confusingly, the incident report released earlier on Friday quoted an officer saying he ""responded to that scene and observed Brown. After viewing Brown and reviewing this video [of the convenience store robbery], I was able to confirm Brown is the primary suspect in this incident."" Attorneys for Brown’s family released a statement Friday saying they are “beyond outraged.” “It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him,” they wrote.

The {images from Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=”about:blank”>, of protesters clashing with the police, of looters raiding local shops, the sirens, the tear gas, the gunshots, recall the long, hot summers of the 1960s. It’s fair to ask what, if anything, local elected officials have learned in the intervening decades.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon is a far cry from Alabama Gov. George Wallace, who stood in the schoolhouse door to defy integration, or Commissioner of Public Safety Bull Connor, who turned fire hoses and attack dogs on peaceful demonstrators in Birmingham.

Nixon comes across as a textbook case of too little, too late, the personification of a white male establishment out of touch with the African-American community. He took too long to acknowledge the seriousness of Michael Brown’s death, an under-reaction given the excessive use of force against the unarmed teen. Then he inflamed the situation by imposing a {curfew}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/17/street-battle-against-cops-again-in-ferguson-despite-midnight-curfew.html”>.

Now that Nixon has {called in the National Guard}<hyperlink=“http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/18/chaos-forces-missouri-governor-to-call-in-the-national-guard.html”>, he’s got President Obama declaring in his press conference Monday that he’ll be watching to see if the Guard’s involvement helps or hurts.

“I don’t envy a governor in this situation,” says Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College. “If you act too fast, you’re overriding local authority and you run the risk of triggering a counter-response. If you wait too long, things get out of control.”

Unfortunately, Nixon managed to get it wrong coming and going, letting too much time pass before he showed his face in Ferguson, triggering angry retorts from residents that as a Democrat he only cared about them on Election Day, then super-imposing a curfew Saturday and Sunday nights only to withdraw it Monday under withering criticism.

“It’s been a mess all around,” says William Galston, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. “Nobody has yet figured out a way of bringing peace to the streets of Ferguson and simultaneously addressing the concerns of people who are showing up in peaceful protest.” The opportunistic looting by what Obama termed a “violent criminal element” has created dilemmas for the police and put civil activists on the defensive, complicating the story line from all sides.

“Still, it’s hard to escape the conclusion that a more artful and sensitive handling of this situation at the beginning could have averted a lot of this aftermath,” says Galston. That’s where Nixon shoulders some blame for failing to step in early and effectively. His apparent inability to read the black community in his state is puzzling, as African Americans are such an important part of the Democratic coalition. “He doesn’t seem to have a feel for that community in a way that a lot of Southern Democratic governors do have,” says Galston.

Before Nixon was elected governor in 2008, he served four terms as Missouri’s attorney general, winning plaudits for a reform agenda on cleaning up corruption, reinstating campaign contribution limits, suing big tobacco, and creating a No-Call list for telemarketers that is a national model. Since his reelection as governor in 2012, he’s been {quietly promoting himself}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/21/missouri-governor-jay-nixon-to-visit-iowa.html”> as a “common-sense moderate,” elected repeatedly in a red state, someone who could put Missouri in the Democratic column as, say, Hillary Clinton’s running mate.

That dream is over. Now Nixon is just trying to get through the night. From being barely visible in the first days of the crisis in Ferguson, he is now turning up on every talk show that will have him. It may be too late, but he seems finally to understand the burden of communication that he carries, that he owes it to the citizens in Ferguson, and elsewhere, to be clear about what’s ahead. The wheels of the criminal justice system move slowly. The grievances in Ferguson are deep and long-standing, and there has to be a strategy for the short term, reinstating calm, and the longer term, making sure justice is served.

For historical perspective, I reached out to Michael Barone, a resident fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, who was just starting his career in Detroit when riots broke out in the early morning of July 23, 1967, sparked by a police raid on an unlicensed bar. “I can’t claim to remember everything clearly,” he wrote in an email, “but I remember being at one point in a conference room alone with the mayor and the governor. That a 22-year-old intern could be in such a place shows how harum-scarum things were.”

The governor was George Romney, a Republican and Mitt’s father, and the mayor, Jerome Cavanagh, was a Democrat. They were not political allies, but they were not bitter adversaries, either, Barone recalls. “My recollection is that Governor Romney sent the National Guard in within 24 hours,” he says. “I am pretty sure that Mayor Cavanagh requested or agreed with this.” Romney also traveled to Detroit to meet with the mayor and the police commissioner.

The National Guard proved ineffectual, having been sidelined throughout the Vietnam era as a “kind of a weekend club rather than a fighting force,” in Barone’s description. Cavanagh wanted federal troops, and Romney, though initially reluctant, came around to that view. President Johnson and Attorney General Ramsey Clark were initially wary, too, “for good reason,” says Barone. “You probably don’t want federal troops patrolling civilian streets as a general rule.” But the time line for debate was short, the need urgent, and after the second full day of rioting, Johnson gave the order for thousands of paratroopers to enter Detroit.

“They came in, patrolled riot areas, and showed good discipline in not scattering gunfire everywhere. At one point the commanding general, General Throckmorton, was told that there was gunfire raking a street. He didn’t think this was correct (apparently you can hear gunshots a mile away) and walked down the middle of the street. No shots were fired at him,” Barone says.

Gov. Romney had presidential ambitions, and so did Cavanagh, but after the riots broke out, the 39-year-old mayor realized that his political career was over. Romney went on to allege that Johnson had delayed the federal response for political reasons, but LBJ declined to run for reelection, and Romney didn’t make the cut in 1968. The toll for the Detroit riots, which went on for five days, was 43 dead, more than 1,000 injured, 2,500 stores looted, hundreds of homes burned, and some $50 million in property damage.",NA,NA,NA,first link is a broken link

In the days since the fatal police shooting of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=”http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/12/michael-brown-s-hometown-is-under-occupation.html”>, there has been some {good reporting}<hyperlink=”http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/08/ferguson-police-arrested-reporters-from-the-washington-post-and-huffington-post/376050/”> on the ground in Ferguson, Missouri—and a heavy dose of unsubstantiated allegations against the unarmed teenager.

Brown’s August 9 killing sparked days of tense demonstrations in the town, with police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, stores looted, at least one business set on fire. On Thursday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon removed local police from the protests, and the Missouri Highway Patrol {took control}<hyperlink=”http://bigstory.ap.org/article/scrutiny-police-response-increases-ferguson”> in the St. Louis suburb. Then, Friday, police finally released the name of the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson, along with a report indicating that Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson were suspects in a convenience-store robbery shortly before the shooting. (Johnson’s lawyer {confirmed}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ferguson-police-name-michael-brown”> to MSNBC that Brown had taken cigars from the store.)

But long before the robbery allegations, online outlets were attempting to paint Brown as a common thug. (You may recall a similar backlash to the {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=”http://gawker.com/5896490/your-guide-to-the-idiotic-racist-backlash-against-trayvon-martin”> case.)

Brown’s family made just that point in a statement Friday: “There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.”

Thankfully, the ugly gang smears against Brown have been relegated mostly to the noisy but fringiest elements of the American right.

But at the core of modern racism is cops vs. young black men. Here’s what we can do about it.

To many, the protests after the shooting murder of black teen Michael Brown in St. Louis will seem like a routine. The outrage, the Al Sharpton—and soon, we’re on to the next thing.

What too few realize is that the main reason so many people think of racism as the core of being black in modern America is the cops: the relationship between police forces and young black men, and how often the former kill the latter under suspicious circumstances.

I am the last person to jump in with overheated rhetoric that America is engaged in a “war against black men.” There is no evidence of anything so deliberate. However, when more temperately minded people say that black lives are valued less in the clinch than white ones, jump in I must, because it’s true.

A few weeks ago, white 18-year-old Steve Lohner {could tote a gun around in Aurora, Colorado}<hyperlink=”http://www.rawstory.com/2014/08/teen-totes-shotgun-through-town-still-shaken-by-mass-murder-because-2nd-amendment/”> (where in 2012 James Holmes gunned 12 people to death and injured 70 others), practically taunting law enforcement  to mess with him, in a quest to make a showy point about gun rights. Who among us can pretend that if a black kid was doing the same thing he wouldn’t be {much more likely to wind up killed}<hyperlink=”http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/08/08/1320164/-Why-Black-Men-Don-t-Open-Carry?detail=facebook”>? Those inclined to pretend might note that meanwhile, black 22-year-old John Crawford was {killed two weeks later}<hyperlink=”http://www.rawstory.com/2014/08/cops-gun-down-ohio-man-holding-toy-rifle-in-walmart-like-he-was-not-even-human/”> for holding a toy gun at a Wal-Mart in Ohio.

This kind of thing sits in black American minds and creates a sense of alienation. I first started writing about race 15 years ago, perplexed that so many people seemed convinced that nothing had changed on race in America since about 1960. Having grown up in quiet neighborhoods, I didn’t get it. I quickly learned—the sticking point was, and still is, the cops.

Incidents like what happened to Michael Brown should teach three lessons.

One: Stereotyping. As most will agree, cops need to get past the idea that what’s cocky for a white kid is potentially lethal coming from a black kid. Clearly, whatever training cops are getting to avoid unnecessary profiling is not zeroing in on this kind of {Implicit Association Bias}<hyperlink=”http://www.understandingprejudice.org/iat/”, which is hardly so complicated that it couldn’t be discussed and worked against more diligently. As a linguist, I suggest one focus be speech: outsiders can read black men’s speech as confrontational at times {when it isn’t intended that way}<hyperlink=”http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/02/when_blacks_are_plainspoken_whites_might_hear_threats.html”>.

Two: The War on Drugs. However, getting rid of biases like these is hard. I have rarely encountered such sneering, glowering disrespect, almost gleeful in its menace, from any human beings as from New York and Jersey City cops amid minor incidents, such as when the driver of a cab I was in got a ticket and I asked if I could just get out and walk the rest of my way, or when I was deemed to be following one of their traffic-directing gestures too slowly, etc.

These interactions are minor irritants for me, but leave me dreading the fate of a black teen under the power of people like this, especially if the teen deigned to mouth off a little. Let’s just keep black kids away from people like this.

And what brings cops into black neighborhoods as often as not is the War on Drugs, where they are assigned to sniff out people holding or selling said drugs. Imagine an America where the cops had no assignment to do such patrols at all: Black boys like Michael Brown could be left to mind their business. Plus, note that much of what keeps a gang going is drug sales. Imagine if there were no money to made selling them because they weren’t illegal.

This is why we should celebrate the crumbling of the War on Drugs wall with the increasing acceptance of the legalization of marijuana, now even hallowed on the pages of The New York Times. It’s just a start: Weed is only one kind of drug the cops are assigned to trawl for. But to prod the War on Drugs ever further into history is to make the death of children like Michael Brown ever less likely.

Three: Looking inward. There’s something else, harder to discuss but, like so many such things, urgent nonetheless. Deep breath: The black community cannot pretend that the stereotype of black men as violent comes out of nowhere.

{Young black men commit about 50 percent of the murders in this country}<hyperlink=”http://sdrostra.com/?p=26096”>, {14 times more than young white men}<hyperlink=” http://conservative-headlines.com/”>. Or, where do murder rates among young white men go up each summer the way they do among black ones in cities like Chicago? “Flash robs” happen when large groups of teens beset a store and steal from it, and I’m sorry, but these are rarely white affairs.

There are reasons for things like these. However, we are being unrealistic to expect America to watch these things and think it’s okay because the boys don’t have Dads and decent-paying low-skill jobs aren’t always easy to find. Let’s face it: If Korean boys regularly did things like this, we’d all be scared to death of them.

Be clear: Michael Brown’s murder was grievously unjustified regardless. And forget the tired canard that the black community doesn’t care about black-on-black murder, which could only be leveled by someone who doesn’t know much about black people. Stop the Violence events are a staple in black neighborhoods.

Yet, I wonder if the black community could step it up some on this. We need to devote some more energy to figuring out what we can do about The Violence, because among all else that it destroys, it feeds a perception bias that ends up killing innocents like Michael Brown.

Nor was an officer when he killed the other Michael Brown.

The death of 18-year-old Michael Brown is not the first time an officer supervised by Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson has killed an unarmed man.

And this is also not the first time that a cop under his command has sparked protests in which Rev. Al Sharpton played a leading role.

Back in 2000, two unarmed young men were shot and killed in a Jack in the Box parking lot in the suburban town of Berkeley adjacent to Ferguson by a pair of officers assigned to a county-wide drug task force where Jackson was deputy commander.

Early reports suggested that a vehicle occupied by Earl Murray and Ronald Beasley moved toward Officers Robert Piekutowski and Keith Kierzkowski, causing them to fear being pinned against another car.

Jackson, then a lieutenant with the St. Louis County Police, told reporters, “I am convinced that the officers were in fear of their lives, that they were in immediate danger.”

Jackson contended that the officers were standing in the driver’s path of flight.

“That's where he was going to escape,” Jackson said. “It was obvious to everyone he was going to go right through them. What they [the officers] said was that it lurched forward. In that instant, they thought, ‘This is it.’”

During the ensuing protests, Sharpton spoke of blocking a major highway, U.S. 40.  Local leaders then protested his planned protest and traffic flowed uninterrupted as he went home to New York.

Subsequently, investigators decided that the car occupied by the two men had not in fact begun to move in their direction when the fatal shots were fired. The officers insisted they were in fear for their lives nonetheless, essentially arguing that the car was itself a deadly weapon pointed their way. That was enough for the shooting to be ruled justified under Missouri state law. The cops were not indicted.

That same provision, Chapter 563 of the Missouri Revised Statutes, will no doubt come into play in this new case in which a cop shot an unarmed man.

Under this law, a cop is justified in using deadly force “in effecting an arrest or in preventing an escape from custody” if “he reasonably believes” it is necessary in order to “to effect the arrest and also reasonably believes that the person to be arrested has committed or attempted to commit a felony…or may otherwise endanger life or inflict serious physical injury unless arrested without delay.”

As the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted on Monday, this law was also cited in a 2005 incident, after police in Lincoln County, Missouri, shot another unarmed young man named Michael Brown.

This other Michael Brown was 23 years old and riding with four friends in a pickup truck driven by 22-year-old Tyler Teasley when a sheriff’s deputy clocked them going well over the 55 mph speed limit. Deputy Nic Forler sought to pull them over, and Teasley tried to elude him by pulling into a driveway and shutting off the truck’s lights.

In his panic, Teasley apparently left the truck in neutral and it began to roll toward Forler down a slope of just 2.1 degrees as he approached. Forler fired repeatedly through the tinted back window, missing three of the occupants, but striking Brown and Teasley in the heads, killing them.

The shooting was not initially found justified and in civil court, Brown’s family subsequently won a $1.2 million settlement. Teasley’s family won $1.1 million at trial.

But after Forler was indicted on manslaughter charges, he was found not guilty in criminal court even though the truck was estimated by the FBI to have been rolling toward him at no more than 3.5 mph.

Now we have another unarmed young man named Michael Brown shot by a cop in Missouri. The present one was not even in a vehicle that a cop could argue was a deadly weapon. But Officer Darren Wilson is almost certain to cite Chapter 563 and say Brown’s size caused him to be in fear for his life when he fired.

If the cop from this latest shooting is either found not guilty or escapes charges altogether, it might be worth considering that the Michael Brown from nine years ago was white.",NA,NA,NA,NA
DailyBeast,beast45,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/17/fact-checking-the-sunday-shows-august-17.html,Fact-Checking the Sunday Shows: August 17,Steve Contorno; Aaron Sharockman,8/17/2014,2/22/2016,"Ferguson, Michael Brown, and race relations in America dominated Sunday talk shows.

The killing of an unarmed black teen by a white police officer in a St. Louis suburb is raising questions about the makeup of the police department and its response to the Aug. 9 shooting.

In some cases, answers are hard to come by.

On Sunday, actor and civil rights activist Jesse Williams appeared on CNN’s State of the Union to discuss the shooting. Williams, best known for his role as a doctor on Grey’s Anatomy, emphasized that journalists should not sensationalize findings that don’t answer questions about why 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot by police — like a security video Ferguson authorities released of Brown allegedly robbing a convenience store minutes before he was killed.

“You will find that the people doing the oppressing often want to start the narrative at a convenient point, always want to start the point in the middle,” said Williams, who is on the board of directors for the Advancement Project, a civil rights group. “This started with a kid getting shot and killed and left in the street for four hours. I've never seen a white body left in the street for four hours in the sweltering heat. I've never — you know, the cop doesn't call — doesn't call in the shooting. The body isn't put in an ambulance. It's shuddered away in some shady unmarked SUV.”

We wondered about WIlliams’ assertion that the officer involved in the shooting, Darren Wilson, failed to call in the incident. {What we found is a situation currently too murky to render a judgment.}<hyperlink=”http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2014/aug/17/did-ferguson-police-officer-fail-call-shooting/” 

But here’s what we know.

There are two sources that could be seen as backing up Williams’ claim. 

One is the lawyer for Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown at the moment of the confrontation with police and fled the scene unharmed. According to the Washington Post, Johnson’s attorney, former St. Louis mayor Freeman Bosley Jr., said Saturday that the Ferguson police officer “doesn’t attempt to resuscitate. He does not call for medical help. The officer didn’t call it in that someone had been shot.”
 
Additionally, the hactivist group known as Anonymous released audio from the St. Louis County dispatch from the afternoon of Brown’s death. According to the Post, the authenticity of the recordings has been confirmed.

In the recordings, a dispatcher said Ferguson police asked for help to assist with crowd control in the area of the shooting and asked for permission to send an officer.

Moments later, the dispatcher said she hears an officer is involved in a shooting, but the information is coming from local media.

“We just got another call stating that an officer’s out shooting at (the intersection of) Canfield and Coppercreek. I don’t who called it in, it was called into my desk,” the dispatcher said. “Be advised this came from the news.”

She adds: “We’re just getting information from the news, and we just called Ferguson back again and they don’t know anything about it.”

While more information is needed to explain why the Ferguson police department told St. Louis county ""they don’t know anything about it,"" it doesn’t necessarily mean that Wilson did not call in the shooting.

In fact, incident reports released by Ferguson police indicate a swift response.

A time line produced by St. Louis Public Radio based on police reports breaks down police action Aug. 9, including the convenience store robbery and the shooting.

12:00:07 p.m., Wilson left a scene where he was assisting with a “sick call.”

12:01:50 p.m., a shooting event is opened by the Ferguson police department.

12:02:22 p.m., Ferguson dispatch alerts another officer, who is en route and arrives on scene.

12:04:55 p.m. EMS is contacted. 

None of this makes clear who made the initial call to police. It’s possible dispatch sent an officer based on a report of a shooting from a witness, or that the officer may have been nearby and responded independently. However, whether it was Wilson who made the call, it does appear that police units arrived quickly on the scene.

One statistic that we could verify, however, came from NBC’s Andrea Mitchell, who filled in as host on Meet the Press.

Mitchell, describing the tension between police officers and the people living in Ferguson, said that ""you've got three black officers and 50 white officers with a town that is 67 percent African-American.""  

Those figures basically are correct as there may be as many as four black officers. {We rate the claim Mostly True.}<hyperlink=”http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/17/andrea-mitchell/ferguson-police-department-has-50-white-officers-t/”>

Mitchell’s statistic about Ferguson’s black population checks out through the city’s QuickFacts profile from the U.S. Census Bureau. As of 2010, 67.4 percent of the city’s 21,000 residents are black, and 29.3 percent are white.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who is white, told the Los Angeles Times and the Associated Press that the police department has 53 officers, three of whom are black. He also said that the other 50 officers are white, according to newspaper reports. Put another way, Ferguson police officers are 94 percent white and 5.6 percent black.

Tim Zoll, a spokesman for the Ferguson Police Department, said Sunday that there are actually four African-American officers among the 53-person officer corps. ""The discrepancy may have been that we really don't see black or white among our colleagues,"" Zoll said.

Whether the number is three or four is a minor point.

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles, who is also white, has addressed the lack of diversity in the police department. According to an Aug. 12 report by St. Louis-based TV station KSDK, Knowles told reporters that young African-Americans aren’t interested in police jobs.

""We hire everyone that we can get,” Knowles said. “There's also the problem that a lot of young African-American people don't want to go into law enforcement. They already have this disconnect with law enforcement, so if we find people who want to go into law enforcement who are African-American we're all over it because we want them to help us bridge the gap.""

Less than 24 hours after citizen protests in Ferguson, Missouri erupted into brutal mayhem, thousands of people gathered in New York City in honor of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Part of a slew of scheduled protests around the country, Union Square began to fill up around 7pm with people adopting the well-circulated Ferguson motto: “Hands up, don’t shoot.” 

[tweetbegin 500050576122855425 tweetend]

The initial rhetoric, led by a group known as the {Revolution Club}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/NYCRevClub”> made reference to other victims of police brutality, including {Eric Garner}<hyperlink=” http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cops-involved-eric-garner-confrontation-asked-target-illegal-cigarette-sales-bratton-article-1.1901612”>, a father who died after being put in a chokehold by the NYPD last month.

Yet as the crowd moved from Union Square towards Times Square, chanting “No justice, no peace” and bringing traffic to a standstill, the situation grew more tense. Upon arriving in the dizzying center of the city - a person in an Elmo costume jumped up exuberantly in support of the group as they passed - the police formed a line to stop the protestors from marching. After some brief altercations between the authorities and protestors in the front of the pack everyone slowly and calmly sat down in front of stopped traffic.  

[tweetbegin 500074852821524481 tweetend]

As the group diverged into smaller packs, police closed off 42nd street between 8th and 9th Avenue, where there were reports of arrests. One police officer refused to let me through despite identifying myself and showing him press credentials. He claimed that I wasn’t “gentleman” enough and chuckled as I presented identification, before physically forcing me to step away. 

The proceedings drew to a close by around 10:30 P.M. after a {handful of individuals}<hyperlink=”http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Times-Square-Rally-Missouri-Shooting-Thousands--271329291.html”> had been placed into an NYPD van with plastic handcuffs restraining them.

But however hard I try, however well they treat me, I know this is not my country.

I wrote the piece below in a late-night frenzy on July 13, 2013, after receiving a notification on my phone that George Zimmerman had been acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin. I had left a party early, brooding about why I felt so strongly about something that, ostensibly, had “nothing to do with me.”

I had originally kept this as a friends-only post on Facebook, because of the justifiable fear that writing angry tearful screeds about how mad you are at America might be harmful for my career.

As it was, the tweets that I sent out about how depressed I was after the Trayvon Martin shooting got dug up several months later by some National Enquirer intern looking for dirt on the recent Jeopardy! celebrity, and I got to see a blurb in the Enquirer asking, “Does Jeopardy champ Arthur Chu hate America?”

So for a while I was paranoid about ever letting anyone see this again. But then another late-night frenzy piece I wrote in response to the Isla Vista shootings took off, and I thought maybe sharing this wouldn’t be so bad an idea.

The one sticking point was, of course, that my D-list viral celebrity as a Jeopardy! champ and all that followed came a year after George Zimmerman’s acquittal and the whole issue of white guys shooting minorities dead and getting away with it was, as we say in the journalism business, “stale.”

But I remember a dark, cynical voice in my mind thinking, “Don’t worry. The issue may be stale now, but just give it a few months and it’ll be in the headlines again. Have faith. This is America.”

What do you know,{I was right}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/us/looting-and-unrest-follows-vigil-for-st-louis-teenager.html”>.

When my father first came to this country as a graduate student, there was an incident where he and a friend were walking home and were suddenly confronted in a parking lot by a group of apparently intoxicated students in a car, driving around them in circles, shouting threats and racist catcalls.

 My father’s friend counseled him to ignore it, to wait for them to get their jollies and leave, that this is just the kind of thing that happens once in a while.

My father waited, and they didn’t leave, and then my father picked up a rock and said, “I’m counting to thirty and if they’re not gone by then this rock is going through their windshield.”

Luckily, they tired of the sport and peeled off around when my dad hit fifteen. It’s good for me that they did—had the rock gone through the windshield, had glass flown in a thousand bright shards across the asphalt, had the driver slumped over, bleeding, and the car doors swung open and his friends stormed out filled with anger, had police been called and charges been filed—well, I probably wouldn’t be here.

If by chance one of those students had been a Zimmerman, carrying a firearm for “self-defense” against “violent criminals” armed with rocks, I very definitely would not be here.

There was a moral to this story when my father told it to me, a moral that I hated more than any of the other morals that came attached to his other anecdotes.

It was a moral that explained many things. It explained, for instance, why he never went to parent-teacher association events, never integrated himself into “the community.” Why he consistently obeyed Rule #1, a rule that my friends’ white suburban parents had never considered—a rule I would not hear from others until I actually met people who’d grown up urban and poor when I got older—Never Talk to the Cops. (In the Bill of Rights it’s actually Rule #5.)

Why he urged me to choose a career specialization based on objective assessment of skills and achievements, one where success was quantifiable, one whose practitioners were organizationally indispensable. To take an “Asian” job like engineer, scientist, programmer. One where there was little room for subjectivity, where the personal impression of the interviewer counted less. To stay away most of all from fields where I would be judged purely based on how well people could relate to me, like direct sales, like middle management, like the performing arts.

To never, ever, ever put my livelihood in a position where I depended on white people liking me.

Because it was a lesson he learned the night that some random drunkards decided that terrorizing two pedestrians in a car, swerving toward them again and again, would be fun—would have no legal consequences because the cops wouldn’t care, would have no moral consequences because the victims didn’t matter.

A lesson he learned every time he was pulled over for a speeding ticket, or pulled aside by the store detective and asked to turn out his pockets, or quietly scoffed at and eyerolled at by a customer service rep for his accent.

That lesson was:

This Is Not Your Country.

You can live here. You can make friends. You can try to live by the law and be a decent citizen and even maybe make a lot of money.

But you will never, ever belong. You will never, ever be one of them. And you must never, ever trust them.

I resisted this lesson. I fought back. I worked for hours to give myself a generic Midwestern broadcaster’s accent—I became a voiceover artist because the way I have trained myself to speak is a “radio voice.” I fell in love with the English language, I developed a vocabulary of nearly a hundred thousand English words, I devoured American culture both high and low, Mark Twain and Eugene O'Neill and Flannery O'Connor and Jerry Seinfeld and Tupac and Public Enemy and the Beach Boys and Buddy Holly and Madonna and Ella Fitzgerald and Weird Al and Bill Hicks and George Carlin and Martin Scorsese and John Waters and John Philip Sousa and Aaron Copland and George Lucas and Beverly Cleary and Matt Groening and on and on and on, all of it, everything I could find, every TV show, every radio station, every book in the library.

History, literature, politics. Fast food and junk food and pop culture trivia and song lyrics and idiomatic colloquialisms of the South, the Northeast, the Midwest. I binged on America, I stuffed myself so full of America I was bursting at the seams with America.

I swallowed it all. As much as I could. I swallowed things that tasted foul and struggled to keep them down, but I did the best I could, to prove I could, to prove that I could swallow anything. I stomached the Chinese Exclusion Acts and the Riots of 1871. The gold miners and the borax miners and the railroad workers. I held my nose and I ate Jack London and the Yellow Peril and the coming war with China. I swallowed H.S. Tsien's deportation and Cold War paranoia and Joe McCarthy and the Yellow Peril and the coming war with China. I choked down Wen Ho Lee’s arrest and Vincent Chin’s murder and Iris Chang’s suicide and Andrew Breitbart and the Yellow Peril and the coming war with China.

My friends were white. The girls I dated were white. I laughed at the racist jokes and invoked hipster irony to make them myself. I steeled my muscles and kept inside all the shit I’d swallowed, told me it was another time, another place, just another one of my dad’s stupid stories. I took history instead of CS or EE in college. To hell with my dad’s misgivings, I set out to be an actor, a performer, to live or die by whether I could get the audience to like me.

Because none of that was real. That was all in another world.

The historical atrocities and the daily microaggressions. Kids who screamed “Chinese Pig!” and adults who asked in an exasperated tone “I mean where are you from originally?” John McCain and the gooks he could never forgive. Making it to callbacks three times in a row only to never be the “fit” they were looking for. Being complimented on my English. Being criticized on my English. The tingle of nerves bristling at standing next in line to a FOB with a thick accent and a bad haircut, the desire to scream “I’m not with him! We’re not related!”

Sum Ting Wong and Ho Lee Fuk. Dick jokes. Accent jokes. Chinese restaurant jokes. The mute Chinese nerd in the background of the movie. The Chinese lead character being played by a white guy in makeup.

Waking up every day knowing that all of it—the broadcaster accent, the memorized cultural references and song lyrics—isn’t fooling anybody. Your face gives you away. The way you overenunciate certain consonants. The foods that don’t make you retch and the foods that do. The sound of your parents’ voice on the phone.

The way it simply matters more when a pretty white girl goes missing than when an Asian man goes missing and is later found dead. The way academics still publish papers on whether you possess the necessary mental apparatus to function in a civil democracy.

The way a grad student is willing to hurl a rock through a car windshield—and throw away his entire future with it—because he knows in that moment that he has no other options, that if he is found run over and dead the next morning the cops won’t really care.

The way a terrified black teenager might lunge at a racist vigilante because he knows there’s no good way out of this and it’s better to die fighting than to be shot in the back.

The way a crowd of people who have had their total and utter helplessness before the law rubbed into their face by the media over and over again might pick up rocks, sticks, knives and break anything they can, because while mindless vengeance is not justice—is far inferior to justice—it is still more than nothing, which, when they try to stand up and peacefully demand justice, is what they always receive.

The way a grim-faced storeowner might pick up an assault rifle and begin firing into that selfsame aggrieved, desperate crowd because he knows no one is coming, no one will help, no justice will be served—the men whose blood the crowd wants are safely ensconced in police protection in the suburbs miles away and they, like the Jewish bailiffs in feudal Russia in the time of the pogroms, will be left to soak up the rage of the masses. They fire round after round in “self-defense” without thought of justice because for them justice does not exist.

They live in a world different from your world, gentle white reader. The one you take for granted, where you can pick up the phone and someone on the other end will listen, a cop or a lawyer or a congressman. They live in Trayvon Martin’s world, in my father’s world, in the world that under all the assimilation and the “model minority” bullshit I live in, despite all my best efforts, despite all my father’s warnings.

But even that is a facile evasion, isn’t it? Calling it two worlds. It’s really only one world, only one country, only one United States of America. There’s one place, one culture, one system.

We all live here. We all make friends here, eat the food, watch the movies, maybe even make money.

It’s just some people belong here, and others don’t.

I can pretend to belong here better than Trayvon was ever given the chance to. The white racist looks at me and sees a stolen job or the slow decline of national prominence, but he doesn’t see a rapist, a thug, a barbarian at the gate. I fear being snubbed and sometimes spat on but rarely shot. And that is a very important difference.

But it is still not my country. However hard I try, however well they treat me, however much we all smile at each other and however much people praise the ""model minority"" I am, I know it is not.

Because it’s also the country whose government had to be pressured into taking an interest in the murder of a young man simply because of the color of his skin. A country that produced a jury that let that murderer walk free. And a country whose most self-proclaimedly patriotic citizens were whooping and hooting and setting off fireworks the night that man went free, right in the midst of the shock and grief and sorrow of those still mourning.

And I am done making excuses for this country, to say that “America” isn’t like that despite what the American government is like, despite what American history is like, despite what even now an overwhelming number of the American people are openly and proudly like. I am dead tired of pretending that countless examples are all exceptions, that to see a pattern where a pattern clearly exists is to be a “reverse racist” and “paranoid” and all the things I have accused my father of being.

I am sick and tired of reassuring myself that if their smiling faces can rejoice at the murderer’s freedom simply because the victim didn’t belong here, that I have any hope of belonging here either.

I am not an American. This is not my country. I have no country other than a China I barely know and do not love. Trayvon had no country other than the vanished West African kingdoms of centuries ago, replaced by post-colonial polities that know nothing of and care nothing for their long-lost sons and daughters of the Middle Passage.

It is not a good feeling, to be homeless. I wish it were not so. I continue to live here, work here, pay the taxes and obey the law. I even intend to spend my life here fighting to the end of my days in whatever small way I can to make this benighted country less of a failure at living up to its ideals. I like the food, I love the music, and in some broken, painful, tragic way I even love America itself, the way a victim of abuse might be unwilling to surrender his love for his abuser because to do so would be to surrender the last of his illusion of dignity and agency.

But of this, no more illusions. I am sorry, father. You were right.

This is not my country.

It never was.

DailyBeast,beast51,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/19/missouri-braces-for-a-new-michael-brown.html,Missouri Braces for a New Michael Brown,Justin Glawe,8/19/2014,2/22/2016,"Police killed a young black man Tuesday who allegedly stole from a convenience store just three miles away from where last week's infamous incident occurred.

NORTH ST. LOUIS, Mo. — Michael Brown died, ostensibly, because police considered him a suspect in the theft of a $50 box of cigars. On Tuesday, a 23-year-old man apparently died for much the same reason, again at the hands of police.

The unnamed man allegedly stole energy drinks and pastries from a convenience store, approached two police officers who arrived on scene, and told them “kill me now” as he reportedly brandished a knife. The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Chief said at a press conference shortly thereafter that the officers issued verbal commands, and when the suspect didn’t comply, opened fire.

Like Brown, he was black. Several people from the neighborhood told The Daily Beast the man was mentally unstable. Whatever the circumstances, the shooting couldn’t come at a worse time.

“It’s going to break out here the same way it did in Ferguson,” said Leon Nelson of the protests that have consumed the St. Louis suburb, just three miles down West Florissant Avenue from site of Tuesday’s shooting.

While Monday night’s clashes in Ferguson had a feel of provocation simply for the sake of it, with outside agitators and a fringe element of protesters fueling the incitement of police, Tuesday may bring a return to unabated rage over this most recent killing by police.

Many in Ferguson, and at the scene in North St. Louis, believe Brown should still be alive. As for the man laying behind bright orange sheets erected by police: “That boy shouldn’t be dead either.”

Local pastors whose leadership was indispensable in their initial prevention of violence Monday night have asked for the Ferguson protest zone to be extended. That may mean protesters from Ferguson and any who materialize in North St. Louis could join up and form one crowd unified by the death of two black men by police.
 
The National Guard, whose mission has so far only been to protect a shopping mall referred to by police as the “Unified Command Center,” might play a larger role tonight.

""People are fed up and they should be,” said Nelson, a 68-year-old Vietnam veteran who lives in the neighborhood where today’s fatal shooting occurred. “It’s sickening. I’m so sorry that I went to Vietnam to fight for what I thought was right only to come back to this.”",NA,NA,NA,NA
