Jay Nixon ordered National Guard troops to the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson early Monday after authorities used tear gas to clear the streets of protesters hours before a midnight curfew took effect for a second consecutive day, while a private autopsy on the unarmed black teen who was fatally shot by a white police officer reportedly showed six gunshot wounds, including two in the head. 

""Tonight, a day of hope, prayers, and peaceful protests was marred by the violent criminal acts of an organized and growing number of individuals, many from outside the community and state, whose actions are putting the residents and businesses of Ferguson at risk,"" Nixon said in a statement released by his office. ""I am directing the highly capable men and women of the Missouri National Guard to assist ... in restoring peace and order to this community.""

As night fell in Ferguson, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated after marchers pushed toward one end of a street and authorities — who said they were responding to reports of gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails — pushed them back by repeatedly firing tear gas. The streets were empty well before a state-imposed curfew took effect at midnight.

""Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of response.""

- Capt. Ron Johnson, Missouri Highway Patrol
""Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of response,"" said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is command in Ferguson.

At least two people were wounded in shootings by civilians, he said. A Missouri Highway Patrol spokesman said that at least seven people were arrested on charges of failing to disperse.

The New York Times reported late Sunday that an autopsy on Michael Brown's body was carried out at the request of Michael Brown's family by Dr. Michael Baden, the former chief medical examiner for New York City. 

Baden told the Times that one of the bullets struck the top of Brown's skull, suggesting that the 18-year-old's head was bent forward when he was shot. The doctor added that four of the six shots struck Brown in the right arm, and all the bullets entered from the teen's front. Only three of the bullets were recovered from Brown's body. 

Baden did not have access to Brown's clothes, which may have gunpowder residue on them if the bullets were fired from close range. Baden also did not have access to X-rays that may have shown where the bullets were found, nor did he see any witness or police statements. 

Brown was fatally shot by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson on the afternoon of August 9 after a confrontation near Brown's grandmother's apartment. The shooting has prompted nationwide protests and the controversy has been augmented by the response from  local authorities, who have used tear gas and smoke canisters against protesters and have been slow to release information about the deadly encounter. 

Baden told The Times that his findings were not meant to resolve the controversy over the confrontation between Brown and Wilson.

""We need more information; for example, the police should be examining the automobile to see if there is gunshot residue in the police car,"" he told the paper.

Baden's autopsy was the first of three planned in the case. Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday ordered a federal medical examiner to perform an autopsy in addition to the one planned by state authorities. Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said that the order was prompted by the ""extraordinary circumstances"" surrounding the case and the wishes of Brown's family. 

""This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,"" Fallon said. ""Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.""

Back in Ferguson, Sunday's clashes erupted three hours before the curfew imposed by Gov. Jay Nixon.

Officers in riot gear ordered all the protesters to disperse. Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley of tear gas.

Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the street near the QuikTrip convenience store that was burned down last week. It was an apparent attempt to block police vehicles, but the vehicles easily plowed through. Someone set a nearby trash bin on fire, and the crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away.

Within two hours, most people had been cleared off West Florissant Avenue, one of the community's main thoroughfares. The streets remained quiet as the curfew began. It was to remain in effect until 5 a.m.

Earlier in the day, Johnson said he had met members of Brown's family and the experience ""brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart.""

""When this is over,"" he told the crowd, ""I'm going to go in my son's room. My black son, who wears his pants sagging, who wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, but that's my baby.""

Johnson added: ""We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael's going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.""

The Rev. Al Sharpton told the rally Brown's death was a ""defining moment for this country.""

Sharpton said he wants Congress to stop programs that provide military-style weaponry to police departments. He said he expects police to ""smear"" the slain teenager, his family and his attorneys. He also condemned the recent violence and looting in Ferguson.

FoxNews,fox2,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/16/ferguson-shooting-police-standoff/,"Ferguson shooting: Police, protesters clash after disclosures",The Associated Press,08/16/2014,10/23/2015,"Anger spurred by the death of a black teenager at the hands of white police officer boiled over again early Saturday morning in Ferguson, Missouri, when protesters stormed into a convenience store — the same store that Michael Brown was accused of robbing.

Police and about 200 protesters began clashing late Friday after another tense day in the St. Louis suburb, a day that included authorities identifying the officer who fatally shot Brown on Aug. 9. At the same news conference in which officer Darren Wilson was named, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released documents alleging that Brown stole a $48.99 box of cigars from the convenience store, then strong-armed a man on his way out.

Just before midnight, some in what had been a large and rowdy but mostly well-behaved crowd broke into that same small store and began looting it, said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson.

Some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Johnson said. One officer was hurt but details on the injury were not immediately available.

Johnson said police backed off to try and ease the tension. He believes looting may have spread to a couple of nearby stores. No arrests were made.

""We had to evaluate the security of the officers there and also the rioters,"" Johnson said. ""We just felt it was better to move back.""

Meanwhile, peaceful protesters yelled at the aggressors to stop what they were doing. About a dozen people eventually blocked off the front of the convenience store to help protect it.

Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday appointed Johnson to take over security after concerns were raised about how local police had used tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters earlier in the week. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly.

Jackson's decision to spell out the allegations that Brown committed the robbery, and his releasing of surveillance video, angered attorneys for Brown's family and others, including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay. Earlier Friday night, the Democratic congressman took a bullhorn and told protesters, ""They have attempted to taint the investigation. They are trying to influence a jury pool by the stunt they pulled today.""

Family attorney Daryl Parks acknowledged that the man shown in the surveillance footage ""appears to be"" Brown. But he and others said Brown's family was blindsided by the allegations and release of the footage. They said that even if it was Brown, the crime didn't justify the shooting of a teen after he put up his hands in surrender to the officer, as witnesses allege.

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said police ""are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style"" killing, said Crump, who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.

The surveillance video appears to show a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store's door. A police report alleges that Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and ""forcefully pushed him back"" into a display rack.

Police said they found evidence of the stolen merchandise on Brown's body.

Brown's family and supporters have been pushing for release of the officer's name. Wilson is a six-year police veteran — two in neighboring Jennings and four in Ferguson — and had no previous complaints filed against him, Jackson said.

The police chief described Wilson as ""a gentle, quiet man"" who had been ""an excellent officer."" Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation of the shooting wraps up.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley on Friday asked Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster to take over the case, saying he did not believe McCulloch could be objective. Koster said Missouri law does not allow it unless McCulloch opts out. McCulloch spokesman Ed Magee said McCulloch has no plans to surrender the case.

Also Friday, the Justice Department confirmed in a statement that FBI agents had conducted several interviews with witnesses as part of a civil-rights investigation into Brown's death. In the days ahead, the agents planned to canvass the neighborhood where the shooting happened, seeking more information, the statement said.",7625,7221,NA,NA
FoxNews,fox3,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-say-michael-brown-fit-description-strong-arm-robbery-suspect/,Ferguson police say Michael Brown was suspect in robbery  ,Mike Tobin; Edmund DeMarche ,08/15/2014,10/23/2015,"A suburban St. Louis police chief on Friday identified the officer whose fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager ignited days of heated protests, and released documents alleging the teen was killed after a robbery in which he was suspected of stealing a $48.99 box of cigars.

Ferguson, Mo., Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the robbery took place just before noon on Saturday at a convenience store roughly 10 minutes before a police officer identified as Darren Wilson fired the bullet that killed Michael Brown. Police say that the shot was fired after a struggle touched off by Wilson's confronting Brown. Jackson said Wilson is a six-year veteran with no disciplinary action on his record.

At a press conference Friday afternoon, authorities said the police officer who shot Brown did not know he was a robbery suspect at the time.

The news conference came after nearly a week of sometimes-violent protests and calls by many, including President Obama, for local law enforcement to be more transparent about the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Police previously said they withheld Wilson's identity because of the potential for threats on the officer and his family. The officer has been on administrative leave since the shooting.

Police released still images and were planning to release video from the robbery, at a QuikTrip store in Ferguson. Jackson said Wilson, along with other officers, were called to the area after a 911 call reporting a ""strong-arm robbery"" at a nearby convenience store. He didn't immediately release details about the alleged robbery, saying more information would be released later.

Police provided few other details about the police officer at the morning news conference and did not take any questions. Jackson said Swisher Sweets cigars were stolen in the robbery. 

According to the police reports, Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson were suspected of taking a box of cigars from a store in Ferguson that morning.

At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times, according to police.

But a much different story has been told by Johnson, who says he was walking down the street with Brown when he was shot. He has said the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

The attorney representing Brown's family, Benjamin Crump, said Brown's parents are ""incensed"" by what he calls ""the old game of smoke and mirrors."" He says the family was blind-sided by Friday's announcement.

Crump says ""it's bad enough they assassinated him, and now they're trying to assassinate his character.""

Tensions in Ferguson boiled over after a candlelight vigil Sunday night, as looters smashed and burned businesses in the neighborhood, where police have repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

But on Thursday, county police in riot gear and armored tanks gave way to {state troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of peaceful protesters.}<hyperlink=http://video.foxnews.com/v/3731592267001/peaceful-protests-replace-violence-in-ferguson/?#sp=show-clips> The dramatic shift came after Gov. Jay Nixon assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol, stripping that authority from the St. Louis County Police Department.

""All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,"" Pedro Smith, who has participated in the nightly protests, said Thursday. ""This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect.""

The more tolerant response came as {President Obama spoke publicly}<hyperlink=http://video.foxnews.com/v/3730977427001/president-obama-gov-nixon-appeal-for-calm-in-ferguson/?#sp=show-clips> for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting -- and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening. But the latest protests had a light, almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd, more akin to a parade or block party.

The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell -- the point at which previous protests have grown tense -- no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.

Nixon appointed Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, to lead the police effort. Johnson, who grew up near Ferguson and commands a region that includes St. Louis County, marched alongside protesters Thursday, joined by other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol as well as the county department. The marchers also had a police escort.

""We're here to serve and protect,"" Johnson said. ""We're not here to instill fear.""",NA,26233,NA,NA

Several of the marchers stopped to shake hands with police and troopers, and some stopped to hug and chat with Capt. Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol, who is overseeing security. The scene stood in stark contrast to clashes earlier this week when officers wore riot gear. 

The latest protests had a light, almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd, more akin to a parade or block party. The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell --the point at which previous protests have grown tense -- no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.

""You can feel it. You can see it,"" protester Cleo Willis said of the change. ""Now it's up to us to ride that feeling.""

 ""All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,"" said Pedro Smith, 41, who has participated in the nightly protests. ""This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect.""

Gov. Jay Nixon announced Thursday that Johnson would oversee security after the local police response to the violent protests drew heavy criticism. Crowds have gathered since Saturday's shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Nixon said the change is intended to make sure ""that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately.""

Johnson, who is black, said he grew up in the community and ""it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence.""

""Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,"" Nixon said at a news conference.

On Sunday night, some residents were seen looting stores, damaging buildings and vandalizing property. Since then, officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" a reference to witness accounts that Brown had his hands raised when he was shot.

Police have used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse large crowds, including on Wednesday night when some people threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers. {Video footage released}<hyperlink=http://video.foxnews.com/v/3729618464001/tensions-in-missouri-escalate-after-shooting-of-black-teen/?#sp=show-clips> from the dark streets resembled images usually reserved for warzones.

Nixon, who has faced increasing criticism over suggestions he has not done enough to calm tensions, said local police will still be involved in providing security, but under state supervision.

Earlier Thursday, President Obama said that law enforcement officials on the ground should not be arresting journalists and allow protesters to form peacefully, but said protesters should not target police officers.

""I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,"" Obama said. ""But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.""

Obama, speaking from the Massachusetts island where he's on a two-week vacation, said there was no excuse for excessive force by police in the aftermath of the shooting. He said he had asked the Justice Department and FBI to investigate the incident.

""There is never an excuse for violence against police or those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" Obama said. He also urged police transparency in the investigation, which has been criticized by protesters.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said officers on Wednesday night tossed tear gas to disperse a large crowd of protesters after some threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers. More than 10 people were arrested in Ferguson.

""In talking to these guys, it is scary,"" Schellman said of officers on the front lines of the protest. ""They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.""

Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control — a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police force took over, leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the smaller city's request.

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said his officers have responded with ""an incredible amount of restraint"" as they've had rocks and bottles thrown at them, been shot at and had two dozen patrol vehicles destroyed.

The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others. The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said later that the name was incorrect.

Twitter quickly suspended the Anonymous account that posted the officer's purported identity and personal information. The site's code of conduct strictly forbids the publication of private and confidential information without permission.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

The officer involved was injured, with one side of his face swollen, Jackson said.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told reporters that the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

FoxNews,fox5,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/11/fbi-opens-investigation-into-fatal-shooting-unarmed-black-teenager-in-suburban/,Michael Brown shooting: FBI opens inquiry into case ,The Associated Press ,08/11/2014,10/26/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. –  The FBI opened an investigation Monday into the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager whose death stirred a night of unrest in a St. Louis suburb.

Michael Brown, 18, was shot multiple times Saturday after an altercation with a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, police said. But it was unclear whether Brown or a man he was with was involved in the scuffle, and authorities were vague about what led an officer to open fire.

The FBI is looking into possible civil rights violations arising from the shooting, said Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI's St. Louis field office. She said the FBI would be investigating regardless of the public attention surrounding the matter.

“The shooting incident in Ferguson, Missouri, this weekend deserves a fulsome review,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement, adding. attorneys from the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office also had joined the investigation.

Dorian Johnson told WALB-TV that he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of his car.

Johnson said the officer fired, and he and Brown were scared and ran away.

""He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,"" Johnson said. ""But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""

""We wasn't causing harm to nobody,"" Johnson told the television station. ""We had no weapons on us at all.""

The race of the officer was not disclosed. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.

The St. Louis County Police Department refused to discuss Johnson's remarks, citing the ongoing investigation. But Police Chief Jon Belmar previously said that an officer encountered Brown and another man outside a Ferguson apartment complex, and that one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled.

Nearly three dozen people were arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night after crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted officers who tried to block access to parts of the city.

Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used Brown's death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.

""Most came here for a peaceful protest, but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. ... I can understand the anger and unrest, but I can't understand the violence and looting,"" Trout said.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said 32 people were arrested for various offenses, including assault, burglary and theft. Two officers suffered minor injuries, and there were no reports of civilians hurt.

Several businesses were looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People also took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer and carted rims away from a tire store.

Some climbed atop police cars as the officers with riot shields and batons stood stoically nearby, trying to restrict access to the most endangered areas.

A spokeswoman for St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said tear gas had been used.

Mayor James Knowles said a small group of people was ""creating a huge mess.""

The unrest, he added, was ""only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.""

Speaking at a press conference Monday, Brown's father, also named Michael Brown, said his son would have deplored the violence that seized the city on Sunday.

""He wouldn't have wanted any of it,"" Brown said. ""But we need justice for our son.""

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV that there's no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but has not yet put to use.

The second person has not been arrested or charged, and it was not clear if he was armed, Jackson said. Blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him for toxicology tests, which can take weeks to complete.

Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting ""Don't shoot me"" while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase until the crowd eventually left. A similar protest that attracted about 250 people was held Monday morning.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she did not understand why police did not subdue her son with a club or stun gun. She said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,"" she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

Brown's family planned to speak later Monday at a news conference with their attorney, Benjamin Crump, who also represented Martin's family.

John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP, said the group was ""outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement.""

""There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,"" Obama said. 

The president spoke at the White House briefing room late Monday, during a pause in the capital from his vacation in Martha's Vineyard. As he has before, Obama walked a fine line in addressing the sustained violence and unrest in the St. Louis suburb over the killing of an unarmed black man by a police officer. 

He said most demonstrators are protesting peacefully, but said a ""small minority"" are not. To those looting and attacking officers, Obama said their behavior ""undermines, rather than [advances] justice."" 

Obama also said ""there's no excuse for excessive force by police."" 

Noting that the Justice Department has opened a federal civil rights probe into the shooting death, he said Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with FBI and DOJ officials on the ground, and local leaders. 

But he also touched on what has become a controversial topic, in Washington and local communities across the country -- the alleged ""militarization"" of local police forces. 

The concerns are connected to a U.S. military program that gives away free military gear to local law enforcement (including those in the St. Louis suburb). According to the Defense Department, a total of 8,000 agencies at all levels of government participate in the so-called 1033 program. Since its start in 1997, the program has transferred more than $4.3 billion in equipment to these agencies. Last year, nearly $450 million worth was transferred. 

Some lawmakers, on both sides of the aisle, have questioned the program in the wake of the Ferguson unrest. 

Obama said the program has provided some useful supplies to local agencies, including radios and equipment to respond to chemical attacks. 

But he added: ""I think it's probably useful for us to review how the funding has gone, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars to make sure that what they're purchasing is stuff that they actually need."" 

Obama said he thinks there will be ""bipartisan interest in re-examining some of those programs."" 

Obama, meanwhile, expressed sympathy for the ""passions and anger"" sparked by the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, but said giving in to that anger through looting and attacks on police only stirs tensions and leads to further chaos. He said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to ""listen and not just shout."" 

""That's how we're going to move forward together, by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. ""We're going to have to hold tight to those values."" 

Obama had a round of meetings in Washington on Monday, amid some criticism over his vacation schedule. He was briefed by Holder on the events in Missouri. 

The meetings came as conditions in Ferguson deteriorated. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon lifted a curfew but ordered the National Guard to step in to help restore order. Holder over the weekend ordered a federal medical examiner to perform a third autopsy on the teenager. 

Obama said he has told Gov. Nixon he wants to ensure the use of the National Guard must be limited in scope, and said he would be monitoring that operation in the coming days to see whether the guard's involvement was helping or hurting. ",NA,2336,NA,Facebook: 1796 Twitter: 540

FoxNews,fox8,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/12/police-use-tear-gas-on-demonstrators-in-missouri-town-rocked-by-unarmed-teen/,Police use tear gas on demonstrators in Missouri town rocked by unarmed teen's shooting,The Associated Press ,08/11/2014,10/26/2015,"Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds near a burned-out convenience store in St. Louis suburb as a second day of protests over the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager turned violent. 

The store had been damaged on Sunday night, when many businesses in the town of Ferguson, Mo. were looted following a vigil calling for a full investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown. 

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said members of the crowd threw rocks at police and gunfire came from the crowd, so officers used tear gas and shot ""beanbag rounds"" meant to stun them. St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said there were at least five arrests and no reports of looting.

An Associated Press photographer said police were telling people to go home, but authorities had blocked exit streets off. Jackson said police blocked off the area where most of the looting and vandalism occurred the previous night out of concern that cars passing by might hit demonstrators in the street.

Two men who said they had witnessed the shooting Saturday afternoon said that Brown had his hands raised when the officer approached with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly. Authorities were vague about exactly what led the officer to open fire on Brown, except to say that the shooting was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man. It was unclear whether Brown or the man he was with was involved in the altercation.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar previously said that an officer encountered Brown and another man outside an apartment complex, and that one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled over the officer's weapon.

But Phillip Walker told the Associated Press that he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.

Brown ""was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,"" Walker said Monday. The officer ""had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times."" The officer then ""stood over him and shot him"" after the victim fell wounded.

Dorian Johnson offered a similar account when he told {KMOV-TV}<hyperlink=http://www.kmov.com/> that he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of the vehicle.

Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away.

""He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,"" Johnson said. ""But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""

""We wasn't causing harm to nobody,"" Johnson said. ""We had no weapons on us at all.""

The officer's identity has not been revealed, but he has been placed on paid administrative leave. Jackson said there's no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex or from any police dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but has not yet put to use. 

Brown's parents and their attorneys asked the public to share any information and videos they might have related to the shooting.

The family had planned to drop their son off at a technical college Monday to begin his studies.

""Instead of celebrating his future, they are having to plan his funeral,"" said Benjamin Crump, a family attorney who also represented Trayvon Martin's relatives after he was slain in 2012 in Florida.

""I don't want to sugarcoat it,"" Crump added. Brown ""was executed in broad daylight.""

Crump and some civil rights leaders drew comparisons between Brown's death and that of Martin and other young black men killed in racially charged incidents.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she did not understand why police did not subdue her son with a club or stun gun. She said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted, adding that ""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty.""

The FBI is looking into possible civil rights violations, said Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the agency's St. Louis field office.

Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement that the case deserves a full review.

Nearly three dozen people were arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night after crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted and threatened reporters and taunted officers.

National NAACP President Cornell William Brooks implored residents Monday to ""turn your anger into action"" while condemning a violent response to Brown's death.

""To sneak around under the cover of darkness, to steal, to loot, to burn down your neighborhood -- this does not require courage,"" he said. ""Courage is when you strive for justice.""

""Martin Luther King did not live and die so that we may steal and lie in the middle of the night,"" he added.

Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they used Brown's death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.

""I can understand the anger and unrest, but I can't understand the violence and looting,"" Trout said.

Some people climbed atop police cars as officers with riot shields and batons stood stoically nearby, trying to restrict access to the most endangered areas.

FoxNews,fox11,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/19/potential-charges-against-suburban-st-louis-police-officer-who-shot-killed/,"Potential charges against suburban St. Louis police officer who shot, killed Michael Brown ",Pete Yost,08/19/2014,10/26/2015,"CHICAGO –  A Missouri grand jury could begin hearing evidence as soon as Wednesday to determine whether any charges should be filed against a white suburban police officer who fatally shot unarmed black 18-year-old Michael Brown.

State prosecutors are wading through contradictory narratives as they decide which account to present. Federal authorities also could take legal action against Officer Darren Wilson, especially if they decide their state counterparts are drawing the wrong conclusions.

Here's a look at some of the legal issues:

___

What state charges could Wilson face?

Although the stiffest possible charge is first-degree murder, which can carry the death penalty, legal experts say that's highly unlikely. It would require proof Wilson plotted to kill Brown, said Peter Joy, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. ""It'd have to be a cold and deliberate killing — almost execution style,"" he said.

If Wilson is charged, a more likely option could be second-degree murder, which is often applied to killings that occur after someone hastily draws a knife in the heat of a fight. Unlike in first-degree murder, the second-degree charge doesn't require evidence of premeditation. Two lesser but still-serious charges are voluntarily or involuntary manslaughter, which would follow a finding Wilson acted recklessly or negligently in causing Brown's death.

___

How critical is motive?

It's extremely important to the case. Prosecutors essentially have to get inside Wilson's head, said Anders Walker, a professor at Saint Louis University School of Law. Did he fire in a fit of racially charged anger, perhaps subjecting him to second-degree murder? ""They have to decide what the officer was thinking,"" Walker said. ""A lot hinges on that.""

___

Are there other relevant state laws?

Yes. One is called ""defense of justification law,"" which provides some legal leeway for officers to shoot suspects they believe are fleeing a serious crime and refusing to surrender, Joy said. In this case, some witnesses say Brown was surrendering. And police have said Wilson didn't know Brown was a robbery suspect. Wilson could try to argue the crime Brown was fleeing wasn't the robbery; he could contend the crime was Brown pushing or hitting Wilson.

___

What's the role of autopsy results?

Bullet wounds to the back of Brown's body could render incredulous any theory Wilson killed Brown from fear for his life, Joy explains. If all of the bullets entered went through the front of Brown's body at close range, that could support claims Wilson fired in a struggle.

___

Could prosecutors opt not to charge Wilson with anything?

Yes, if they conclude he acted in self-defense. But, Joy said, prosecutors do have to account for the fact someone died one way or another. That means it's unlikely they'd decide on a relatively minor charge, such as assault. ""It's likely you're going to have the state charge him with murder or manslaughter — or nothing at all,"" Joy said.

___

What charges could federal authorities pursue?

Bringing a murder charge isn't among their options. They could charge Wilson with a criminal civil rights violation, which carries a maximum life sentence, said Joel Bertocchi, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago. They'd have to show Wilson, perhaps out of racial bias, deprived Brown of his civil rights by killing him.

It could take months or even a year for the feds to decide, said Samuel Bagenstos, a former Justice Department official. It would hardly be the first time they took such action under the statute, called ""Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law."" The Rodney King case was brought under these post-Civil War federal laws protecting civil rights.

And in the first four years of Barack Obama's presidency, the Justice Department brought more than 250 such cases.",NA,53,NA,NA

Lieb,08/18/2014,10/27/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. –  A Missouri teenager fatally shot by police suffered a bullet wound to his right arm that may indicate his hands were up or his back was turned to the shooter, but ""we don't know,"" a pathologist hired by the teen's family said Monday.

An independent autopsy determined that 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, according to the hired pathologists and the family's attorneys. Brown was shot Aug. 9 in Ferguson, touching off a week of rancorous protests in the St. Louis suburb. Police have used riot gear and tear gas, and the governor called in the National Guard early Monday to help.

Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells, who assisted former New York City chief medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden during the autopsy, said a bullet graze wound on Brown's right arm could have occurred in several ways. He said the teen may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position.

""We don't know,"" he said. ""We still have to look at the other (elements) of this investigation before we start piecing things together.""

Witnesses have said Brown had his hands raised above his head when he was repeatedly shot in a street in Ferguson, where the death has heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white police department.

Another protest quickly deteriorated Sunday night as marchers pushed toward one end of a street, and authorities — who said they were responding to reports of gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails — pushed them back with tear gas.

The streets were empty before a state-imposed midnight curfew, but hours later, Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the National Guard to Ferguson. It was unclear when the troops may arrive.

""These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served and to feel safe in their own homes,"" Nixon said in a statement.

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death, but it's unclear how long it may take, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney.

Family attorney Benjamin Crump said Brown's parents wanted the additional autopsy because they feared results of the county's examination could be biased. Crump declined to release copies of the report to the media, and the county's autopsy report has not been released.

""They could not trust what was going to be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child,"" he said during Monday's news conference with Parcells and Baden, who has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

The second autopsy, Crump said, ""verifies that the witness accounts were true: that he was shot multiple times.""

Baden said one of the bullets entered the top of Brown's skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when he suffered that fatal injury. The pathologists said Brown, who also was shot four times in the right arm, could have survived the other bullet wounds.

Baden also said there was no gun-power residue on Brown's body, indicating he was not shot at close range. However, Baden said he did not have access to Brown's clothing, and that it was possible the residue could be on the clothing.

Crump also noted that Brown had abrasions on his face from where he fell to the ground, but there was ""otherwise no evidence of a struggle.""",NA,22,NA,NA

Attorneys for the family of Brown, who was shot dead Aug. 9 in a confrontation with police in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, held a news conference Monday to unveil a report by Dr. Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner for New York City. Baden's autopsy, commissioned by the family, determined that Brown was shot six times, with the fatal wound striking the top of his head.

“We believe given those kinds of facts this officer should have been arrested,” Attorney Daryl Parks said.

But Baden, who was at the news conference and also spoke, said he had not concluded whether the fatal entry wound's position meant Brown was surrendering to Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson when he was killed. Baden said the entry wound atop Brown's skull suggested his head was bent forward when he suffered the fatal injury, and earlier told The New York Times it could be consistent with either surrender or charging at the officer.

A pathologist who works with Baden said Parks' conclusion could be correct, ""but we don't know.""

Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells said Brown may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position.

Lawyer Benjamin Crump said Monday that the independent autopsy shows Brown was shot at least six times. But, like Baden, he stressed that the report was preliminary.

A St. Louis County autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times.

County medical examiner's office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday the autopsy showed Michael Brown was hit in the head and chest. McCune would not confirm whether Brown was hit elsewhere on his body or discuss other details.

A person familiar with the {county investigation told The Washington Post}<hyperlink=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/18/county-investigation-michael-brown-was-shot-from-the-front-had-marijuana-in-his-system/> that Brown had marijuana in his system. 

Full findings of the autopsy aren't expected for about two weeks.

Baden, who has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson trial, said earlier Monday he was awaiting information from the St. Louis County autopsy -- and other scientific studies -- before making final conclusions about the manner in which Brown died.

Crump said the family wanted the additional autopsy because they feared results of the county's examination could be biased. Crump declined to release copies of the report to the media, and the county's autopsy report has not been released.

""They could not trust what was going to be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child,"" he said during Monday's news conference.

He said Brown's mother ""had the question any mother would have: Was my child in pain? Dr. Baden shared with her, in his opinion, he did not suffer."" He also noted that Brown had abrasions on his face from where he fell to the ground, but ""otherwise no evidence of a struggle.""

Meanwhile, a Missouri grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday regarding Brown’s shooting death.

Ed Magee, a spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch – who is overseeing the case -- said Monday that prosecutors would try to start presenting evidence Wednesday, the regular once-a-week meeting date for the grand jury.

Cases often are presented to grand jurors in a single day. But Magee says Brown's case is complicated and will take longer, though he gave no specific timeline.",NA,900,NA,NA

Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson told reporters in Ferguson early Tuesday that 31 people had been arrested during a night of unrest that followed a day of largely peaceful protest. As Johnson spoke, two handguns and a Molotov cocktail that he said had been confiscated during the night by authorities lay on a table in front of him. 

The majority-black town of approximately 21,000 has been roiled by unrest since the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by a white police officer following a confrontation of some kind on the afternoon of August 9. Local authorities have fired tear gas and smoke canisters on an almost daily basis at protesters upset with the response to the shootings by Ferguson Police.

A visibly angry Johnson said that officers had come under heavy gunfire from protesters and at least two people had been shot. Johnson said he did not know the condition of the shooting victims. Four officers had been injured when they were struck by rocks or bottles, though Johnson claimed that police had not fired a single shot.  

Citing what he called a ""dangerous dynamic in the night,"" Johnson requested that protests take place during the daylight hours, so that officers could effectively isolate any troublemakers. However, Johnson said that his forces could not make protesters leave the streets after sunset if they did not want to. 

""This nation is watching each and every one of us,"" said Johnson. ""I am not going to let the criminals that have come here from across this country, or live in this neighborhood, define this community."" Johnson added that some of those who had been arrested overnight had come from as far afield as New York and California. The trooper also directed his wrath at the assembled media, saying that they had put themselves and officers in danger by failing to clear areas when asked before imploring them to ""not glamorize the acts of criminals.""

""We do not want to lose another life in this community,"" Johnson added.

Shortly before midnight local time, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that police fired tear gas at a group of protesters who had reportedly defied orders to leave the parking lot of a burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that has been near the center of demonstrations over the past eight day. St. Louis County Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters that shots had been fired in the area and media members were told to go to a designated area about a quarter of a mile away. 

Late Monday, reporters estimated that the number of protesters had dropped to around 100, far fewer than the number of media members who were covering them.

A photographer for the Getty photo agency was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released. Two German reporters were arrested and detained for three hours. Conservative German daily Die Welt said correspondent Ansgar Graw and reporter Frank Herrmann, who writes for German regional papers, were arrested after allegedly failing to follow police instructions to vacate an empty street. They said they followed police orders.

At his news conference, Johnson said in some cases it was not immediately clear who was a reporter but that once it was established, police acted properly.

As darkness fell, National Guard units with armored vehicles were waiting at a staging area about a half-mile from the portion of West Florissant Avenue that has been the scene of the largest protests. Closer to the protest site, a crowd of demonstrators was marching and growing in size. Sheriff's deputies in body armor and state troopers carrying wooden bats and gas masks stood watch over the group.

The Post-Dispatch reported that some protesters began throwing bottles at police shortly after 10 p.m. local time. Authorities responded by ordering protesters to clear the streets and firing high-pitched sound cannons. 

Another group of protesters marched toward the police lines and stopped, defying orders that demonstrators could not assemble in a single spot, but had to keep moving instead. The Post-Dispatch reported that an armored vehicle moved down the street trying to clear the crowd and a group of pastors locked arms and helped to move protesters away from the police line. 

In federal court earlier Monday, a judge denied a request from the American Civil Liberties Union for a restraining order that would have prevented authorities from enforcing the no-stopping rule.

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney.

The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday. But she declined further comment, saying the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.

Lawyers for Brown's family and hired pathologists said an independent autopsy determined that Brown was shot six times, including twice in the head. 

 Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells, who assisted former New York City chief medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden during the private autopsy, said a bullet grazed Brown's right arm. He said the wound indicates Brown may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position across his chest or face.

""We don't know,"" Parcells said. ""We still have to look at the other (elements) of this investigation before we start piecing things together.""

A third and final autopsy was performed Monday for the Justice Department by one of the military's most experienced medical examiners, Attorney General Eric Holder said. Holder was scheduled to travel to Ferguson later this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death.

Due to the unrest, the Ferguson-Florissant School District announced late Monday that classes would be canceled for the remainder of the week. Students were due to return from summer vacation last week, but were held out due to the unrest. ",NA,18349,NA,NA

In these kinds of tinderbox situations, the right generally lines up behind the police and the left pounces on the police state.

But this time is different. A split is emerging among conservative commentators and politicians, some of whom are troubled by the way local police departments have bulked up until they resemble military units.

The tragedy of a white police officer shooting an unarmed black teenager—at least six times, we now know from a private autopsy on Michael Brown first leaked to the New York Times—was followed by a series of protests that turned violent. In the early days, the local force was widely viewed as overreacting, which is why Missouri’s governor installed a new commander who adopted a softer tone. The looting and anarchy that followed a curfew imposed last weekend shifted the spotlight from the police response to the anger-fueled agitators. And that will take on a new layer with Gov. Jay Nixon yesterday calling out the National Guard.

President Obama tackled the issue at a news conference yesterday. While some of the post-9/11 buildup to combat potential terrorism has been helpful, he said, ""I think it’s probably useful for us to review how the funding has gone, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars, to make sure that what they’re purchasing is stuff that they actually need. Because, you know, there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred."" Obama expressed his concern without taking a strong stand, settling for a ""review."" 

Crime has been a conservative issue since the days that Richard Nixon ran on “law and order” and some radicals called police officers pigs. When police conduct has been at issue—Birmingham in 1963, Chicago in 1968, Los Angeles and Rodney King in 1992—the fiery criticism has come from the left.

The most striking development in the conservative movement these days is that Big Government can also include law enforcement, its growth fueled by federal largesse.

Rand Paul, the potential presidential candidate with a strong libertarian streak, registered his objections in a {Time}<hyperlink=http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/> piece:

“Big government has been at the heart of the problem,” the Kentucky senator says. “Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement…

“When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.

“Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them.”

It sounds like something a liberal lawmaker might write.

Ross Douthat, the conservative {New York Times}<hyperlink=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-playing-soldier-in-the-suburbs.html?_r=1> columnist, traces the history of the buildup:

“In the name of local preparedness, Washington has been bestowing antiterror grants and Pentagon surplus on communities barely touched by major crime, let alone by terrorism. Tanks and aircraft, helmets and armor, guns and grenade launchers have flowed to police departments from Des Moines (home of two $180,000 {bomb-disarming robots}<hyperlink=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/12/20/local-cops-ready-for-war-with-homeland-security-funded-military-weapons.html>) to Keene, N.H.

“And it’s a path to potential disaster, for cops and citizens alike. The ‘S’ in SWAT was there for a reason: Militarized tactics that are potentially useful in specialized circumstances — like firefights with suicidal terrorist groups — can be counterproductive when employed for crowd-control purposes by rank-and-file cops.” 

One of the staunchest conservatives around, RedState founder {Erick Erickson,}<hyperlink=http://www.redstate.com/2014/08/18/ferguson-is-not-binary/> takes aim at local police:

“It is perfectly fine to think Mr. Brown was no saint, the rioters should be punished, and in addition to both of those, to think the police in Ferguson, MO behaved badly too,"" the Fox News contributor says. ""Before rioting even began the police in Ferguson decided to behave like soldiers instead of police…

“Police do a good and necessary job. But if power corrupts men and absolute power corrupts absolutely, we should be wary of putting our neighborhood man in blue in camouflage, a helmet, and an AR-15 inside an armored personnel carrier except in the most serious of circumstances…

“No conservative is saying police do not need to be able to outshoot and out arm the bad guys. But many of us are saying police are more quickly than ever before resorting to playing soldier when they could accomplish the same as just a policeman.”

Not all conservative subscribe to this view, of course. But there is a healthy debate taking shape, driven by the right and the firepower on display in a small Missouri town.",1086,444,NA,NA

Between {two nights of unrest,}<hyperlink=http://video.foxnews.com/v/3725873684001/rioting-breaks-out-in-wake-of-police-shooting/?#sp=show-clips> a community forum hosted by the local NAACP chapter Monday night drew hundreds to a sweltering church in Ferguson, the nearly 70 percent black St. Louis County suburb where an unarmed 18-year-old, Michael Brown, was shot multiple times by a police officer.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said a large crowd that gathered throughout Monday at the site of a burned-out convenience store turned rowdy at nightfall, throwing rocks at police. Officers used tear gas and shot ""beanbag rounds"" meant to stun them, he said.

Fox2Now.com {reported}<hyperlink=http://fox2now.com/2014/08/11/protesters-at-quiktrip-on-west-florissant-approach-police-line/> that one person was taken to the hospital for injuries sustained from a rubber bullet. Photographs from the scene showed police wearing helmets and dressed like SWAT teams.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said there were at least five arrests and no reports of looting. Nearly three dozen people were arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night when crowds burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers.

""People are tired. They have reached the end of their rope,"" said Ruth Latchison Nichols after the NAACP forum, where many more were left waiting outside once the pews reached capacity. ""Enough is enough. This is a state of emergency.""

National NAACP President Cornell William Brooks implored residents to ""turn your anger into action"" while condemning the violent response to Brown's death.

""To sneak around under the cover of darkness, to steal, to loot, to burn down your neighborhood -- this does not require courage,"" he said. ""Courage is when you strive for justice.""

""Martin Luther King did not live and die so that we may steal and lie in the middle of the night,"" he added.

The FBI has opened an investigation into Brown's death, looking into possible {civil rights violations.}<hyperlink=http://video.foxnews.com/v/3725037669001/protests-over-st-louis-teens-death-erupt-into-riots/?#sp=show-clips> Witnesses have said that Brown had his hands raised when the unidentified officer approached with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly.

Brown's parents have been among those calling for calm. His family, who had planned to drop him off at a technical college Monday to begin his studies, have asked people to share any information and videos they might have related to the shooting.

Authorities have been vague about what led the officer to open fire, saying only that the shooting -- which is being investigated by the St. Louis County police at the smaller city's request -- was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man in which the officer's weapon discharged once inside a patrol car.

Investigators have refused to publicly disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave. But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.

Brown ""was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,"" Walker told The Associated Press. The officer ""had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times."" The officer then ""stood over him and shot him"" after the victim fell wounded.

Dorian Johnson offered a similar account, telling KMOV-TV that he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of the vehicle.

Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away.

""He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,"" Johnson said. ""But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""

""We wasn't causing harm to nobody,"" Johnson said. ""We had no weapons on us at all.""

Walker said that he did not see a scuffle or the circumstances that preceded the first gunshot.

Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, said there's no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex or from any police dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but has not yet put to use.

Some civil rights leaders have drawn comparisons between Brown's death and that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder charges.

""Instead of celebrating his future, they are having to plan his funeral,"" said Benjamin Crump, a family attorney who also represented Martin's relatives after he was slain in 2012 in Florida.

LOUIS –  For nearly a week, the police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, has been a shadowy figure — nameless, faceless and seemingly shielded from the fury that has filled the streets of the town he was sworn to protect.

On Friday, the community finally learned his name — Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white officer who has spent the last six years patrolling the St. Louis suburbs, drawing praise from his boss.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson provided the name and said Wilson had not been the focus of any public complaints. He declined to offer many details about Wilson's life or career but commended his police record and his demeanor.

""He was a gentle, quiet man,"" Jackson said. ""He was a distinguished officer. He is, has been, an excellent officer for the police department.""

Police said Wilson stopped 18-year-old Michael Brown and another young man last Saturday because they were walking down the middle of the street. He ordered them onto the sidewalk.

Authorities say one of the men pushed Wilson into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with him over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Wilson shot Brown multiple times, according to police.

Wilson is ""devastated"" by last weekend's events, the police chief said.

""He never intended for any of this to happen,"" Jackson added.

The killing touched off day after day of violent protests, which were met by an aggressive police response that included officers in riot gear pointing assault rifles, firing rubber bullets and unleashing tear gas. On Thursday, the governor ordered Missouri State Police to take over security in Ferguson. Within hours, the tension in the streets began to ease.

Wilson spent the first two years of his career with the police department in nearby Jennings, Missouri, before moving on to Ferguson for the past four years. Ferguson's police force is nearly all-white. The town's population is about 70 percent black.

Jackson had originally planned to release the name earlier in the week but delayed the announcement, citing safety concerns and death threats against the officer.

St. Louis County police and the FBI are conducting separate investigations.

The St. Louis County prosecutor said it will probably be weeks before a decision is made on whether to charge Wilson with a crime.",NA,28,NA,NA

Big universities and small colleges alike are taking extreme security measures, from setting up elaborate networks of security cameras to purchasing urban-warfare vehicles and semi-automatic rifles.

In 2013, the campus police at The Ohio State University procured a Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicle (MRAP), according to {the Daily Caller.}<hyperlink=http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/17/the-cops-at-ohio-state-have-an-armored-fighting-vehicle-now/> The vehicle, which school officials noted was “acquired at no cost from military surplus,” has a gun turret on the roof and is designed to stave off ambushes and roll over improvised explosive devices. OSU was also the first agency in the state to acquire an MRAP at the time.

Around the nation, officers from campus agencies across the country have been receiving SWAT-style training since 2007. In addition, many of the agencies are acquiring weapons directly from the Department of Defense.

Evidence of beefed up college police arsenals was also seen in 2011, during the height of the “Occupy Wall Street” protests when camps cops at UC Davis in Northern California were seen controlling the crowd in full riot gear. A year later, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte appointed its own SWAT team, outfitted with MP-15 rifles, M&P .40 caliber pistols and shotguns.

According to {federal data}<hyperlink=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cle0405.pdf> from 2008, nine out of 10 college policing agencies employ sworn police officers and have armed patrols with the authorization to use deadly force if need be.

Last December, one such example of deadly force was used by a campus officer at the University of the Incarnate Word, a Catholic college in San Antonio. Senior student Robert Redus was fatally shot by a campus officer after he tried to grab his baton during a traffic stop.

Jackson said at an afternoon press conference that Brown and his friend were stopped Saturday ""because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.""

The robbery ""was not related to the initial contact"" between the officer and Brown, he said.

Jackson said the officer involved in the shooting -- identified as Darren Wilson -- had gone to the area after a 911 call reporting the robbery. He says a dispatcher gave a description of the suspect, and that Wilson encountered Brown a few minutes before another officer arrived.

The announcement was met with anger by community members who insisted Brown wasn't the man seen in a security camera video of the robbery.

""I am incensed,"" Laura Keys, 50, told {The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.}<hyperlink=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-officer-who-shot-michael-brown-identified-brown-named-as/article_52c40b84-ad90-5f9a-973c-70d628d0be04.html> ""I can't believe this is the tactic they are using, bringing up a robbery to make the victim look like he was the person who created this whole mess.""

Dorian Johnson, the friend who was with Brown when he was shot and killed by a police officer over the weekend, reportedly confirmed that he and Brown had taken part in the {theft of cigars}<hyperlink=http://video.foxnews.com/v/3732083868001/> from a convenience store that day. But police have determined that Johnson was not involved in the robbery and will not seek charges against him, Jackson said.

Brown's uncle says if Wilson really had believed Brown was a suspect, he wouldn't have just told him to get out of the street. Either way, he says, it doesn't justify the shooting.

The attorney representing Brown's family, Benjamin Crump, said Brown's parents are ""incensed"" by what he calls ""the old game of smoke and mirrors."" He says the family was blind-sided by Friday's announcement.

Crump says ""it's bad enough they assassinated him, and now they're trying to assassinate his character.""

The police chief described Wilson as ""a gentle, quiet man"" who had been ""an excellent officer."" He has been on the Ferguson force for four years. Prior to that, he patrolled in the neighboring community of Jennings, Jackson said.

Wilson, who was placed on administrative after the Aug. 9 shooting, ""never intended for any of this to happen,"" Jackson said.

Police reports released Friday under an open-records request showed that at 11:51 a.m. on the day of the shooting, authorities received a 911 call reporting a robbery at the Ferguson Market. An unidentified officer was dispatched to the store, arriving within three minutes. The officer interviewed an employee and customer, who gave a description of a man who stole the cigars and walked off with another man toward a QuikTrip store.

Descriptions of the suspect were broadcast over the police radio. The officer did not find the suspects either on the street or at the Quik Trip, the reports said.

Separately, Wilson had been responding to a nearby call involving a sick 2-month child from 11:48 am until noon, when he left that place. A minute later, he encountered Michael Brown walking down Canfield Drive. The documents contained no description of what happened between Brown and Wilson.

Gov. Jay Nixon assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol, stripping that authority from the St. Louis County Police Department.

He appointed Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, to lead the police effort. Johnson, who grew up near Ferguson and commands a region that includes St. Louis County, marched alongside protesters Thursday, joined by other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol as well as the county department. The marchers also had a police escort.

One of the owners, with a large black gun resting on his shoulder, told the station that police were lined up blocks from the looting, and did not engage looters making off with large boxes from these stores.

""There's no police,"" he said. ""We trusted the police to keep it peaceful; they didn't do their job.""

Former St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch tweeted: ""You did not see ""police restraint"" overnight. You saw police reluctant to act. We cannot keep stoning the keepers at the gate.""

Just before midnight, some in what had been a large and rowdy but mostly well-behaved crowd broke in a convenience store that police accused 18-year-old Michael Brown of robbing minutes before he was fatally shot by an officer, and began looting it, said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson.

Some in the crowd of about 200 began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Johnson said. One officer was hurt but details on the injury were not immediately available.

Johnson said police backed off to try and ease the tension. No arrests were made.

""We had to evaluate the security of the officers there and also the rioters,"" Johnson said. ""We just felt it was better to move back.""

Meanwhile, peaceful protesters yelled at the aggressors to stop what they were doing. About a dozen people eventually blocked off the front of the convenience store to help protect it.

Friday marked a resurgence of unrest that had momentarily abated after Gov. Jay Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol Thursday. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrates. 

The violence erupted after a day that included {authorities identifying the officer}<hyperlink=http://video.foxnews.com/v/3732133313001/police-release-surveillance-video-of-strong-arm-robbery/?#sp=show-clips> who fatally shot Brown on Aug. 9.

The released surveillance video shows a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store's door. A police report alleges Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and ""forcefully pushed him back"" into a display rack.

Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, did not know the teen was a robbery suspect at the time of the shooting and stopped Brown and a companion ""because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic,"" Jackson said Friday. Police said they found evidence of the stolen merchandise on Brown's body.

Wilson is a six-year police veteran -- two in neighboring Jennings and four in Ferguson -- and had no previous complaints filed against him, Jackson said, describing him as ""a gentle, quiet man"" who had been ""an excellent officer.""

Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up.

Jackson's decision to spell out the allegations that Brown committed the robbery, and his releasing of surveillance video, angered attorneys for Brown's family and many in the community, including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay.

Earlier Friday night, the Democratic congressman took a bullhorn and told protesters, ""They have attempted to taint the investigation. They are trying to influence a jury pool by the stunt they pulled today.""

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said police ""are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style"" killing, said Crump, who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley on Friday asked Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster to take over the case, saying he did not believe McCulloch could be objective. Koster said Missouri law does not allow it unless McCulloch opts out. McCulloch spokesman Ed Magee said McCulloch has no plans to surrender the case.

FoxNews,fox29,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/16/ferguson-police-chief-thomas-jackson-cedes-much-his-authority/,Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson cedes much of his authority ,The Associated Press ,08/16/2014,10/29/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. –  In less than a week, the nation's most embattled police chief has ceded much of his authority — first to county police and then to state troopers.

Thomas Jackson, the snowy haired leader of the Ferguson Police Department, has been the public face of the agency at the center of the violent protests over a white police officer's killing of an unarmed black teenager.

Jackson's leadership has drawn wide criticism, both for the aggressive police response to the protesters and for his agency's erratic and infrequent releases of key information.

""It's clear the Ferguson chief is overwhelmed by the magnitude of this incident,"" said Daniel Isom II, a retired St. Louis police chief who now teaches at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""He has been releasing information as he sees appropriate, but maybe not taking into consideration the impact of releasing that information.""

On Friday, Jackson identified the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown and simultaneously released store security video that police say shows the young man stealing a box of cigars and shoving a clerk only a short time before his death.

Protesters and members of Brown's family accused authorities of trying to deflect attention from the officer while smearing the dead teen's name.

""They want to take the heat off"" Wilson, said Randolf Scott, 55, of Ferguson. ""They're trying to do everything and anything they can to make this sound justified.""

Jackson spent more than 30 years with the St. Louis County Police Department before taking over the 53-officer force in Ferguson, a mostly black city of 21,000, four years ago.

While working for St. Louis County, he led a drug task force and was also a SWAT team supervisor, airplane and helicopter instructor pilot, undercover detective and hostage negotiator.

He lives in nearby Hazelwood, one of a cluster of small cities just north of St. Louis known collectively as North County.

Since the Aug. 9 shooting, the Ferguson chief has continually spoken of a desire to work with community members. He's described efforts to bolster minority hiring in a department with just three black officers. But he's also struggled to manage a local crisis that has turned into an international news story, with 24-hour media coverage and a community filled with both grief and rage.

After the shooting, Jackson asked county police to take the lead in both the investigation of the shooting and in crowd control at the protests.

On Thursday, the governor put the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of Ferguson security after local and county police used riot gear, tear gas and heavy artillery — which only seemed to inflame crowds of angry protesters.

Highway patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson said that he was not told ahead of time that Jackson would release the Ferguson officer's name or the information about Brown as a robbery suspect.

""I would have like to have been consulted,"" Johnson said Friday. ""I really can't tell you about the timing. I saw it on the news like everybody else.""

Jackson had planned to release the name of the officer who shot Brown on Tuesday but said he reversed course in response to a stream of death threats against officers, including Wilson.

Both he and St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch had warned earlier in the week that it could be several weeks before the officer's name was made public, pending possible review of the case by a grand jury to assess criminal charges.

It was unclear what has since changed since then. Jackson took no questions about the information he had just released at a morning news conference, and then struggled to explain his decision-making at a later news conference. He never directly addressed why the timing had changed.

The apparent disconnect between local and county police and state troopers is both inefficient and unnecessary, Isom said.

""There are several agencies involved in this endeavor,"" he said. ""It seems that everyone is on their own page. And that's not good for us moving forward.""",NA,447,NA,NA

FoxNews,fox36,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/08/19/ferguson-fury-activists-journalists-stuck-in-160s-racial-resentments.html,"Ferguson fury: Activists, journalists stuck in 1960s racial resentments ",Fred Siegel,08/19/2014,10/30/2015,"The American understanding of riots and racial violence was shaped a half-century ago, during the insurrections of the 1960s. To judge by the responses to the current rioting in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, little has changed since then. 

After riots have wrought their physical and psychic damage, some invariably declare that the unrest was constructive. 

Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman for Ferguson, rationalized that the events in Ferguson would benefit the entire metropolitan area because, she said, “St. Louis never has had its true race moment, where they had to confront this.” 

She was topped by Missouri Highway Patrol captain Ron Johnson, who has been leading the police response in Ferguson. Speaking to a unity rally at a local church, Johnson suggested that, somehow, Brown’s death was “going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.”

One rioter, who wouldn’t give his name, admitted that “If it wasn’t for the looting, we wouldn’t get the attention.” 

The virtue of disruption, academics and observers argue, is that it gives African-Americans a crisis with which to bargain. But after 50 years, what has this bargain achieved, except to cultivate a community that excels in resentment?

It’s not just African-Americans who are stuck in the sixties. Reporters are still seeking out the Kerner Commission’s white racists, who are ultimately to blame for all racial problems.

Historians and sociologists are offering structural explanations for the violence; whites in general, and small businesses in particular, have little to say but simply flee to safer climes. 

In Ferguson, after a week of unrest that included looting and rioting, we know very little about the incident that resulted in Michael Brown’s death, despite the release of the first pathology report. The officer involved is in seclusion and has given no public statements. The Grand Jury, should one be convened, will likely have only a vague picture of what happened.

When Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012, the media constructed a racial narrative around the case—especially NBC news, which doctored tapes of George Zimmerman’s 911 call. It wasn’t until much later that pictures were shown of Zimmerman’s dark-skinned, Peruvian mother. Had those pictures been publicized earlier, the public might have understood that Trayvon Martin’s tragic death was not an example of a Klan-like murder.

In Ferguson, the media’s preferred narrative—a “gentle giant” of a young black man gunned down for no reason by a racist cop—was short-circuited by a videotape, taken minutes before his death, depicting Michael Brown strong-arming a diminutive store clerk who’d caught him stealing a box of cigarillos. 

Deflated, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer described the video as a “smear.” Does he think the tape should have been suppressed? 

His CNN colleague Jake Tapper, just back from apologizing for Hamas in Gaza and justifiably angered by the misuse of military equipment to intimidate suburban civilians, subjected the state’s Democratic governor, Jay Nixon, to a vigorous grilling. Tapper suggested that Nixon had some atoning to do for his supposedly racist past before he could be relied on to take action in Ferguson. If only Tapper had been so hard-edged with Hamas.

Historian Colin Gordon has revived the old chestnut that the rioting owes to the failure of big cities to incorporate suburbs. The problem, argues Gordon, is that small towns and cities compete with each other to attract businesses. If they had higher taxes, it’s implied, they could afford to spend more on social services. But does anyone think that Ferguson would be better off incorporated into a dysfunctional St. Louis? The vast city of Los Angeles, with its 469 square miles (compared with St. Louis’s 69) saw two of the most violent “rebellions” of the last 50 years. What, in Gordon’s estimation, accounts for that?

Riots bring but one certainty—enormous economic and social costs. Businesses flee, taking jobs and tax revenues with them. Home values decline for all races, but particularly for blacks. Insurance costs rise and civic morale collapses. The black and white middle classes move out. Despite its busy port and enormous geographic assets, Newark, New Jersey has never fully recovered from its 1967 riot. This year, Newark elected as its mayor Ras Baraka, the son and political heir of Amiri Baraka—the intellectual inspiration for the 1967 unrest.

The story is similar in Detroit, which lost half its residents between 1967 and 2000. Civic authority was never restored after the late 1960s riots, which never really ended; they just continued in slow motion. “It got decided a long time ago in Detroit,” explained Adolph Mongo, advisor to the jailed former “hip-hop mayor,” Kwame Kilpatrick, that “the city belongs to the black man. The white man was a convenient target until there were no white men left in Detroit.” The upshot, explained Sam Riddle, an advisor to current congressman John Conyers, first elected in 1965, is that “the only difference between Detroit and the Third World in terms of corruption is that Detroit don’t have no goats in the streets.”

The grotesque pantomime of repression and redemption, riots and never-quite-achieved rewards, plays out time and again. The chaos in Ferguson is but the latest episode of this long, sad drama of resentment and revenge. 

The drama persists in part because so many journalists and academics, not to mention black activists, have so much invested in it. It’s the conceptual air that they breathe. Sadly, to paraphrase the philosopher Ernest Gellner, some failed practices cannot be the subject of reconsideration, because they already shape the way we think.

No doubt little will be learned from Ferguson. No doubt there will be more Fergusons.",NA,0,NA,NA

All eyes on Ferguson, Missouri, as violence erupts yet again. Police fired tear gas after bottles of Molotov cocktails were tossed into the crowd last night. Two people were shot, 31 more arrested following the clashes.

The chaos has forced Captain Ron Johnson to take a new tune, slamming criminals for the latest unrest.

CAPT. RON JOHNSON, MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL: We cannot have that. We do not want any citizen hurt. We don't want any officer hurt. When you are shooting in apartment complexes and children are laying in their bed in apartment complexes and bullets are flying through the air, the old saying on the streets as they say, a bullet has no name.

We do not want to lose another life in this community, and I am not going to let the criminals that have come out here from across the country or live in this community define this neighborhood and define what we're going to do to make it right.

PERINO: FOX News correspondent Mike Tobin and Steve Harrigan were front and center last night when things got out of hand.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Shots fired, shots fired. Yes, shots fired, and now, they are firing the tear gas. That smoke does have some tear gas in it, whew! That's in my eyes. A lot of tear gas. Whew! My face is on fire.

STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The dignified protesters went home at dusk. This is just child's play right now.

(EXPLETIVES DELETED)

HARRIGAN: I'm on TV right now.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't give a damn.

HARRIGAN: Uh-oh.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You all on TV. I don't care about this (EXPLETIVES DELETED)

HARRIGAN: I don't want to argue with you.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You told them this is just child's play? Who is the child playing with toys? That's them. Can you cite (ph) it? White.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: Steve Harrigan joins us now. Steve, last night looked intense. How did the rest of the night go and how did today shape up?

HARRIGAN: After that tear gas, things quieted down quite a bit just about 1:00 in the morning. And right now, today, as you can look around, it's a vastly different scene. We've got traffic moving through. Probably about 60 or 70 protesters in total really getting the shade there from the McDonald's building. It's about 90 degrees out here.

Things usually ebb and flow throughout the early afternoon, but then it gets little hectic at night. A lot of different groups have said, for today, they do not want their people out on the street protesting after dusk. So, there is a chance we could see a quiet night tonight, but we haven't seen that so far.

ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hey, Steve. It's Eric Bolling. So, there's been a lot of people reporting that there are 70 arrests, I believe. One of four are from a different place, Chicago, Detroit, Texas, some parts of Brooklyn as well. Have you noticed people coming from other places to protest, and/or are they also there to do looting and rioting at night?

HARRIGAN: Seventy-eight arrests last night. Of those arrests, only about three or four from this town of Ferguson. A lot from Missouri, but as you correctly point out some from as far away as California and New York.

There's definitely a small sector trying to take advantage of this protest. What the police captain himself said, trying to use it as cover to attack police. On the other hand, though, there are a lot of protesters who are trying deliberately to keep things peaceful, trying to keep their people back on the curb, trying to prevent an outbreak of violence.

So, a lot of different groups inside the protesters, their numbers yesterday as high as a thousand over all. But in that thousand, there's people with handguns, people who want to throw Molotov cocktails and people who legitimately want to protest what they think is a racist, divided city, and they're trying to do that in a peaceful fashion.

PERINO: Greg?

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Steve, this is Gutfeld.

It seems to me when I'm watching this stuff, the worse it gets, the worse it gets. Meaning as the media attention becomes a magnifying glass, it seems to take something, sizzle it and make it burn even more.

Do you feel that the media is actually hurting this rather than helping?

HARRIGAN: You know, I think the media can give a distorted picture a little bit of things. When I actually go home and watch some of the footage on TV, I see -- I hardly each recognize it because the small screen can really capture a sense of violence that I don't really see. It looks like Rome is burning, you know, when you watch it on TV, and basically we're talking about an area of two square blocks where there's been street protests but the police didn't actually fire a shot last night.

On the other hand, when you talk to people outside of these protests, it's really -- you really do get the sense that people are angry here. That there's been racism here for decades and they are fed up.

So, on the one hand, TV is giving a misleading picture that the whole city is on fire and it's not. On the other hand, there is a real problem here and we're bringing attention to it.

PERINO: Andrea?

ANDREA TANTAROS, CO-HOST: Steve, if you can break down the ratio of how you see the people there, the peaceful protesters versus the rioters because we've heard all sorts of information, right? We've heard another host on another cable channel say that it's mostly media in the streets. We've heard the president yesterday say that there's a very small percentage of rioters and protesters, it's mostly peaceful.

If you can break us down, break it down, give us a sense of what it's like on the street and who makes up the majority of what you are seeing.

HARRIGAN: It really depends on what time you go out. As of now, there's probably about 70 or 80 people in all. Around 6:00 or 7:00, when it cools off a little bit, we could see up to a thousand. Those are peaceful marchers, sometimes people pushing kids in strollers.

It gets bad around midnight and sometimes there's only 100 people left then, so we're talking about a very small amount of people. And among that 100, there might be, you know, four or five with masks on who are ready to throw a Molotov cocktail or who have a gun.

So, a small percentage I'd say could be violent, but you know it's a tense stand-off when police are four rows deep with batons and helmets on and there's a crowd of a thousand. That's all it takes is two or three bad people to really set off a spark that could turn things very ugly here very quickly.

PERINO: Bob?

BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: Hey, Steve, it's Bob Beckel. Can you confirm something for me? I don't want to put you on the spot here. You've been very busy, doing a great job.

But is it the case that Ferguson police do not have to live in Ferguson, to be cops in Ferguson?

HARRIGAN: They definitely do not have to live in Ferguson. I think the officer in question here did not live in Ferguson.

BECKEL: That's what I thought.

HARRIGAN: And when you look at the two lines, it's basically, you know, white police, black protesters. So, even though it's police and protesters, there's also a white-black division that's pretty clear.

PERINO: Steve, it's Dana. I wonder if you could tell us if the National Guard and police department today, do they have a new strategy going into tonight?

HARRIGAN: I think that's one of the things that's been a problem that you are getting at. We've seen a new strategy every day and sometimes within the same day, several strategies. The one strategy that seemed to work was making people march. That calmed things down, thinned out the crowd, kept people moving and kept things peaceful, when they went away from that, that's when trouble really started.

The National Guard has been pretty much held off in reserve at the (AUDIO GAP). We've seen SWAT teams, local police -- a shift in strategy and a shift in command.

A even if you are not a expert, when you look at the police lines and seen some of the charges they have made, seen some of the things they've done, seen the show of force, you get the feeling of uh-oh, not a whole lot of experience, not a whole lot of calm confidence on the side of police, especially the local forces right now.

PERINO: All right. Eric?

BOLLING: Steve, Bolling again.

So, I woke up this morning, I was watching all the stuff from overnight. Around 10:00 or 11:00, it felt likes things are starting -- even the story felt like, it was -- all right, we've seen this now.

And then, 1:00 Central Time, your time, there was another police- involved shooting. A man was shot and killed. He was wielding a knife. Police felt threatened. They shot him and killed him. They say he was yelling some crazy things and whatnot.

But I wanted to know did that spark, did that energize anything that you saw going on there? Does that have any effect going on in the scene? By the way, that's only about four miles from where you're standing.

HARRIGAN: That's right. Around the scene itself, it sparked some attention, small crowd gathered, making some of the same chants that we've seen, ""Hands up, don't shoot, they shot another one of us.""

But, right here, it's had no effect so far tonight. When the sun goes down and cools off, more of a crowd. It might have some effect. But we haven't seen it yet.

PERINO: Bob?

BECKEL: Yes, Steve, the -- checking with the Missouri Department of Public Safety, Ferguson police statistics were rejected for gross in errors. Also, as I understand it, 67 percent of people in the town are black, 97 percent of the cars that are stopped are black. Two times as many blacks get frisked as whites and three times more chance to get your cars frisked than white.

Is that -- have you picked that sort of stuff up from blacks? Even prior to this, do they feel that there is a racial divide in that city?

HARRIGAN: There's no question about it. We were standing out in front of Target yesterday just talking to African-Americans who are not part of the protest, who were coming out.

And this woman about 40 told me, ""I avoid Ferguson. I drive around it. Those people, the whites, don't want us in their stores and we get the sense that it's a divided place that we don't want any part of. They don't like us, we don't like them.""

So, even if they're not protesting here, you get the sense that this is the place that's stuck in 1970. And there's a lot of people who have some real frustration that's been building over the years.

GUTFELD: Steve, those are interesting emotions. What about facts? Have you asked any of the police officers or anybody within the police department, why they aren't living in Ferguson?

Is it because perhaps maybe they haven't been able to find qualified applicants for the police force, or are they actively avoiding hiring people in Ferguson? Have they said, ""No, we don't want to hire them""? Or is it because of certain factors that prevent them from hiring them? Or perhaps, education, criminal records or a lack of desire to become a police officer?

HARRIGAN: I can't answer the specifics of that question with facts, but a couple of things have come out since this crisis began, and that is that the police here in Ferguson are going to push for more minority candidates for their police academy. They are also going to make sure that they have cameras on their vests, on their dash, so we see spurred on by this incident some reforms headed for the police department here in Ferguson soon.

BECKEL: Steve, you want some facts. There are other facts here. The fact is the budget of Ferguson police department or the town have zero dollars for minority recruitment. Now, I can assume that a lot of --

GUTFELD: Zero?

BECKEL: Zero, zero.

PERINO: Hey, let's not make Steve get in the middle of this. We got two more blocks.

TANTAROS: He's got enough conflict.

(CROSSTALK)

PERINO: Steve, you're going to get your last question from Andrea.

TANTAROS: Yes, Steve. Sorry, you are in the middle of enough conflict in Ferguson.

HARRIGAN: Thanks, Dana.

TANTAROS: We don't mean to put you into our conflict here on THE FIVE.

HARRIGAN: Yes.

TANTAROS: Eric Holder is heading to the area tomorrow. I know the administration has been pressuring the police department in different ways, so over the weekend we heard a report that they pressured them, the feds not to release that surveillance tape. However, they were lecturing them on transparency.

Any idea of what's happening behind the scenes? If the police plan on releasing more information, if they plan on indicting? What are you hearing from the department about how they're going to take next steps?

HARRIGAN: I think the release of that video was a real surprise, both at the county and state level and at the national level as well and it shows the real gap in the command structure between the very top and the local force.

And I imagine the local police feel real slighted by how they have been portrayed in the media so far.

But the story is likely to take on more national attention in the days ahead with this Thursday day of national rage and then a funeral for Michael Brown on Monday, could get a lot of real national attention as this story expands beyond Ferguson.

PERINO: All right. Steve, thank you so much for being with us this afternoon.

HARRIGAN: Thank you.

PERINO: When we come back: Greg on the media's role in stoking Ferguson's flames. Will they care about the city after they jump to the next story? That's next on THE FIVE.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GUTFELD: The media, like humanity, can only handle two sides to a story, and they almost always flock to one side and it's David, never Goliath, even if Goliath might be right. It's a side dictated by decades of pop culture deeming what's cool and what isn't.

Who needs balance when Buffalo Springfield tells you there's something happening here? We're all suckers for that.

But there aren't two sides to Ferguson. There are lots, or at least four, aside from protesters and the law. You've got insiders and outsiders, those who stop by for the racket and those left to clean up after the opportunists are gone. The outsiders arrive like moth to a flame, and the flame is any camera. And reporters, a different moth, find their flame in all the action.

Al Sharpton, a moth, has never met a spotlight he didn't like. Freddy's Fashion Mart, Tawana Brawley, Crown Heights -- the pain and suffering of others is a small price to pay for his stardom. The only crime is when he's ignored, which is why you most always keep in mind those who were left behind, because once these outsiders leave, the only people left are those who can't.

Shop owners don't happily return to their ""Huffington Post"" podcast. They're repairing windows in displays. The shop keeper stays well until he packs up for good, for safer pastures. And what's left behind is another scorched hut (ph), another city undone by the divas of division.

Andrea, what would happen if all the cameras packed up? Like what would the agitators do?

TANTAROS: They probably wait for another situation like this, which is what they do. They're not spending their time in Chicago addressing black on black crime for the most part.

But what's been shocking to me was the handling of this by certain cable news channel. I think some of it has been very fair. There's one in particular --

GUTFELD: Rhymes with PNN?

TANTAROS: Well, yes. It does remind with PNN and the C, in the end now stands for the ""cops not needed"" network.

GUTFELD: Yes.

TANTAROS: Yesterday, when the autopsy came out, Dr. Michael Baden couldn't have been more clear. He said that there's no specific series of event that this autopsy can confirm. There's no specific fact pattern.

Yet, on the air, one of the anchors said the results of this autopsy now confirm what protesters believe to be true -- reporting that as fact. That is completely untrue.

It's irresponsible. Leading the guest is very irresponsible.

And these ear buds that I emailed last night, the reporter for ""The Huffington Post"", I think we have the full screen really wanted these ear plugs to be rubber bullets, he put out a tweet asking if anybody knew -- can anyone confirm, these are rubber bullets? No, they were what I used to go to sleep at night when the cabs are honking. It's just mine are pink.

GUTFELD: Yes.

TANTAROS: So, there really is some irresponsible journalism happening. And when they do leave, Greg, you're going to have a lot of those business owners, unfortunately minority business owners, a lot of them, left to pick up the pieces.

GUTFELD: Eric, we just heard Harrigan talked about the upcoming day of rage.

BOLLING: Yes.

GUTFELD: Is that something reporters should be talking about?

BOLLING: Yes -

GUTFELD: Coming up.

BOLLING: He's reporting what's going on down there. That's what we want -- look, that's what cable news is right. You got 24/7. You want to know exactly what's going on. This happens to be a story.

It's incredible, like -- I analyzed the ratings on these things. You can go and find out by quarter hours, or 15-minute chunks of time. Shows we'll be handling the show -- this situation in Missouri will be rating here. They will go off and do another topic, very compelling topic, provocative, the ratings will dip and they'll go back to it later and the ratings will go back up.

There's an appetite by the consuming public who want their news. They want to see this. They want to see that video. They want to see the looters shooting the window out and then running into this one, right there. That one, that's what they want to see because, frankly, they are sitting from home from wherever they are and go, wow, can you imagine what's going on there?

The problem is that poor storm owner is going, can you imagine what's going on here?

GUTFELD: Yes, looters are making money for somebody.

BOLLING: And how is that helping the cause, right?

GUTFELD: Yes.

BOLLING: I mean, the Michael Brown cause or the incarceration or arrest rate amongst African-Americans in a community. That doesn't help.

GUTFELD: Dana, it's the chicken and egg question, does the chaos incite more chaos, or does the chaos incite more media to come and watch it?

PERINO: I think that what you're saying is that if the cameras were to leave right now, if everybody made -- if the media made a pact, and they said because they say -- everybody says they really want this get this situation to really get calmed down, they made a pact and they all walked away, and nobody was going to film it tonight, would there be riots? Maybe, maybe not.

I think the interesting thing, though, is that there's different ways of filming things now. Everybody has their own phone. So, the story is going to be covered.

And, plus, what Steve Harrigan was saying is, maybe this is a story that needed to be exposed. If people in Ferguson feel that strongly about a racial divide, maybe this is something that had to be talked about.

GUTFELD: Yes, true.

Bob, there's another night of riots, which means another night of award-winning photography, which would guarantee another night of rioting. It's like a snowboard of -- snowboard -- a snowball of suffering.

BECKEL: Yes, and you know, the thing -- the sad part about this these punks that come from out of town, they are in there to do one or two things, either to incite riot or to steal. And I would bet you when all of said and done, most of people who did the violence in this thing, in a very contained area as you pointed out, were done by out-of-towners, all of whom should be lock up quick.

And the other -- but the other thing is, it is seems to me that for CNN, you know, I understand exactly what you are saying about the Baden thing. I mean, he did not draw a conclusion.

Now, you have to look at it two ways. When you say conclusions, you can't draw conclusions. There aren't enough facts here. But if you are somebody who lives in Ferguson where you believe that the police are racists and you see that these gunshot wounds are coming down your arm like this, they are going to assume, they are going to assume without full evidence that this kid had his hands up in the air.

Now, I don't know what happened. I know I tackled a lot of -- if this kid was tackling this cop, I've tackled a lot of people in my life, I've never done it with my hands up like this.

Does that mean that the guy was not charging him? Probably not. But does it mean the people in Ferguson believe it? Absolutely.

GUTFELD: No, you mean charging him?

BECKEL: Charging him.

GUTFELD: Yes, yes.

(CROSSTALK)

GUTFELD: Not charging him.

BECKEL: Charging (ph) him.

GUTFELD: I don't know. No, it's true. It's very confusing to all of us.

What about the people that are still -- like in a couple of months, it will be Ferguson but worse because everybody had left and there would be shopkeepers who were in debt because they had to repair all of these displays and windows.

TANTAROS: That's right. And a lot of stories about how the economy is driving this even more. How does this help the economy? How does this help the police force?

I mean, if this is a region of the country that has deep-seated racial divisions, I don't know how you begin to put the pieces back together after what just happened, especially after the cameras leave? I mean, then really who's going to focus on this?

BOLLING: I --

PERINO: It's a slow burn. It's a slow burn to -- it takes -- it will take many years. But, you know, yes, shops will leave and people will have to travel farther in order to get services or people have to live farther out in order to work in Ferguson.

BOLLING: And there's one possible silver lining to this whole thing and the coverage in seeing what's going on, that the African-American community in there can vote, they can vote in the people they want, they can vote in the town council people. They can -- and have those town council people, I don't know, put -- hire cops that are more diverse and maybe that will solve some of the problem in the area.

BECKEL: Yes. Well, you know, I would bet you most of the people going into the stores looting don't care one whit about this kid.

PERINO: I agree.

BECKEL: They would not go down there and protest the fact that he was killed. They went down there to take advantage of the situation, knowing full well they could get into a liquor store. We've seen it happen before in riot after riot after riot.

And this is the point I keep making. The majority of these people, the vast majority of them, want to see this kid -- his trial be fair and the rest of it. They don't go into liquor stores and rob. And I bet most of them couldn't even pronounce his name. >

GUTFELD: All right. We got to go.

Coming up: President Obama faces another racially charged story in Ferguson but some African-Americans are not buying his explanation for the causes of violence. Details, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

TANTAROS: Well, President Obama has never shied away from diving into racial issues before and yesterday was no exception. The president took a break from his Martha's Vineyard vacation to address the unrest in Ferguson and blamed black violence on our, quote, ""tragic histories.""

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Part of the ongoing challenge of perfecting our union has involved dealing with communities that feel left behind, who as a consequence of tragic histories often find themselves isolated, and you have young men of color in many communities who are more likely to end up in jail or in the criminal justice system than they are in a good job or in college.

(END VIDOE CLIP)

TANTAROS: But ""The Wall Street Journal's"" Jason Riley took issue with that explanation.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JASON RILEY, ""WALL STREET JOURNAL"": He said black criminals should be prosecuted, which is helpful. But then he attributed that black criminality. He suggested it stems from poverty or a racist criminal justice system. Which is nonsense. The black crime rate in 1960 was lower than it is today. Was there less racism or less poverty in 1960? This is about black behavior. It needs to be addressed head on. It's about attitudes towards the criminal justice system in these neighborhoods, where young black men have no sense of what it means to be a male or what it means to be black. And he needs to talk about that head-on, not dismiss it as a product of poverty or history, which is a dodge.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TANTAROS: Right, Greg. Also, the president taking heat for not saying looting was wrong. He basically stated the intended goal of the rioting and the looting, right, to promote aggression. Charles Krauthammer made that comment -- comment last night.

What did you think about the president's remarks yesterday?

GUTFELD: I can't get too, like, out of shape about it. I think his goal is to remain calm. I mean, he's the most famous black American in the world, and sometimes you'd like to think that he would take some risks and say some uncomfortable things. But maybe he will, and maybe he realizes that's not who he is.

But if you look at what is wrong, and you see what's happening to Ferguson, which is almost like Detroit condensed into a made-for-TV movie. It's like a time lapse history with a generation of a city, I think it's not simply black on black. It's poor on poor. You've got a decline in the family structure: bad schools, high taxes, corruption and bureaucracy, joblessness.

The result is you have people leaving, leaving to the suburbs, who are both black and white, leaving the poor to prey upon the poor. Who runs these places into the ground? It's not evil white cops. It's liberalism. It's liberalism that has destroyed every single one of these cities.

TANTAROS: Dana, one thing that I thought that was pretty radical yesterday, even though he had a very muted tone, some of the messaging was anything but.

When he talked about suspensions of black youth in schools, this is a policy the president has talked about before. And it seems like he's going to be putting pressure on schools not to suspend as many black kids. Which I just took issue with. He was almost deducing that this happened because of black kids getting suspended more than white kids.

So the answer to that is, is this administration now going to pressure schools to stop suspending blacks and suspend more whites? I mean, I'm just wondering where he was going with that yesterday.

PERINO: I actually think it was part of a bigger picture, because he mentioned his program, My Brother's Keeper, which was well-received by everybody, to say yes, this is something that we need to do. And then he is in the best position to be able to do it.

I think tomorrow when he sends Attorney General Eric Holder to Ferguson, it does raise expectations and it also raises questions, because this is going to happen again somewhere in America, and at that point has the precedent been set? Hopefully, they can calm things down.

I think maybe the most helpful thing that Obama and Holder could say is to the people who have come -- the outsiders that have come in that have stoked further violence, they should have a very tough message for them and tell them to get the heck out of there.

TANTAROS: Um-hmm. Eric, do you think that the police officer has a chance for a fair shake with Holder going to the town? A lot of people wondering that. And out of the gate he said civil rights investigation without knowing the facts. He went right to civil rights. He met with the victim's family before he knew any of the facts. Do you think he'll have a fair shake?

BOLLING: You know, on the other side, I've been hearing all day about the county prosecutor. His father was a cop who was killed by an African- American, so the other side is saying they won't -- he will have more than his due -- fair shake or however we put it. Hopefully, justice is fair, and it will be taken care of.

Let me throw one thing at you, though. President Obama has now become probably the most influential civil rights activist in the country, far exceeding Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson. So if he wants that job, and he seems to want it with the kind of rhetoric he's saying. Comes back to Martha's Vineyard; makes this big announcement. How about he go himself? How about he -- hold on. Let me just finish this one thought.

Let him go himself. Let him stand there for five minutes, say, ""All right, everyone. We're going to take care of this issue. We understand there's a racial situation going on. Let's calm down, fix this. Get out of there,"" and I promise you I won't be that right-winger that says, ""Why does he only show up to the things that are important to him?"" Because that would probably calm things down overnight.

BECKEL: I think calm is a good idea here for me. Let me just say it. It contributed to the destruction of American cities, being liberal.

We did not put on what Barack Obama said yesterday about looters. And he was very strong on it. No, we didn't do that. We put that on. And so I'll get in trouble here. I'm not attacking my own show. I'm just saying the president had other things to say.

He's spoken three times. Three times he's denounced looters. Three times he's called them criminals. Three times he said to get out of town. Now, I don't know what more he has to do.

And you know, it just -- this guy, Ridley [SIC], whatever his name is from The Wall Street Journal, the idea that poverty does not contribute to crime, you just don't get it. Is it more poverty in the '60s? Yes, but there were families in the '60s. That's the difference.

PERINO: That's actually a good point.

BOLLING: That's a good point, though.

PERINO: That's what he said. If you know anything about Jason Riley, that is his point. And he knows something -- he knows a lot more about growing up in -- a black man in an inner city than we do, because he did. So I think he's worth listening to.

BECKEL: But I wish he had said that. That's one...

PERINO: He does. I'll look in on -- maybe -- follow Jason Riley. He has really interesting good things to say about this topic.

TANTAROS: Yes, he does.

PERINO: Every day. Not just...

BOLLING: And by the way, Bob, I think he did say poverty does contribute to crime. He said black -- race doesn't contribute to crime. Poverty does.

BECKEL: He said...

TANTAROS: All right. Bob, you got your Bob-o-logue. Just like to drag-o-logue without your Bob-o-logue.

Up next, there was another fatal shooting involving a police officer just miles from Ferguson. Mike Tobin will join us with the details on that next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BOLLING: All right. We're going to head back out to Missouri, where earlier this afternoon, police shot and killed, I believe what is said to be a 22-year-old man who was wielding a knife, trying to rob a convenience store.

Mike, you have the very latest? Tell us what the response is from your -- where you stand.

MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's interesting. Because I'm out here on West Floriston (ph) Avenue, and you get the reaction from the people; and the reaction from the people really involves a lot of misinformation. It gets out on social media. It gets out through -- through word of mouth. And the conclusion that was arrived at right away well was, ""Well, the police got another one."" It also gets twisted along the lines of this guy was paying for his food, and the police ultimately shot him.

And it also combined the narrative. The police have a lot of nonlethal options that they could have used instead of deadly force. And it sounds like, in reality, this guy had some mental problems, and sadly, he's dead now.

BECKEL: Mike, you know, the reactions of those people you're talking about, I mean, it is -- the conclusions that they jump to right away -- the social media doesn't help on that -- but there -- doesn't there seem to be a predetermined view on their part to accept that that would be the case? I mean, I'm trying to -- it's difficult to put myself in their situation. But if I heard that a cop killed a guy in St. Louis, and I was living there; and I was upset already about what's happening, my conclusion would be, ""There, that they got another one.""

TOBIN: Well, and that's immediately the conclusion they arrived at. What I didn't see out here, Bob, though is a big flash of anger. You get a lot of talk. The crowd is pretty small right now. And as the -- as the evening comes around, you'll see the crowd grow, and then once the sun goes down, you'll see the crowd get aggressive; you see the crowd get cranky; you see the crowd get angry. But we haven't seen the immediate flash of anger.

And you do have a big differentiation in this case, because with Mike Brown the narrative was that he was unarmed. In this case, you know now he had a knife, and at least according to the information we got from police, he was lunging at the officers.

TANTAROS: Mike, I know we don't have a lot of details on this specific incident that just took place, and I'm not trying to jump to conclusions on either story, but it does seem a little odd that we have two men who are now dead, shot dead in the streets of Missouri, because I guess the police suspected them of a crime, or something transpired.

And I did a little research into the law. This is pretty troubling here. Cops are allowed in Missouri to use deadly force if they suspect that the person in front of them is even a suspect in a crime or if it's going to affect the arrest. That's a pretty liberal reading of the law, that these cops are just killing people when this person could just be a suspect. I mean, one had a knife. One was unarmed but this law seems pretty unbelievable that cops are allowed to do this.

TOBIN: Well, I think the interpretation of law is one thing, but I think there's an exception with your notion that this is unusual. This kind of thing happens across the nation all the time. The only reason we're paying attention to this particular case in St. Louis that happened today is because it happened with such close proximity and so close in time to what happened to Mike Brown.

PERINO: Hi, Mike. It's Dana. I'm just curious if anybody that you've talk to, do they have expectations for tomorrow's meeting, when Attorney General Eric Holder comes to Ferguson, or is that not really something they're concerned with?

TOBIN: They don't really talk about it that much, and I think I've watched Captain Johnson go around and tell the demonstrators, ""Look, you had an impact. You have 40 FBI agents combing this neighborhood right now, trying to bring you the justice that you say you're after."" But they just don't accept it.

The people out here hear what they want. They want to see an arrest. and they want a conviction right away. They don't want to go through the long process, and they don't really want to take the time to understand the process, particularly as it relates to a grand jury.

GUTFELD: Mike, this is Greg. I'm struggling to come up with a question, but I can't come up with one. All I can say is, from my statistics, black offenders outnumber whites in homicides by almost 25 percent in 2012, despite having a population of a fifth the size, and I'm wondering what that would be like if we covered every one of those? Just a question.

TOBIN: You got me there.

GUTFELD: It wasn't really meant for you.

BECKEL: I've got a question for you about tonight. I assume that we -- these outsiders who come in there that do this -- the lion's share of this tragedy will use St. Louis. I mean, St. Louis is going to become a rallying point tonight, don't you think?

TOBIN: Well, St. Louis or Ferguson here. The one stat I can give you is there were 78 arrests last night, most of them for defying the order to disperse. Of those 78 arrests, four people were from Ferguson. Thirteen were from out of state. So that answers your question about outside agitators.

BECKEL: What I'm saying, they are the things who are going to use this St. Louis thing as part of their argument -- part of their anger, supposedly, tonight. Man, you must have a hard time hearing out there. I have a hard time -- is that all day long you have to put up with those horns?

TOBIN: It's constant. There's always somebody heckling. There's always a horn going on.

BOLLING: All right. Hey, Mike, we're going to let you go. But just one observation: Last night, I think you were doing about the same live shot, and I think you were saying about the same thing. It seems kind of calm, and last night happened to be the most violent and the most arrests of all of them so far.

Mike, we're going to leave you right there. Thank you very much.

Directly ahead, football is back, and so is the Redskin name controversy. More on that when we return.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BECKEL: Take a look at that picture. You're never going to see that few cars on Sixth Avenue.

Football is back, and so is the Redskins controversy. It continues to create headaches for the team's ownership, and two new voices might just have them reaching for Advil now.

Hugely influential commentator Phil Sims some people's minds, of CBS, and Tony Dungy of NBC have both said they both will refrain from calling the team ""Redskins,"" instead referring to them simply as ""Washington.""

Eric, what do you think?

BOLLING: Simms, great quarterback, Dungy great coach, two -- two guys wussing out on this. I think that it's the Washington Redskins until either the team changes their name or the league instructs differently. Until then you go with ""Washington Redskins.""

The good news is Mike Ditka and Al Michaels will continue to use the Washington Redskins until the name is officially changed. I'm with them.

BECKEL: Dana, this seems to be a growing problem for the Redskins from a communications standpoint. Do you agree with that?

PERINO: Yes. I was just -- I was wondering earlier today. How do they get this behind them? Like, what actually could happen that they can move forward, move past it?

I think it's reaching a point where Snider is either going to have to make a decision, and I think you'll see a change, maybe not this year, but within the next three years they will probably change it.

The other thing they could do is just bleep every time somebody says Redskins, and then it would be so annoying that they'll make sure they have to change it.

BECKEL: Do you think they'll give up the name?

TANTAROS: He might if it continues to get -- if they continue to get political pressure. But I think this is a smart way of handling it. Look, if the announcers don't want to use the word, don't use the word. That's a perfect way of dealing with it, but I don't think you should be forced to change the name.

BECKEL: OK.

TANTAROS: That is -- and that's a banned phrase.

BECKEL: Do you think that they're wussing out? Or they're...

GUTFELD: I think calling them ""Washington"" is way more offensive.

PERINO: I knew you were going to say that. I knew it!

GUTFELD: The proportion of outrage devoted to this is absolutely nuts. Redskins, silly bad name, but the suicide rate of young Native Americans is three times that of the general population, and that's not due to the name of a football team. So this -- it's a collection of pathologies that have nothing to do with football, and it makes this whole issue seem idiotic and silly.

BECKEL: OK. I -- let me, being a Washingtonian defending this for many, many, many years, I've got to say I just don't see it going away, and I agree. I don't know how you put it behind you. I hate to say it, but I just think it's time or maybe time shortly for the -- the Washington team to change its name.

BOLLING: But what about weighing in on whether Phil Simms and Tony Dungy should not use it?

BECKEL: I think they should not use it. Because that's what they believe.

BOLLING: It's the team name.

BECKEL: I know, but that's what they believe. I mean, they feel pretty strongly about it. And...

PERINO: What if people don't like, like -- let's just say they don't like Speaker Boehner. And they say, ""We, I'm just going to call him the speaker. I'll never actually say his name""?

GUTFELD: I don't like the Sims, so I'm not going to call him...

TANTAROS: I think that's a great way of dealing with it.

BECKEL: I don't know how else...

TANTAROS: I'd rather say ""minority leader"" than Pelosi.

PERINO: There you go.

BECKEL: You would? OK. I'd rather say -- I'd rather say ""speaker.""

OK. ""One More Thing"" up next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PERINO: Time now for ""One More Thing,"" and Andrea kicks us off.

I felt like I did a good job of holding my composure throughout the night, and you have a lapse of judgment and slip up.

TANTAROS: Yes.

BOLLING: This one.

PERINO: He went to media training. You can tell. He's much better than before the summer. So I don't know who that was. Ari, was that you? I don't know.

Let's see. I'm going to show you the best picture I've taken this summer. You know I take a lot of pictures of Jasper. This is my friend, Macy English, jumping off the dock and Jasper going after her.

GUTFELD: Of course, she was eaten by the dog.

PERINO: Macy English is 10. She was not eaten by the dog. But he went in after her.

She's -- they're in South Carolina. I thought it was the best picture of the summer. And I learned something about her, though. She went back to school last week, and you know how it is over the summer. Sometimes your classmates grow taller and you don't. Turns out she's now the shortest person in her class. She doesn't like that, but Macy, I'm here to tell you, I was the shortest person in my class, too.

BECKEL: You put a picture of your dog attacking little girls?

PERINO: She just jumped after her.

Anyway, I just -- Macy, look, it's OK to be the shortest person in your class and, you know, sometimes short people wear glasses too, right, Greg?

GUTFELD: That's absolutely right.

PERINO: Don't you want to give her a word of encouragement.

GUTFELD: Things get better. They really do. Hang in there. Hang in there.

PERINO: You met her.

GUTFELD: Yes, she was a very nice kid, very nice kid, and she's going to grow.

PERINO: She'll grow. Unlike you.

GUTFELD: Unlike me. I stopped growing.

TANTAROS: There's always high heels. That's your motto, right, Greg?

GUTFELD: Exactly. Exactly.

PERINO: OK, Greg, you get to go next.

GUTFELD: All right. It's time for...

GUTFELD: Greg's Secrets to Happiness, the abridged version.

OK. The secret to happiness here is it's good to see a person of influence credit an uncool behavior. What's the next step? It's to focus on destructive behaviors and protective behaviors and not be afraid to defend the dorky.

PERINO: OK. I'm going to have to rewind that.

GUTFELD: That made no sense, did it?

PERINO: It did not, but...

TANTAROS: Wait. Fanny packs equal happiness, was that the message?

GUTFELD: Yes. Fanny packs equal happiness.

FoxNews,fox38,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/08/19/absurd-coverage-police-ferguson-unrest-and-african-americans.html,"Absurd coverage of police, Ferguson unrest and African-Americans",Cal Thomas,08/19/2014,10/30/2015,"It was in a college theater class that I learned about a genre called “Theater of the Absurd.” These were plays written mostly by European playwrights between the 1940s and 1960s, as well as a certain style that flowed from their work.

What reminded me of this is now “playing” in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was — select one — a) innocently walking down the street when a police officer shot him to death without provocation, or, b) walking with a friend in the street and told by a police officer to get on the sidewalk, whereupon a physical confrontation occurred and Brown allegedly tried to grab the officer’s gun and was shot by the cop, now identified as Darren Wilson. This after Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store of some cigars and was seen on a store camera intimidating the clerk as he walked out, which may, or may not, have been related to the shooting.

The rioting and looting that followed and the pundits who weighed in with the familiar narrative about slavery, discrimination, stereotyping, joblessness, lack of education and absent fathers, are familiar scenes we have watched in incidents dating back to the race riots of the 1960s. Blue ribbon commissions have been appointed to study the “causes,” laws have been passed, little has changed.

The Theater of the Absurd, as defined by The American Heritage Dictionary, is “A form of drama that emphasizes the absurdity of human existence by employing disjointed, repetitious, and meaningless dialogue, purposeless and confusing situations, and plots that lack realistic or logical development.”

Doesn’t this sound like Ferguson, Missouri, in recent days?

The cast of characters has expanded with the introduction of the National Guard, ordered to Ferguson by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to quell the unrest, much of it apparently fomented, according to some locals, by outsiders taking advantage of the situation to engage in criminal activity.

Just how absurd things are getting in the St. Louis suburb and in some of the commentary written before all the facts are known can be seen in these headlines on the Drudge Report: “George Zimmerman attorney urges caution” (Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin); “Iran’s Ayatollah weighs in;” “Jesse Jackson: ‘state execution.’”

If jumping to conclusions were an Olympic sport, some of these loudmouths who insert themselves where they don’t belong and frequently fan flames instead of working to extinguish them would win gold medals.

The shooting galleries in Chicago and other major cities leave hundreds dead each year. Most shooters and victims are black, or Hispanic, but only the local news gives coverage. There are no statements from the president. No FBI or Justice Department investigative task forces are sent from Washington. I have yet to hear a credible explanation for this.

It is the same when a child disappears. A white child, especially a female, gets a lot of attention, a black child, no matter the gender, not so much. Isn’t this a form of racism?

One more question that adds to the absurdity: Why is so little attention paid to African-Americans who have overcome difficult circumstances to become responsible citizens and committed husbands and fathers? Possible answer: It doesn’t play into the media’s stereotypical portrayal of the black man as a frightening, threatening, menace to society. Blacks who loot stores make for more dramatic pictures than those who are law-abiding. (To their great credit, Brown’s parents have repeatedly called for calm in Ferguson, to little avail.)

Don’t the major media have a bias of their own in these matters?

It’s all so absurd.",NA,0,NA,NA

While the president, who is in Washington for two days of meetings, returns Tuesday evening to his family vacation in Martha’s Vineyard, Holder will head to Ferguson, Mo., where protests continue to give way to riots and looting on a nightly basis – straining law enforcement previously accused of being heavy-handed in their response.

From the White House, Obama is keeping a reserved tone by calling for calm on both sides, urging protesters to stay peaceful and police to show restraint. But at the Justice Department, Holder is committing what is being described as an “extraordinary” effort to investigate the local case.

“They’re basically flooding the zone [with investigators],” Thomas Dupree, former deputy assistant attorney general under the George W. Bush administration, told Fox News. “It’s an extraordinary level of commitment for an incident of this nature.”

Dupree said the response shows this case is something Holder “is personally invested in.”

Holder will visit Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with the FBI agents and other Justice Department personnel on the scene, as well as local community leaders. Holder’s Justice Department already has opened a federal civil rights probe – according to Politico, federal investigators are conducting hundreds of interviews and turning up information the local police haven’t – and conducted an additional autopsy of 18-year-old Michael Brown’s body.

A top DOJ official is heading to Ferguson Tuesday in advance of Holder’s arrival to work with local police.

Whether Holder and his department will ease or inflame tensions remains to be seen – it’s the same question that hangs over Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon’s decision to call in the National Guard.

Dupree voiced concerns that Holder is sending a signal to his department that there is a “correct outcome.”

“I don’t want to say they’ve prejudged it, but the statements he’s saying I think could lead people to conclude that there’s a right way and a wrong way to do things in the mind of the attorney general,” he said.

Holder said Monday that the “full resources” of DOJ are being committed, including more than 40 FBI agents on the ground.

“I realize there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to Michael Brown’s death, but I ask for the public’s patience as we conduct this investigation,” Holder said in a statement. “The selective release of sensitive information that we have seen in this case so far is troubling to me. No matter how others pursue their own separate inquiries, the Justice Department is resolved to preserve the integrity of its investigation. This is a critical step in restoring trust between law enforcement and the community, not just in Ferguson, but beyond.”

Holder also called for an end to violence and looting in Ferguson.

Holder, one of the few remaining members of the original Obama Cabinet, remains a lightning rod figure in Washington, for his role in several controversies. The Republican-led House voted to hold him in contempt of Congress in 2012, in connection with the botched Fast and Furious anti-gun-trafficking operation. His department more recently came under scrutiny for its surveillance of members of the media, and for allegedly not doing enough to investigate the IRS over alleged targeting of conservatives.

On matters of race, Holder has been outspoken. He called the country a “nation of cowards” on racial issues in 2009. As Obama did, he publicly identified with Trayvon Martin – the black teenager shot by George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012 – recalling incidents of racial profiling he faced as a young man.

This time, Obama has shied away from personalizing his response to the Ferguson shooting. But Holder is showing an acute interest in the case.

So far, his involvement is drawing praise from the state’s Republican senator, Roy Blunt, but also words of caution. Blunt said that he and Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill will join the attorney general on Wednesday, and that he’s been “pleased with my conversations with the attorney general and civil rights division regarding their helpful understanding that they aren't taking over this investigation, but are conducting a parallel review.”  

He called a “parallel federal investigation” into the death “important” but cautioned against DOJ taking on too large a role.

“While the federal government can assist with that investigation, the federal government should not assume the state and local governments' responsibilities,” Blunt said in a statement.",15557,4879,NA,NA

Former Police Commissioner of Yonkers, New York, Ed Hartnett, says, with this flood of investigators, there are just too many cooks in the kitchen.

Too many people investigating, too many boots on the ground? Why?

ED HARTNETT, PRESIDENT, BROSNAN RISK CONSULTANTS: It seems so -- I mean, I understand the optics of the A.G. going out there. I mean, I understand the optics and the necessity of agents out there to do the civil rights investigation. But the perception is confusing. Is anybody investigating the actual death of this individual? Are -- are there too many people involved? Is the FBI doing anything to investigate those that are maybe behind the ongoing violence that is occurring every night now in Ferguson?

VARNEY: That's interesting. You want an investigation more into who is violent, who is behind it, as opposed to the death of Michael Brown, because we have had a lot of the people -- I don't know about a lot -- but many of the people arrested in Ferguson have come from out of state.

HARTNETT: Yes.

And I have great respect for the FBI. I had a long-term relationship with the FBI when I was in the NYPD and in Yonkers. And I get that the investigation into the civil rights violation has to take place.

But at the same time, can the FBI assist the investigation into who is responsible every night there's ongoing violence, looting? There are guns in those neighborhood. How are those guns getting there? I think the federal government can assist in that way, as well as with the civil rights investigation.

VARNEY: So, what is the problem here? You got 40 FBI guys flooding the zone, as they say. And you have got three separate, I believe, separate investigations into the confrontation and death of Michael Brown.

What is wrong with this picture? Why is that too many people there? Why are there too many investigations? What is wrong?

HARTNETT: Well, the perception I think to the people on the ground, the cop in the street, is, who is in charge?

VARNEY: OK.

HARTNETT: Who is running our city now? And how long will they be here?

The federal government has a -- has a -- has a reputation at times of inserting itself into investigations like this, then installing a monitor on the police, and then seemingly never going home.

VARNEY: OK, now, Mr. -- the attorney general, Holder, he is not happy that the local police released that video of Michael Brown in that convenience store roughing up the smaller clerk there. What say you about that?

HARTNETT: As a former police commissioner, I understand what the A.G. is saying, but at the same time, I think releasing that video was OK.

I think any video of Michael Brown that day can be helpful in an ongoing investigation. If there was a video of Michael Brown assisting someone to cross the street, I would want to see that video. If there's a video of Michael Brown just walking down the street, I would want to see that video.

I think the police probably made a mistake in not releasing the name of the officer sooner.

VARNEY: Well, wait a second. He would not have been safe had they just immediately said it was X-Y-Z officer.

HARTNETT: Exactly. I don't think they should have done it immediately.

But I think once they -- they have to -- their paramount policy there should have been make sure that officer and his family are safe. But after a couple of days, I think it would have been prudent to release that name as long as the officer and his family were safe, and then release that video of Michael Brown in the store.

VARNEY: What's your judgment of the performance of the local police department?

HARTNETT: I think they're overwhelmed.

I think -- I think this is a small city. It's relatively small police deep. You have a lot of people coming from outside Ferguson, from outside the Saint Louis county area, coming in as agitators, maybe as peaceful protesters, maybe a little of both, maybe some anarchists thrown in. So, I think there's a -- it's a department that right now is overwhelmed.

VARNEY: What do you make of a department which is in a heavily black city, town, which is only 5 percent black in its officer corps?

HARTNETT: I think they need to do something to diversify. I don't know what the system is as far as civil service exams. But clearly they need to do some things a little different to diversify that department a little bit more.

VARNEY: What is job one tonight? Get control of the violence?

HARTNETT: Get control of the violence and keep people from getting killed.

VARNEY: Do what you got to do.

HARTNETT: Do what you got to do.

VARNEY: All right, Ed Hartnett, thanks very much for joining us, sir.

Appreciate it.

HARTNETT: Thank you, Stuart.",NA,0,NA,NA

Let's get right to the story that is riveting the nation as we speak. It's almost dark in Ferguson, Missouri where the city is bracing for its 11th night of unrest after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. Last night's efforts by authorities to restore order failed as reported by our St. Louis affiliate KTVI.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are not credentialed media, you need to disperse immediately. Or you will be subject to arrest.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was a volatile scene last night on West Florison (ph) police used smoke bombs and tear gas to break up the crowd. Johnson says the protests were ok until about 9:40. That's when about 200 chanting protesters started walking towards police on West Florison (ph) at Ferguson.

Johnson says bottles were thrown from the crowd at the officers. Police then stepped up their response. Johnson says two people wound up being shot, not by law officers, but by others in the area. However, Johnson tells us officers did come under fire. Four county police officers were hurt when they were hit by rocks.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: All right. Our own Steve Harrigan is on the ground at Ferguson. Steve you saw the scene turn last night, turn violent first hand first of all before we get to how it looks tonight. Talk to us a little bit about those protesters, I'm sorry -- the rioters and the looters last night; 78 arrests, not all from the Missouri area, is that right?

STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That's right; 78 arrests. Just three of them here from the town of Ferguson a lot from Missouri but some came from as far away as California and New York as well. Some concerns from police that rioters are using the demonstrations as a cover -- a cover to launch some attack against police.

At the same time though, it's got to be said there are a lot of demonstrators who are trying to keep people on the sidewalk and the peace. Right now we just saw a woman like a 60-year-old woman flex cuffed on the ground. She stopped walking and was in the street. If you stop walking at these protests you will get arrested in seconds flat, Eric.

BOLLING: Steve there was another officer involved shooting about four miles away in the city of St. Louis. Now have those protesters where you are in Ferguson have they heard about it and are they reacting to that shooting?

HARRIGAN: They have heard about it. But it hasn't spiked the violence like you might expect. But it's about, you know, 95 degrees here during the day. The real action starts at night. So it's too early to tell whether that second shooting again, a young African-American male who was armed with a knife against police, it's too early to tell whether that will stir things up or not. But we haven't seen any effect yet here on the ground.

BOLLING: Ok and also you had mentioned that there is a potential for what you classified as a day of rage. Are people talking about a day of rage? Can you tell us what that is all about?

HARRIGAN: It's about later this week on Thursday, perhaps this movement will go national -- several different cities a day of rage. But also looking ahead, it looks like Monday is going to be the funeral for Michael Brown and that could be a major event as well. So this protest could have legs.

Now, on all sides, there have been encouraging people not to come out tonight. Community leaders and police after the sun goes down, it looks like we've got about a half hour of sunlight left. So really a test to tell whether they will come out again tonight or not, Eric.

BOLLING: Now, Steve -- you have some people in the background, they kind of give you a little bit of a rough time last night. Do you expect the same tonight?

HARRIGAN: You know, it's a tricky situation. There is all different kinds of people in the crowd. They can hear what you're saying. If they don't agree with what you are saying they let you know. So, you know, it's possible.

BOLLING: Ok. All right. Steve, we're going to leave it right there and say thank you very much.

Community leaders were also in the middle of the protest last night doing their best to keep the peace.

Joining us now from Ferguson is one of those local leaders, Bishop Edwin Bass, the president of the Church of God and Christ Urban Initiative. Bishop thank you for joining us. First of all can I ask you, you want to keep the peace and calm in Ferguson President Obama yesterday came back from Martha's Vineyard to Washington, D.C. and said he was sending Attorney General Eric Holder to the area. That didn't keep the peace. No offense, sir, how is the local bishop going to keep the peace?

BISHOP EDWIN BASS, COGIC URBAN INITIATIVE PRESIDENT: Well, I certainly believe that we should try. And we have a number of clergy out in the community. I'm certainly not out there by myself. Out there trying to speak to both sides, trying to speak to both law enforcement and trying to speak to the protesters, out on the street and all we can do is try with the hope that it will bear some good fruit.

BOLLING: Ok.

BASS: But wouldn't it be not a good idea to sit back and just let things take care of themselves without some effort?

BOLLING: Bishop, all I keep hearing from the protesters and attorneys for Michael Brown and the family, they say they won't stop until they have justice. But they define justice as an indictment or an arrest of officer -- of the officer involved in the shooting. If there isn't an arrest right away, will we continue to have violence every night?

BASS: Well, again, my hope is that we will not. That the community will continue to do things, make adjustments in our strategy in the hopes that we will reduce the violence in the community. Obviously, it's going to take some time for the wheels of justice to grind. And get to the point of even indictment and ultimately of some adjudication. So, we are working during that period of time in an effort to bring some peace to the community.

BOLLING: Bishop, the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton and Reverend Jesse Jackson, does that help or hurt the situation in Ferguson?

BASS: Well, let me answer that this way. I believe that everybody is struggling, trying to find a solution to a very difficult situation. I believe those people, as well as the people here are trying to do that.

I really don't want to get into a discussion about individuals, other than to say that simply all of us, I think, want the same thing. We want peace, we want justice in the community. We want the community to return back to its normal operations. We want businesses working, people back to work. And anybody that can facilitate that, regardless of their ideology, regardless of their color, we are welcoming those people into our community.

BOLLING: Ok, Bishop then, if that's the case, the new Black Panther Party was actually calling out a chant kill Darren Wilson, kill the officer. Kill Darren Wilson would you tell the new Black Panther Party to leave the area and go back to wherever they came from?

BASS: I would not do that. And here is why I would not do that. Again, the goals of my organization and me personally are to speak to the issues of peace and of justice. And what we don't want to do is inflame the already high passions that are operating in the community so that's really not my place to do.

BOLLING: Sir, I apologize, I don't want to interrupt you, but aren't they in fact inflaming the already high tensions in the area by saying kill an officer? We don't even know what the facts are yet.

BASS: Well, I've never -- I have not heard that first of all. And secondly, again, we are focused on our agenda. And our agenda is one of reaching the community to preach the message of peace and justice. We're not called to put everything in order. We're not called to correct other people's points of view. We are called simply to deal with the issues and the agenda that we have.

BOLLING: All right, Bishop. We're going to leave it right there and say thank you very much, sir.",NA,0,NA,NA

A third autopsy on the body of Michael Brown completed, now this one by the Department Of Justice. Yesterday, a pathologist Michael Baden who performed earlier autopsy at the Brown family's request said the 18-year-old was shot at least six times including twice in the head.

And the Brown's family lawyer Ben Crump joins us. Good evening, sir.

BENJAMIN CRUMP, ATTORNEY FOR MICHAEL BROWN'S FAMILY: Good evening.

VAN SUSTEREN: It's nice to have you back, sir. We have spoken before.

CRUMP: Yes, ma'am, thank you for having me.

VAN SUSTEREN: We understand that this, sort of, a personal note that the funeral has been set for Monday, is that right?

CRUMP: Yes, ma'am.

VAN SUSTEREN: Any idea funeral plan would be closed to the public who will be eulogizing Michael Brown, anything like that.

CRUMP: The family is still going through that process, Greta. So, as soon as they make their final decisions, we will let y'all know.

VAN SUSTEREN: All right. You know, I can't even imagine what it's like for the parents. Is there -- you know, is there anything that you can say to them at this point? I mean, this is -- you know, as we've been watching what's been unfolding, they've lost a son and now we have all this violence out in Ferguson.

CRUMP: Yes, ma'am. They are very troubled by the violence. They have asked that people act responsibly and not do anything other than what's within the law. All the violence, they don't think at all that's what their objective is. And that is to get answers and get justice for their child being killed in broad daylight.

VAN SUSTEREN: What do you think Attorney General Eric Holder will accomplish going to Ferguson tomorrow.

CRUMP: You know, one of the things, Greta, and I think the people of Ferguson have a great distrust with the local St. Louis authorities. And so, looking at the federal government saying that we are going to ensure that it's going to be a fair and transparent process hopefully will give them some sense of confidence to where they won't feel Michael Brown's death will be swept under the rug. I think that is the greatest concern for a lot of the protesters that they've seen this happen before, where police officers kill young people of color and nobody knows what the process is, they come out and says justify and it's over.

And in this matter with Michael Brown Jr., I think, because it was out in broad daylight, because you have so many witnesses, and because he was shot multiple times. People feel very passionate about it. And the most troubling thing, I think, Greta, is for over four hours his body was laying on the concrete so by the time they finally did move him, not only was his mother and father there trying to get pass the police lines to get him but everybody, they had 100 people out there watching saying this is not right. And so, the community kept getting more passionate.

VAN SUSTEREN: Mr. Crump, I have not spoken to all the eyewitnesses and they will all be testifying behind closed doors in a grand jury proceeding as you and I both know being lawyers. And so, I don't know -- you know, I don't know what -- you know, what kind of evidence they're going to hear, but in the event that they conclude that this was not -- you know, that this was, for instance, an accidental shooting or not a murder, can your clients accept that if that happened? I mean, I have no idea how the facts are going to unfold. I know they got shot six times. That's horrible. I got that but, I don't know what the witnesses will say happened on the street.

CRUMP: You know, Greta, I think the clients want to see a process that is transparent, Grand juries are a secret proceeding, as you and I know as lawyers. And that is troubling because if they don't know what was told to grand jury, what was presented to grand jury. I think the people in Ferguson are going to be troubled by it. That's why they asked them for federal intervention, somebody who they feel can be objective, who didn't work with police officer who was the shooter and people who they think have no connections to the Ferguson police department or the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office, because these people have lived in this community for years. And this isn't the first police shooting of a young African-American that have had a lot of controversy surrounding it.

VAN SUSTEREN: I think for me as a bystander what's going to be very significant is when we see whether or not the clothes had any evidence of gunpowder residue which might suggest a closer shooting than a more distant one. Do you have any information about when, you know, when the clothing that Michael's wearing whether there was any indication there was gunpowder residue on it?

CRUMP: We don't, Greta. But as you know, Dr. Baden, the pathologist that is working on the family's behalf did the autopsy for the family, he has talked to the St. Louis county medical examiner and requested that that information as well as the X-rays to see what bullets were taken out of his body where casings were found at or near where tragic shooting took place but also whether there was any evidence in the police car of any kind of blood or evidence that would help us tell the whole story. Dr. Baden had said that the autopsy is only one part of the story.

But what you really need is to have all of the witness statements, all of the gunshot residue evidence, everything, so we can look at it very objectively and say, it is likely what the witnesses said happened or is it likely what the police officers said happened? And that's what we hope to get to. But if it's a grand jury proceeding that's closed, nobody in the community gets to hear that. And I think that's a problem for this community.

VAN SUSTEREN: And I agree. Both sides of this, you know, this, you know, this current issue, people made up their minds and haven't had the facts develop. And, you know, I don't know, I mean, the grand jury's always is a secret and I get around it. But that's only I agree, they creates an issue. And I thank you for joining us tonight, sir. And I hope you'll come back.

CRUMP: Thank you so much for having me.

Mumtaz Lalani is the owner of Dellwood Market and Sonny Dayan is the owner of St. Louis Cordless Communications. Welcome both of you to the program. Sonny, tell us what happened to your business? 

SONNY DAYAN, OWNER OF ST. LOUIS CORDLESS COMMUNICATIONS: Well, on Saturday night early morning I had a break-in. I got a call saying there were some movement and people inside my store basically looting. We called 911. The police said they can't do much about it and they can't come in.  I had to come in myself. And after a few hours I was able to get into the street. The street was blocked. And it's just a complete devastation, looking at the place, the difference, what it was when I left it and what it was when I found it. It was just a tremendous difference. Glass all over, shattered, merchandise was missing. 

HANNITY: We're seeing right now. Tell us about -- 

DAYAN: It was --

HANNITY: Tell us about your market.

MUMTAZ LALANI, OWNER OF DELLWOOD MARKET: Well, same story with me.  My son was there at the store until about 10:00. I told him, hey, come on down the store early, and as soon as he left the store, the alarm company called him and said there's a break-in at your store. So he called me at home, and I have surveillance at the house so I can watch my store. I saw there were about 30, 40 kids breaking, knocking my windows down and shooting at windows. And I called the police immediately. I said there is a big crowd out of my store. And by the time police get in there, they break in and empty almost my store with liquor, cigarette, beer, and try to put my store on fire at the same time. Sonny said he found some liquor bottles in the store. That must be from my store. They broke in there and had a picnic in your store. 

DAYAN: That's what it looks like. 

HANNITY: Nobody should have to go through that. That's one of the sadder parts of this story. And I hope you guys get your stores up and running in good time.

They were heard yelling death chants at Darren Wilson, who is the officer involved in this shooting.

Here with reaction to the chaos is the author of The New York Times best-seller ""One Nation,"" Fox News contributor Dr. Ben Carson. ""What do we want?"" The name of the officer. ""What do we want? We want him dead.""  You've heard those chants. Your reaction.

DR. BEN CARSON, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, this is obviously inflaming the situation. And you know, a lot of outside agitators seem to have descended on this situation. And I wish they would use that same energy to help us with what's going on in Chicago and Detroit and New Orleans and Washington, D.C., where just tons of shootings, murder, violence all the time, where we have tons of teenage pregnancy. Women giving birth, it ends their education. It sends their children into poverty. It continues the cycle of poverty and dependence. 

These are big problems for our country because we only have 320 or so million people.  We're competing on a global stage against countries that have over a billion people. We need all of our resources to be developed and to be developed well. We can't afford this.

HANNITY: Let me ask you, then, Dr. Carson, we had seven dead in Chicago -- and I'm only picking one city, and Ed Henry brought this up a little earlier -- 29 injured just over this past weekend. Now, as I understand it, you know, Reverend Jackson's from Chicago. The president's from Chicago. Why is it a case like this garners national attention and ongoing violence in a number of cities, many of which you mentioned, don't get the same attention?

CARSON: Because it's politically incorrect to blame the wrong people.  If you have somebody, you know, like a police officer, that's an easy one to blame. But it's very difficult to blame a city council or a mayor that you like or -- you know, this is a problem.

We have -- we've got to start being objective. We've got to stop picking and choosing who the villains are and who the good guys are. And we have to start looking at things objectively. That's the only way that we ever make progress.

And in particular, you know, in the black community, I think we have to be honest with ourselves. And you know, let's go back and think about a time, you know, before the early '60s, tremendous progress that was made by black people in this country when they relied on family and they relied on each other and they had faith.

And then what happened when we started relying on other people to do things for us and to tell us what we're supposed -- how we're supposed to think and who we're supposed to like and who we're supposed to follow? And where has that led? Not to a very good place. And we have to think about what we're talking about. You say, ""Death to the police"" -- try living for 24 hours with no police. I think you'll really find out what a difficult situation is.

HANNITY: Oh, I think that's the first duty of government, and that's to protect its citizenry. 

Let me ask you -- there was a lot of anger Friday over the release of the video of Michael Brown involved in this robbery, intimidating this store clerk. You know, the words that I heard a lot of people say, commentators, ""Well, first they assassinated him, now they're assassinating his character.""

Wouldn't this be important in terms of the legal aspect of this, that that might give us some insight into his state of mind when confronting an officer right after a robbery that he was involved in?

CARSON: Well, certainly, when it comes to the trial, that would be, obviously, an important piece of information. And I think it probably would be a very good thing for the authorities to try to expedite justice in this situation because the longer it takes, you know, the more deceives (ph) and the more suspicion that people have. So I think it would be possible to get a lot of information out very quickly with a concerted effort. I think that would have a very ameliorating effect on the atmosphere.

HANNITY: The president never called (ph) to try to hold back on the release of the tape. And you heard the president earlier today. What's your reaction to his handling of this in general?

CARSON: Well, you know, I'm proud to see that he has learned not to go in and prejudge the situation, as he has in other racially-charged situations. So that's progress. I just look at it that way. That's a good thing.

HANNITY: Why is there so much anger? You know, we had graffiti, ""The only good cop is a dead cop,"" you know, ""Kill the police,"" then you have, you know, the New Black Panthers, ""What do we want,"" the name of the officer. ""What do we want, him dead."" Where -- why is -- where is all this anger towards police coming from? Now, I understand that this is a volatile situation. We don't have all the facts. I wasn't there. You weren't there. Most people weren't there.

CARSON: Sure.

HANNITY: And I think it's an ongoing investigation. And I would urge people to withhold their judgment until the facts are in and then they can make an educated -- you know, come to an educated conclusion.

CARSON: Sure.

HANNITY: But there seems to be fairly widespread contempt and anger towards police. Why do you think that is?

CARSON: Well, as far as I can tell, there's not a long history of police shootings in that area that I know of. And maybe someone can correct me on that. But therefore, it seems to me like there's a lot of agitation going on.

And you know, part of the problem -- one of the things that I wrote about, you know, in ""One Nation,"" is hypersensitivity, false hypersensitivity, where people come in and they rev people up about all kinds of issues because, you know, someone said this word or somebody did this or -- and you get people into a frenzy.

It's almost like when you were in the 3rd grade and you had that kid who always ran around to someone saying, ""Did you hear what he said about your mama?"" And then he goes and says it to the other one so they can start a good fight. You know, why do we allow ourselves to be manipulated like this?

And I would be very much in favor of asking those people who are agitating, ""What would you like to see happen?"" There's an investigation that's going on. The legal process has been put into motion. What do you want to have happen that's not happening now? And let's hear a logical, cogent response to that.

HANNITY: All right. I'd also think the issues of selective moral outrage, socioeconomic conditions -- we'll talk about as the show goes on.  Dr. Carson, good to see you. Thank you for being with us.

CARSON: You, too. Thank you, Sean.",NA,45,NA,NA
FoxNews,fox45,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/08/18/president-obama-calls-calm-ferguson/,President Obama calls for calm in Ferguson ,Rush transcript from “The Five”,08/18/2014,10/30/2015,"ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Explosive new video of the latest round of rioting and protesting in Ferguson, Missouri, last night. Police fired tear gas into the crowd. Two were shot in the melee as tensions remain extremely high.

Those images prompted Missouri Governor Nixon to call in the National Guard. They'll attempt to do what the Ferguson police, the St. Louis County police and the Missouri state police could not do -- keep the peace in Ferguson.

In addition, he will end a curfew that has only seemed to incite more violence these last few nights.

Famed pathologist Dr. Michael Baden was called in by the brown family to perform a second autopsy. Here are the highlights of what he found.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DR. MICHAEL BADEN, FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST: In this instance there's no gunshot residues on the skin surface, so that the muzzle of the gun was at least one or two feet away. There are six bullets struck him. Six bullets struck, and two may have re-entered after the gunshot wounds fell flat down unprotected and got those abrasions. Otherwise, no evidence much a struggle.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: And President Obama weighed in just moments ago.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The Justice Department has opened an independent, federal civil rights investigation into the death of Michael Brown. I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown. Giving in to that anger by looting, or carrying guns, and even attacking the police only disserves to raise tensions. In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: OK. So, we have two topics. We have Michael Baden, Dr. Michael Baden doing the autopsy, telling us what he found. And then President Obama weighing in on what the way he sees Ferguson.

Start on Michael Baden. We heard him talk about six gunshots. He wasn't very definitive on a lot of things.

Did he answer any questions?

KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: I'll tell you why because he had the body. OK? But there's a lot of other evidence around forensics that if he had available to them he would examine that would help piece the puzzle together.

He's telling you what he knows about the young man's body, right? From head to toe, in terms of where the shots were. We know they all came from the front. But we know they weren't at such close range, that there was what's called GSR, gunshot residue.

What you do is when you discharge a weapon, the blowback comes across your hand. You would see that on a shooter, you would also see GSR on the body of the victim. And he's saying we didn't see that there. So, we know he was shot from the front but not right up like this. That also helps put some, I guess some light, shed some light onto the situation.

He would like to have all of the evidence with him in front of him in terms of all the bullets, stuff, et cetera because that's important to see the trajectory, where everything was coming from.

Right now, that doesn't necessarily help with the protester situation, saying that this was a young man that was murdered in cold blood with hands up. There are still some questions remaining as to his angling and posturing.

BOLLING: Go ahead. You want to jump into this? What -- did we learn anything new or do we just, you know, create more questions?

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: What was weird for me, I'm not a coroner. But there are people in the media that are interested in an unblemished narrative. They want it to be perfect.

So, you have a journalist at ""The New York Times"", Appelbaum I think is his name, tweeting why does it matter whether he was on drugs?

Well, it matters because it's a fact. And you're in journalism why would you discount a fact because you don't like the fact is part of the narrative that you wish to keep.

So, the yearn for an unblemished story line, and they're not going to get it. And the media, in the end, we're going to have more egg on their face than, I don't know, a guy with lots of eggs on their faces.

BOLLING: Dana, you interested by the way that press conference was delivered. You had the attorneys for Michael Brown come out and make some sometimes. And literally, Dr. Michael Baden refuted some of the things that the attorney had said literally minutes prior to that. I was just watching that in shock and awe. Like don't they get their story together?

DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Ideally, you would in a crisis communications situation. But from the beginning, with this story, whether it's from the police department, or from the families or from the protesters, or the looters themselves, no one is exactly in lockstep when it comes to locking down a story.

But that I think goes to Greg's point which is it's not necessarily going to be cut and dried. It's not going to fit into a novel.

You know, in a novel you have the ability to create characters, and you get to set the scene exactly as you want it. Real life isn't like that. It's harder, and the investigations take time.

BOLLING: Bob, a lot of this started, a lot of rioting started, with the hands up. Remember how many times we've seen hands up. We've seen attorneys do it. We've seen the family do it. We've seen Al Sharpton do it. The hands up was the issue.

Dr. Michael Baden wasn't able to lock down the fact that Michael Brown ever had his hands up when he was shot.

BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: Well, I'm not sure -- I mean, I just don't know enough about how all this stuff works to draw any conclusions about it.

The only thing I will say is the gunshot residue, Baden did say he would have liked to have the kid's clothes.

GUILFOYLE: Clothing.

BECKEL: That would tell whether there was some gunshot residue.

But I don't know what that says about your hands up, your hands down. I don't know. I assume Baden, if he thought he could draw some conclusions would have said something. He didn't say that.

So -- but I can't imagine, that during this event, that there weren't people around with cameras or something that took pictures of what happened. Maybe there weren't. But there certainly were witnesses.

The other thing that strikes me is the way rumors start flying around these things like this, you know, you had a night of calm, and then all of a sudden you have people who didn't want a night of calm.

GUTFELD: But, you know, can I address the reason why that changed? So much for kinder, gentler policing. Once you did this appropriate outreach with Johnson that was perceived as an appeasement in a way which is counterproductive to enforcement, we condemned the militarization which energized the looters, and unfortunately shopkeepers -- shopkeepers do not have the luxury of discussing tactical gear.

GUILFOYLE: Right.

GUTFELD: They have to protect their livelihoods. And we let them down. We might as well have just driven a bunch of trucks to help the looters take their stuff. You know, because we just said it was OK.

BOLLING: K.G., before we move on to President Obama's commentary, very quickly the cops. We haven't heard the cop's side of the story. We haven't heard the hospital reports from the police. We haven't seen any of the forensics from the cop's side of the story. What are they waiting for?

GUILFOYLE: They're trying to protect the investigation, the integrity of it, and make sure they have access to all the information which is ongoing, right? Because there could be other shop owners that come forward. There could be other video -- I've had stuff come in to an investigation two months in where all of a sudden the guy from the 7-Eleven says oh, actually I've got a tape that shows that angle or shows that intersection.

Now, you have some of the audio recordings showing other witness statement. Look, the cops didn't handle this right from the beginning but nevertheless they have a right to protect themselves, to defend themselves. They should not be held solely responsible on another hand because of the people, the looters, other people coming in to seek opportunity in a time of turmoil and grief.

So, let's let them get this together. Pull all the reports together, because guess someone else who deserves the benefit of the doubt, too, until we have all the facts is the officer involved.

BECKEL: Dana, let me say one thing about the -- when the night that Brown, there was a calm night, the one place I disagree is that there were a lot of people who took that as a signal from Chicago, to head on down there because they didn't want a calm night. So what they call themselves, revolution two, whatever they call it, went down there and being able to stir things up.

So, the last thing the people who want to stir things up want to see is a calm night, one. And two, I think that the media down there so far, the idea of taking a camera down, and walking up to the steps of this cop's house, is just to me just irresponsible.

GUILFOYLE: I agree.

BOLLING: Did President Obama -- he came to D.C. He left his Martha's Vineyard two-week vacation, came back to D.C. to say -- comment on Iraq, which I didn't hear anything majorly new about that. And number two, to comment on this.

Why?

PERINO: Well, it is -- it still remains a mystery as to the real reason that President Obama came back, because it was a week or so ago --

BOLLING: We don't know that yet?

PERINO: We don't know it yet. My prediction I'm holding onto it but it might be coming.

On Iraq, what president said that was new was that the Mosul -- the dam in Mosul has been secured. Hopefully, that is true and will continue to be true.

And the only real news that he broke on the Michael Brown situation in Ferguson is that he is asked Attorney General Eric Holder to travel down there. He will do so this Wednesday, and get a briefing, and that sends a signal from the White House that they're taking it seriously and they want a good investigation. Have to walk a line that Kimberly was suggesting which is that the police officers have a right to defend themselves and the community has a right to be defended.

BOLLING: Can I just follow up? So people were dying, the Yazidis were dying in the mount, 30,000, 50,000 were dying in the mountain. We were doing air strikes and he delivered that from Martha's Vineyard. But these two things --

PERINO: Again, the president of the United States, the White House press office, announced well over -- well before the Ferguson situation took place, and the developments in Iraq, that the president would be coming back for one day to meet with Vice President Biden.

It still remains a mystery. Maybe he just wanted to come home from a day. Get away from the vineyard -- I mean, as one would.

(CROSSTALK)

GUILFOYLE: As one would.

PERINO: Come back to the White House for a meeting.

(CROSSTALK)

BECKEL: What he said was, which is when you finally had people up against these big bad boys, they fled.

PERINO: In Iraq.

BECKEL: And they got the dam back -- in Iraq.

PERINO: Right.

BECKEL: So, my point is when you finally put something up in front of these guys except the girl scouts, you're going to start to drive them away. And they've driven away out of two towns and off the dam.

GUTFELD: That's -- OK. That's the lesson in all of this is that --

(CROSSTALK)

GUTFELD: -- there are certain people, criminals, who only listen to force. Looters respond to slugs, not hugs.

GUILFOYLE: Thank you.

GUTFELD: Once the police got once the politicians got the police to stand back and let the looters run wild, there's only one recourse and it's an armed populace. That's where you're going to end up. I almost said at the end of the day.

But the fantasy of the gun-free zone is now a fantasy. If you can no longer rely on law enforcement or your own government, your federal government, to protect you, all you could do is buy a gun and end the gun- free zone.

PERINO: Or you could leave. Or as a business owner, you can say, you know what? I'm out of here.

GUILFOYLE: Like Detroit. Like Detroit.

BOLLING: Let's transition to a perfect sound byte -- President Obama weighing in on the militarization of police forces. Listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: I think it's probably useful for us to review how the funding has gone. How local law enforcement has used grant dollars, to make sure that what they're -- what they're purchasing is stuff that they actually need. There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement and we don't want those lines blurred.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: So, they're giving us about a minute and a half.

PERINO: So, I just want to say that they don't want lines blurred. I can agree with that.

What's interesting is just two months ago, House of Representatives had a vote on militarization of police and this type of grant-making and giving this equipment, and 372 yes votes. So, now, maybe everybody's going to rethink. But 372 members of Congress are on record saying they support it.

BECKEL: I thought in these things -- I'm sorry, go ahead.

GUTFELD: Go ahead.

BECKEL: I was just going to say that the governor of Missouri says he was appalled by the militarization of the police on the one hand, and then the next thing he did was call up the National Guard. So, I'm not sure I quite understand that although I think he was appalled by it as I was -- the militarization of the police then he calls out the militants.

GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. They had to protect themselves.

BECKEL: They didn't.

GUTFELD: No, but you know -- I mean --

GUILFOYLE: Look what happened after they took that away. You had civilian shot, you had six officers injured. I'm just saying, once you're out there then you see the truth.

BECKEL: Give them tanks.

BOLLING: Wrap it up.

GUTFELD: Yes, I mean, if police are kept from policing, the message is abandon ship. And that's what's happening.

BOLLING: We're going to leave it right there.

Reverend Al Sharpton and the New Black Panthers are just some of the outspoken mouthpieces on the ground in Ferguson, Missouri. But are they posing any real solutions to the unrest or just fanning the claims of an already tense racial firestorm?

That debate when THE FIVE returns.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GUILFOYLE: Well, as Ferguson, Missouri, continues to smolder over the killing of an unarmed black teen -- have black leaders been doing more to stoke the fire than put it out? Listen to civil rights activist and current congressman, John Lewis, who warns discontent could spread.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. JOHN LEWIS (D), GEORGIA: Maybe Ferguson today, but tomorrow it could be some place else. We cannot have peace and order without justice.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUILFOYLE: Al Sharpton, meanwhile, takes direct aim as what he claims to be a rigged system.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST: All of my life, I've never seen nothing more despicable than while this mother and this father and their families haven't even had the time to bury their son the police chief would release a tape trying to disparage his name. How can the young folk of the city believe in a system that would try to spit on the name and character of a young man who hasn't been buried? We are not looters, we are liberators. We are not burners, we're builders.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUILFOYLE: Doesn't look like that from here.

And, finally, a Black Panther-led group was far less subtle, as they said, what they are calling for.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's his name?

CROWD: Darren Wilson!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is his name?

CROWD: Darren Wilson!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's his name?

CROWD: Darren Wilson!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's his name?

CROWD: Darren Wilson!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who do we want?

CROWD: Darren Wilson!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do we want him?

CROWD: Dead!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who do we want him?

CROWD: Darren Wilson!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do we want him?

CROWD: Indicted!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who do we want him?

CROWD: Darren Wilson!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do we want him?

CROWD: Indicted.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUILFOYLE: That ought to offend every single person on the planet basically calling for the death of an officer, whatever happened to someone said constitutional rights, the right to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt you don't see them serving justice or giving this officer a chance.

David, you're shaking your head.

GUTFELD: Well, I want to ignore whether the New Black Panthers because they're not worthy of the time on any network.

Let's go to Sharpton who is a waste of space, basically saying this is the worst thing he's ever seen. Apparently, he forgot about Tawana Brawley, the rape hoax that he helped, or the Freddy's Fashion Mart, which was tragedy that killed more than a handful of people that maybe had something to do with Al Sharpton -- Google Freddy's Fashion Mart.

Let's talk about John Lewis. John Lewis says it's a disgrace, the racial disparity between the community and the police. It's a disgrace but it's not the police's fault. You have to look at the facts.

What is necessary to occur to become a police officer? You have to be -- have a desire to be a cop, which isn't there. You cannot have a criminal history which is an issue. You need a minimum education.

So, these are all the things that end up killing the racial narrative that is being pushed right now that doesn't help anything but creates more divisiveness. If you just look at the facts -- cops would love to have more black applicants. They would die for it and they're not getting it.

GUILFOYLE: Eric?

BOLLING: Well, look, if there's -- if the ""B"" block is all about what's really going on in Ferguson, it's on one hand you have an investigation that's going on. We don't have any answers.

So, what's the next thing the other thing that's going on? We have a racial, I don't know, a racial divide that's widening perpetrated by Al Sharpton and New Black Panther Party. Jesse Jackson and anyone else who wants to make a name for themselves by saying look there's a problem here. There's a racial divide in Ferguson.

If the divide is the fact that there are three black cops out of 53 in a town that has a predominantly black population. So be it. That doesn't mean what officer --

GUILFOYLE: Wilson.

BOLLING: -- Wilson did was illegal. Or wrong.

GUILFOYLE: Obviously.

BOLLING: We still haven't found out their side of the story.

So, before -- before they start calling for the death of Officer Wilson, they should find out what the facts are. Maybe he was defending himself. Listen, I'm --

GUILFOYLE: He has a right, by the way, to use force whether the teen is armed or not.

(CROSSTALK)

BECKEL: That isn't so.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, it is so, Bob. Yes, it is.

BOLLING: For President Obama to come on television and say, we need to calm what's going on there. How about he says that? How about he says, hey, New Black Panther Party, cut the crap? How about Reverend Al Sharpton, cut the crap? Jesse Jackson cut the crap.

Get out of there. We'll handle this. Eric Holder will handle this.

GUILFOYLE: They're not helping the matter, they're making it far worse.

BECKEL: John Lewis doesn't have to make his name. He was the single bravest man in the civil rights movement and went to the hospital 68 times.

BOLLING: I didn't mention John Lewis, did I?

BECKEL: Well, no, you didn't.

GUILFOYLE: You did not.

BECKEL: John Lewis has every right in the world to express himself and say what is true and that is that there may be other situations like this. Let us be careful about this.

Now, I couldn't agree more about Sharpton. He made no sense except for the one thing. The one thing and Bill O'Reilly said this on the special which a few of us were here for on Friday night and that is -- well, I said, Bill, why do you think they released the tape the same day they released the name of the cop? He said probably to cover up for the cop.

And that's right. He was right about that. Releasing that tape was ridiculous, disgraceful, disgusting --

GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.

BECKEL: He was the police chief.

GUILFOYLE: It's also fact surrounding the circumstances of that --

BECKEL: You selectively would like to pick out a fact like that.

GUTFELD: This is the issue here.

GUILFOYLE: That's what I did for a living, Bob. I know a bit about it.

GUTFELD: You talk about toxicology and when you talk about the video, people want the facts, unless it's the facts that don't fit their story.

GUILFOYLE: Exactly.

GUTFELD: Then the facts don't matter.

BECKEL: What is the fact about that video?

GUTFELD: Now, we knew what was happening before and we also know the mind-set of Mr. Brown --

GUILFOYLE: Of the officer, too.

GUTFELD: Maybe the officer didn't know anything about Mr. Brown, but Mr. Brown didn't know that. He didn't know that the cop didn't know. And that plays a role in his behavior.

And then if you look at the toxicology report that also plays a factor. How? I have no idea. I'm not a doctor.

BOLLING: I know we -- Dana, just one thing -- Bob, you want facts. Most of this stuff, most of this strike started with people holding up their hands in the streets saying, he was executed.

GUILFOYLE: Hands up, yes.

BOLLING: His hands were up when he was shot and we still have --

BECKEL: How do you know he wasn't? We don't know.

(CROSSTALK)

GUILFOYLE: Oh my gosh. And the officer was treated at the hospital for facial injures, as well. Oh, my gosh! Come on!

Why do you want everybody to be a bad guy. Why do you want him --

BECKEL: Have you ever met a bad cop in your life?

GUILFOYLE: Why don't you want everything to be racist?

BECKEL: Who said racist? Have you ever met a bad cop in your life?

GUILFOYLE: Oh, come on. That's such a ridiculous question. The bottom line is: don't assume that they're all bad.

BECKEL: I did not assume that that all.

GUILFOYLE: -- racial divide.

BECKEL: I also don't assume -- and I assume there's the fact about him having gun holes in his body is a fact that should be considered. What's not a fact that should be considered is he was trying to lift some cigarettes out of a store.

GUILFOYLE: Fine.

Dana?

PERINO: I'm OK, I'll catch up in the ""C"" block.

GUILFOYLE: I like to hear Dana.

PERIN: I am going to -- I'll comment later on.

GUILFOYLE: In the Greg-alogue.

GUTFELD: And you can't just back out of a segment.

PERINO: I think the ratcheting up of the rhetoric is absolutely unhelpful and Al Sharpton has passed his sell-by date. As soon as everybody smells the rottenness of what he is saying, the better off we'll be. But right now, we're not at that place.

President Obama is trying to fill a gap. And he's trying to be -- I think he's trying to walk a line that's very fine. I don't know if he exactly did it. But it didn't seem like he fell off, OK? So, he's got the safety net is Eric Holder going in there on Wednesday, and hopefully tonight, everything can calm down. And then we can start to solve the problem.

But until we actually have more facts, and all of the facts, then a lot of this speculation and the ratcheting up in the community is completely unhelpful.

How's that?

GUILFOYLE: I am so glad that I insisted.

Coming up: while the media spot light has been shining brightly on Ferguson, Missouri, bloodshed in Chicago and New York city has not drawn a similar response. Greg breaks down the media's agenda, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GUTFELD: What do you call six dead and 25 wounded? A weekend in Chicago.

Such crime is so mundane, it's become background music for bad neighborhoods. So why doesn't the media approach this chaos with the same fervor as they do with Ferguson? Repetitive violence doesn't excite because it's not crystallized in to one stark act. It doesn't produce the imagery that Pulitzer protein that builds portfolios and careers.

Also, a reporter only needs to hoof it to Ferguson for a week. You want to tackle bigger violence, that's full time, the incidents are too frequent and the cops are too sympathetic and that's pretty boring.

We've been down this road before because the road never changes. Ferguson, Trayvon and even Newton -- these are media musts because they fit a greater story line, one that often emits facts that don't fit. The media believes such stories carry a bigger social impact, unlike the horrors that kill more innocents daily.

And so, their lopsided coverage is actually self-fulfilling, making the story bigger and expanding the suffering. Politicians retreat in response to the media's gaze, acting out of concern for the world view, but not for the shopkeeper. That's why you have riots and no riot police.

With mundane death, you can't raise money off it, you can't raise your profile off it and you can't raise any hell. But with Ferguson, you could do all that. Facts be damned.

So, Dana, certain types of violence are accepted just because they're common. Or is it because it's just not exciting?

PERINO: I think when something like this -- when something happens every day or every weekend, like you mentioned Chicago, then it does become a little bit routine and it moves to the back pages because there's nothing different, there's nothing new.

Michael Brown being shot in Ferguson was different. An unarmed black teenager shot by a white police officer. That is different. Black on black violence, however, which we've talked about on the show, that gets less and less coverage and gets moved to the back pages.

GUTFELD: Yes. Eric, you know what drives me nuts if you have a lot of outsiders coming into a town like Ferguson. Then they will leave, and what's left behind are the shop owners, and the police -- the police officers left picking up the pieces.

BOLLING: Yes. And the street cleaners. Can I call CNN out right now? So this morning I'm watching CNN, and they have the Piaget Crenshaw, the first real eyewitness who's come on television. She said she watched the whole thing happen from her balcony only a few feet above the crime scene. She videotaped what happened after with the officer standing over the dead body. But she had said she witnessed the whole thing.

So she was asked a question what happened. She goes through what happened, which is very compelling. And it corroborates everything we've heard from other eyewitnesses, as well.

But then something happened. This -- I can't remember the name of the lady who does the morning show, didn't ask the follow-up question. She just took it as fact, didn't ask about hands up, didn't ask about who was charging, what was going on. She turned to an emotional interview: ""I hear something in your voice. You tell us how you feel."" After one question of what happened. Your first interview with the facts, and she turns to what's the emotion. CNN failed miserably this morning. That was the moment to find out.

I hope someone on FOX gets this woman and gets her in front of a camera and says, ""What happened after that first -- you say he was shot, he turned, he was shot again. Tell us more about what that was all about?""

Unbelievable. Are they complicit?

GUTFELD: They want the interview. They want a narrative. They want their narrative to be pure.

Bob what do you think about the media reaction with different types of crimes? We've talked about this a lot.

BECKEL: Yes, we have. But I think, look, as Dana said, you have a white cop killing an unarmed black kid, which is not the situation in Chicago. Chicago has gone on for a long time. As I've said for a long time, it is a gang war over drugs.

These are two specific gangs. They've been after each other now for twelve, thirteen years, and a lot of people die. It's much, much different than what happened in Ferguson.

So should they go in to be talking about it? Should Sharpton and the rest of them do it? I don't know how you deal with gang-on-gang violence when you have that much drugs and that much money involved. But that's what Chicago is. It is a drug war.

GUTFELD: But it's a drug war everywhere, and it's -- and there are innocent bystanders, little girls shot.

BECKEL: That's true. That's exactly right.

GUTFELD: Kimberly...

GUILFOYLE: Yes.

GUTFELD: ... shootings, I guess shootings went up 10 percent in New York over last year.

GUILFOYLE: Mm-hmm.

GUTFELD: So this is something that is also not being covered as well as it should.

GUILFOYLE: No. I mean, the only time you hear news, really, that's relevant and important is when we talk about New York on this show. I mean, you don't -- you don't hear this stuff covered.

And in terms of the case in Ferguson, for me it just -- it bothers me so much that people are looking for race in this solely, that no matter what, if you've never even met an individual, you're just going to assume that they're a racist. Why is that? Why does it always have to be that the officer is a bad person, whoever is the shooter is the bad person? Why can't you just assess the facts, take them for what they are, make your decision instead of right away doing the rush to judgment? For people like al Sharpton.

BECKEL: Who said he was a racist? Who thinks he's a racist?

GUILFOYLE; I'm just saying Bob when I hear the things you're saying, you're...

GUTFELD: You did earlier...

GUILFOYLE: You just said it on the show.

GUTFELD: You said, ""Aren't there bad cops?""

BECKEL: I didn't say about this cop. Now wait. Let's be clear about this. I never once said -- not once did I suggest in any way that this cop was a racist or the fact this was a racially motivated crime. I didn't say that. I said that you can't say all cops are good cops when you look at what's happened in other areas. There have been bad cops.

GUILFOYLE: But we're not saying that. What we're talking about is looking at the individual facts...

BECKEL: OK. But don't lay -- don't lay -- me call the guy a racist. I don't know who he is. He could be -- for all I know he could have been - - go down to your civil rights board every week.

GUILFOYLE: That's it. We don't know.

GUTFELD: On that note, directly ahead, Texas Governor Rick Perry gets support from liberals as he vows to fight his indictment for alleged abuse of power. Is he facing trumped-up charges? Details next on ""The Five.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(MUSIC: KENNY ROGERS, ""THE GAMBLER"")

PERINO: So weird. This morning I was thinking that that song would be perfect for this block. Joshua and I are tracking today. That's good.

GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.

PERINO: In Texas some Democrats may have lost their minds when they followed through on a threat to indict Texas Governor Rick Perry on trumped-up charges for abusing his veto power, in an indictment the ""New Yorker"" calls ""unbelievably ridiculous."" Former Clinton special counsel Lanny Davis says Democrats must denounce it, and former White House advisor David Axelroad -- Axelrod, excuse me, tweeted, ""Unless he was demonstrably trying to scrap the ethics unit for other than his stated reasons, Perry indictment seems pretty sketchy.""

Perry came out swinging on Saturday at the state capitol.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GOV. RICK PERRY (R), TEXAS: It is outrageous that some would use partisan political theatrics to rip away at the very fabric of our state's constitution.

I intend to fight against those who would erode our state's constitution and laws purely for political purposes. And I intend to win.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: Kimberly, I'm going to go to you first. I have a question. So that he basically threatened to veto funding for a state office unless the woman that ran it...

GUILFOYLE: Public Integrity.

PERINO: The Public Integrity -- she was a viciously partisan prosecutor. She was jailed for drunken driving.

GUILFOYLE: Point 2-3 blood alcohol, could kill a whole family in a car.

PERINO: So irresponsible behavior. The governor said, ""We're not going to have any of that.""

GUILFOYLE: Almost three times the legal...

PERINO: To come back and now he's in trouble for threatening the veto?

GUILFOYLE: He's in trouble for upholding the law and exercising his legal authority to do so.

You have to understand, this is the grand jury system there in that county that brought the charges against Tom DeLay that an appeals court 2-1 reversed. OK. So they're used to creating this kind of damage. But are they on sound legal footing? They also did the same thing with Kay Bailey.

So there's a pattern in practice here of politicizing the judicial process, in that particular county, actually, that should be investigated.

So Governor Perry has every right to defend himself, to make these statements and to use the law. He's the governor of the state, and let's see what ultimately goes to what a jury says about this.

PERINO: Governor Perry, Greg, in the 2012 presidential election during the primary, he embarrassed himself a little bit when he had that mess up in the debate.

GUTFELD: Right.

PERINO: But he's been coming back a little bit. So do you think that the Democrats are trying to usurp...

GUTFELD: I don't know. It's good to see him come out swinging, and I think it was important.

She's a watchdog over political corruption, and yet she's publicly corrupt. There's no -- I mean that's like having a drug dealer running the DEA. You can't have that. So it makes perfect sense.

And by the way, I mean, it's good that we don't show the tape of it. Her tape is embarrassing. It's sad.

PERINO: It's good for her that we won't show it.

GUTFELD: Yes. It's good for her. But in the tape she's basically telling these people, ""You are ruining my career. If you do this you are ruining my career."" Well, she might -- she didn't consider that when she was prosecuting people. She didn't consider that she was ruining people's careers. So I don't think she -- I think what he -- this story is going to be gone in 24 hours.

GUILFOYLE: Remember she had the open bottle of vodka in her car, too. Charming.

PERINO: Shouldn't the Democrats have disagreed with Perry and said she should resign?

BECKEL: Absolutely not. I think Perry -- I'm real surprised at some of my fellow liberals I think are wusses in this.

Look, you went through -- I lived in Travis County for two years, and I tell you it is Democratic. That's true. But you all want to follow the law. The law was a grand jury was convened and found this guy had violated the law. He is one of the most partisan politicians in the country. He did violate the law. And this was...

GUILFOYLE: How do you know he violated the law?

BECKEL: Greg said she was corrupt. There's no such indication of corruption. You're suggesting something that happened on a drunk traffic charge that was last year. How does that make her bad?

GUILFOYLE: I'm trying to follow and connect your dots.

BECKEL: OK.

GUILFOYLE: It's hard.

BECKEL: You're saying that he decided he was going to withhold this money because he didn't like this woman.

GUILFOYLE: He was saying that he's going to withhold from that specific office...

BECKEL: Yes. Because of that woman.

PERINO: But Bob, she runs the Public Integrity office. I mean, have you seen the videotape of her behavior?

BECKEL: No, but there are a lot of politicians who have been drunk who run public integrity offices.

PERINO: OK, all right, now...

GUILFOYLE: That's a great defense.

GUTFELD: That's not a good defense, Bob.

BECKEL: This is the same Perry that had that racial...

Doesn't that warm your heart?

(CROSSTALK)

GUTFELD: Yes, that was...

BOLLING: Oh, there you go. Throw that in.

PERINO: Is there a pattern. Is there a pattern? Is there a pattern here, Eric, when you see that Chris Christie, Scott Walker, now Rick Perry. Any governor that seems to be doing fairly well in their state, they get attacked from the left?

BECKEL: You've got a big conspiracy going on here.

BOLLING: I'm not sure -- OK, I think, as Kimberly points out, this group in Texas has a tendency to do this -- Kay Bailey Hutchinson is the other one that comes to mind -- against Republicans.

Very quickly I think the issue is that the announced the reason for vetoing the budget. Rather than just vetoing the budget with a wink and a nod he had to go ahead and say it's because of this woman who was, you know, he felt was -- shouldn't be in the job. Had he just done it like every other politician in the world would do, he wouldn't be in any trouble. He wouldn't be indicted.

Did they really fingerprint him and get a mug shot of him? Is that...

PERINO: They're supposed to sometime this week.

BECKEL: I hope so.

BOLLING: A standing governor. I mean, come on.

PERINO: Actually, that's the whole thing...

BECKEL: Duly elected official.

PERINO: I think that's the whole reason for this is they want the picture of him on file.

GUILFOYLE: Of course they do.

BECKEL: That's a big conspiracy. We've got all these governors who have lined up, and we'll get them.

PERINO: And Rick Perry is going to be on ""Hannity"" tonight.

BECKEL: And Rick Perry is a jerk.

GUILFOYLE: You know what, Bob?

GUTFELD: Ad hominum attack, quite elegant.

GUILFOYLE: Why don't you try and be mature?

PERINO: All right. Ahead on ""The Five,"" this is going to be very exciting. We're going to make history. No, not the stuff Bob does and, you know, this day in history stuff but actual history. An inside source with three-time Grammy award winner Brad Paisley sent me his brand-new country song. It's called ""Country Nation."" It's yet to be released, and you can only hear it here on ""The Five"" if I decide to play it in the next block as my ""One More Thing.""

But first, Bob will give you tips on spotting liars and whether or not I was lying about my big reveal. Which I'm not. So stay tuned.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BECKEL: Welcome back. Ever wonder how you can know if someone's lying? Well, besides a growing nose like Pinocchio, here are five ways, according to experts, you can sniff out a fibber.

No. 1, a person's demeanor or voice radically changes.

Two, a person avoids saying ""I."" I, I, I.

Three, a person has an answer for everything.

Four, a person fidgets, and -- what is that? -- fusses for no reason.

And five, a person proclaims his or her honesty repeatedly.

Greg, you buy into that?

GUTFELD: Yes. You know when -- you know you can tell someone's lying? When they go play golf right afterward.

BOLLING: And before.

GUTFELD: And before.

GUILFOYLE: My goodness.

BECKEL: All right. Dana, what do you think? You think that's -- that's accurate?

PERINO: Yes. I like -- I like -- remember when you said the body language expert on FOX News, and she could tell you if somebody was lying. I like watching that.

GUTFELD: yes. Turned out she was -- she was lying the whole time.

BOLLING: She was lying.

PERINO: Oh, really?

GUTFELD: Yes.

PERINO: She didn't know what she was talking about?

GUTFELD: She wasn't -- no.

PERINO: I believed that? Really?

BECKEL: This study says that people lie on average three times in ten minutes.

GUTFELD: I'm kidding.

PERINO: Oh.

BOLLING: The book says liberal lies three times.

BECKEL: No, it doesn't. Nope, nope it doesn't. No, no, that's -- that's an ad hominum attack.

GUILFOYLE: Is this a real segment?

BOLLING: No.

BECKEL: Hey, kiss me.

GUILFOYLE: Hey.

BECKEL: Kiss the moon.

Hey, she says here a study conducted at the University of Massachusetts researcher Robert Feldman found 60 percent of people lie in a common conversation, people like about three times per ten minutes. What do you think?

GUILFOYLE: About what?

BECKEL: Do you think that's an accurate statement?

BOLLING: That's great. What are those hands behind my head? What is that?

GUILFOYLE: Fingers crossed.

BECKEL: Why does nobody want to respond to this? Does anybody find that...

PERINO: Because we're all worried you're going to think we're lying.

GUILFOYLE: I don't know. I mean, this is kind of lame. Because it says a person proclaims his honestly repeatedly. What are you supposed to say?

BECKEL: Kimberly, it's lame because I always get lame segments. So don't feel badly about it.

GUILFOYLE: No. I'm not talking about your block being lame...

BECKEL: So there you go.

GUILFOYLE: I'm saying -- I'm saying these factors, I think, are a little bit ridiculous, because the point is if somebody is telling you they didn't do something, I'd like them to say it. I don't care if they say it 100 times. If they say it emphatically, I'm going to look at how they say it, not the fact that they deny it, to say that they're lying.

BOLLING: Let's take it out. Can you take Bob's camera three? Is President Obama doing a good job?

BECKEL: Yes. I think so.

PERINO: Yes, see. He's...

BOLLING: You were fidgeting.

BECKEL: No, I wasn't.

PERINO: You know what? I think as an adult as you get older, there are less people that lie to you. Don't you think that's true?

GUTFELD: That's because they're all dying.

PERINO: I mean, I don't have -- I don't really think there's any...

BECKEL: I think that's true, because people can't remember what they -- what they say when you lie.

GUILFOYLE: How about you?

BECKEL: I can't remember. That's one reason I really don't lie that much, because I can't remember what I said.

GUILFOYLE: You can't remember what you said last block.

BECKEL: Sweetheart, you -- I know what you said. And I ain't going to forget it.

GUILFOYLE: Uh-oh.

BECKEL: You got it coming, too.

Anyway, this is a typical Bob's liberal segment here. Thanks. We had a chance to cover Ferguson. We've had a chance to cover some big deals, but no, we'll get down to Bob and, like, Rick Perry. OK. One More Thing is up next.

GUILFOYLE: You better stay out of Texas.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BOLLING: Time for ""One More Thing."" We're going to start with Dana with some big news.

PERINO: OK. I'm very excited, because I've never really leaked anything before. I used to, like, try to prevent leaks in my old job, and now I get to leak a very special song from Brad Paisley, three-time Grammy award winner, one of my favorite country music singers.

He sent us this little new song. It's called ""Country Nation."" You're going to hear it here first.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

(MUSIC: BRAD PAISLEY, ""COUNTRY NATION"")

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: That was the first time I got to see it, too. Kimberly just said she's going to learn how to two step.

GUTFELD: These bands are so diverse.

BECKEL: What did you say about...

GUILFOYLE: I had to do the Puerto Rican...

BECKEL: ... a song that...

PERINO: Greg is not the biggest country music fan, but he really likes that song.

BECKEL: But what did you say about -- he was doing a song and there were two of us from the bands...

GUILFOYLE: Whoa!

BOLLING: Can I point something out, Brad Paisley? One of the -- White House correspondents, a big fan of ""The Five,"" big fan of Dana Perino, as well.

PERINO: And also his dad is a big fan of ""The Five,"" as well. I think it's a great song. It's about American culture and patriotism, and we thank you so much. We're honored.

BOLLING: K.G. -- Cage, you're up.

GUILFOYLE: OK. ""La Bamba"" or not? I've got a dancing ""One More Thing"" with Governor Christie busting a move with Jamie Foxx. You knew he liked to dance, right?

GUTFELD: That's horrifying.

GUILFOYLE: This is at the Apollo in the Hamptons, benefit Sunday night. Saturday night. Oh, my gosh.

BOLLING: That's what happens when you lose 120 pounds, I guess. He's showing off.

GUILFOYLE: It's not bad.

GUTFELD: It's not good.

PERINO: He can do better.

GUTFELD: That should never be seen.

PERINO: Can you do better?

GUTFELD: Oh, yes. But I never would.

GUILFOYLE: Not John Travolta-esque.

BOLLING: All right. Have you seen enough of him yet?

GUILFOYLE: Right.

Bobby, you're up.

BECKEL: Good. That's good. Great.

There's two polls out that should make members of both parties very, very worried. Because they are at an all-time high for these poll outfits. Gallup polled ""Do most members of Congress deserve to be reelected?"" They've asked this for 25 years, and this is the highest it's ever been. No, 74 percent. Yes, 19 percent. That bodes not well for Democrats in the Senate, nor Republicans in the House of Representatives.

In the ""Post""/ABC of Congressman job approval. Here's one that I find most amazing. I've been in politics a long time. Fifty-one percent of the people think that their own representative should not be re-elected. Now, usually you'll find that people will say a lot of people shouldn't be re- elected, but I love my own member of Congress.

PERINO: True.

BECKEL: Something that we always depended on when we were doing campaigns. This time around, 51 percent saying their own representative does not deserve re-election. That is stunning to me, and if it's accurate, and I think it probably is, there's going to be some surprises come November.

PERINO: Fine. That will make it fun.

GUILFOYLE: Do you have the -- what is it, the fortune teller thing, Bob's prediction? Remember that?

BECKEL: I'll do that. I'll do that.

GUILFOYLE: That was kind of cool. Bring it back, people.

GUTFELD: Well, I was going to leak something, but then I went to the doctor. All right. I haven't had a banned phrase in about two days. Let's ban this phrase.

GUILFOYLE: What do you mean?

GUTFELD: ""I can't thank you enough."" Yes, you can. Just say, ""Thank you."" Or if you can't thank you me enough, buy me a gift.

GUILFOYLE: Yes.

GUTFELD: If you can't thank me enough, go to Tiffany's and get me a nice thing.

PERINO: Or some wine.

GUTFELD: Or some wine, perhaps. Wine is always a good gift.

GUILFOYLE: It really is.

GUTFELD: I got a gift of wine yesterday. But pens, I lose. I got a gift of wine yesterday and the bag broke. It shattered all over the lobby of my apartment. And I was slightly inebriated, and I was on my hands and knees, cleaning up -- cleaning it up.

GUILFOYLE: And you got shards of glass.

GUTFELD: I had shards of glass and children walking around me.

PERINO: Is there a video?

GUTFELD: No, I'm a pathetic individual.

GUILFOYLE: Well, this is a problem. Give it in a cushioned wine bag when you give it to Greg.

GUTFELD: Yes, exactly.

BOLLING: All right. Very quickly, my ""One More Thing."" I'm hosting ""The O'Reilly Factor"" tonight, 8 p.m. We're going to be live in Ferguson. We're going to take a look in there. Bill O'Reilly is...

BECKEL: Is he in Ferguson?

BECKEL: No, but you have trouble on the ground in Ferguson. Bill O'Reilly is going to call into his own show. It's going to be very interesting, and he's going to weigh in on all the events.

And also -- can we take camera two for a second? -- Paul Ryan wrote a brand-new book. This is Dana's book. I couldn't get my hands on the book. Dana loaned it to me for the weekend. It's a fantastic read.

GUILFOYLE: ... forward.

BOLLING: I love your notes. We -- we have similar ideas of what's important.

BECKEL: Was that -- so this is from the publisher, it's free to you. So this one she gives me.

PERINO: No, it was better than the ones I usually give you. It's actually very good. I thought it was great. It was a wonderful personal story.

BOLLING: Bob Beckel -- hold on. Breaking news, Bob Beckel is trending on Twitter.

PERINO: For what? What did he do?

FoxNews,fox46,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/08/19/ferguson-unrest-continues/,Ferguson unrest continues,Rush transcript from “The O'Reilly Factor”,08/18/2014,10/30/2015,"Hi, I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight.

Let's get straight to our ""Top Story"" the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. There have been dramatic and fast moving developments today. And Bill O'Reilly himself will be joining us with his analysis in just a moment. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has deployed the National Guard in Ferguson as local and state authorities struggle to control the chaos. Ferguson is bracing for yet another night of turmoil after fierce clashes between police and a group of protesters, last night the worst seen yet.

With the situation seemingly spiraling out of control President Obama announced today that he is sending Attorney General Eric Holder to the area to help oversee the federal investigation into Michael Brown's death. While the President appealed for calm he also said he sympathized with growing frustration in the African-American community.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: In too many communities around the country a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: Joining us now on the phone Bill O'Reilly. Bill, you heard that sound bite. Is that fair? Is that a fair assessment the President has to make? That you know it's all about, you know, men of color in communities or is this more? Is this bigger?

BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST (via telephone): Let's take a look at the stats I mean the facts really will tell the story in Ferguson, Missouri. Last year 2012, I'm sorry 2012 the latest stats we have from the FBI. There were 12 million total arrests in the United States of America. That averages about roughly 34,000 arrests per day across the country, all right? 34,000 arrests every single day. Do you know how many police shootings there were? 420 per year average.

So you've got 12 million arrests, 420 police shootings. And they call them homicides. Sometimes they are justifiable. Sometimes they are not. We don't have stat breakdown on how many police were convicted but not many. So this is an infinitesimal situation. It doesn't happen and those people who run in to Ferguson or any other city and say the police are hunting down young black men are lying and they're grossly insulting law enforcement across the country because this stat shows it all, this tells it all.

All right let's go to Ferguson, Missouri. There has never been, as far as we can tell and we have investigated, a police shooting in that town -- never. All right so again the people that ran there and are screaming about young black men being gunned down in the street it doesn't happen that much in this country.

Of all the police shootings 42 percent are white; 32 percent black; 20 percent Hispanic -- all right? So, it isn't one racial group. Now, black men are, you know, 13 percent of the population African-American. So it's higher. But it is in proportion to the crimes committed. All right so those are the stats.

Now let's get to the press coverage which is grossly irresponsible. The first thing everyone should know listening to THE FACTOR tonight is that most television journalists are terrified, terrified of being labeled a racist. Therefore, they are never going to challenge any kind of smear thrown out in any kind of a situation.

For example, on MSNBC, they put on a woman who said that Michael Brown was shot in the back. All right? That is a lie. We now know that because of the autopsy. Was it challenged by MSNBC? No, it was not. It was put out there as fact.

OK. So, there is my opening salvo. Now I want to praise Congressman John Lewis from Georgia, an old civil rights guy he's been around forever in Congress. He struck the right tone yesterday on ""Meet the Press"". He said that all Americans should be concerned when any American of any color is shot six times by a police officer and is unarmed -- all right. Concerned -- every American should be concerned they shouldn't be judging because they weren't there and that includes the racial provocateurs that go in and try to stir up trouble. And we all know their names. We all know who they are. They weren't there they don't know what happened.

The autopsy shows that the young man was shot six times, had marijuana in his bloodstream. The tape shows that shortly before the confrontation with the police officer, the young man stole stuff from a convenient store and not assaulted but pushed a clerk who is half his size. Mr. Brown was close to 300 pounds and 6'4"".

Now, when that tape was released what did we hear in the media? This was a smear against Michael Brown, the victim. A smear -- how can facts be a smear? How is that possible? If you want a transparent investigation which I do, you have to put the facts out.

Now I am very, very upset that Michael Brown's family and friends have to go through this. I saw his mother on ""Good Morning America"" today and it's heart-breaking. But when you have facts in a case and there are people who are trying to exploit the case in a violent way, you have to put the facts out.

And the facts are that this young man did something wrong, was walking down the middle of the street and a confrontation happened. We don't know why. We don't know how. We don't know what happened. Let the justice system play out.

Now, politics. President Obama is within -- is doing the right thing by calling for calm. That's all he should do. He can't get involved with the criminal case. I have no problem with Attorney General Holder going to Ferguson, Missouri. I have no problem with that because the state authorities there have botched the case. And the local authorities are the Keystone Cops. So let's get the feds in and do a transparent investigation. That's what every good American should want -- to know the truth.

Finally 00 no justice, no peace. There are 100 people -- that is according to authorities -- that are causing trouble in Ferguson. They are violent people, they're throwing Molotov cocktails. Some of them are armed -- 100, that's all. But that's enough to bring out the Guard and bring out all because they can cause a lot of damage. These are anarchists, these are haters, these are new Black Panther Party. These are zealots -- all right. They have to be controlled because they will hurt the people. But it's not the African-American community. They're concerned and they should be. They should be. But let's keep everything in perspective and let's deal with the facts.

All right. What else do you want to know, Eric?

BOLLING: Well so, let's stay on that for a second. Let's talk about the facts. You know, I'm going to push back a little bit on you. I agree with almost everything you have to say there but part of the problem, if you remember, Bill, this young man was shot on Saturday. One of the first things we started hearing about the protesters, the rioters, the looters from the attorneys, to the families to the race merchants were the hands up. Remember the hands up he had the international sign of surrender and he was shot execution style. We heard it over and over again.

Why didn't the Ferguson Police Department, the Police Chief Tom Jackson release some of the facts that we're learning now. CNN today had an eyewitness on. She was asked about the video she took. She witnessed the whole thing. Never once was asked about the hands up. She was asked one question what happened. She went through it and then afterwards, the host, I can't remember her name, said oh, I see the emotion on your face in your voice. And she went to an emotional interview instead of asking for the facts. And the facts, Bill, may clear up a lot of the reason, a lot of anxiety that's going on in Ferguson.

O'REILLY: Yes. And we're not going to get the facts for a while. Number one, the police department in Ferguson is in over their head. They are panicking, they didn't know how to present it, they should have hired somebody immediately to go out and be their PR spokesman because they couldn't do it. All right that's number one.

Number two the woman you are talking about on CNN. I did not see the interview but I can tell you she is terrified. Absolutely they are all terrified, Eric, of saying anything that a race hustler might turn around and say oh, look, you're a racist. Look, you know that kind of thing.

So, no justice, no peace. These people don't want justice. What if the facts come out and say it was a justifiable shooting by the police officer? This guy was coming at him? What if they say that? Do you think these people are going to accept that?

BOLLING: Just ask -- I agree with you. She is probably scared to death. But why can't a CNN or an MSNBC just ask the darn question and let --

(CROSSTALK)

O'REILLY: Look I don't speak to that I speak to what we do on the Fox News Channel.

BOLLING: Ok.

O'REILLY: And we ask the questions that need to be asked. But, that being said, Eric that being said, you don't try the case on television.

BOLLING: Fair enough.

O'REILLY: All right. You just don't know.

BOLLING: A lot of these -- a lot of these rioters are getting their information from TV. Bill, they are actually wrapping me on your show. This could be the first -- it may be the last. Bill -- Bill O'Reilly thank you very much.

Al Sharpton called the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in suburban St. Louis a ""defining moment for this country.""

Sharpton spoke Sunday at a rally in Ferguson, where days of protest have ended with almost nightly confrontations between police and protesters.

Sharpton says he wants Congress to stop programs that provide military-style weaponry to police departments. He says he expects police to ""smear"" the slain teenager, his family and his attorneys.

He also condemned the recent spate of violence and looting in Ferguson.",NA,24,NA,NA

Al Sharpton says the shooting of a black Missouri teenager by a white police officer – which has spurred a week of rancorous and sometimes violent protests in suburban St. Louis – will become a “defining moment on how this country deals with policing.”

The civil rights activist, speaking at a rally Sunday afternoon in Ferguson, Mo., also urged people who are protesting the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown to remain peaceful in their actions.

“Some are angry and out of control. And others are taking advantage of it. And don’t take advantage of their child,” said Sharpton, referring to Brown’s parents.

“Don’t loot in Michael’s name,” he added. “We are not looters, we’re liberators. We are not burners. We are builders.”

The plea followed the first night of a state-imposed curfew in Ferguson, which ended with tear gas and seven arrests after police dressed in riot gear used armored vehicles to disperse defiant protesters.

Brown, who was unarmed, was shot to death in the middle of a street in Ferguson on Aug. 9.

In response to the death, Sharpton urged people to rally and march in Washington, D.C., to demand legislation on policing.

“Ferguson and Michael Brown Jr. will be a defining moment on how this country deals with policing and the rights of citizens to address how police behave in this country,” Sharpton said.

He also asked potential 2016 presidential candidates to speak out on the shooting and protests.

“Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, don’t get laryngitis on this issue,” Sharpton said. “Nobody can go to the White House unless they stop by our house and talk about policing.”

Earlier Sunday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on Brown’s body.

Department of Justice spokesman Brian Fallon cited a request by family members and the ""extraordinary circumstances"" surrounding the case of in explaining the decision.

""This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,"" Fallon said in a statement. ""Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.""

The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation of the shooting. Officials said a day earlier that 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson, Missouri.

David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami's U.S. Attorney's office, said a federally conducted autopsy ""more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises"" might help that investigation, and that the move is ""not that unusual.""

He also said federal authorities want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case.

Holder's latest announcement followed the state-imposed curfew in Ferguson.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said protesters weren't the reason for the escalated police reaction early Sunday morning after the midnight curfew took effect, but a report of people who had broken into a barbecue restaurant and taken to the roof, and a man who flashed a handgun in the street as armored vehicles approached the crowd of protesters.

Also overnight, a man was shot and critically wounded in the same area, but not by police; authorities were searching for the shooter. Someone also shot at a police car, officials said.

The protests have been going on since Brown's death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Missouri's governor to put the Highway Patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson Police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store before he was killed, though Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Gov. Jay Nixon, who imposed the curfew after declaring a state of emergency as protests turned violent to start the weekend, said Sunday morning on ABC's ""This Week"" that he was not aware the police were going to release surveillance video from the store where Brown is alleged to have stolen a $49 box of cigars.

""It's appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,"" Nixon said.

In announcing the curfew, Nixon said many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully but the state would not allow looters to endanger the community. Johnson, the Highway Patrol captain, had said police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas and would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave. Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.

“This is my neighborhood. You are my family, you are my friends. I am you,” Johnson said at the rally Sunday. “And I will stand and protect you. I will protect your right to protest.”

Johnson also apologized to Brown’s family at the rally.

“My heart goes out to you and I say that I’m sorry. I wear this uniform. And I should stand up here and say that I’m sorry,” he said.

As the curfew deadline arrived early Sunday, most protesters left the streets, but those who remained protesters refused to leave the area as officers spoke through a loudspeaker: ""You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately.""

As officers put on gas masks, a chant from the distant crowd emerged: ""We have the right to assemble peacefully.""

A moment later, police began firing canisters into the crowd. Highway Patrol Spokesman Lt. John Hotz initially said police only used smoke, but later told The Associated Press they also used tear gas canisters.

Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, has identified the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting and the department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.",2130,571,NA,NA

The Missouri Highway Patrol said that seven people were arrested and one man had been shot at the site of the protest in Ferguson, Mo. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said that the shooting victim was in critical condition and had been rushed to a hospital by protesters. 

Johnson said the use of tear gas was precipitated by concerns about people who'd broken into a barbecue restaurant and taken position on the roof overlooking approaching police. Another concern involved a man flashing a handgun who appeared in the middle of the street as armored vehicles approached. Johnson says someone fired at a patrol car, but no officers were injured.

""I was disappointed in the actions of tonight,"" Johnson said.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has taken part in demonstrations all week, told reporters that the police's tactics ""were a lot better"" than they could have been. French also said that he had attempted to convince people to honor the curfew, but some ""didn't want to be told to leave.""

French later tweeted, ""I can tell you firsthand that some of the people that remained tonight were armed. Were ready for a fight. And wanted to injure police.""

Hundreds of other protesters had left peacefully before the midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew took effect, but remaining protesters -- chanting ""No justice! No curfew!"" -- refused to leave the area.

As five armored tactical vehicles approached the crowd, officers spoke through a loudspeaker: ""You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately. Failure to comply may result in arrest.""

Highway Patrol Spokesman Lt. John Hotz initially said police only used smoke, but later told The Associated Press that they also fired tear gas canisters. He said of police efforts: ""Obviously, we're trying to give them every opportunity to comply with the curfew.""

As officers put on gas masks, a chant from the distant crowd emerged: ""We have the right to assemble peacefully."" A moment later, police began firing canisters into the crowd. Protesters said their faces and eyes had been burned. Others screamed in pain.

Jayson Ross, who was leading the protesters toward police, said: ""They got guns. We got guns. We are ready.""

The curfew had been announced by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon Saturday afternoon in an effort to prevent the violence and looting that had marred earlier protests over the August 9 death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. The governor also declared a state of emergency. 

Early Sunday, Johnson said that authorities were not aware of any looting that had occurred during the night. 

Stormy weather and the urgings of protest leaders made the decision to go home before midnight easier for some. As midnight approached late Saturday, New Black Panther Party leader Malik Shabazz roamed the street with a bullhorn, encouraging people to leave for their own safety.

""C'mon you all, let's roll out,"" Shabazz said through his bullhorn. ""Let's roll out of here, get some rest and come back tomorrow."" 

Nixon said Sunday morning on ABC's ""This Week"" that he was not aware the police were going to release the surveillance video.

""It's appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,"" he said.

In announcing the curfew, Nixon said that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow looters to endanger the community.

""I am committed to making sure the forces of peace and justice prevail,"" Nixon said during a Saturday press conference at a church that was interrupted repeatedly by people objecting to the curfew and demanding that the officer who shot Brown be charged with murder.

""We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching,"" Nixon said. ""We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.""

Nixon's curfew announcement came after tensions again flared in Ferguson late Friday night. Earlier that day, local police identified the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson and released documents and video footage alleging that Brown had robbed a convenience store just before he was shot. Police said Wilson was unaware Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Law enforcement officials tell Fox News that the footage of Brown in the convenience store was released by local authorities over the Justice Department's objections. One official told Fox News that federal authorities had their own copy of the tape and did not intend to make it public.

In a statement Sunday, Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said Attorney General Eric Holder has requested an additional autopsy of Brown to be performed by a federal medical examiner. 

""This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,"" the statement said. ""Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.""

Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door in the neighborhood starting Saturday, talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting.

Johnson assured those at the news conference that police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas but would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave. Nixon and Johnson were flanked by numerous local elected officials, including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., who urged Johnson to be flexible with the midnight curfew.

But they were interrupted repeatedly.

""Why is the focus on security and not getting justice? Why is there not an arrest?"" one women yelled.

Brown's death had already ignited several days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But Friday night marked a resurgence of unrest.

On Saturday, some residents said it appeared the violent acts were being committed by people who came from other suburbs or states.

""Who would burn down their own backyard?"" asked Rebecca McCloud, a local who works with the Sunshine Baptist Church in St. Louis. ""These people aren't from here. They came to burn down our city and leave.""

Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly and several officers got trapped and injured.

Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, is a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, the local police chief has said.

The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson's whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Crowds that were in the hundreds prior to the curfew had dwindled significantly in the final hour.

Keyon Watkins, a 26-year-old computer science worker from St. Louis, said on Saturday that if many others stayed in the street, he would join them.

""All of this is just building up — pent-up aggression by being mistreated on a daily basis,"" Watkins said.

State statute gives the governor broad powers when he declares a state of emergency, but he hasn't indicated that he plans to do anything other than imposing the curfew and empowering the state highway patrol to enforce it.

Officers demonstrated ""a high level of restraint"" during Friday's protest, said Sean Whent, chief of police in Oakland, a city that has grappled with numerous protests spanning from the fatal shooting of Oscar Grant by a transit police officer in 2009 to Occupy Oakland in 2011-12.

Another Ferguson-related protest was planned in Oakland Saturday evening.

On Friday, several protesters assaulted the officer while he attempted to make an arrest, said Officer Johnna Watson, an Oakland police spokeswoman. The injured officer was taken to a local hospital and later released.

At least two other officers were pepper-sprayed and treated at the scene, said Watson, who added that the march was mainly nonviolent.

""A majority of the crowd was peaceful, but there were some individuals and groups who participated in assaulting police, vandalizing businesses and committing graffiti along the march route,"" Watson said.

The protest began outside Oakland City Hall, the site of a peaceful gathering the previous day. Marchers encountered several Oakland police officers, some in riot helmets, blocking a freeway on-ramp to keep them from walking onto Interstate 880 — as some did to protest the fatal shooting of Florida teen Trayvon Martin in 2012.

As nightfall approached, a few protesters with covered faces pulled out paint cans and hammers and sprayed anti-police graffiti on buildings as the march continued along a main Oakland thoroughfare into the neighboring city of Berkeley.

Oakland police later arrested two men in their 40s, one for assaulting an officer and the other for obstructing and resisting police, Watson said.

I'm Andrea Tantaros, along with Bob Beckel, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""

(MUSIC)

TANTAROS: Lots of breaking developments today out of Ferguson, Missouri.

Police have released this surveillance tape showing 18-year-old Michael Brown the night he was killed allegedly stealing cigars in a robbery. Police also identified the officer who shot Brown.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

THOMAS JACKSON, FERGUSON POLICE CHIEF: The officer that was involved in the shooting of Michael Brown was Darren Wilson. He's been a police officer for six years. He has had no disciplinary action taken against him. He was treated for injuries which occurred on Saturday.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TANTAROS: And -- and this is big -- we're learning that Officer Wilson did not know the teenager was a robbery suspect before his run in with him on Saturday night.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JACKSON: And we're thinking it was the same officer who handled the robbery as the -- as was involved in the shooting. That is not the case. There were two separate officers. This robbery does not relate to the initial contact between the officer and Michael Brown.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TANTAROS: So, why did this Wilson initiate contact with Brown in the first place?

Chief Jackson says the officer was in the area coming off a sick case and stopped him because the teen was blocking traffic. Just moments ago, at a press conference, the Brown family attorney said that they still want answers because it doesn't make sense if he didn't know he was involved in the robbery, then why did he stop him, did he have probable cause?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BROWN FAMILY ATTORNEY: We heard from the chief and we believe that certainly and the rest of the world sees it for what it is worth the pictures that were released and the video has nothing to do with what happened and how he was killed on that thing. That's very important, that people understand that and see it for what it's worth.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TANTAROS: Still more questions than there are answers, Bob. Six days later, people are wondering why the police would release that surveillance footage in the stop and shop or in the store and bring up this alleged stealing of cigars.

Why do you think the police did that six days later? Was it to make sure they had all the information, or -- I was just reading some blogs, they said, oh, they are doing this to taint Brown?

BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: Well, I -- certainly, I'll tell you my instinct is to taint Brown. The other thing is, if you follow this thing, they were supposedly blocking foot traffic, she was walking with his friend the officer pushed -- moved -- pushed him over to where he's standing and the kids had his hands up, according to a number of witnesses. If that's true and then he shot him, then this officer has a real problem.

The other thing that's amazing to me is, I understand that a lot of blacks don't want police officers in that area and it's 80 percent or 90 percent white officers, but the elected officials are all white in that area, so I find -- that's very unique. I can think of another place I thought about before in the country where you have such a large minority population -- and no, I mean no elected officials that are minority.

TANTAROS: And, Greg, we still don't have answers to what happened that night. I think we do have to bear with the police on some level because they have been busy quelling these riots. So, it's a little tough to get the investigation going when there's a dangerous situation in Ferguson.

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yes, an assessment can only be made once you have all the facts and we're not there. I think, you know, because of the media treat these stories, it feels like life should be an episode of ""Law and Order"" where you have -- where it follows a distinct pattern with dramatic interludes of music and then at the end everything is wrapped up. It's not that way.

The interesting point about this footage is that cameras end all ambiguity. We see this footage in the convenience store and it tells us something. Imagine if you had that kind of footage about conflict between the police officer and Brown later. Cameras actually equal justice, cameras equal peace and footage clears the fog, and I think we need to think about that, you know, because now, as you see more facts, it makes -- it takes the black and white, and it makes it gray, which is the way life is.

TANTAROS: Well, a lot of people are trying to make this, Dana, about black and white and trying to make this about race. Bob does points out there are racial divisions in this town. But I want to talk to you about the release of this information and what your take is from a press perspective.

So, six days later, you have this surveillance footage released. But it only was what? A couple of hours ago, four hours after that video was released that we learned from the police chief, four hours later that this police officer had no idea he was involved in the robbery. Why would they stagger them like that?

DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: The only thing I can imagine is that this is not something that the Ferguson PR department, Ferguson County, the police department is used to doing. I mean, these types of crisis communication things -- the reason you have crisis communicators on staff is usually because they are experienced in trying to release information.

I don't know -- maybe we'll find out there was a nefarious reason to try to release the tape. Truth is the tape was going to come out at some point, whether it was released by the police officers or by the owners of the business. At some point, we were going to find out more about Michael Brown. Maybe it should not have come from the police, but at some point that was going to come.

I also think that, Bob, to your point, there was one other statistic we haven't talked about in this town. The public high school graduation rate is about 69.8 percent. That is not good enough. That is one of the things when you talk about the soft bigotry of low expectations that it's in a community like that where school choice, reform, all that kind of effort, if you start at the beginning of somebody's life and I think there's probably a lot of agreement on that, then maybe you get to a point where you have police officers from that community, from all walks of life that are able to make it on the force. But right now, they are not there with the 69 percent --

BECKEL: I would imagine you have to have at least a high school degree to be on the police force, right?

PERINO: I'd imagine, or GED equivalent and go pass your test.

TANTAROS: Eric, a lot of people are frustrated and I get that because you look at this surveillance footage today and stealing a pack of cigarettes does not warrant somebody getting killed, and so you can imagine the outrage there. But everybody is up in arms, these rioters, these protests, you have civil rights leaders, nobody knows what happened after that what went down.

ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: I'm 100 percent in fact, I booked Kevin Johnson -- Jackson, I'm sorry, because I wanted him, he was the one who was saying keep calm let's get the facts. I talked to him. But then this information came out. I've been telling you, I've watching this stuff nonstop. This police captain, police chief, Thomas Jackson from Ferguson, at one point did say that the officers, Darren Wilson and other, were responding because there was a call away from -- they were doing the sick call. There was a robbery at the convenience store and they were responding.

At one point he said that. I heard him say that. Now, whether or not he backtracked on it the second time, I'm just baffled. But then taking it one step further and releasing this video that he says, quote, ""I've been sitting on for six days,"" his words, and then releases the name Darren Wilson, I'm having a hard time saying this Ferguson police department really has bungled this thing and really is the basis for a lot of the angst in Ferguson.

Now, that said, Captain Ron Johnson who was assigned most recently, kept the peace last night. He kept the peace. And I'm sure he's scratching his head now, how am I supposed to handle this when the Ferguson police department is really -- listen, I think they're screwing it up.

They really need to sit down to get together and say, this is what happened, we'll be as transparent as we possibly can, we need to listen to the Brown attorneys and family, and ask for calm and peace, but here's all the information -- instead of this piecemeal release what they want to do and the way they are doing it is just -- it's terrible.

TANTAROS: I wouldn't necessarily critique them releasing the video a couple of days later, because Rudy Giuliani used to wait to put out all the information, because when he would race to put out all the information to get the facts out, people would criticize him, you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't. Oh, you're rushing to judgment, you're just throwing everything out there, so there is a delicate dance.

But I think you make a good point, Eric, it has been all over the place. I mean, why would they release a video and then hours later, this huge revelation that the officer had no idea he was involved in robbery?

BOLLING: Which is opposite of what he had said earlier. This morning, he said, I believe it's this morning, I've been listening to this stuff for days. At one point, words came out of that police chief's name, Johnson, he said they were responding because there was a robbery at a convenience store. They were on another call. But that's why.

So, if you make that leap, if you hear those words coming out of his mouth, you are saying, those officer left the sick call to respond to the convenience store and on the way, there's a suspect that matches the description, he had said the description was put out over the radio of the convenience store hold up or whatever it is, theft. So, he kind of implied and he may have even said it, but he at least implied that was the suspect they were looking for. That's why it was stopped.

Now, all of a sudden, this afternoon, he backtracked and said, oh, nothing to do with. It was all about blocking traffic.

TANTAROS: And Al Sharpton has been on the scene. He's been making comments on this for days. He says that we're not out of this yet. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLP)

AL SHARPTON, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK/MSNBC HOST: Let's not act like we solved the problem because we've now had the cop marching with the marchers. We still have an unarmed young man that was killed. We're not out of this yet. We even haven't had the funeral. What happens when these kids see their friends laying in the casket? I've been through this more than one time. We're not out of the emotions because we all of a sudden had one good night of marching.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TANTAROS: Greg, we asked this question earlier, he may be exactly right -- we're not out of this yet because nobody knows what happened still. But when he weighs on it does it hurt situations like this because of his lack of credibility?

GUTFELD: Yes, before -- whenever you discuss Al Sharpton, you have to preface it with Al Sharpton's history. Freddie's fashion mart which ended in a number of deaths. You have the Tawana Brawley hoax. Those are the two big part of his history, that never should be forgotten about this charlatan.

So, there's a positive development here, one of the few positive developments from this tragedy. There are a growing number of sober voices that are drowning out Sharpton. He seems more marginal by the day.

If he actually cared he would stay away, because he actually harms the cause. When he shows up everyone moves away from him. He's like the stinky guy on the subway. But the stench is his history. So, when he shows up, people go, God, not him again. Please, we're actually getting somewhere -- and when you see people like Johnson, finally there are people you can listen to and you're getting away from the charlatans who were there to gin up outrage every day.

BECKEL: You know, the other is, for Sharpton to say we had one good night of marching, the fact is they had many good nights of marching. There were rioters who were out there who were not part of the march. And you almost want to say to Al -- Al, probably you thought it was one good night, probably wished it wasn't a good night, right?

It's almost as if you're saying, all the rest of the marches were riots but we had one good night. Maybe we'll get back to riots.

That's not the case. I said this yesterday, I'll say it again, there's a very small percentage number of people who committed these acts of violence.

TANTAROS: And it's tough to differentiate between the two, Dana, because there are peaceful marches, and then there's the riots. But, oftentimes, you look up and you say, Al Sharpton is weighing in. This is a big issue. He's contributing to this. Maybe he's not contributing to it at all.

PERINO: I think it's a great point about Al Sharpton being marginalized, because I think, maybe for the first time within this last year, when he has spoken, most people has sort of went, oh, God, not him again.

(CROSSTALK)

GUTFELD: It's just us talking about him.

PERINO: And him talking about himself.

GUTFELD: Yes.

PERINO: And he gets a lot of media attention for it.

One thing I think is interesting about what this community will be doing next and I think the sober voices that you mentioned are the ones that have to look at this from a short, medium and long term perspective. The short term is, we're not out of the woods yet. All right. The immediate thing is to calm the situation down.

In the medium term, they're going to have to have a very transparent investigation, and they need to have a communicator that is disciplined enough not release information that they are not prepared to fully release so they don't have problems like today which undermine the confidence.

And then, in the long term, it's a question of can that community pull together to deal with not only the shooting and the peaceful protest and the rioting, but also what you saw in the videotape. I mean, that, when you -- if you're a small business owner, if you're sympathetic to the business owner, you think, why would the business owner want to be there? That's something that Ferguson doesn't want to have happened.

So, that's why I think there's three things that need happen simultaneously but they're not all in the same track.

BOLLING: And one more thing. When you release the information and you're transparent, when you get it, when it's ready and not hold -- quote- unquote, ""I've been sitting on it,"" you also prevent things going on. I say one of the worst things that have happened besides the death of Michael Brown, twice now, there was a group that released the name of the officer, they thought the officer who shot --

GUTFELD: That's Anonymous.

BOLLING: OK. So they released this name and it wasn't him.

Then the second time we heard when the morning press conference, the officer's name Darren Wilson was released -- they were posting pictures of the wrong Darren Wilson who happens to be another cop in St. Louis.

So, you eliminate all this stuff. You just be open and transparent, and you won't hurt people. These people are really probably hurt now.

BECKEL: The other thing is we're guilty of it as every other network. The only video we're running is either glass being broken and people rioting a small percentage and we've seen at least six times so far this kid being thrown out of this convenience store.

Now that is a part of the story. That's true. But it is a small part of the story, and they are making it to be the story. And I think people out there better under just because we run video of this stuff, because we have nothing else to run apparently --

BOLLING: What else would you run?

BECKEL: Huh?

BOLLING: What else would you run?

BECKEL: Peaceful marchers. How is that for an idea?

(CROSSTALK)

BOLLING: I think that was on TV today. We saw calm. We woke up this morning, calm night -- thanks to Ron Johnson.

BECKEL: I'm talking about the two nights in a row where they had town meetings where people did not get up and scream and yell. We didn't run that.

GUTFELD: But you know what? You can actually move beyond that microcosm to the macro level of stories in general. The priority and proportion of stories are changing. We don't even talk about MH-17, the Ukrainian plane. Robin Williams came and went in a flash. ISIS. The Nigerian girls, due to an insatiable desire for novelty.

Priority is a casualty. News is almost like pornography, disposal, replaceable. How do you make a story stick? I guarantee you: this story will be replaced by something else next week. That's the way it rolls.

TANTAROS: And the hottest footage, the rioting and surveillance video --

GUTFELD: Yes.

TANTAROS: -- irrespective of any facts, gets rolled over.

GUTFELD: Yes, knocks out the peaceful marching.

TANTAROS: OK. Up ahead, there's a lot of debate about the militarization of police in America following the response to the protests in Ferguson. We'll debate that next.

Plus, it's Facebook Friday, so send your questions now to Facebook.com/TheFiveFNC. You may have it answered. That's coming up.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GUTFELD: It's the new outrage -- the militarization of the police. So, is all that gear out of proportion to the fear? Yes and no. Yes, in that I question sniper rifles pointed at the peaceful and camo seems a bit odd.

But then, again, where there are riots, you do need some riot gear. You can't stop anarchy with a stern look. Just weeks ago, people praised Israel's Iron Dome. The principle is the same, it's like an SAT question, the dome is incoming rockets as body armor is to Molotov cocktails.

During the looting, a store burned to the ground. I bet businesses didn't mind the arrival of this ominous cavalry. Those scary soldiers save their stores.

But I get the libertarian take. Their response is always don't. Never do. Which is great as a small government addict, I'm a huge fan of don't it's why I want a program, a robot to say no and then run for president.

But incidents like these are chaotic. No police officer wants to beat someone, tussle over a gun or resort to deadly force. So, maybe it's better to look scary than be scary. It's for your sake, not just theirs.

And really, you don't need a sniper rifle to maim or kill. Example, a retired cabbie in his 70s knocked out for no reason. Example, a pregnant woman knocked out for no reason. Example, the harmless Jeffrey Babbitt, one punch in the head in Union Square, dead for no reason.

Of course, a militarized police looks odd, but that look worse for all of us.

So, Dana, the Pentagon transferred half a billion just this year of equipment, 2013, it all came from Afghanistan and Iraq. Is it a good thing that it's used? Does it make sense? Does it have any place in a civilian context?

PERINO: I've been watching this debate for a few years because people have been sounding the alarm for a long time, mostly from the far right, I'd say the far right or on the libertarian side saying, why would any police community need this?

Now, this is farfetched but I'm just going to mention something. We talked about Ebola last week and the concern what happens if it spread. When I was involved in an exercise where we did this simulation of whether there was a pandemic flu --

GUTFELD: Right.

PERINO: -- what would happen if you had to close down a border in a state and need to contain that in a state or if people were clamoring for the one cure and it was only in Georgia and everybody was trying to get there. It seems farfetched and it seems over the top, I don't think it was needed in this case, but do police departments need some type of heavy equipment? I would argue yes.

GUTFELD: That's the problem. For peaceful protests, no. But for rioting, how can you deny the body odor? Body armor, not odor.

(LAUGHTER)

(CROSSTALK)

BOLLING: But look what happened when Ron Johnson walked with the protesters without a helmet, without a vest. So, he calmed things down.

So, the theory is, use equal force, use equal defense with the amount of force you're probably going to see. I love the idea of using half a billion dollars that we've already spent giving it to SWAT teams around the country. I just don't think they should be deployed for peaceful protests -- OK, rioting, looting, cops can handle that. They can handle it with tear gas. They probably don't need be there on top of those big amphibious vehicles with guns aimed down.

Look, I back the police as well, but just -- you know, an equal response or appropriate response I would hope for.

GUTFELD: Bob, you know, the Senate is going to reviewing the militarization of police in the defense bill. Do you think this is going to change how -- change anything?

BECKEL: Not really. I think you got all this excess equipment and they're going to put it somewhere. They're not going to put in moth balls. And police departments who get it feel the need to use it.

But having said that, and sort of hard to put yourself in the position of a minority in a community like that, but it feeds into their view of what the police are like. You see these people coming down the street with these camouflage things and SWAT rifles and the rest of it, and saying, there they are, there's the cops they are after us.

Now, I think that -- first of all, the idea there was rioting, there were break-ins and burnings of buildings, that's true. You can conclude that's rioting. But the vast majority of the people were not involved in that and there was no reason to bring out the Patton and his army.

GUTFELD: I think though, but, Bob, to my -- there's some businesses that were grateful that they were there because it prevented it from spreading.

BECKEL: Well, maybe that's so. If I'm a business I suppose I could say that. If I was there to peacefully protest and I saw that crowd coming down the street, it would get me right angry.

GUTFELD: Yes. Andrea, so over 20 years violent crime has dropped, 42.8 percent. Probably little do with this. But doesn't this make look weirder, the fact that it's calmer but you still have this camo-clad sniper look?

TANTAROS: Yes, I'm less worried about the guys in fatigues and military guns and rifles and all that equipment, because I'm not on the ground there. I'm assuming if they make the decision to use this type of armor, it's because they definitely need it.

But I think it's probably more of a PR issue. You know, Bob makes a good point you see these people coming down the street. It doesn't look good.

I'm assuming, though, they figure, you know what? Who cares if it doesn't look good? It's better than a dead cop --

GUTFELD: Right.

TANTAROS: -- which is what they are trying to prevent. However, I do think there is an argument to be made that certain police forces, not all like the NYPD, has become part of its citizenry. Some police forces have not and view the citizens as the enemy.

More and more and -- that's why there are more libertarians coming out of the woodwork -- more and more police fundraisers are seeing the citizenry as the enemy. They're stopping them random traffic stops, right? Collecting license plates. Looking at people, do they have their seat belt on?

I think people are feeling intimidated by the police lately and they shouldn't be acting this way. And I think it's become the modern ethos of certain police departments. It is a concern.

BECKEL: It's a very, very good point.

GUTFELD: All right. On that note, next, President Obama has declared victory in Iraq to rescue Christian refugees from ISIS, but many remain trapped. Should the U.S. really be heading out?

Later, Facebook Friday --

(LAUGHTER)

GUTFELD: Almost forgot. Facebook Friday, my favorite thing.

Send in your questions to Facebook.com/TheFiveFNC.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PERINO: Yesterday President Obama emerged from vacation to declare our mission in Iraq to rescue Yazidis a success.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The bottom line is that the situation on the mountain has greatly improved. Because of these efforts, we do not expect there to be an additional operation to evacuate people off the mountain, and it's unlikely that we're going to need to continue humanitarian air drops on the mountain.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: But the country's Yazidi, minority and Kurdish officials say many refugees remain trapped, and help is very much still needed to battle ISIS. Retired four-star General Jack King says the U.S. needs to figure out a strategy against this growing terror network. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GEN. JACK KING (RET.), U.S. ARMY: ISIS has freedom of movement and has the initiative. They are attacking right now, as we speak, in over six different locations inside Iraq, also attacking in Syria and also attacking in Lebanon. This is an organization that is usually ambitious, has competent leadership and is very determined. The fact of the matter is they're destabilizing the Middle East. We really desperately need a strategy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: And this just in from Iraq officials. They say ISIS has just now massacred 80 Yazidis in a northern Iraqi town. So those were the people that we were going in to try to help.

But I think, Andrea, one of the concerns I had when the president came out yesterday was that it felt very premature and, you know, look, learn from previous mistakes. Don't declare victory yet, especially when the next day 80 Yazidis are killed by ISIS. Does the president -- I guess does he even care that it looks like they are behind the eight ball?

TANTAROS: First I would say 80 is a pretty good number for a J.V. squad of terrorists, as Bob likes to point out. It's shocking that President Obama wouldn't, as you point out, learn from the past mistakes of past administrations, because he and his staff were very critical about criticizing your former boss for using the words ""mission accomplished."" To me, Dana, this sounded yesterday like a ""mission accomplished.""

PERINO: And it wasn't -- that's even apples and oranges.

TANTAROS: To sort of spike the football and say, ""Our job here is done."" However, he has made comments about terrorism before: al Qaeda being decimated when we know that that's not the truth either.

It's -- look, if defeating or obliterating ISIS is the goal, which he doesn't seem to be making that point, that that is the goal, we're far from that. It seems like he's just allowing an evacuation route for Yazidis.

If the goal is to get rid of -- is to save Christians or to save the Yazidis, I think this administration is a little too late. There have been major ethnic cleansing in any region that ISIS controls that have Christians, in Iraq and in Syria. This administration is way too late to the game.

So my question would be what is the mission? What are we doing? Is it obliterating ISIS? Is it saving the Yazidis? Is it both? Because what we're doing here doesn't seem to be, I don't think, helping either of those two goals.

PERINO: I talked to some geopolitical experts today who said that -- that what their biggest concern, is that not only is ISIS a very brutal organization, but they're operationally very good. I mean, Eric, this is not the Keystone Kops of suicide bombers. These are people that we actually should consider a very worthy adversary.

BOLLING: Not only that, even -- take that and add in the fact that they stole $1.2 billion, a lot of it in gold, from an Iraqi bank. And this one, they're stealing oil from Iraqi oil fields, Iraqi oil pipelines and selling it. They're raising $3 million a day, ABC is reporting $3 million a day going into that group. If you know anything about these terrorist groups, you're more likely to get more people joining up for you when you're paying them well. You're outfitting them well. You're giving them guns; you're giving them cell phones.

This group, as Andrew points out, ain't the J.V., and they're only going to get stronger unless you cut off the funding. I mean, that's -- first and foremost protect those oil fields.

PERINO: Greg, you have some history living in Britain, and they still talk about the former British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, who claimed that after he met with Hitler, ""Everything's going to be fine. There's going to be peace."" And it turned out to be very wrong.

GUTFELD: Well, President Obama said recently he believes in no victor, no vanquish. If you tell that to ISIS, they might keep you alive just for comic relief.

On foreign policy Obama is like a shower head in a cheap hotel: very, very weak. And you have -- we do not have the luxury of deciding when America can sit out in a quarter of a game of good versus evil, because evil never sits out. There's no such thing as half measures.

Our military never loses if you give them the option of winning. If they have a mission and they're told the mission, they will go in there and they will do it, and they will relish it. But you just can't do drop, drop, drops.

PERINO: Interesting, yesterday, Bob, a few congressional members were asking to be brought back from recess so that they could vote on something we were talking -- you and I were talking about in the green room. Do you think the president is going to, at some point, going to have to go to Congress and say, ""I need to reverse course here, and I need your authorization to do so.""

BECKEL: Well, I don't know the answer to that. I would certainly hope not, but I don't think it's -- in fairness to the president, he was talking about the people who were refugees on the mountain.

Even the NGOs, the government -- non-government organizations, say that the pressure has been released on these people, and they are out of the mountains. What he's talking about ISIS what they did today in that town is horrible, but when you have a gutless Iraqi military who's not there, you can be a J.V. and kill 80 people when you've got no military there. I still come back from one question: Where's the gutless Iraqi military that we trained so well?

TANTAROS: It doesn't matter. Dana, I think...

BECKEL: It doesn't matter?

TANTAROS: Foreign policy managed, designed to manage a news cycle. This is why there's no strategy. Because the only thing President Obama wants to avoid is the headline that says ISIS slaughters women and children. That's all. That's all he wants to do. He knee-jerks to manage the news cycle.

BECKEL: Wait a minute. That was a policy in two administrations, including Obama's that said, ""We're going to train the Iraqi army, and we're going to push them."" They are gutlessly running with our equipment and leaving it behind. And so don't tell me this is all Obama's fault. The fact is, the Iraqis, we put our money on Maliki. He's a crook. He's a bum, and he finally got out. And look at these soldiers.

PERINO: You don't think that President Obama had anything to do with Maliki's re-election in 2010?

BECKEL: I think -- no. You guys said it was a fair and open election.

PERINO: Bob, you're making my point.

BECKEL: No, no. Where did Maliki come from? When was he put in?

PERINO: Maliki won an election. He won a re-election in 2010.

BECKEL: Where did he come from? Where was he originally introduced to Iraq?

PERINO: This is, like, the weirdest academic exercise that we're having this week.

BECKEL: Why?

PERINO: Why? Because does anything that you're saying actually matter? The fact that the Iraqi -- I can agree with you. The Iraqi army is not up to par. OK, fine. But now have all of these -- all of these ISIS terrorists that are overrunning the country.

BECKEL: Wait a minute. You keep saying there's no strategy. The strategy was to make these guys a strong army. There's supposedly 100,000 of them. If they can't take these guys on, they're gutless. And the strategy of your administration and my administration failed.

PERINO: OK, so then we have to do something about it.

BECKEL: That's right. Get rid of Maliki and people like that, who was put in there before Obama was elected.

PERINO: ""Facebook Friday"" -- And re-elected in 2010.

""Facebook Friday"" next on ""The Five."" We are really looking forward to answering your questions.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BOLLING: Time for ""Facebook Friday."" We're going to get right to it, because we don't have a lot of time. A lot of questions. First, two questions are for Bob. First up, from Mary F.: ""Bob, did you attend Woodstock? Forty-fifth anniversary today, by the way.""

BOLLING: Did I attend the anniversary? No. Did I attend it? Yes, with my brother, and it was terrible. It was rainy, and it was -- and the acid was bad.

BOLLING: Oh, good lord. All right. Also, Bob, from Cory W.: ""Bob, my wife and I are having our first child in December. What tip can you give a soon-to-be dad?""

BECKEL: Well, I would hope maybe in you're in a position to hire a nanny, I'd do that. If -- if not, I certainly would just keep in mind that you better get used to a smell that will linger for a long, long time. And if you invite people from outside in, warn them at the door. Say, ""Inside, baby.""

BOLLING: All right. Very good. All right. Dana, from Bob R.: ""Were you a member of a sorority during college and if so which one?""

PERINO: No, there were no -- I think there was one fraternity at our college and no sororities. It was not necessarily known as a party school.

BOLLING: Any clubs?

PERINO: I'm sure that surprises all of you.

BOLLING: Any fun activities? Baseball?

PERINO: Yes. There was Silver Saddles, I think.

GUTFELD: You were in speech -- you were in speech club.

PERINO: Country western -- country western dancing.

GUTFELD: You were in the speech club. Weren't you?

PERINO: Yes. The club? Speech team. Of course.

BECKEL: Did you do square dancing, too?

PERINO: We did not do square dancing.

BECKEL: Oh, you didn't?

PERINO: But I did go to -- to country music.

TANTAROS: You were in Silver Saddles?

PERINO: I went to Silver Saddles.

BOLLING: What is Silver Saddles, before we move on?

PERINO: It's a restaurant, like a bar. At Silver Saddles.

GUTFELD: She danced for tips.

PERINO: I did not.

GUTFELD: You had to go through dental hygiene school.

BOLLING: Do you follow any sports? Rodeo?

PERINO: Do I follow anything? Not really. I just -- I -- I'm like a buffet. I just sample.

BECKEL: Football hostess.

PERINO: I feel so traumatized by the last block.

BOLLING: For Greg, from Dawn Z.: ""Are you working on another book?""

GUTFELD: Yes, I am, as a matter of fact. I am.

BOLLING: Is Dawn Z. your publicist?

GUTFELD: Yes, exactly.

PERINO: You were Dawn Z.

GUTFELD: You know what? I can't say what is it, because it's a surprise.

PERINO: It's brilliant, though.

GUTFELD: But it's going to change the way you think and also dress and smell.

BOLLING: All right, for Greg from Michael M.: ""Is Greg really into punk music as much as I hope he is?""

GUTFELD: I -- it changed my life when I got the Clash and the Sex Pistols, '77, '76, and the Ramones. I shaved my head. I dressed like an idiot, and I did that for about four years.

BECKEL: What's changed?

GUTFELD: Thanks, Bob. No, but it changed music. And everything you listen to now is somewhat influenced by that movement.

PERINO: Why did it change your life?

TANTAROS: Why did you shave your head?

GUTFELD: No, I mean, I got it cropped. I used to have long hair, and then I cropped...

BOLLING: No mohawk, though.

TANTAROS: It changed your life; it changed the way you dressed. But it didn't change the way you smell. Unlike the new book?

GUTFELD: Exactly.

BOLLING: Very good. Ands, from Jill B.: ""Andrea, I was also born in Allentown, Pennsylvania. What do you miss most about living there? I miss the Pennsylvania Dutch food.""

TANTAROS: I miss the quiet. And I miss the cheap prices.

BECKEL: Have you been to Allentown?

TANTAROS: Don't knock Allentown. Greg and I both lived in Allentown. I grew up in Allentown. I would miss the peace and quiet. And everybody is really nice, and the prices are really low.

BOLLING: Very good.

GUTFELD: King George Hotel. Dorney Park.

TANTAROS: The Chicken Lounge. We talked about this before.

GUTFELD: The Sterling Hotel.

TANTAROS: Yes.

GUTFELD: Beers around the world, blintzes (ph).

TANTAROS: The Pied Piper.

BOLLING: This was for Andrea also from William M. I think we've asked her this before. ""What's your favorite exercise and why?"" Haven't we asked you this?

TANTAROS: Yes. I get this same question. My favorite exercise, I would say probably running. What's so funny about that?

BECKEL: I was going to -- I was going to guess.

TANTAROS: Oh, Bob, you sicko.

BECKEL: No, it wasn't that. I thought aerobics or yoga.

PERINO: Eric, this is from Christine M.: ""If you had to change occupations what would you do?""

BECKEL: Do every TV show there are.

BOLLING: I would be in politics.

PERINO: ""EB2016."" Do you have an announcement to make?

BOLLING: No, do I not.

TANTAROS: Will you make it on this show?

BOLLING: You know what? It was baseball. It was trading, and it was TV. And the next thing absolutely would be politics. I love it.

PERINO: OK. And the next one is, ""If you had to change"" -- same one. ""Eric, I love your watch. Who is your jeweler?""

BOLLING: My wife is my jeweler. She bought it for me.

BECKEL: That thing weighs about 30 pounds.

BOLLING: All right. We got to go.

PERINO: That's why it's got...

BECKEL: Oh, yes, we will.

BOLLING: For about a half an hour on the unrest in Missouri. Don't miss that. Back in just a minute.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BECKEL: Dana is still upset by the fact she got bleeped. Don't worry about it. I'm used to it.

America used to be a place where you knew everyone on your block. But a new survey reveals that over half of Americans don't even know the name of their neighbors anymore.

All right. Greg, do you know the name of your neighbors?

GUTFELD: Absolutely not. You know what? I was thinking about this. Remember old TV shows, a neighbor would stop by for a cup of sugar?

PERINO: Yes.

GUTFELD: I dare you to do that now. You will get maced. I sometimes do...

PERINO: No one in New York has sugar.

GUTFELD: Nobody has sugar. And generally, your neighbors aren't wearing pants. So it's weird.

BECKEL: Dana.

GUTFELD: There's a fear to intervene. People don't want to get involved.

BECKEL: Dana, when you were a kid growing up, you knew your neighbors, right?

PERINO: Yes. They were the Townsends. And they were a really lovely couple. They -- their children had already gone through college, so they were empty nesters, in a way. My sister and I used to go. We could do all sorts of things at their house. Jump on the bed. It was fun.

BECKEL: And you know the neighbors in your current apartment, don't you?

PERINO: I do, and we get along great.

BECKEL: Yes.

PERINO: I know all sorts of names. In fact, you met some at my birthday party.

BECKEL: It was the longest discussion I've ever had.

TANTAROS: It's time now for ""One More Thing,"" and I will kick it off. So this administration oftentimes does things to manage a news cycle. Well, the V.A. scandal may be off our front pages, but the administration has decided to expand its program to veterans, allowing them more primary care services.

Now, this sounds great, but veterans beware. The reimbursement rates are so low that probably no doctor is going to be willing to see you. So when you see these stories and the administration is touting ""We're doing more to help our veterans"" after this V.A. scandal, don't believe everything you see. It's positively, I think, disgraceful.

Jackson at the same time released documents saying Brown was suspected of stealing a box of cigars shortly before he was killed.

The attorney, Benjamin Crump, says Brown's parents are ""incensed"" by what he calls ""the old game of smoke and mirrors."" He says the family was blind-sided by Friday's announcement.

The protests began after a still-unnamed St. Louis County police officer shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was unarmed and apparently walking away from the officer who pulled the trigger.

Although police have tried to protect the identity of the officers involved, they will eventually have to file a police report about the incident — and all the questionably legal incidents that have occurred in the past few days as cops have harassed, assaulted and arrested protesters. That report will be a public record and, eventually, we will know the name of the man who killed Michael Brown.

But if state Rep. Jeff Roorda, D-Barnhart, had his way, that would not be the case.

Roorda introduced a bill last year to amend the state’s Sunshine Law to prevent the public from obtaining “any records and documents pertaining to police shootings … if they contain the name of any officer who did the shooting.”",NA,31,NA,NA

Jesse Jackson appears at protest in Ferguson ,Rush transcript from “Hannity” ,08/15/2014,10/30/2015,"ANDREA TANTAROS, GUEST HOST: And tonight, demonstrations continue in Ferguson, Missouri, and in attendance at one of those gatherings is the Reverend Jesse Jackson from the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. Reverend Jackson joins us now live for a ""Hannity"" exclusive.

Reverend, thank you so much for being here.

REV. JESSE JACKSON, RAINBOW/PUSH COALITION: Very well.

TANTAROS: Reverend, when you get involved in these type of situations, a lot of media attention seems to follow. And some have been very critical of your involvement in these instances. Do you think that when you get involved in these instances, it could be considered a distraction?

JACKSON: You know, when I brought Americans home from prison in Cuba and Iraq and Yugoslavia and the Gambia, it was considered by some to be a distraction. For others, it was a life-saving intervention.

And so there's some need here to express love to this family and support for the family. But also, there's such high frustration here, and it must not become a self-destructive set of actions.

(INAUDIBLE) seven days later, they released the name of the police. They have not released how many times Michael was shot and the way he was shot. That action (ph) compounds suspicion. They release his name, and then some discrediting tapes about Michael. No connection between the tapes and the shooting. And that just simply further arouses suspicion.

And my concern now is that it's not enough to have quietness, which is the absence of noise, but peace, the presence of justice. And the fact of the matter is, the citizens here deserve half the police force, white, black, male and female, or the fire force. There's essentially a lack of trust here because there's such gross injustice and disparities.

TANTAROS: Reverend, earlier on ""The Five,"" Bill O'Reilly called in and he said that you and others, like Reverend Al Sharpton, who has also been weighing in on this tragedy in Ferguson -- he called you a racial agitator and your involvement in these issues to agitate, to ignite, to inflame. Do you think that's what you do?

JACKSON: No. And I think it's unfortunate for him to name-call and to stereotype in that way. The fact is, what I have been doing, meeting with ministers tonight and meeting with members of the family, trying to work on people doing, for example, voter registration, telling people that only registered voters can be jurors. Registered voters elect mayors who appoint police chiefs. Registered voters, in fact, can elect judges.

We've been giving clarity and instruction. We know that you can reshape the iron when it's hot, but you shouldn't turn the iron on yourself. We discourage any kind of violence by police or people. The real riot here has been a police riot. And so they've stepped away.  People are upset, but people are really calm.

TANTAROS: Reverend, what is your take on how the police have handled this thus far? I know that you said that you were upset that they've not released details about how many times Brown was shot. How would you grade how they've conducted this investigation so far and how they've communicated with the public?

JACKSON: Well (INAUDIBLE) they had to have an outside state trooper to come in to bring some police civil order to the relationships here.  What you have here is that (INAUDIBLE) released the police name and then they released disparaging information about Michael Brown which had nothing to do whatsoever with his getting shot.

Now we need to know how many times was he shot. If you go -- if you were to come to Ferguson and see in the middle of his own neighborhood, not another neighborhood, not downtown, in the middle of his own neighborhood, shot in the middle of -- 2:30 in the afternoon, before people watching, and let him lay there on the ground.

You know, Michael Vick was put in jail for dogs fighting. Michael Brown was killed worse than a dog. It's just not right. It's not fair. I'm glad President Obama, when they begin to risk (ph) -- risk (ph) journalists, and others step in with a calming voice, his voice is a calming voice. Governor Nixon's voice today was a calming voice. I think Reverend Al, those who've been here, their voices have been calming voices.

No one wants to see self-destructive riots because there's no future in riots. I think that aggressive, nonviolent demands will be significant.  I think people just should go from door to door full voter registration, demanding using their voting power to elect officials who will respond to their real needs. They're not voting for whatever reason has resulted in them being left in a rather difficult situation.

TANTAROS: Reverend, do you believe that the police releasing the surveillance footage today is an attempt to smear Brown? Are you frustrated they didn't release it sooner?

JACKSON: Well, it's an attempt to justify what happened. In other words, because that is this tape, therefore he got shot. They have to...

TANTAROS: But do you think it was...

(CROSSTALK)

TANTAROS: Do you think it was designed to smear him?

JACKSON: Of course -- of course, it's to smear him, to make him less worthy of living because this happened. But now it comes out that the police officer that did the shooting didn't know anything about his being a suspect. So this is completely separate. But to release them designed to disrupt and discredit and distort.

And people read right through it. People don't like it because it's not a good thing. Why did it take seven days to release the policeman's name? I can understand not releasing the face of a minor on television, but not to release the police? They've had seven days to concoct a story that people tend not to believe.

Now the concern is that his name should have been released. He should be safe and protected as an officer of the law. He should be safe and protected. Furthermore, we need to know how many times was Michael shot.  Was he shot in the back? How many times in the front. The ranges go from one to six shots. We just simply need to know.

That would bring some more relief because it seems like the justice system is going to work. The people here really have the power to elect judges and prosecutors and mayors, who appoint police and fire chiefs.  People here must begin to use -- turn their pain into real political power.  They really have that opportunity.

TANTAROS: Reverend, if you're confident that the justice system will work and it will play out and we will get answers, don't you think then all of this is a huge distraction? I mean, no one really seems to know what happened. I mean, the police chief came out today. He said that the officer was not aware that Brown was the suspect in a robbery. So none of us really have all the answers.

Don't you think that the protests, the rioting, the distraction, the media, the commenting, the racial igniting of division between white and black is a complete distraction from getting the facts of this and letting this play out and letting the police do their investigation?

JACKSON: Maybe this -- maybe this not just black and white, it's wrong and right. You really can't trust a police that there's 56 police and three black in a city that's 70 percent African-American. There's great distrust here for this police department and how it handles people. The police, the judges, they feel that the system has fallen out on them.

I want to go a step further, and it is to say that since the (INAUDIBLE) since the police department and the fire department -- the fire department gets federal money and federal grants, there should be an investigation -- a congressional hearing here on the (INAUDIBLE) police jobs and fire jobs and teacher jobs and contractors. There must be a sense of fairness.

It's not enough to be quiet. Quietness is the absence of noise. We need peace, the presence of justice and to be -- and so people here can coexist and live together. Most of these police and firemen don't live in Ferguson, by the way. They work here but don't live here. So they do not share the culture of the people who are the majority of the population -- rather undemocratic.

TANTAROS: Do you believe that Brown was targeted specifically because he was black?

JACKSON: I don't know that. But there is a pattern that creates a strong suspicion. You know, it's Trayvon Martin in Florida. It's Oscar Grant in Oakland. It's Diallo shot unarmed 41 times in New York. It's (INAUDIBLE) rammed in the rectum until he nearly bled to death in Brooklyn.  I mean, and the list goes on.

And this madness must stop. I take the position, you know, if a black shoots a white, it's quick justice and jail time. A white shoots a black, it's rebellion (ph) time. If it's black on black and white on white, it's shrug your shoulder time. Nobody should be able to kill anybody. We must stop the killing. Stop -- the police should not have hard military hardware, tanks rolling down the streets. That was not necessary. And I'm glad that the governor finally removed that and put Ron Johnson, a man who seems to be more civil, with police patrol (ph) and crowd control.

TANTAROS: Reverend, why don't we see more of you in cities like Chicago? I think a lot of people wonder why you and Reverend Al Sharpton and others aren't speaking out on all of the murders taking place. It seems, every other weekend more black children, more black teens, are being gunned down in the streets of Chicago, and yet you're not there.

JACKSON: (INAUDIBLE) a matter of fact, I'm doing (INAUDIBLE) just this coming Monday. I'm there all of the time (INAUDIBLE) funeral (ph).  And so the fact of the matter is, in Chicago...

TANTAROS: Well, why don't we see...

(CROSSTALK)

TANTAROS: ... that type of attention, Reverend?

JACKSON: Well...

TANTAROS: Why don't we see the same type of outrage from the black community about these young black kids...

JACKSON: Maybe...

TANTAROS: ... getting gunned down in the streets of Chicago...

JACKSON: Maybe...

TANTAROS: ... every single day?

JACKSON: Maybe if this is black shooting whites in Chicago, or whites shooting blacks in Chicago, you'd have a different dynamic. That's the nature of our culture. But in Chicago, you do have 50 schools have closed, create great angst, 50 drug stores closed, 75 grocery stores closed, 85,000 (INAUDIBLE). There's a great sense of despair there. And so it's -- that's why I say there's -- there are dry (ph) chips (ph) around the nation and a spark can set it off, whether it's inner city Newark (ph) or Chicago.

These urban cities deserve attention, and we need a White House conference on policy and reconstruction (ph), and these young people need to be back at work learning how to code an app and doing meaningful stuff with their lives.

TANTAROS: Well, I think we can both agree that it is a huge issue that definitely deserves more attention.

JACKSON: Well, I'm telling...

TANTAROS: Reverend Jesse Jackson, thank you.

JACKSON: ... these young people here to love each other and love everybody. Thank you very much, OK?

They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it ""ricocheted"" back, apparently upsetting the officer. Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.

Some journalists' run-ins with law enforcement were documented on Twitter.

On Wednesday evening, two reporters were briefly held after police officers attempted to clear a McDonald's restaurant where they were working. Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post said they were handcuffed and put into a police van. The Post reported that Lowery said he was slammed against a soda machine and plastic cuffs were put on his wrists. The reporters were subsequently released without any charges.

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.

Now is the time for healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: So, the question, is Ferguson and the Missouri Governor Jay Nixon over-militarizing the town?

Let's bring it around.

Your thoughts on a serious show of force, right?

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: There are three angles to this story. There's the left, there's the right and there's the libertarian.

The left sees this tragedy, and uses it to brand society as a pit of racial injustice. The right uses it often to lecture on culture and lawlessness. And then the libertarians bemoan the militarization of police.

The solution to all of this is just to say they're all right. Every one of those perspectives is correct. There are parts of society where there's racial injustice. There are problems with culture and lawlessness. And they do look like they're commandos.

So, why can't we all agree with that? But the problem -- the reason why we can't agree with it is because agreement is boring. If we all agree with each other, then there's no more news. And then there's no conflict. The media loves conflict.

BOLLING: Dana, do you think they went too far with putting, you know, some serious vehicles, the whole camouflage uniforms and all that, did they need to go that far? Some would say, yes, that works.

DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: So, this might be really boring, but I agree with you, because I just don't think we know enough. So, when President Obama came out today, one of the things he said is that we need a full investigation. But while he is saying that, he was putting the considerable weight of his thumb on the scale against the police.

I'm not quite ready to do that. I can see that people have legitimate grievances from all sides, legitimate concerns. I actually think a full investigation is smart. I really like the idea of changing out the police force, not because the police necessarily has specifically done anything wrong, but because in order to get a full pivot to the next stage of this, which is hopefully reconciliation, and then the investigation that comes out in a full report, I think that had to happen.

And the police chief, the interview he did with Cavuto from Ferguson, Missouri, he was very impressive. I thought he was great.

BOLLING: Bob, before we get to some of the sound bytes of the people weighing in on this. What do you see so far?

BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: Well, Ferguson is similar to a lot of suburbs around big cities. I think about Prince Georges County outside Washington --

PERINO: Yes.

BECKEL: -- which was 80 percent white, 85 percent white, is now almost predominantly black. Ferguson was the same way.

One of the byproducts to that is we end up with a police force that is disproportionately white and not as many black members.

That does not excuse what happened. I go back to what I said yesterday, it's a small percentage.

I think using force like that kind of draws the media in there to see that kind of thing. Believe me when I tell you the media loves those pictures. The fact that these people got arrested, if they were denying what police said. But the last thing I will say is for the police to take somebody's camera is way beyond the pale.

BOLLING: That's exactly what I want to throw to Andrea. Did they go too far to take not only citizens' cameras, reporters' cameras as well?

ANDREA TANTAROS, CO-HOST: Well, I think --

BOLLING: Let me correct that, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. They didn't take them, they made them stop filming. That's --

TANTAROS: Well, think about what we have here. We have citizen journalists now, which we didn't have before. Instead of just the news media being there, we have the people on the streets using their cell phones to film. We have people filming people filming what's going on the streets. So, it is starting to spiral out of question, no question.

I am shocked that the president would get involved in this at this point. I mean, I'm not surprised because he's stuck his nose into other local issues. But to Greg's point, there's the right, there's the middle and then there's the left side of this.

But then there's also the people who aren't there. And that's most of us. That's what the police chief tried do come out and say, he's like, look, the president is not helping the situation by making comments from the Vineyard today. I mean, did he get his updates yesterday in between the Macarena at the party with that?

I just feel like it didn't help. And Dana's absolutely right, the president would have been perfect in pitch with his remarks, but instead, his comments about excessive force by the police, the police that have resisted using excessive force on Sunday night, they backed off on Sunday night and it only got worse -- to me, the president only inflamed the situation. He should have said, the reason we can't have this investigation is because we've been too focused on the rioting. Stop the rioting and call for peace. But he didn't --

BOLLING: I have a lot of sounds to get to. Let me guys. If you don't mind, we're going to give you one perspective, the opposite perspective, and then something I think we can all agree on.

Give us the first one, Kevin Jackson, first.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KEVIN JACKSON, THE BLACK SPHERE: There are many, many more instances of the police doing great things, and not only the black community, but across the nation. You get an incident like this, where you don't even know all the facts, and everybody is automatically jumping to the conclusion that the police have done something wrong. I would ask the folks in the black neighborhood, would you rather the cops not be here, or would you rather they be there to protect you?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: Now, Bob, that might be the other side of your argument there. ] BECKEL: Yes, but also, I just want to say one thing. Obama did say there's never an excuse for violence against police. Or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism, or looting. I think the president of the United States, you know, if he doesn't say something, you all say he should say something, or he gets (INAUDIBLE).

Look, it's got a potential to spiral out, and I will guarantee you what's happening here is a lot of the professional agitators from around the country are on airplanes coming to this site. I mean, people who are - - you know, former Panther people, people like that, they tend to gather in something like this.

And my worry is you're seeing people here who have nothing to do with the whole deal, they're just there to stir things up.

GUTFELD: You know, what Kevin Jackson said is an important point, which is great things are never filmed, rarely filmed. The bad things are.

So, the solution for all of this is cameras, but only if they capture not just the lawlessness, but also the law enforcer equally, so you have a mutually assured destruction. Cameras everywhere, where it isn't private, it's public, will help eliminate the ambiguity and suspicion that surrounds such incidents. So, we know what happened.

BOLLING: It may be a good deterrent as well.

GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. If you know the camera is rolling, you may not do something that maybe -- you know, implicate you later.

Dana, do you want to weigh in on this one?

PERINO: Well, I have one thought about the media piece of it. I think one of the things that the police department could have done and maybe could do is invite those reporters along. Say that, you know what, we'll embed you with us. These are our rules. We want to make sure you're safe. If you want to find out about this story, take them with you.

That's kind of like having a camera on your head, because I think the first hand eyewitness accounts are really important, and something that the media and the police could actually work together, and then solve the problem.

BOLLING: I think I'm going to invest in GoPro. Can you imagine if every police officer in the country had a GoPro?

I want to get -- can I get Andrea now?

BECKEL: Sure.

BOLLING: This one, Kevin Jackson?

TANTAROS: Yes, I think he was right on point with what he said. And my issue, and I'm going to go back to respond with what Bob said.

When President Obama made that comment about the police, my issue is that he put them, the police, on the same moral equivalency as the rioters. So, he chastised both of them.

Look, these images, they're brutal. The police getting Molotov cocktails thrown at them. They look like they have militarized the area.

But again, we don't know what's going on there. I don't know if the DOJ is right in the investigation. Maybe Eric Holder is right, maybe there's a civil rights issue here. All of these extra comments, the president's comments today, the rioting, they don't help us get closer to getting the answers of what really happened.

BOLLING: Let me get this in, Bob. I know you want to get -- you can comment after this. Let's listen to John Lewis now. Honestly, this is kind of a little bit surprising. But listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. JOHN LEWIS (D), GEORGIA: President Obama should use the authority of his office to declare martial law, federalize the Missouri National Guard to protect people as they protest. And people should come together.

If we fail to act, the fires of frustration and discontent will continue to burn. Not only in Ferguson, Missouri, but all across America.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: Now, Bobby, are you surprised that Representative Lewis, who knows a thing or two about protests, would go so far as to say president Obama should declare martial law?

BECKEL: No, I'm not, because in his era of protesting, that was exactly what happened. I think John has not -- I mean, the times have -- he did a magnificent job when he did.

Can I make one other point about the press? There have been two town meetings that have been packed and people have been waiting on the outside to try to get in. I don't know about the rest of you, I saw no coverage of those town meetings, which were fairly dignified. Some people were allowed.

But I saw plenty of footage of glass being broken. That's the problem.

Then, you -- then, you have -- when Obama says First Amendment rights, First Amendment rights are exactly right, but it also includes seems to me is covering the whole story. And if you don't go into a place where they have two peaceful packed town meetings, hundreds of -- maybe 1,000 people, you're not getting that side of the story.

GUTFELD: I mean, it's an image race right now. People are looking for the most explosive images. A lot of these images feature intimidating figures, the police dressed in a certain manner. When you see this, it's disturbing to see decent citizens standing there, and men who really look like they should be in Afghanistan.

But it undermines what is really an important purpose, which is intimidation, which is necessary. It eliminates the need for force. No cop wants to put their hands on you, because in this age, they're going to get sued because they're being filmed. Their lives will be ruined. So, intimidating -- being a force of intimidation hopefully ends the conflict before a conflict starts.

But it doesn't look that way on camera. Instead it looks like David and Goliath. And the media loves David and Goliath. They love that story. They beat it to death.

BOLLING: Can I pick a piece of sound here that I think a lot of people watching, hopefully everyone at the table would agree with? Take a listen. This is mayor of Ferguson.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you feel about the arrival or the presence of Al Sharpton?

MAYOR JAMES KNOWLES, FERGUSON, MISSOURI: I have concern that we will lose sight of this young man and the tragedy. And become clearly a national spectacle, instead of losing, instead focusing on this young man and the issues at hand. So, sometimes star power is not always a good thing.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: Would you agree with the mayor?

TANTAROS: How can you not?

BOLLING: Yes.

TANTAROS: I mean, again, there may be a legitimate wrongdoing here by the police. We just don't know yet.

The problem is, every time you see Al Sharpton, you go right to race. Then nobody focuses on the facts anymore. You have one side trying to make it about race, the Al Sharptons of the world, he doesn't have the greatest track record.

And then you have the other side that's trying to make it about everything but what went on. And it just becomes a fight between right and left and then you have more division. But yes, I mean, look, Al Sharpton, so far and up to this point, he's condemned the violence. He hasn't said anything completely inflammatory that I've heard. But it's just the connotation and the association that makes it far worse.

And, again, President Obama should not have said anything today. I don't think he helped the situation.

PERINO: I think it's interesting that --we checked right before, the population of Ferguson is only 21,000 people. So, not only do you have this explosive situation, now you have national media attention, and the national divisive figures coming, and not just a national story, this is probably an international story by now, saying, look at what's happening in America.

I think that we -- Al Sharpton takes away the perspective that everyone could have, and that the mayor, the police chief, the governor, the calm that they're trying to bring to the area.

BECKEL: Well, I don't think it's going to become -- what happens here, the most explosive of these things, like this is during the funeral. When this kid gets in a hearse and they take him down and they take him to a graveyard, there's going to be potential for a lot of unrest.

Now, Al Sharpton is Al Sharpton. We all know about that. It doesn't help.

On the other hand, I have a feeling this is a bigger story than perhaps we want it to be. There's been frustration building up. There always is. And the summertime is the worst time to have these.

BOLLING: Bob, before we go, Greg, do you want to weigh in on this one?

GUTFELD: Well, I was going to say, you know, Al Sharpton's goal is to raise tension, because that expands his power and influence. That's his career. And he somehow becomes the czar of racial division because by having him over at the White House so often, it gave him a greater stature. He is like the czar of division.

BOLLING: Quick, I want to just weigh in on your comment earlier, you said the community had changed from a predominantly white community to a predominantly black community. It's about 75 percent black now. Ninety percent of the police force is white. Are you saying the police force should reflect more accurately what the community --

BECKEL: I think -- no, I don't think you can take cops out of their jobs. They put time in, they're moving up. It just -- it's happened in Prince Georges County, the same thing. And there were racial tensions and part of it was because the black community, I think they were reflective on the police department.

BOLLING: Does it go the other way, too, though?

BECKEL: I really do think -- two things. They should try to recruit as many black officers as they can. And secondly, as soon as they get the information out here, this is a case to get out as much as you can that's been proved sooner rather than later.

BOLLING: We've got to go. Quick thoughts, anyone?

TANTAROS: It doesn't help when the chief of police is tweeting out that people have a right to be suspicious of cops. I think they should stay off social media and they should just let the investigation play out.

BOLLING: Ands, I hate to cut you off, but Porter is yelling in my ear. He's yelling in my ear again.

We have a lot more on the unrest in Missouri, next.

And later, the wife of the late Robin Williams issued a statement. She revealed a disease that the legend was suffering from, besides depression, that no one knew about. We'll have that in a minute.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

TANTAROS: Well, back now with more on the chaos in Ferguson, Missouri. Social media has played a very big role in this tragedy. Some of it helps, some of it hurts.

Earlier, I mentioned the chief of police saying that it's OK for people to be suspicious of the police. I don't believe that that helped the situation at all. But do posts like this on outlets like Facebook from black Americans who are outraged about the looting, do they help or do they hurt?

Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What we're doing out here is not helping. Us rioting, looting, I'm sick of it! I'm not going to tell you and tell you, we're going to march, we're going to do this, we're going to do that, I'm going to tell you, let's change! When is this going to stop? When? How are our children supposed to grow up when we are here acting like fools?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TANTAROS: OK. He lives in California, Eric, but there have been a number of people speaking out on Twitter, on Facebook, either for or against what's happening there. A lot of different sides.

Is it just extra chatter that is unnecessary? Or does this help?

BOLLING: You know what, Ands? He said almost the same thing, Kevin Jackson said in the first -- in the ""A"" block. Kevin Jackson delivered it in a completely different manner. Let's wait. Before we go and judge what happened here, let's get the facts and let's be smart and let's not put ourselves in these situations, as the black community.

So, if you listen to more of Jackson's commentary. They were almost exactly the same. They just have different delivery. So, I don't think it hurts. I mean I think there will be a certain percentage of the community that listen and say, you know, he's right. I needed to hear it in that form. And there are others who will say, Kevin Jackson said it in a calm tone, and I understood that, too. But the message is the same.

TANTAROS: Dana, earlier in the ""A"" block, Greg was talking how difficult it is because of social media and the cameras and people taking pictures. It is scary to see police dressed in these type of fatigues. But I would assume that they wouldn't be dressed that way if they really thought their lives were in danger and this was a dangerous situation.

How about people taking pictures of that, the perception, other news outlets running pictures over and over of the police in this gear? Does it help? Or does it skew it? I mean, it's a little scary for me to watch. But I think it's probably necessary.

PERINO: I think it's probably skewed it against the police department, which at this point, they don't need to worry about talking about their outfits. They have more important things to do. And as public servants, you have an obligation to make sure that whatever you're saying on social media is going to either -- it's not going to fuel the problem. I think that maybe there are some -- maybe some guidelines that need to be established so people don't do that.

However, you asked a good question, is it helping or is it hurting? I think in some ways you have to accept that it's never -- we're never going back to a point where we don't have the ability to discuss things on social media. Maybe the outlet is very good. I do think it's a little different for public servants. When it comes to the police, I can understand that people are saying, why do you need that? Why do you need all that gear in Ferguson, Missouri?

However, I also don't think that I have much knowledge or expertise to say that the military -- I'm sorry, that the police doesn't deserve to have the kind of protection that they think that they need. Maybe for some people, it was over the top. But they're protecting -- the police are having to protect themselves, and they have the latest gear in order to do that.

TANTAROS: There's no question, Greg, that we need an investigation. I think the police agree they're a little tied up right now trying to stem the looting. This is actually hurting getting to the bottom of what happened. But the looters don't care, they don't want to wait for the facts anyway.

But President Obama in his remarks today mentioned Eric Holder launching an investigation. Here's the president talking how his administration is going to get involved.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: I've already tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI to independently investigate the death of Michael Brown, along with local officials on the ground. I made clear to the attorney general that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened, and to see that justice is done.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TANTAROS: Maybe the DOJ does need to get involved, we don't know.

GUTFELD: Well, I guess, of course, this is an issue. It's a crisis.

But in my opinion, all serious crimes are a crisis. There is a sense with Holder, that actual crimes were the same comparison, if there was a shooting here and a shooting there. Some matter more than others. And I think he's made that clear in his views, that he is an activist and that he looks at America through a particular prism of race, and that creates a more activist DOJ.

So, there's always some kind jaundiced or skeptical view when you think of Holder. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that the DOJ should be looking into this, because, again, this is a crisis. Nobody knows what happened, and it's a serious possible crime. Who knows?

TANTAROS: Bob, we've been saying on social media a little bit in this block. The Justice Department tweeted out about a ""Huffington Post"" reporter. They probably shouldn't have done it. It appears that they are not picking sides in the media, but, I mean, Dana is nodding her head.

Should the Department of Justice be highlighting reporters at outlets that notoriously lean left who are covering the story, or should they just focus on the facts and stay off Twitter?

BECKEL: I mean, that's a fact that they were arrested. I mean, you need to go with that.

I would be curious when this investigation is over, was it really necessary to bring out all that riot gear. Maybe it was. But my guess is, if it wasn't, it's inflamed the citizenry more than it should be.

And the second thing is, when you listen to that guy on social media, he's from California. The last thing that most -- the vast majority of blacks in this country want to see is looting. And it reminds him, he was kid, there was looting during -- when Martin Luther King was killed. And it was horrible. He said, my kids have to grow up and see this.

And he's right. I think that there must be a reaction by the black community that says, this is enough, this is not who we are. And we gave him coverage, I'm glad we did. But most people do not.

TANTAROS: All right. Up next on THE FIVE: is ISIS looking for recruits in the West? Greg will show you some concerning leaflets that have been circulating around London. That's coming up.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GUTFELD: The British police are investigating pro-ISIS leaflets said to be found in London, asking Muslims to join their merry band of death credence, which makes me miss the good old days when it was the Hare Krishnas handing out the leaflets. The worst thing they did was chant. There was never a beheading.

So these fliers aren't about finding peace or even pizza. They're offering a way out for bitter weirdoes, a promise of revenge in an evil world.

Not that I care. If you want to join a death cult, go ahead. I hope you die in a cloud of dust. Which is why, when one asks if these leaflets should be stopped, I say never. We need this activity out in the open, because recruitment does us a big favor. It gets the evil out of our country. If radical Islamists leave to fight in Iraq or Syria or Afghanistan, that's far better than the reverse. I'd rather America fight them over there, obliterating these terrorists into a sticky paste, than have them decapitating citizens here in the street.

ISIS could be their magnet, a glorious roach motel that attracts the very worst of this planet, where they die in large groups. Of course, this all depends on whether the west is willing to do the dirty work to keep them from returning. Because for every time we say no boots on the ground, you can hear the footsteps of their boots right behind us.

PERINO: Hmm.

GUTFELD: Hmm. What does that mean?

PERINO: Someone told me that it's awkward after your monologue if we don't say anything. But I -- it's really because we just need a moment to absorb the brilliance.

GUTFELD: Oh, thank you.

PERINO: I was trying to fill the silence.

BECKEL: Can you speak for yourself?

GUTFELD: Bob, what do you have? What was wrong with it?

BECKEL: I think this -- handing out these pamphlets is a good example of group like Subway trying to get people to come get -- but ISIS...

GUTFELD: Are you calling Subway terrorists?

BECKEL: Yes, they are. And their food...

GUTFELD: This is great.

BECKEL: But the -- they probably advertise that. I'm in trouble again.

But you know, the fact that ISIS -- no organized group goes out and hands out pamphlets on a street, No. 1.

No. 2, we've already driven them out of two -- they've been driven out of two towns by the Kurds. They've been driven out of another town near the mountains. These are guys that, when they're confronted with people who have guns, are not nearly as big a crowd as people think. I will repeat my point, they are the J.V.

GUTFELD: Dana, you're having flashes.

PERINO: I'm having a hot flash of anger, OK?

GUTFELD: All right.

PERINO: I just -- I think that, when the 9/11 Commission comes out a decade after their original report and says America is more complacent than ever before 9/11, I think that it is a serious problem. Do you remember, Greg, when the soldier in Britain was executed in the streets?

GUTFELD: Yes. Yes.

PERINO: It was a beheading.

GUTFELD: Yes.

PERINO: All right. Then the soldiers in Britain were told, ""Do not wear your uniforms outside, because you don't want to offend anybody.""

So I agree, I'm glad that the leaflets are being handed out. I think that it actually is organized, and I think it's propaganda that has to be fought combat to combat. I'm for that.

GUTFELD: Eric, are the leaflets a big deal?

BOLLING: They are -- no, I think you're right. I think they have -- we need to see that this goes on.

But I will tell you, Bobby, I'm going to take the other side of it. They're not J.V. They're not -- it's not just leaflets. They have a sophisticated P.R. wing. They're putting out videos that are amazingly produced.

BECKEL: Not hard to do in this day and age.

BOLLING: No, no, no. But no one else is -- how is this? They have a better P.R. wing than the White House has. That's how good it is.

BECKEL: Well, that -- that might be the case. But I would think...

BOLLING: You really need to spend some time. I mean, these are videos that are training. I'm sorry. Their recruiting videos, they're unbelievable. They make it seem like they're -- they're on this beautiful mission to, you know, save the world of all the ills of the western people.

PERINO: Fight the (UNINTELLIGIBLE) people.

BOLLING: And you don't see any of that, though. You don't see the beheadings and the savagery and the kids hanging on crosses and things like that. Out of control good, and they're definitely not the J.V.

BECKEL: Well, I -- has anybody heard the Iraqi -- the vaunted Iraqi military say one thing? Not one.

PERINO: I heard our defense secretary yesterday say in front of Marines that this is a terrorist threat like the world has never seen.

BECKEL: I heard that.

PERINO: I don't think that it's...

BECKEL: The five of us could go marching through an area with nobody shooting at us and hurt people. And I want to know where -- I keep coming back to, where is this vaunted Iraqi military...

TANTAROS: No organized group can pass out leaflets on the street? There's an organized group of palm readers on the Upper West Side...

BECKEL: That's right, which is exactly what I think these guys are.

TANTAROS: Palm readers? A little bit different. They cut off people's palms.

BECKEL: Yes, I understand that, but...

TANTAROS: They cut off the palms of children. I would love to know, if you think they are J.V., who is the ""A"" team then? Who are the really elite terrorists if they -- no, no, no, let me finish. Who are the elite terrorists if these guys are J.G. -- J.V.? What do you consider being elite? Because they're beheading people. They're killing women; they're killing children. I just want to know: Who does it better than them?

BECKEL: I think this -- I think the Navy SEALs are elite. I think these guys are the J.V.

GUTFELD: Do you think they're stupid?

BECKEL: I think they're stupid. They're going through --swathing through these areas with no opposition whatsoever. Anybody could do that without...

TANTAROS: What do you mean opposition? They're not going to be able to take Baghdad. They'll get pushed back like they've never seen before.

BECKEL: Well, there you go. They're not that big a deal, are they?

TANTAROS: But they've been very successful at taking other regions.

BECKEL: Other regions because the Baghdad military, the Iraqi military has not been there to stop them. Has it?

PERINO: That is such a -- that is such a -- just a false way of looking at it, Bob.

BECKEL: Why is it false?

PERINO: I don't know who you're protecting. Are you trying to protect President Obama?

BECKEL: No. I'm not trying to protect anybody. I want to -- Obama - - Obama...

PERINO: How in the -- how in the world can you say that these people are J.V. when the defense secretary says it's a -- it's a terrorist group like the world has never seen?

BECKEL: Well, first of all, I think that -- I think that's vastly an overstatement.

PERINO: How do you know? The defense secretary sits there in the situation room every day. He gets all the information. And it's his job to say in front of the Marines what he thinks. I just want to know, like where do you get your information that you can tell the American people that it's not a big deal?

BECKEL: You give me this. You explain to me where the Iraqi military is.

PERINO: I don't care where the Iraqi military is.

BECKEL: Why don't you care? We spent $168 million to train them!

PERINO: Because it's not the subject. The subject is about...

BECKEL: Oh, come on.

PERINO: I can argue about the Iraqi -- you want to do the next segment...

BECKEL: It's not just...

PERINO: ... and talk about the Iraqi army? That's not what we're here to talk about.

BECKEL: Well, if you have a military and supposedly a tough bunch of people...

PERINO: No, they're not. OK.

BECKEL: ... and we don't have a single person up against them except for the United States Air Force, then of course they're going to march across. Once they hit resistance, they backed off.

PERINO: No, that is -- OK.

BECKEL: The Kurds drove them out of two towns. And they were driven out of a town yesterday.

PERINO: I'm sure the American people are very comforted to know that Bob thinks that the terrorists are not important, but the defense secretary thinks it's the worst terrorist organization the world has ever...

BECKEL: And do not walk down your street worried about your head is being chopped off. Please.

GUTFELD: Didn't they just take more towns in Syria?

BECKEL: What?

GUTFELD: They just took a couple more towns.

BECKEL: I'm talking about Iraq.

GUTFELD: Oh, OK.

PERINO: But they started in Syria. Hence the name, ISIS, in Syria.

BECKEL: I think they changed it. I think they changed it to...

PERINO: It all goes back to the president and his false red line in Syria.

BECKEL: I think it -- well, I agree with you on that. They called themselves the Islamic state. But I still want to know where the people with no guts, where the Iraqis are who will not fight.

GUTFELD: All right.

TANTAROS: It's a totally different thing, though.

BECKEL: We're tired of spending our money for your lousy soldiers who are not willing to fight.

GUTFELD: All right. OK, Bob. Here we go. President Obama is making a mysterious trip back to D.C. in the middle of his vacation. That was fun. It's shrouded in secrecy. But Dana thinks she might know what it's about, if she doesn't kill Bob during the break.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PERINO: Bob and I made up. We're going to talk about something else now, because we all know President Obama likes his down time, and who can blame him? It looks like so much fun. So why is he breaking up his two- week vacation Sunday for just one meeting back in Washington? The White House keeps reminding us that the president can work from anywhere. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ERIC SCHULTZ, WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN: The president is the president wherever he goes. He travels with a wide array of communications equipment. We also travel with a staff that allows us to have robust operational capabilities.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: So we're left to speculate, and here's my thoughts. I think he's making a personnel announcement, something he could not do with the Martha's Vineyard backdrop behind him. A cabinet secretary resignation maybe, or perhaps something outside of his administration.

Bob, I want to give you a chance to agree with me here. I think it could be a Supreme Court resignation and a nomination. Something that will jam the midterm elections in the Democrats' favor as they make everyone worry that they're going to lose their birth control.

BECKEL: I -- I think you're on point on that. He said something, you know, in an interview about he thought that he would replace a Supreme Court justice in his term. Two years left. And we know that, at least in Ginsberg's case, she's very sick. So that wouldn't surprise me.

The other thing I hope he would say, without trying to rekindle this argument, is they're going to ask the Iraqis for the money back that we used to train their infamous army.

PERINO: Do you think he would go back to Washington to do that?

BECKEL: I would -- yes.

PERINO: You mentioned Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Let's take a listen to what she had to say just, like, three weeks ago.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBERG, U.S. SUPREME COURT: I think people know that I'm here to stay. And my answer is, I will do this job as long as I can do it full steam.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: OK, Andrea, that said, earlier this summer, I was at an event where a senator, a Democratic senator addressed a gathering, and he said, you better be really worried about Republicans taking over, because if Republicans take over President Obama won't be able to have his Supreme Court nominee of his choice. And you're going into a place where Senator Reid might not be in charge anymore. Do you think my theory is far- fetched, or perhaps in the realm of possibility?

TANTAROS: I think it's in the realm of possibility. And if you are correct, nothing will gin up the base, No. 1, which is what they need for a midterm election.

But No. 2, nothing will change the news cycle, and change the dialogue like something like this. And I believe everything the president's doing now is designed to manage the news cycle.

So exactly what we're doing in Iraq, trying to save these women and children. That is just an action designed to keep off the headlines as Obama did. There's women and children dying at the hands of terrorists. He does everything from foreign policy to domestic policy with the news cycle in mind. And that is why there's all this buzz. I mean, President Obama working on a Sunday, working on a Sunday. That really shouldn't be a typical headline.

(CROSSTALK)

BECKEL: Those people are coming back down to the mountains, thanks to the United States military.

TANTAROS: But he wants us to sit around and talk about why he's actually working on a Sunday. We should just be like, ""Oh, well, he's working. Who cares?""

PERINO: Is it an usual move, right, Eric? Do you think I'm being a conspiracy theorist?

BOLLING: No, not at all. I think you're 100 percent right. I think Andrea is right: the optics of it look good. He left Martha's Vineyard vacation where he's golfing. By the way, he left the golf course within minutes after that. Six minutes after that press conference.

BECKEL: So would you.

BOLLING: So I would think, I would love to think that he was coming back because, I don't know, ISIS is taking Iraq, our border agents are getting shot on the southern border, and you know, gas is four bucks a gallon. I would think that would be a good reason to come back. But that would mean he'd have to stay.

TANTAROS: Maybe he's releasing more terrorists.

BOLLING: Just one day, right?

PERINO: Just one day, and he was very specific, for a meeting with Biden. Greg, let's get your take on this. What do you think?

GUTFELD: It's always -- it's Occam's razor. You go to the most obvious. Why is he returning? He forgot his putter. Or he needs to do his laundry. Because you know when you go away for a month, it's always hard to figure out how much underwear to bring.

Here's the big story here. You saw the press spokesman. That wasn't Josh Earnest.

PERINO: No.

GUTFELD: Because Josh Earnest is out on paternity leave. And that's a piece of information I would like to put in a time machine and send back to our founders in 1776.

PERINO: Because they did not get paternity leave?

GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't. They would go, what?

PERINO: What is that?

GUTFELD: Awesome.

BECKEL: Let's go back to another thought that you had a couple days ago. I would not be -- I wouldn't fall off my chair if -- first of all, the Supreme Court nominee, the balance would still be 5-4.

PERINO: Correct.

BECKEL: Secondly, it may be Kerry.

PERINO: It also could be Eric Holder. Right? Because Eric Holder is saying he might not stay for the rest of the term.

BECKEL: Yes.

PERINO: And so Eric Holder...

BECKEL: Whoever it is is...

PERINO: A Supreme Court nominee, and then...

BECKEL: Now, that may be exactly right.

GUTFELD: It could be an ""Entourage"" marathon.

PERINO: Thank you, Bob.

BECKEL: That would be a brilliant move, too.

PERINO: All right. We're going to move on. Is it time for a woman to make a debut on a U.S. dollar bill?

GUTFELD: No.

PERINO: Would you vote for it if it ever came to pass? We're going to tell you who we picked next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BECKEL: President Obama originally said he was open to the idea of finally putting a female face on American paper money. Eric's been opposed to this for a long time. With so many great choices, particularly from the last century, we thought we might have a little fun and pick the ones we'd like to go first. My two choices would be Eleanor Roosevelt and Rosa Parks.

BOLLING: That's it? Why?

BECKEL: What do you mean why? Why Eleanor Roosevelt? Probably the strongest woman, first lady there ever was. And Rosa Parks, because she had more courage than any 200 million men in America.

TANTAROS: I was going to say Nancy Reagan.

BECKEL: Eric.

BOLLING: OK. So, the -- the idea that you have a prominent American female. So I said Hillary Clinton first, but she's already on a Bill, right? Ayn Rand.

BECKEL: You're wrong about that.

BOLLING: I'm sorry. Ayn Rand. Some people say ""ind,"" some people say ""Ann."" I just...

BECKEL: Isn't she dead?

BOLLING: Yes, but she's being...

BECKEL: Good. That would mean she won't be the only Republican on the Supreme Court.

BOLLING: Well, I'm trying to embrace the libertarian movement ad best I can.

PERINO: I went with Willa Cather. I went a little unconventional. She's a great...

BECKEL Willa Cather?

PERINO: Do you know Willa Cather?

BECKEL: Did they make the catheter?

PERINO: The great American author. And she wrote one of the best American novels, ""Death Comes for the Archbishop."" And I think that women who can express themselves at that point in really great literature at that point had an impact on America.

BECKEL: There you go.

All right. Here we go. This is going to be.

GUTFELD: I'm just amazed they didn't put these people on a bill. I'm just absolutely shocked. That's the whole point of this segment was to show -- oh, we can't do that with money? They just told me it's against the law.

BOLLING: You're having a conversation with...

GUTFELD: I apologize. By the way, why does this have to be about gender? Why does it have to be a human? I suggest a manatee. Nature's sea cow. This one in particular is neither male nor female. It's a quasi- hermaphrodite. And we skirt past all these issues.

TANTAROS: It's cute(ph).

GUTFELD: It's cute. It's an adorable sea cow. Hello, sea cow.

""Hello, Greg.""

BECKEL: Andrea, you're up.

TANTAROS: Can I discuss it about this segment? We've done some really ridiculous segments on this show. The most ridiculous is what kind of underpants you wear. But this takes the cake.

Are we really debating would replace G.W. with and throw George on the ash heap of history for some female or male or whoever?

WASHINGTON: Who else is on -- who else is on the bill?

TANTAROS: This is crazy. I think we need our head examined.

BECKEL: Who else is on the bill except George Washington? Jefferson...

PERINO: Wasn't it on any bill?

TANTAROS: I'll stick with G. Dubs.

BECKEL: Is Hoover on one of the bills?

GUTFELD: He had a wig.

BECKEL: He could be replaced.

GUTFELD: He had a wig. He was clearly a cross dresser.

TANTAROS: President Obama is getting -- another distraction to manage the news cycle. Who should we put on the dollar? What women should we have? And we're just falling into it.

PERINO: We can talk about the Iraqi army.

BECKEL: Yes. Or we could put the -- I was going to say we put -- never mind.

OK. ""One More Thing"" is up next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BOLLING: All righty. Time for ""One More Thing"". I'll start it off.

I love the Sunday talk shows. I absolutely love all of them. I'm a political junky. ""Meet the Press"" is one of my favorites. Porter said I should get a life.

However, today it was announced David Gregory is being replaced on ""Meet the Press."" That's with Chuck Todd. Chuck Todd is on the left there, the White House -- senior NBC White House correspondent for years. So we'll take a look. We'll see what's going on right there, 6 1/2 years after that.

Let's take a look at David Gregory's good-bye tweet, if you don't mind. Pull it up. It says -- wee now, it's smaller. Can you just read it? There it goes. ""I leave NBC as I came, humbled and grateful. I love journalism and serving as moderator of 'Meet the Press' was the highest honor there is.""

So good luck, David, on your future, wherever you're headed and look forward to...

TANTAROS: Can I just make a recommendation?

BECKEL: You put they could put Ichabod Crane in for...

TANTAROS: No, that's not nice. I would suggest Chuck Todd get rid of the goatee.

BECKEL: Yes, exactly.

TANTAROS: I think he looks more handsome.

BOLLING: Like ""putting on a tie, Bolling."" Go ahead, Bob, you're up.

BECKEL: Robin Williams' wife announced that, besides his -- his depression -- and that he was sober at the time this happened. That he was suffering from early Parkinson's Disease.

That does not surprise me, since most alcoholics develop Parkinson's Disease or some form of dementia early in their life. So it's not surprising at all; it's not a big revelation.

BOLLING: Dana, you're up.

PERINO: All right. Remember the most transparent White House in history claim? Well, this is interesting.

Forty-seven of the 73 inspectors general -- these are the independent people that inspect the departments and do all the oversight -- they wrote a letter, 47 of them signed it, saying that they are concerned because they are not able to actually get any documents from the administration in cooperation from agencies such as the EPA. And not just the EPA, but many of the other ones.

But I also thought it was interesting, Bob, that they -- the EPA, Justice Department and the Peace Corps is one of the worst. I don't know why the Peace Corps is one of them.

BOLLING: Got to move it along. Greg, you're up.

GUTFELD: Let's ban a phrase today. And it is, ""hug it out."" This is one of the worst phrases ever.

BOLLING: Thank God!

GUTFELD: Ever, ever. It came from the worst show in history called ""Entourage,"" which is responsible for all bro humor of the last ten years. All of these people are has-beens, including Adrian Grenier. It happens to be President Obama's favorite show, which says everything. Hug it out.

BOLLING: I am so, so happy you did that.

GUTFELD: Terrible song. Terrible.

BOLLING: All right, Ands. Yours.

TANTAROS: Yesterday a number of us FOX gals got to get together and send off our beautiful, beloved colleague, Jenna Lee right there in the middle with the belly. She's going off to maternity leave, and she doesn't know if she's having a boy or girl. So there is the group yesterday.

You see Janice, Laura, Harris. You recognize a lot of faces. There's Jenna with her baby gear from FNC. I'm kissing the bump there. The baby whisperer, Harris called me.

And there is Laura Ingle, who is a butt-kicking machine when it comes to baby games. I failed miserably. There's Kennedy. She had a very funny birthing story that she shared, which is hilarious.

And best of luck to Jenna and thank you to Colori (ph) Tavern for doing such a great job. We wish Jenna the best. And tweet me, boy or girl, what do you think?

BECKEL: And may her husband make it through the procedure.

LOUIS –  St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson says he was so concerned by the way police handled rioting and unrest in nearby Ferguson that he's no longer sending his city's officers to assist.

Dotson told The Associated Press on Thursday that a 24-officer tactical unit and the city's lone armored vehicle were sent to the St. Louis suburb on Sunday and Monday.

Protests, including a night of looting, erupted after a Ferguson police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown on Saturday. Brown was unarmed.

Dotson says he was concerned by how protesters were treated, and for his officers' safety. He decided Tuesday to no longer send officers to the protest area.

The Associated Press has not been able to verify the name. Police and prosecutors have declined to name the officer, citing concerns that his life, and the lives of his relatives, could be endangered if his identity is made public.

St. Louis County police and the FBI are investigating the shooting. County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said Wednesday that it could be several weeks before the investigation wraps up and authorities decide whether to charge the officer.

On Wednesday night, police in riot gear again used tear gas to disperse protesters after some threw explosive devices and rocks at officers.

Instead, officers in riot gear have clashed with people protesting the death of Michael Brown.

Wednesday saw more confrontations, and two reporters said they were detained by police before being released. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported about 10 people had been arrested, including St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has chronicled the protests on social media.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: Of course, it's important to remember how this started. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Joining us now from Tallahassee, Florida Benjamin Crump -- he's the attorney for Michael Brown's parents. Mr. Crump also represented the parents of Trayvon Martin. So Mr. Crump, what was the family's reaction to hearing the President say that about their son today?

BENJAMIN CRUMP, ATTORNEY FOR MICHAEL BROWN'S FAMILY: They were -- they're devastated still so they're dealing with it, Laura, best they can. They were heartened to hear the President address not only Michael but also the situation in their home town saying that we need to be peaceful and we need to protest in a responsible way.

INGRAHAM: And Mr. Crump, what is their reaction then to the police department's unwillingness to identify the police officer in question? Because there is a lot of controversy around that. They're demanding to know who he is and then concerned that obviously there have been death threats against him and apparently his family. What is their latest on that?

CRUMP: Well, Laura, they are parents who are still trying to come to the reality that their son is never coming back, that he was shot multiple times by a police officer in broad daylight when he was clearly unarmed with a t-shirt, shorts and flip-flops. It is a situation where they continue to wait for answers from the police department. And when they won't even give the name of the police officer that shot their teenage son multiple times as witnesses described it, execution style, they just can't understand why they are not being transparent.

INGRAHAM: And Mr. Crump, the President's statement today, at the same time talking about Iraq and then he went in and talked about this. Did you have any conversations with Eric Holder or has the White House reached out to you in the aftermath of all of this?

CRUMP: No ma'am. It has been the Justice Department officials have - - went to Missouri and met with the family and are doing a joint investigation and this time we are requesting strenuously that they do an independent investigation because there is such distrust between the local community and the family and law enforcement agencies there in St. Louis. So we want independent investigation. And Laura, we really want an independent autopsy especially looking at the ballistics examinations because there is no way to justify doing this to this kid.

INGRAHAM: Now, as far as you understand, the community itself, before this happened, the racial relationship between the police department and the community -- majority black community, 30 percent white, what was it like? I interviewed some store owners on my radio show earlier this week and they were from Israel, actually. And they said -- we have always had great -- we have never had any problems here in Ferguson. We have a great business. We have a great community. Their store was looted, unfortunately, he said we have always had great relationships.

CRUMP: And just for the family perspective, Laura, they are very disappointed with the looting and the rioting. They don't think that's a reflection of what they want their son's legacy to be. And so they would ask that people peacefully protest.

As you asked about the relationships, I think there have been some challenges with getting diversity within the police department and that was one of the ongoing struggles between the police and the community and the hope is that if everything is transparent, that this community can be healed and they will be able to move forward from this tragedy.

INGRAHAM: All right, Mr. Crump thanks so much. We appreciate it.",NA,0,NA,NA

VAN SUSTEREN: ""The Washington Post's"" Wes Lowery joins us on the phone.

Good evening, Wes. And, Wes, what were you being arrested for? Have you figured that out?

WES LOWERY, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: We were told that we were trespassing in a McDonald's where we had purchased food, we had been spending hours. In fact, today when I went back to McDonald's most of the employees were saying, we are so sorry for what happened to you, are you OK?

VAN SUSTEREN: Had McDonald's called the police or did the police just show up?

LOWERY: My understanding -- I can't say that definitively because the manager was not in today. But our understanding is that the police just showed up. They showed up. They asked people to leave. Not demanded, but asked. If the riot was coming to McDonald's, that's where we would want to be, being reporters. Wes said, we are fine, officers. You are warning us things are going to get hot. We understand. If the protest is moving this way, we want to stay. They didn't like that answer, and so then they decided that they were evacuating the McDonald's. It was no longer, you should leave, it's now you have to leave immediately.

VAN SUSTEREN: Were you actually handcuffed?

LOWERY: I was put in plastic restraints, plastic handcuffs, the kind that riot police officers use.

VAN SUSTEREN: What was it that prompted them to release you?

LOWERY: We were sitting in a jail cell and fellow reporter from the ""L.A. Times"" called the police chief and said, what in the world is going on? The police chief said, quote, ""Oh, God.""

(LAUGHTER)

And so he called in and got us out of the cell. They released us, gave us no information, no police report. We asked repeatedly for the officers' names, for badge numbers. They refused to cooperate with us and give us any information about who they were. Ryan was slammed into a door. I was thrown up into a soda fountain machine because we weren't leaving a private establishment fast enough and had the audacity to videotape police officers.

VAN SUSTEREN: I assume during the process you told them you were journalists, during the process where they were cuffing you?

LOWERY: My credentials were hanging from my neck the entire time. The reason it took so long is I had multiple notebooks strewn across the table. My computer was set up. We had had been working, using McDonald's essentially as an office.

VAN SUSTEREN: And for people who don't cover these stories, when you are out in the field, you make an office wherever someone will give you an outlet, to charge your phone and laptop, and you spend hours there. We all do that.

LOWERY: McDonalds, I'm not going to speak for them but they have been nice to us. A lot of reporters in and out. Only place with Wi-Fi. They have been great to us. Hard to believe McDonald's wanted us out. They never said that to us.

Again, we were forcibly removed. The officer was obsessed that I didn't pack up my things fast enough, which as can you see from the video, from the moment I start walking backwards to the moment I begin walking back forward again, it's less than a minute. I'm talking four or five notebooks, a computer plugged in, and I'm doing it with one hand because there is a SWAT officer with an assault weapon who was gesturing it at me. I thought I ought to record that.

VAN SUSTEREN: Wes, you have been the reporter, the national reporter there the longest. Tell me, in comparing tonight with like last night, does it look like there is going to be more trouble tonight or does the lid seem to be on it? Give me a compare and contrast.

LOWERY: Greta, I have got to tell you, things could not be more different. This is a different city tonight than it has been any other night. Monday night, during the tear gas and rubber bullets, I was worried for my life. Right now, it's an extremely peaceful protest. We have the superintendent of the state police out marching, or the highway patrol, is marching with the protesters. He is the man who grew up here. People are walking up to him and hugging him. The person with the bullhorn leading the march said, ""Respect the police because they respect us."" The tone is night and day right now.

VAN SUSTEREN: Wes, thank you. Glad you are out of custody. Thank you, Wes.

SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Now, despite the Reverend Al Sharpton's efforts to interject himself into the Ferguson shooting, prominent black leaders, as well as city officials, are voicing major concern about his involvement and urging him to use caution.

Now, just yesterday, the Ferguson mayor had this to say during an interview with Newsmax and Steve Malzberg. Take a listen.

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

MAYOR JAMES KNOWLES, FERGUSON, MISSOURI: Sometimes star power is not always a good thing. There's competing protests today, and Sharpton -- there's been some comments made by some leaders who don't want Sharpton's protest to happen today, so -- African-American leaders and some of the African-American elected officials. So you know, it's unfortunate, you know, even -- even the groups concerned here are not necessarily on the same page.

(END AUDIO CLIP)

HANNITY: And earlier this morning, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Alveda King, said this on ""Fox & Friends."" Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ALVEDA KING, MARTIN LUTHER KING'S NIECE: When Al Sharpton comes, sometimes I don't know what his goal is, but people continue to riot and things escalate. And so I'm asking now, speak peace, Reverend Sharpton.  Speak love. Speak justice. But you can have justice without violence.  Our Jesus Christ showed that. Gandhi showed that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: All right, here with reaction is -- St. Louis NAACP President Adolphus Morris Pruitt is with us. Welcome to the program.  Thanks for being with us.

ADOLPHUS MORRIS PRUITT, ST. LOUIS NAACP PRES.: Yes. Thank you.

HANNITY: What's your reaction to -- well, you're got the New Black Panther party, Louis Farrakhan has spoken out, and the Reverend Al Sharpton is there on the ground. Helpful? Does it hurt? Is there a rush to judgment on his part or the part of some?

PRUITT: Well, no, I don't necessarily think it's a rush to judgment on his part or anybody else's part, at this point in time. I think we're all looking to find out what the answers are. And as far as I was concerned, he's basically called for peaceful demonstrations, and at the same time, he's asked for the Justice Department to do the right thing and come in and provide some outside eyes on the prize and let's see what's going on.

HANNITY: Do you have a conclusion? Because there's obviously been an outcry in the community about this, and there's been violence and mayhem and looting, and you know, ""the only good cop is a dead cop"" and ""kill the police."" What is your reaction to all of those calls for violence and the reaction of some?

PRUITT: Well, you know, I guess it's easy for some people to reach conclusions when they look at things from afar. Based on what we've been able to ascertain on the ground here, on that Sunday right after the vigil, what really started all of this was the police shot a flare up in the air.  The crowd did not move. They then turned around and shot a flare into the ground, and it skipped towards the crowd, and the crowd responded. I'm not saying that they were supposed to...

HANNITY: Does that justify the looting, though? I mean, we've seen looting...

PRUITT: No, no. I...

HANNITY: ... Molotov cocktails thrown at police, rocks thrown at police.

PRUITT: Again, I said I don't think that justifies anything. But if you want to know what precipitated the action, all I'm doing is giving you the facts on what occurred. I don't think violence, I don't think looting, I don't think anybody dying justifies anything, whether it was intentional or unintentional. But the fact is that if we're going to look at something, we need to ascertain what exactly happened and then base conclusions on that. And that's all I was doing was giving you the facts.

HANNITY: Look, I wasn't there. You weren't there. We only...

PRUITT: I -- to some degree...

HANNITY: No, you weren't there -- you weren't there at the shooting, I mean.

PRUITT: I wasn't there when they shot the flare, but we've identified witnesses who told us...

HANNITY: I'm talking the shooting of Michael Brown. You weren't at the shooting of Michael Brown. I wasn't there. Reverend Sharpton wasn't there.

PRUITT: No. No.

HANNITY: And we've seen this reaction. You know, I understand that people may rush to conclusions. What do you make of what the eyewitnesses have said? For example, this one eyewitness that I referred to in the last segment, Tiffany Mitchell, saying that there was a struggle with the officer and Michael Brown, Michael Brown reaching into the police car, and that that was where the first shot was fired?

What do you make of what I would call part one of this struggle?  Because, you know, that in and of itself raises a lot of questions, doesn't it?

PRUITT: It raises some questions, but on the other hand, we've identified four witnesses so far who said something that's just the opposite. So the question is, is -- is for the...

HANNITY: Well, she seems to corroborate what the other three say, and that is that at some point, there was quite a distance between the officer and Michael Brown, and the officer fired. So there seems to be two parts of this. That is the initiation of contact, which was when the police officer was in the car, and then the second part of this is when Michael Brown was going down the street and whether or not he had his hands up and the officer still fired, right?

PRUITT: No, every witness that we've spoken with and that we've put in front of federal authorities has basically said that the officer reached his hand out of the car and grabbed Michael Brown by the neck. And that was the initiation of the contact.

PRUITT: So if anybody says something different, it's a witness I haven't spoken with.

PRUITT: Each witness...

HANNITY: Recently...

PRUITT: Each witness we had said something different.

HANNITY: The mayor of New York and the New York City police chief recently said, when you are being arrested, don't resist. This has nothing to do -- this question really has nothing to do with this specific incident. But we've seen a lot of incidents where people do resist arrest.

Do you agree that it is best for anybody, when the police come up to you and say, You're under arrest, to not resist? Do you agree with that sentiment?

PRUITT: I agree with it when the police do say you're under arrest.  In the Michael Brown situation, that did not occur.

HANNITY: Well, you don't know that. You weren't there.

PRUITT: No. I'm saying, from the witnesses we talked to -- and we have some idea of what the policeman's statements was, that did not occur.

HANNITY: OK. Bottom line is, I think, for everybody not to make a rush to judgment is probably the best thing.

PRUITT: Absolutely.

HANNITY: And I believe the facts will come out. And certainly, those witnesses will hold a lot of weight in a court of law, I think. All right...

FoxNews,fox70,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/13/protesters-lob-molotov-cocktails-and-police-use-tear-gas-smoke-bombs-to/,"Protesters lob Molotov cocktails and police use tear gas, smoke bombs to disperse crowd ",Jeff Roberson; Alan Scher Zagier,08/13/2014,11/03/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. –  Protests in the St. Louis suburb rocked by racial unrest since a white police officer shot an unarmed black teenager to death turned violent Wednesday night, with some people lobbing Molotov cocktails and other objects at police who responded with smoke bombs and tear gas to disperse the crowd.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who has been the public face of the city torn by Saturday's death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, told reporters earlier in the day that the St. Louis County investigation of the shooting could take weeks to complete. In the meantime, he said, his department welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.

""Unfortunately, an undertow (of racial unrest) has bubbled to the surface,"" said Jackson. ""Race relations is the top priority right now.""

While Jackson said he wanted to mend fences with the community, protesters were on the streets of Ferguson again Wednesday, facing heavily armed police who at time trained weapons on them from an armored truck. Two reporters said they were detained by police while working at a McDonald's in the area.

The situation became more tense after nightfall, with police ordering people to go home and then using smoke bombs and later tear gas after some people threw Molotov cocktails and other things at them. Most of the crowd then dispersed. Journalists who witnessed the events included an Associated Press photographer.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said he had no immediate information about the situation.

Earlier, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post said they were handcuffed and put into a police van after officers came in to quickly clear the fast-food restaurant where they were doing some work. The Post reported that Lowery said he was slammed against a soda machine and plastic cuffs were put on his wrists. Reilly told MSNBC that an officer slammed his head against the glass ""purposefully"" on the way out of the restaurant ""and then sarcastically apologized for it."" The reporters were subsequently released without any charges.

Martin D. Baron, The Washington Post's executive editor, issued a statement saying ""there was absolutely no justification"" for Lowery's arrest and said the organization was appalled by the officers' conduct.

The Huffington Post said in an article on its website that when it called the Ferguson Police Department to ask about Reilly, a person who identified himself as ""George"" said there was no one there who could give any information. Subsequent calls were put through to the jail voicemail and referred to email, the Huffington Post said.

Jackson did not immediately return a cellphone message Wednesday night from the AP seeking comment about the arrests.

Jackson has faced mounting demands from protesters, clergy and even hackers to reveal the identity of the officer who shot Brown. Jackson argues that revealing that detail could bring retribution to the officer.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.

Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it ""ricocheted"" back, apparently upsetting the officer. Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.

Some protesters Wednesday raised their arms above their heads as they faced the police. Others held signs asking for answers about Brown's death. The most popular chant has been, ""Hands up! Don't shoot!""

Brown's body remained on the street for hours — a span Jackson deemed ""uncomfortable"" but justified, given that ""you only get one chance at that crime scene"" to process it correctly. Jackson said authorities also were concerned about gunfire they could hear in a nearby building.

In the shooting's aftermath, the notorious hacking collective Anonymous has taken credit for burrowing into the city website and shutting it down for much of the day Monday. The group also released what it said were audio experts from St. Louis County dispatch on the day Brown was killed. Police declined to comment on the recordings.",NA,42,NA,NA

Police also used smoke bombs Wednesday night, after directing people to go home. Helicopters circled overhead and smoke hung in the air.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said he had no immediate information about the situation.

Now, a friend of Michael Brown who says they witnessed the shooting said that he was gunned down in cold blood. Take a look at what he said.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE, SHOOTING WITNESS: As he was running, the officer was trying to get out of the car. And once he got out of the car, he pursued my friend, but his weapon was drawn. He didn't see any weapon drawn at him or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn when he got out the car. He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot he turned around and put his hands in the air and he started to get down. But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired several more shots. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Joining me now to give his insight into what happened on that fateful Saturday afternoon, Ferguson City Police Chief Thomas Jackson.  Mr. Jackson, welcome to the program. Thank you for being with us. 

THOMAS JACKSON, FERGUSON, MISSOURI, POLICE CHIEF: Thank you for having me, Sean. 

HANNITY: I read your public comments. They differ dramatically from what we just heard, and that is you said in fact the officer was injured, had a facial wound of some kind, and that in fact a struggle ensued over the officer's weapon and a shot was actually fired inside the car. Why is there such a dramatically different story being told here? 

JACKSON: Well, Sean, unfortunately we're going to have to wait until all the witnesses have been interviewed and all the forensic evidence has been examined before we're going to have a real, true picture of what happened that day. The people who were there all have different perspectives of what happened. And I know the St. Louis County Police Department's doing a very thorough investigation. They're going to interview everybody. They're going to look at the ballistics. They're going to look at the gunshot wounds. And they're going to come to a conclusion and present their findings to the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney. And at that point we will have a final decision. 

HANNITY: Well, either a shot was fired inside the police officer's car or it was not. Do we know for a fact -- 

JACKSON: It was, yes. 

HANNITY: That is a fact then. So there was a struggle for the gun. 

JACKSON: That is a fact. 

HANNITY: Are there witnesses that will say that there was a struggle for the gun? 

JACKSON: I can't talk to what the witnesses are going to say. And the reason for that is as soon as this happened I called the county police chief and asked him to take over the scene and the investigation so I could be certain that there was no appearance of impropriety, and I would know that a very thorough and complete investigation would be done and we could get to the truth of what happened. 

HANNITY: Can you shed any light on why so many shots were fired? 

JACKSON: No, I can't. I don't actually know how many were fired at this time. 

HANNITY: Do you suspect, as has been reported, 10 shots or more? 

JACKSON: It's possible that that many shots were fired, I don't know. 

HANNITY: I assume you found shell casings, you know a certain amount.  Do you have a range in which you know? 

JACKSON: No, I can't talk to the evidence at all. That's the St. Louis County Police Department's investigation. 

HANNITY: I understand that the police officer, there's been a lot of death threats against him, a lot of volatility. You've got the New Black Panther Party, Louis Farrakhan has spoken out, the Reverend Al Sharpton is there. You've had the chanting, have a sign up there, ""The only good cop is a dead cop."" There's been rioting and looting, et cetera, going on.  That has prevented you from releasing the name of the officer. Some have questioned whether the wisdom of that, the public's right to know versus the safety of the officer. You're balancing that? 

JACKSON: I am. And that's exactly what we did. You know, we had originally believed we had an obligation to release that information to the public and to the press. But what happened is another officer's name was released as being the officer involved in the shooting. He was not. But his picture was put up on the Internet, his Facebook page was hacked, and death threats started coming in. 

So that's when we waived the benefit of releasing the information right now versus the safety to the officer, his family, and his neighbors, and the rest of the police department. So we decided to delay the release of the name. 

HANNITY: Let me ask you this one simple question. Based on your preliminary investigation and you speaking with other officers that were on the scene as I understand it, correct? 

JACKSON: Yes. 

HANNITY: Then are you convinced that the officer involved in the shooting was within department guidelines in protecting himself? 

JACKSON: I can't answer that question until I have the final report from the county. I really don't want to say anything that I might know or that I think. When I say something, I want to say what I know. 

HANNITY: But you are certain that an altercation occurred and a shot was fired within the car, meaning Mr. Brown was in the car at some point? 

JACKSON: He was, he was -- yes. 

HANNITY: In other words, he wasn't handcuffed in the car. He went in the car of his own volition. 

JACKSON: Yes. 

HANNITY: And do you believe there was a struggle for that gun? 

JACKSON: That's what the county police chief said in his opening statement. He's the one that took the -- his officers are the ones that took the statement from both the officer and the witnesses. 

HANNITY: What about the unrest that has taken place now in your city?  Do you believe a lot of the looting and a lot of what has happened is a result of outside agitators, as some have suggested, or do you think this is just a community angry at what happened? 

JACKSON: No, it's a lot of outside agitators that are causing the violence. We've had some -- several very peaceful protests. I mean, they're angry. They want -- they have questions they want answers to. And I understand that. I get that. 

But we've had -- the community has now stepped up. Once this violence happened, our community leaders, the clergy, some of the activists have stepped forward and said enough is enough, and they're taking the lead on the protest. They're going to continue to protest, but they want it to be peaceful. 

HANNITY: All right, chief, thank you so much for your time tonight, and we wish your community the best, really do, in every way. 

JACKSON: Thank you very much. ",NA,0,NA,NA

A candlelight vigil was held Sunday evening in Ferguson, Mo. for Michael Brown, whom witnesses and authorities said was shot several times by an officer who had scuffled with the teen and another person.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told The Associated Press that he was informed Monday that the FBI was going to take over the investigation into the death. Jackson said he welcomes the move.

After the vigil Sunday, some people looted a convenience store. Several other stores along a main road near the shooting scene were broken into and looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store.

People were seen carrying bags of food and toilet paper. TV footage showed streams of people walking out of a liquor store carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters were standing atop police cars or taunting officers who stood stoic, often in riot gear.

Other witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows. Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van.

More than 30 people were arrested on charges including assault, burglary and theft. Police say two officers suffered minor injuries.

""Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors,” Ferguson's mayor, James Knowles, told {KTVI-TV.}<hyperlink=http://fox2now.com/2014/08/10/report-michael-brown-protesters-damage-police-vehicles-on-west-florissant/>  “There's nothing productive from this.""

As the investigation of Brown's death progresses, ""we understand people want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out,"" Knowles added. ""We're going to obviously try to urge calm.""

Knowles said police struggled to catch any looters because the crimes were so widespread.

Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced that the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used Brown's death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.

""Most came here for a peaceful protest but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. ... I can understand the anger and unrest but I can't understand the violence and looting,"" Trout, 53, said.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries but confirmed widespread property damage. ""Right now I'm just worried about people, not property,"" he said.

Pat Washington, a spokeswoman for Dooley, said later that there was one instance she knew of in which tear gas was used.

Earlier in the day, a few hundred protesters had gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police building, some chanting ""Don't shoot me"" while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn't use force; the crowd eventually left.

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after an officer encountered two people -- one of whom was Brown -- on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known, but ""it was more than just a couple."" He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged. Authorities aren't sure if that person was unarmed, Jackson said.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told {KSDK-TV}<hyperlink=http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/10/rioting-breaks-out-in-ferguson/13880305/> there's no apparent video footage of the shooting from a nearby apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn't yet put in use.

Jackson said blood samples have been taken from Brown and the officer who shot him, with those toxicology tests generally expected to take weeks to complete.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said he had graduated from high school and was about to enter a local college. She said she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue her son with a club or Taser, and she said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,"" she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

""We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,"" said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.

The Rev. Al Sharpton called the shooting ""very disturbing"" and said he planned to go to Ferguson to meet with the family.

St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, and Dooley said he will request an FBI investigation. The U.S. Justice Department said Attorney General Eric Holder had instructed staff to monitor developments.

The race of the officer involved in the shooting has not been disclosed. He has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years, Belmar said, and has been placed on paid administrative leave.",NA,7991,NA,NA

But, the focus really here right now is on tonight.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

You said 300 officers on the street last night. They will be available again tonight if anything happens, if they are --

O'REILLY: All right, but I understand that the officers -- many of the officers stood by. Mr. Sells, I understand that many officers stood by last night and did not intervene as the looting went on. Is that true.

SELLS: That is what the reports are, that the people who were on the ground say that, in many cases, the officers pretty much set up parameters and tried --

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

-- to stay away and tried not to -- basically, tried not to get violent. The mayor was speaking today here about the fact that the large presence allowed them to get through last night without any civilians getting hurt.

Now, whether the inaction, so to speak, as it's been described by some, is the reason for that or is cause for criticism, well, that --

O'REILLY: All right, that's a valid point.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

We'll wait and see what the facts show. Now, Mr. Milhaven, do you believe that these looters and the people taking advantage of this terrible situation where the young boy was killed -- and, again, we will wait and see what happened.

We'll wait for the facts to emerge. We believe they will. We have a black attorney general who's a liberal in this country, all right.

And he's certainly not going to let this go by the wayside. The FBI will be called in. They will investigate.

So, we expect -- we, in the media, that all the facts will emerge. However, the people who did the damage last night, who exploited this terrible thing, are they Ferguson people or are they outsiders.

MCGRAW MILHAVEN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: It's a great question, Bill. I would say that the anecdotal evidence is that most of the looters are from outside of the region.

Many of the callers who called in to my radio show this morning --

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

-- talked about how Ferguson is a close-knit community, diverse and yet very close-knit. So, many of those people who were out looting came in to the area to try advantage of the situation.

O'REILLY: All right, now, Ferguson, primarily a black town, --

(END VIDEO CLIP)

-- I understand, 60 to 65 percent black. Is that true.

MILHAVEN: It's two-thirds African-American, one-third white. It's about 20,000 people. It's a working class neighborhood. They just elected a white Republican mayor not too long ago.

O'REILLY: Interesting. Some of the businesses, of course, were black-owned that got burned and got destroyed and looted, correct.

MILHAVEN: One of the stories, I think, that is important to take away from this is that, yes, there were small black-owned businesses just getting out, just starting -- you know, that difficult five, six, seven, eight-month period, that is now totally destroyed.

There's also stories developing here where there was a car dealer -- a transmission place, Zisser (ph), where the community went to the store and took keys of the cars that were there and took a lot of the tires off the wall, took them home and protected them from the looters.

And then, the following morning -- this morning, came back and brought the keys and the tires back to the place for safekeeping.

O'REILLY: Oh, good. I thought you were going to say the exact opposite. And I'm very glad to hear that some in the community were as appalled as, I think, most Americans are, that you don't take the shooting death of a young man and break the law.

You don't do that. Again, we have a system in place -- go ahead.

MILHAVEN: Yes, Bill, I also want to mention that because that's the good side. The bad side is, tonight, they were talking about the protesters being there.

And this is very disturbing, especially for here in St. Louis, which we -- we pride ourselves on solving these problems as a region. Many --

O'REILLY: Well, let's hope the police will protect the property tonight and the whole thing will diffuse over the next few days.

And we hope that happens. We hope outside agitators do not go in there. If they do, I will spotlight that on 'The Factor'.

Gentlemen, thanks very much. We appreciate it.",NA,0,NA,NA

Some in the crowd taunted police with chants of ""Don't shoot me"" as they held up their hands while walking into the Ferguson Police Department building. Officers stood at the top of a staircase and stopped the crowd without using force.

A news conference was held simultaneously in a different building. There, St. Louis County Police Jon Belmar said the incident began when the officer encountered two men on the street near an apartment complex on Saturday afternoon in a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and the struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired inside the police car.

The struggle spilled out into the street where the teenager was shot. Police have not disclosed his name, but family members say it was 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Shell casings found at the scene matched the officers' gun. Belmar said the teen was shot multiple times, but it wasn't yet known how many.

""It was more than just a couple,"" he said.

Belmar said the officer has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years and that he wasn't aware of other issues involving the man. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave.

The protesters chanted ""We want answers"" and ""no justice, no peace,"" Sunday morning and some carried signs saying ""stop police terrorism"" and ""disarm the police.""

John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, said Saturday the FBI should get involved ""to protect the integrity of the investigation.""

He alluded to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, as well as the New York man who died from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes.

""With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,"" Gaskin said.

State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that she would ask the U.S. Justice Department on Monday for a formal investigation.

Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, said she saw him running in her neighborhood Saturday afternoon. Just minutes later, she heard a commotion and went outside to check on it. She found Brown's body less than two blocks away.

""When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.""

Harris said her grandson had recently graduated high school and was looking forward to the future.

""My grandson never even got into a fight,"" she said. ""He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.""

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, had harsh words Saturday for authorities: ""You're not God, you don't get to decide when you get to take somebody from here,"" she told KSDK.",NA,834,NA,NA

Desiree Harris told the Associated Press that she was expecting a visit from her grandson, Michael Brown, on Saturday afternoon. She discovered his body after hearing a commotion outside her apartment building. 

""He was running this way,"" she said. ""When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.""

The AP reported that residents of the predominantly black town of Ferguson spilled out of their apartments in a confrontation that lasted several hours. They shouted obscenities and some threats, such as ""kill the police,"" but there were no reports of additional injuries.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a group of around 100 people gathered outside the Ferguson Police Department later Saturday evening and chanted ""No Justice! No Peace!""

An eyewitness told the Post-Dispatch that she saw a police officer attempting to put Brown in the back of a squad car shortly before the shooting. As Brown attempted to flee, the witness said he was shot several times in the head and chest. 

A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting at the request of the local department, confirmed a Ferguson police officer shot the man. The spokesman didn't give the reason for the shooting.

John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, said the FBI should get involved ""to protect the integrity of the investigation."" He alluded to the 2012 racially-charged shooting of a 17-year-old high school student by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, as well as the death of a New York man from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes on the street.

""With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,"" Gaskin said.

Gaskin said officials in the organization spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who told them teenager had been shot twice.

By early Saturday night, dozens of police cars remained parked near the shooting scene as mourners left votive candles, rose petals, a large stuffed animal and other remembrances at a makeshift memorial in the middle of the street. At the height of the post-shooting tensions, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents, about two-thirds of whom are black.

Harris said her grandson had recently graduated high school and was looking forward to the future, including possibly attending college.

""My grandson never even got into a fight,"" she said. ""He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.""

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told the Post-Dispatch that the officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave.

""We are hoping for calm and for people to give us a chance to conduct a thorough investigation,"" Jackson said.

Gaskin said the angry crowd was reacting to a ""trauma.""

""Anytime you have this type of event that's taken place, emotions are going to run high,"" he said. ""But for 600 people to gather around an area to see where a man is lying in the street, that means something happened that should have not happened.""",NA,1143,NA,NA

It's not a spin. It's not a whim. It is a clinical diagnosis of a pathological movement that is sweeping our area but will soon come to a theater near you. It has to be stopped now. The ones who are standing right now in front of this tsunami IS Israel. Support Israel, support yourself. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Joining me now to recap that interview is the professor of philosophy and Christian practice at Union Theological Seminary, Dr. Cornel West is with us again. It's good to see you, my friend. How are you? 

DR. CORNELL WEST, UNION THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY: Nice to be in conversation with you.

HANNITY: He said it's pathological. Here's what Israel is surrounded by. Hamas, their charter says obliterate Israel, and kill the Jews, that's what their charter says. Hezbollah, then you have Boko Haram.  And then you have ISIS, ISIL. You've got Al Qaeda and Islamic Jihad. You have the Muslim Brotherhood. Surrounded by people that buy into the idea that there ought to be a worldwide caliphate, kill the Jews, destroy Israel, wipe it off the map, and I didn't even mention Iran. What are they to do but defend themselves?

WEST: The ""they,"" you're talking about who?

HANNITY: Israel.

WEST: Your mean the Israeli brothers and sisters. One is you have to make sure that you have an Israeli society that doesn't put a stress on militarism and racism. You can't have a right wing government that allows for the killing of 427 precious Palestinian babies --

HANNITY: What do you -- professor, you are a smart guy. What do you do when 3,500 rockets and 60 tunnels are dug, and your children are kidnapped and killed, and your cities are bombed every day? What do you do? 

WEST: You and I agree, a precious Palestinian baby has the same value as a precious Jewish baby. As Christians, we believe that, right?

HANNITY: We're all God's children.

WEST: I'm going to tell you what they ought to do. One is you've got to end an occupation of 46 years and a blockade. 

HANNITY: They already gave them back Gaza. 

WEST: They didn't give Gaza back. They still control the land, sea, food supplies, medical supplies, all the food going in. It was a political -- 

HANNITY: You're blaming Israel. 

WEST: It's not blaming Israel, it's a matter of acknowledging that terrorism -- 

HANNITY: The Palestinians -- 

WEST: The terrorizing of Israeli brothers and sisters is wrong. 

HANNITY: Palestinians have voted in Hamas -- 

WEST: The killing of Palestinian innocent people is wrong across the board.

HANNITY: Hang on, this is important. The Palestinians voted in Hamas. Hamas is -- 

(CROSSTALK)

HANNITY: They elected a group that says obliterate Israel. They fire 3,500 rockets. The Israelis want to live in peace. So Palestinians work in Israel. Palestinians vote, Arabs vote in Israel. 

WEST: The thing is when you at 46 years of vicious occupation --

HANNITY: It's not occupation. 

WEST: Yes, it is. 

HANNITY: The U.N. -- they've been there for 3,000 years, professor.  You know history better than that. 

WEST: The history. 

HANNITY: King David was there, Solomon built his temple there. 

WEST: Let's look at this land possessions, the history says that Jews jumped out of the burning buildings of Europe in a Jew hating Europe led by a gangster named Hitler, right? They landed on the backs of some Arabs in 1940s. 

HANNITY: That was the U.N. partition plan in '47. They declared their independence in '48. What about King David and Solomon and the temple that was built on that very land? That was their land. 

WEST: Thousands of years, there's so much transformation, people don't have control of people of land for 2,000 years. But you deny an occupation is at work? 

HANNITY: I absolutely deny it. 

WEST: Oh, no, we have deep disagreements. 

HANNITY: Let's see if we can find some agreement.

WEST: I come from people who have been terrorized and traumatized in the United States, American terrorism. Michael Brown and his precious mother led -- 

HANNITY: A kid was killed. Do you know what happened? 

WEST: -- another instance of American terrorism coming at innocent, young, precious black brother.

HANNITY: Where did you rush to judgment? Because the police say he was reach -- I wasn't there, and you weren't there. You can't call it terrorism if you're not there. 

WEST: Because when you kill an unarmed, innocent brother, how in fact could it be anything else? 

HANNITY: Hang on. 

WEST: What could he have done to warrant being shot like that? 

HANNITY: If you're reaching for the gun of the police officer, you're no longer unarmed. 

WEST: His hands are up. He's shot 10 times. 

HANNITY: Not according -- I'm not saying I know what happened. At the end of the day -- as a result of this the people in that community are saying, shoot the police. The people in that community are rioting. The people in that community are -- 

WEST: They're upset.

HANNITY: Is that anyway to react? 

WEST: It's a raid. You want to have some kind of moral venue. We want the love supreme of John Coltrane and Jesus to operate. But you understand that outrage.

HANNITY: Do you understand what that screen says. The only good cop is a dead cop. 

WEST: That's wrong too. When there's arbitrary police power used against -- not just Clinton Allen in Dallas -- 

HANNITY: Do you believe Americans -- 

WEST: Chamberlain right here in White Plains, police -- 

HANNITY: Let me ask you something, do you believe people are innocent in America until proven guilty? 

WEST: They should be. 

HANNITY: That police officer is assumed innocent? 

WEST: He should have a fair trial. 

HANNITY: And you just called him a terrorist and convicted him without the benefit of a trial. 

WEST: Because the bullet came from someone, and it -- 

HANNITY: You don't know the circumstances. Do you? You weren't there. 

WEST: You got a good point. It's hard for me to conceive -- 

HANNITY: He's assumed innocent. 

WEST: He's assumed innocent. But a precious child has been killed. 

HANNITY: I don't want any kids dead. You want to know the first thing we can do to save kids from being killed? We can throw them in schools that are not the dumbed down, stupid schools we send them to. 

WEST: Give them a job with a living wage. We can give them a sense of self-respect. Let me ask you this -- do you agree that there's such a thing of American terrorism and Israeli terrorism? Is there such a thing for you? 

HANNITY: I don't think, is my answer -- there's never been -- the United States has not been perfect -- 

WEST: America has a history of terrorizing indigenous people.

HANNITY: I believe America, the greatness of America, and the greatest sin was slavery -- 

WEST: No, indigenous people. 

HANNITY: Slavery is ""evil,"" that's the word I would use. 

WEST: But people -- 

HANNITY: Our founders and our framers in their wisdom created a system where we right wrongs and create injustices. And they have been proven correct with the 64 Civil Rights Act, the 65 Voting Right Act. 

WEST: Is there such a thing as Israel terrorism? 

HANNITY: No, I don't think so. I believe Israel is the victim. 

WEST: You don't think Israel has committed a war crime when it kills -- 

HANNITY: Israel is protecting its city from constant attacks. The 48, 67, 73, 3,500 rockets fired into its city, they have a right to defend itself. If I fire a rocket at your house, what do you do? 

WEST: You don't have a right to commit a war crime.

HANNITY: If I attack your house, what are going to you do? If I break into your house what are you going to do? 

WEST: I'm going to defend myself.

HANNITY: Damn right.

WEST: But I'm not going to kill your momma. I'm going to focus on you. Collective punishment is a war crime, my brother. I don't have a right to kill your child if you come into my house. 

HANNITY: They're sending leaflets, they're sending phone calls, they're sending text messages, we're about to bomb you get out of the way.  What else can they do? 

WEST: Three minute notice. 

HANNITY: Eight minutes. 

WEST: If you deny such a thing as Israeli terrorism -- every nation - - 

HANNITY: Israel is surrounded by terrorists, my friend. 

WEST: I agree with that too. We've got to condemn terrorism in all its forms. 

HANNITY: I need you for a full hour. 

WEST: I'll be back, though. 

HANNITY: Israel is a victim of radical Islamic terrorism, is the world's modern Nazism. 

WEST: There is a different form of Nazism that certainly was -- 

HANNITY: Radical Islamism is the world's modern -- they want a modern day holocaust. 

WEST: If you have militarism and fascism together you get fascist consequences.

The looting and violence that erupted in Ferguson, Missouri early this morning, with one person shot and 7 arrested in confrontations with police, came too late for the Sunday morning papers, but they added to the sense of chaos that kicked into a higher gear on Friday when the troubling tale of just why a Missouri officer shot and killed Michael Brown took a bizarre turn. Ferguson police released a videotape showing the teenager, Michael Brown, intimidating a convenience store check and making off with some cigars. Now, this ran in an endless loop on cable news, but it wasn't until a press conference hours later that reporters got the police chief to admit this had nothing to do with the fatal shooting.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're telling us that when the officer stopped Michael Brown the first time, he was not aware that Brown was a suspect in a robbery?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, he didn't. He was walking --

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So that had nothing to do with the stop?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It had nothing to do with the stop.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why at this point -- at this point, why didn't he stop Michael Brown?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KURTZ: Joining us now to examine the coverage, Lauren Ashburn, Fox News contributor who hosts ""Social Buzz"" on the Fox website. Jim Geraghty, contributing editor at National Review, and Joe Trippi, Fox News contributor and a Democratic strategist.

How has this video of the shoplifting, which I've now seen about 10,000 times, how has it changed the storyline of this tragedy?

LAUREN ASHBURN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It has utterly transformed the way we take a look at this, the way analysts do, the way reporters do and the way the public sees it. You know the old cliche, a picture is worth a thousand words. It doesn't matter what the police are saying that it didn't have anything to do with it. What they're saying is -- the images are saying, yes it did.

KURTZ: Does it matter what the reporters and the anchors are saying? And should cable news be playing this over and over and over again, like wallpaper, despite the fact that there is no dispute that this robbery was not connected to the shooting?

ASHBURN: Absolutely not. This is something of the media going overboard, and the police shouldn't have released it, either. Even the FBI said, don't do this, it will cause trouble.

KURTZ: Jim, how is it that it took skeptical reporters at that press conference you just saw, and this was hours after this thing was playing on cable news, to get the police chief to acknowledge that this is a shoplifting case and that the officer who shot Michael Brown didn't even know that the guy was a suspect?

JIM GERAGHTY, NATIONAL REVIEW ONLINE: Yes. From the comments during that seemingly chaotic press conference, you could get the feeling that the police chief was not at the top of his game.

KURTZ: You are being diplomatic.

GERAGHTY: A bit of a panic--

(CROSSTALK)

GERAGHTY: And yet, perhaps there's a little bit of crazy like a fox sort of thing, because for several hours, putting this out there, this goes from the story of a bad cop shooting this poor kid to all of a sudden, wait a minute, maybe he's not such a poor kid. Presuming it's him in the video and some people are expressing skepticism--

KURTZ: His family's team is not denying it at this point.

GERAGHTY: So he does this, and all of a sudden he's not this innocent kid more. He's not this gentle giant. Now he's a bit of a thug. Which all of a sudden puts things in a new light, except then a couple of weeks later, the cop didn't know about -- you know, a couple of hours later. But by that point, if you're watching mid-day, it hasn't sunk in yet.

KURTZ: But that suggests to me that the media -- and I'm not saying this isn't news and I'm not saying it shouldn't be aired. Of course we need to know more about this 18-year-old who is now dead. But (inaudible) the media were used by the Ferguson police.

JOE TRIPPI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, this is clearly a case of -- this whole episode shows how the media is both manipulated and has to be there. They're manipulated when the video is released. And they use it. It's great video, as Lauren points out, it's going to get repeated over and over again. The police knew that, the chief knew that. Did it anyway on purpose despite the FBI Justice Department saying don't do this. And then, but look, it's a requirement. It's a requirement of the media being there, putting the police chief in that position a few hours later, and constantly grilling him until he fessed up and said it had nothing to do with the reason they were stopped.

ASHBURN: And that's good that there were boots on the ground in order to do that and to get to the truth.

KURTZ: Chief Todd Jackson claimed that he had to release this video because there were some FOI requests from several media organizations. The family called it character assassination. Talk about how the images of this story, because the pictures have been so powerful, have changed over the last week in the aftermath of the killing?

ASHBURN: Well, in the very beginning, you see the victim lying on the ground. He was there for several hours. You hear that the police shot him seven times, that he had his hand up in the air. You had social media going crazy saying I just watched the police shoot this guy as he was running away.

(CROSSTALK)

ASHBURN: Then the robbery video surfaced. And then just Friday and early this morning, 4:00 in the morning, there were people who were anti-curfew protesters coming out, and it starts to change the way the coverage is shaped. Because now you're thinking, gosh, these police have to deal with these very violent crowds.

GERAGHTY: Think about how -- cable we have always thought of as this voracious beast, that it's hungry for new pictures all the time. Think about how often during this we've watched a blank podium, empty, waiting for a press conference to start, and everybody is at the edge of their seats saying what's going the happen? Any new video that comes out of this, whether it's protesters, whether it's tear gas canisters flying around, in some ways this is a fantastic story for cable news, because each day something new happens, the images are violent, they're vivid. On the other hand, you have to wonder for the media cameras, are these things getting worse because the cameras are there? Is there an element of performance?

TRIPPI: So -- and also the cameras are looking for new characters. So the hero, kind of the heroic Ron Johnson, the captain, comes on the scene.

(CROSSTALK)

KURTZ: He's the voice of reason. He marches with the protesters.

TRIPPI: One guy is going to solve all the problems. Everybody is going to go home. Never -- that was never going to happen, and, actually, you know, just an injustice to him.

KURTZ: There's also an old character, Al Sharpton, who always shows up at these things. I have to say Sharpton has condemned the violence. And I don't think his rhetoric has been inflammatory, but again, to show up at the press conference with the Brown family and then interviewed them on MSNBC and then go back today -- he once again is wearing two hats in a way that I don't think most news organizations will allow. But MSNBC says it does not have any problem with it.

We're going to do more on the Ferguson coverage throughout this hour. But I want to turn now to the political story that got a lot of heat and generated a lot of buzz this week. Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic conducted a lengthy and substantive interview with Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, but a few passages exploded in the headlines because they seem to diss Barack Obama, such as taking aim at one of the president's slogans, ""great nations need organizing principles,"" she said, ""and 'don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle."" What kind of temerity was this? Every pundit on the planet seemed to weigh in.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hillary Clinton wants to divorce herself from Barack Obama, whose popularity on the handling of foreign affairs is declining.

LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: Certainly Fox News is taking it to be an attack on the president. Which she had to anticipate.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KURTZ: And Hillary's attempts at patching things up brought a new round of media mockery.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: She still seems so awkward. So stiff. And so canned. Let's be honest about it, so insincere.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KURTZ: How great is the media appetite for a big, bad Hillary versus Obama spat?

ASHBURN: It's voracious. People want to talk about political dust-ups. Yes, there was a bit of conversation about the foreign policy angle and whether she was right, he was right, who made the decisions and what did she say. Yes, that was there, but then we get headlines like these from the Daily Mail, ""Hillary and Obama pals, a sign the pair danced the night away."" That was when they were in Martha's Vineyard. And then one from this morning I love, ""Obama and Hillary's hug-a-thon that turned into a slug-a-thon.""

KURTZ: But let's deal with the substance a bit. The criticism that Hillary Clinton made was fairly restrained. For example, she said the failure to create a fighting force to help the Syrian rebels -- she didn't name Obama. Clearly the implication was there. But this was just catnip for the media.

GERAGHTY: Here is the thing. The hug-it-out aspect is the frigging dumbest part of a really important story. I don't care if they get along. Or someone -- it's very high school-ish. Someone is not speaking to someone else. The real question is, what do we do in Syria?

ASHBURN: But politics is high school, right?

GERAGHTY: No, it's not. This is serious.

KURTZ: Let me stop right there. I think you should give him a hug.

(LAUGHTER)

KURTZ: In other words, this went off the rails and obscured what you think is a serious debate --

GERAGHTY: Absolutely.

(CROSSTALK)

KURTZ: Much of this criticism was in her book.

TRIPPI: It's not only is it in her book, it's like the scene from ""Casablanca."" Shocked, shocked that gambling is happening in a casino. And on two fronts. First of all, he beat her. She isn't president of the United States today because of this guy, and she was always to the right of him on all of these issues from the beginning. She was always much more of a hawk than Barack Obama. She was for the war, he was against it. It cost her the nomination. None of this should be a surprise to anybody. And guess what else isn't a surprise? She's running for president of the United States in 2016 and wants to separate herself from him.

KURTZ: I want to let you finish your point, but that's what strikes me is it is hardly shocking that somebody who is running would distance herself from the president of her own party, because she has to, especially at a time when huge foreign policy problems around the globe from Gaza to Iraq to Syria, because she needs to separate herself. And you're shocked by this?

GERAGHTY: It's a criticism that makes both of them look significantly worse.

(CROSSTALK)

KURTZ: Makes them both look?

GERAGHTY: Makes both of them look significantly worse. And it's more than just a routine, oh, they didn't agree about arming Syria. She said an overarching policy vision, that there was no there there, it was just don't do stupid you know what. Here is the thing. If only she had been in some position to influence foreign policy, over the last four years. If only she could have done something, she had some job --

TRIPPI: This is going to help her and hurt the president.

KURTZ: Let me have you respond to Jim. Do you think that the media have fallen down on pointing out that Hillary Clinton was running the State Department for four years during -- while some of these problems were growing and festering?

TRIPPI: I think the media has to do that, will do it, I'm sure.

KURTZ: Has the media done it so far?

TRIPPI: No. I think they will if and when she runs. But I think the fact of the matter is, the media and the pundits were putting everybody in the position of if only Barack Obama had listened to Hillary Clinton. How does that hurt her in 2016?

ASHBURN: It hurts her with progressives.

TRIPPI: That could be a problem--

ASHBURN: But who else do they have? Anyway, that's politics.

KURTZ: Let me get a break in here. We're going to talk more about Hillary and the hug on the other side of this break. As I said, more on Ferguson a little bit later in the program.

Send me a tweet about our show during this hour -- @howardkurtz. As you know, we read the best messages at the end of each hour.

Also ahead, a look at the excesses and mistakes in covering Robin Williams's tragic suicide.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KURTZ: We're back talking about the Hillary hug hype. And Jim Geraghty, before the break, you said that was a rather crazy phrase, in your view, used by a Hillary spokesman. I assume she approved it. Why exactly is it -- is it because it is something a male candidate would say?

GERAGHTY: No. I think the idea that there's some sort of special personal relationship between the president and the secretary of state, and it matters whether they get along -- when it doesn't. I'm sure Colin Powell and George W. Bush didn't always get along.

KURTZ: Wait a minute, the camera has to go to this look on Lauren's face, who -- apparently (inaudible).

ASHBURN: Are you saying that men can't talk about hugging? John Boehner cries, for goodness sake. I mean, I'm so tired or --

KURTZ: I'm not saying it. I'm asking the question --

ASHBURN: You are asking the question and implying it. I am just so tired. Let's just stop making Hillary, all of this about her being a woman.

GERAGHTY: But if it were John Kerry, would we be talking about hug --

(CROSSTALK)

ASHBURN: It's 2006 phrase. That's more egregious than anything.

KURTZ: Everybody is piling on what Hillary was calculating, she didn't handle it right, she handled it fine. Is there any possibility -- and I know this sounds insane -- that in answering those questions from the Atlantic on foreign policy, that she was just saying what she thinks? Or do candidates not do that? You ran a campaign.

TRIPPI: I think she was saying what she thinks, but it was calculated. She knew exactly what she was doing, both things are probably true.

KURTZ: Right. So then you would say that then she looked bad because she walked it back, she called the president.

(CROSSTALK)

GERAGHTY: She will call them as she sees them, and then she will call back and apologize. But the second thing is, if she's saying what she really thinks now, it means for the past four years, she's not been saying what she thinks. Which is probably necessary for every cabinet official. However, this is a big deal that basically she thinks the entire time we're pursuing the wrong strategy in Syria, but she's going to salute and say okay, Mr. President, do it. Now we find a situation with 170,000 people dead later --

KURTZ: In fairness, it's been reported that she was more hawkish, within the administration councils on Syria, she did write about this in her book. What I want to know is where is the video of the alleged hug? Why is it being hidden from the press? But a serious, semi serious question for you, after the Atlantic interview was published, there was a lot of sniping, particularly in the newspapers, between unnamed Hillary Clinton advisers and unnamed White House allies and officials, except for David Axelrod, who took a swipe at Hillary on Twitter. Should the media be reporting this background (inaudible)?

ASHBURN: Every media organization will say, here is our anonymous sources policy. We will not use anonymous sources to disparage anyone. If you ask any media executive, that's what they stand by. In practice, it's completely different. That is not what happens. And they're used, because it's political theater.

TRIPPI: The media loves to cover food fights between two people in the same party, particularly when one of them is the president of the United States and the other one is running for president.

KURTZ: And if that involves granting people anonymity, so they can take pot shots, so be it?

TRIPPI: They're going to do it. I mean, in a political -- in that situation, I mean, particularly in a presidential campaign, it just gets rampant with --

(CROSSTALK)

KURTZ: I guess we are already in a presidential campaign.

TRIPPI: Yes.

KURTZ: Let me just close by saying we have such a heavy news night this week that we not even -- only have time to talk about the indictment of Rick Perry. What is striking about that, the Texas governor not exactly hiding, at a news conference yesterday, he was on ""Fox News Sunday"" this morning. I think even many liberal leading commentators and analysts are saying this seems like a pretty flimsy indictment in which the governor was (inaudible) was just practicing politics by using his veto power to force out an investigator. Yes, (inaudible) of his administration, but was locked up on a pretty bad drunk driving charge.

TRIPPI: When we start going after governors because we disagree with a veto, so we think he's going to get indicted, I mean, he has the legislative -- the authority in the Constitution to veto this stuff. So I just think -- I look at this grand jury indictment and it doesn't make any sense to me, other than it's political -- try to embarrass him politically as he gets ready to run for president.

ASHBURN: And Joe is a Democrat.

GERAGHTY: Friends don't let friends drink and drive and remain in prosecutor's offices.

ASHBURN: That's a good line.

KURTZ: All right, we're going to close. I still think Jim needs a hug, Jim Geraghty and Joe Trippi, thanks very much for joining us. Ahead, is Chuck Todd the man to fix NBC's debacle over ""Meet the Press?""

Up next, two reporters arrested in Ferguson. How much did that change the tone of the coverage?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KURTZ: The situation in Ferguson, Missouri, spun so out of control this week that President Obama felt compelled to speak up on behalf of journalists trying to do their jobs. As protesters filled the streets after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, an Al Jazeera crew said officers fired tear gas at them. We're looking at the pictures right now as they were setting up for a live shot and carried off their camera equipment. And two reporters, one for the Washington Post and one for the Huffington Post were arrested at a McDonald's. The beginning of the confrontation captured on video by the Washington Post's Wes Lowery.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can move your car if your car is out here. Let's go.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is. That's what I was asking.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Here is the door over here. Let's go.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've got an armed officer with what can only be described as an assault weapon gesturing his weapon at me. And so I couldn't help but have some of my attention focused on this large gun in front of me. That's when they said, let's take him. They threw me up against a soda machine, they put me in handcuffs or in plastic restraints, all the while yelling at me stop resisting, stop resisting, as I was yelling to them, I'm not resisting.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KURTZ: Joining us now from New York, Joe Concha, a columnist for Mediaite, and Keli Goff, special correspondent for TheRoot.com and a columnist for the Daily Beast.

Joe, let's start with the arrest of the two reporters in that McDonald's. Those charges were totally trumped up, right?

JOE CONCHA, MEDIAITE.COM: Howie, if you watch that tape in full, on 23 separate occasions, that officer asked Wes Lowery and the Huffington Post reporter, Ryan Reilly, to move. How do Wes and Ryan know what's going on outside in the street where they can resist that order? And before that video was shot, also, Howie, Wes Lowery was asked for identification, for which he refused. This was clearly an action to provoke that officer.

KURTZ: I'm going to stop you there. They didn't resist arrest. They were packing up their computer equipment, which was plugged in.

CONCHA: Really?

KURTZ: Secondly, I'm sure you don't condone slamming reporters' heads into glass doors and soda machines. Thirdly, the charges were so flimsy that the police chief immediately dropped them.

CONCHA: Correct. No, they shouldn't have arrested them, Howie, I don't advocate that. But how do you pack up equipment and batteries when you're holding up a camera and pointing it at somebody? I'm having a little trouble grabbing my laptop and all of my equipment when I do that. And here is how you know this was all about Wes Lowery expanding his television career. Right after he was released from custody, it was all about tweeting out, calling Maddow now, going on national television, CNN, MSNBC after that, Fox, as well. This was a media tour that was only rivaled by Hillary Clinton's all in the efforts to give Wes Lowery's byline a microphone and a future career, and nothing more.

KURTZ: I think that's unfair. Wes Lowery is a good, solid reporter. He was deluged with requests to appear on TV, including from me. He only did a few of those. I don't think this was as self-promotional as you do. Let's agree to disagree so I can turn to Keli. Were those arrests and the tear gassing of the Al Jazeera crew and the seizing of the equipment, did that become kind of a turning point in the tone of the coverage, Keli?

KELI GOFF, THEROOT.COM: Absolutely. And I will say with all due respect to Joe, I hate to hear the kind of criticism he would have doled out about 50 or 60 years ago to reporters who may have been a little slow to pack up their gear when they were covering another crisis, which is known as the civil rights movement.

CONCHA: A little slow.

GOFF: So this idea that reporters shouldn't be documenting the behavior of people in authority when people in authority are part of the story and their behavior has been questioned by the reporters that were there, I think to criticize them for recording is odd, Joe. They actually would have been doing their jobs to not record, and frankly, I don't think it would have been a smart safety thing to do. Not to be funny, but just again, drawing the comparison, there were a lot of reporters who were assaulted, some were almost murdered during the civil rights movements. I only wish they had Twitter and camera phones back then. So I think to criticize Ryan and Wes for recording is a little bizarre.

KURTZ: The images of the riot gear and the armed personnel carriers and the tear gas, in some ways was that reminiscent of Birmingham in 1963? Purely from the kind of perceptions that it had on the public as that footage was recorded?

GOFF: I don't know how anyone could watch the footage of what was done to those Al Jazeera reporters and not draw parallels. And I think this idea that once you see that footage, I don't see why anyone would not record their interactions with police. If you are a citizen or if you are a member of the press. And I also think that not only do you and I seem to disagree with Joe and Howie, but let's not forget the letter that was signed by 40 major news outlets decrying this atrocious behavior of the police by members of the press.

KURTZ: Let me go back to Joe. Did the sheer volume of the coverage here, hour after hour, day after day, as the national media descended on Ferguson, to do their jobs, is that exacerbated what is an undeniable tragedy no matter who is at fault, and that is the killing of an unarmed 18-year-old?

CONCHA: Absolutely, Howie. Twitter has now become the sixth network. There's ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN and Twitter, and there's only been over 7 million tweets that have mentioned Ferguson. So that certainly poured gas in the fire. Then you have activists that have 6 pm shows on another network that are going down there and fueling the flames, as well.

KURTZ: You're referring to Al Sharpton?

CONCHA: I am, exactly. And look, one second, Kel, you know, the bottom line is, it's now a cottage industry when a white cop shoots a black kid or we saw with Trayvon Martin last year, CNN, HLN quadrupled their ratings because of these sort of events, and ISIS and Gaza happening overseas. This is domestic, cheap and easy narrative, and that's why we've seen the coverage go where it has.

GOFF: You call it a cottage industry -- those of us who have African- American men in our families consider it a crisis, Joe, and I think that must be nice to not have the experience in this country where you can dismiss it --

(CROSSTALK)

CONCHA: You don't get to do that to me, Keli. You're calling me a racist on national television? Sorry.

KURTZ: She's not at all, Joe.

CONCHA: That's the inference, that I'm being somehow insensitive.

GOFF: No, it's not -- I think you're being insensitive. I didn't call you a racist. You're the one that used that word, Joe.

And what I want to say, Howie, is I think this idea that the coverage has inflamed things, I'm going to again to go back to draw the parallels from 60 years ago. We all know that there was behavior that changed 60 years ago because people realized that the images were filtering out to the rest of the country, and the South did not like how it was being portrayed. I think the same thing has happened here in Ferguson.

New York magazine ran a headline about this, about how you saw this 180, where you saw the police actually start marching with the protesters and engaging them in a positive way. I do not think that would have happened if there hadn't been all those images of them in riot gear, and they knew how that was reflecting on their town.

CONCHA: And one point, Howie. What Twitter has done in a positive manner, and Keli, I'm sorry if I overreacted. Perhaps I did.

At least now the police cannot control the narrative in terms of everything that is coming out.

(CROSSTALK)

KURTZ: That is true.

CONCHA: So there are positives for social media, as well as negatives. I just want to say that, and I apologize to Keli for overreacting as well.

KURTZ: Not at all, you two can go hug it out and then make up.

CONCHA: There will be video of that, by the way. Unlike some other people.

KURTZ: I do think that we still don't know what the police version is of exactly what happened. I saw a lot of the coverage up to now had been one- sided because we haven't had access to the other side. Keli Goff, Joe Concha, thanks very much for stopping by.

CONCHA: Thanks, Howie.

GOFF: Thanks, Howie.

KURTZ: Ahead on ""MediaBuzz,"" when we come back, how about some of the reporting on Robin Williams' suicide, was it distasteful or just wrong? And the ugliness that drove his daughter off Twitter. And later, can Chuck Todd pull ""Meet the Press"" out of its tailspin?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(NEWSBREAK)

KURTZ: Just about everyone seemed to love Robin Williams for his comic brilliance and acting intensity. So the suicide of the 63-year-old entertainer who had spoken openly about battling depression and alcoholism came as a shock. Every newspaper, every web site, every network weighed in. And the cable nets were virtually wall to wall.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Great actor and comedian Robin Williams has died. The Marin County sheriff's office confirming Williams was found dead in his house.

BRIAN WILLIAMS, NBC ANCHOR: On our broadcast tonight, Robin Williams, what we're learning about his sudden and shocking death. The investigation into his apparent suicide as tributes pour in.

ROBIN ROBERTS, ABC NEWS: Robin Williams was often at his best when he was just playing himself, funny, smart, touching, always lightning fast.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Breaking tonight, what we've now learned about the final hours of Robin Williams' life.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KURTZ: Joining us now for ""The Z Block"" to examine this emotional media outpouring is David Zurawik, television and media critic for ""The Baltimore Sun."" Let's start with some of the excesses. ABC apologized for running streaming video of Williams' house. Fox's Shep Smith apologized for briefly questioning whether Williams as a father might have been a coward for taking his own life. CBS had the gall to interview somebody who had been in AA with Robin Williams. Not a pretty picture.

DAVID ZURAWIK, BALTIMORE SUN: Outrageous. Howie, those kinds of excesses totally need to be denounced. There's no excuse for them. These are professional broadcasters doing really stupid stuff. Why do you sit on the air after someone is dead and call them a coward for? What was Shep Smith thinking? He was a veteran anchor. Why do you show a picture of his house? Howie, it's so simple in some ways. The journalism that you and I were socialized to, if cable news just practiced that, which what do we know to be true? Let's limit it to that. They would have been fine.

KURTZ: And then you have social media with Robin's daughter, Zelda, quitting Twitter and Instagram because people were being incredibly cruel, blaming her for her father's death.

ZURAWIK: What do you say about that? We know that's the way social media is. But what is it in the culture that makes people want to do that in the wake of something like this? Look, the minute it happened, I happened to be walking in the news room and they said, Robin Williams is dead. They said do you want to write about it? I said this is going to stop the culture, to myself, this guy is that important. And do you know what was missing --

KURTZ: Let me pick up on that. There were hours and hours and hours and there were no other stories virtually on television. It wasn't the most important story in the world, but I didn't have a problem with all the coverage. Did you?

ZURAWIK: I had no problem whatsoever. I thought it was important. I think as our culture, I think the people who run the media tend to minimize the importance of cultural figures like Robin Williams to our emotional, to our psychological and to our spiritual life. This guy touched the culture in deep ways. And do you know what was missing in all of this coverage that got high ratings for just about everybody, what was missing were analysts who told people why he was special. It's not enough to say he was a genius, he was a force of nature. Remember when Mike Wallace died and you and I were on the air live on another channel, we went right to why historically did he matter.

KURTZ: The speculation was proven to be so off base, because then several days later, Robin Williams' wife said, well, he was suffering from Parkinson's disease, which might or might not -- I'm not going to speculate here -- played a role. Also, I did find a good focus on depression. Even though I hate when we do the disease of the week, because of a celebrity. A lot of journalists talked candidly about their own battles with depression. The other thing is, here he is on the cover of ""Time,"" it's a big spread inside, but what totally got overshadowed was the death of Lauren Bacall at 89, although she was a bigger star in her heyday, but that was a long time ago.

ZURAWIK: She was. And I think that's just the way the culture works. And don't forget, Robin Williams spoke to successive generations in different media. I'm surprised at how many people in their 20s came up to me the next day and wanted to talk about him.

KURTZ: Take a half a minute to talk about the coverage of Ferguson, Missouri, and what has struck you with all the television presence there.

ZURAWIK: You know, some people say we're not equipped to talk about issues like depression and mental health? Race. We are awful when it comes to race. You know, I think that if you ask me what single event troubled you most, it was the police shooting rubber bullets and tear gas canisters, which you reported at Al Jazeera and the other sorts of things to the press.

But, you know, showing the officers how -- here we go again with all these excesses, and Howie, this is just basic journalism that we knew 20 years ago and forgot. Especially in cable news when we're on a story. It's tough when you're out there and it's going and it's going and it's going. But you have to be better than they are right now. Especially when it involves race.

KURTZ: Yes. And the death of a young man. But it does get ratings. Let me get a break here. Don't go away. Up next, NBC finally dumping David Gregory after putting his through slow-motion torture. But is Chuck Todd the right choice for ""Meet the Press?""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KURTZ: NBC has made David Gregory twist slowly in the wind for months, but this week, the network finally made it official -- Gregory is out as moderator of ""Meet the Press."" He is being replaced by a man of many titles, NBC's political director, chief White House correspondent, and MSNBC morning host, Chuck Todd.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CHUCK TODD, NBC: This poll is a disaster for the president. Essentially, the public is saying your presidency is over.

By saying a number like that, it was 54 percent saying that he no longer has the ability to lead. And solve problems.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KURTZ: David Zurawik, NBC's treatment of David Gregory was shabby and really inexcusable, but was it the right choice to dump him?

ZURAWIK: Absolutely, Howie. We talked about this earlier in the summer, I think. I felt he had a total lack of passion compared to Chuck Todd's kind of passion. Chuck Todd, whether it's true or not, you have the feeling with him that you have with Mike Allen of Politico, that he knows everything that's happening in Washington and cares about it, and that he's plugged in totally.

KURTZ: Not just in Washington, but in 435 congressional districts.

ZURAWIK: Exactly.

KURTZ: For people not familiar, he's a political junky, he is a former print guy, he ran the Politico hot line. So he's had to make a transition to television. In your view, then, smart choice?

ZURAWIK: Oh, absolutely for him. Look, he's not the consultant's idea of a host, which makes me love him, absolutely, first of all.

KURTZ: That's interesting.

ZURAWIK: He isn't.

KURTZ: He's not a blow-dried anchor.

ZURAWIK: Exactly. He's not slick, he's not glib, he doesn't look that way. But here is what I believe. No. 1, I believe passion is more important on television than a -- that good looks and hair.

KURTZ: You have to believe that.

(LAUGHTER)

ZURAWIK: Yes, I have to believe that. But secondly, this guy really, really can lift this show out of the sort of malaise that it's in right now. It's really been sad to see this great franchise fall into the kind of disrepair it is. So you need somebody with this kind of energy to try to bring it back.

KURTZ: Insiders tell me that Chuck Todd has these challenges, making the transition from daily journalism to daily cycle to a weekly show, doing more online, and he's a very frequent tweeter, and making the show more relevant, which is another way of saying, what you said, which is it's got to matter again?

ZURAWIK: One thing about this, I think people don't understand. Sunday morning television, people want experience. Everybody in TV wants young, young, young. Bob Schieffer is No. 1 for a reason, because he gives you the sense that he can synthesize and he has experience. I think it's that. Now, Howie, one problem with this transition, I think NBC has bigger problems. I think the production of that show has really suffered. I wrote about a really bad mistake.

KURTZ: Let me jump in because we are short on time. Some people think Chuck Todd is liberal because he's on MSNBC, but he regularly on his cable show has Republicans and conservatives on. I think that side respects him. But is he -- no one is expecting him to be Tim Russert. Is he a strong enough interviewer?

ZURAWIK: That is a good question. I think he can grow into the Tim Russert role. I think if anybody at that network can grow into it -- it's Tim Russert. But also senior management, they've really got a screwed-up operation over at NBC News. How long will they stay with him if he doesn't get a ratings bump? Will they bring in consultants, will they bring in a psychiatrist to talk to him like they did David Gregory? And call it a brand consultant?

KURTZ: Let's hope not. I don't think he needs any psychoanalyzing.

(CROSSTALK)

KURTZ: You saved me the cheap shot. Thanks for stopping by, Z.

After the break, was a CNN anchor acting an an advocate for the family of Michael Brown? And the Fox News contributor who has a problem, yes, with Michelle Obama's weight. Our video verdict is straight ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KURTZ: Time for our video verdict, where we rate TV clips based on whether they're good journalism and good television. After the tragic police shooting of their son, Michael Brown's parents gave their first interview to MSNBC's Al Sharpton.

ASHBURN: But their second sit-down was on CNN, where anchor Don Lemon conducted an interview that was both highly sympathetic and highly unusual.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: How are you dealing with this right now?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The best way I can.

LEMON: Are you sure -- it says no justice? Why are you wearing the shirt?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because my son don't have justice. And we don't have no peace. He has no justice, we won't get no peace.

LEMON: And to you, mom, I don't even know what to say to you, except that every mother in this country, in this world is rooting for you. And so you stay strong, you have the entire world behind you, and if you ever, either of you need anything, you know how to get in touch with me personally.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ASHBURN: That was cringe-worthy in my opinion. I just feel like he crossed a huge line. It was so personal.

KURTZ: Personal in a sense that he was openly siding with the family. And look, let's make it clear, these people just suffered an unimaginable loss.

ASHBURN: I get it.

KURTZ: And of course he's going to do a sympathetic interview, and I have no problem with it.

ASHBURN: There is a way to be compassionate without crossing that line. The last time I checked, Don Lemon was an anchor.

KURTZ: And he doesn't know what happened. We still don't know the details of the shooting, and so by saying you come to me if you need anything, he was acting as an advocate. What's your score?

ASHBURN: Two.

KURTZ: Well, it's pretty moving, and so I will give it a three.

ASHBURN: It wasn't that moving. All right. The women on Fox's ""Outnumbered"" seemed to be taken a bit aback the other day when one lucky guy weighed in on Michelle Obama.

KURTZ: Dr. Keith Ablow, psychiatrist and Fox News contributor, is not a fan of the first lady, and he took a swipe at her looks.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We don't need the federal government applying -- projecting these standards upon us, and Michelle Obama is like the duchess when she speaks.

(CROSSTALK)

ABLOW: How well can she be eating? She needs to drop a few.

ASHBURN: The worst thing a guy can do is talk about a woman's weight. And he should know that.

KURTZ: You're saying I shouldn't mention that time you kept going back to the buffet?

ASHBURN: Exactly right, get out of here. I give it a 3.

KURTZ: You're giving it a 3? Look, it was a low blow, but Keith Ablow was trying to be entertaining, he was trying to be provocative. He is on a show with a bunch of women.

ASHBURN: The only thing he should say about a woman when they asked how do I look, is hold up his pinkie and say, you look this thin, you look this good. That's what my dad did, that's it.

KURTZ: Nice try. I'm giving it a 5.

ASHBURN: No way. 3.

KURTZ: It was fun.

Still to come, your best tweets, a list of reasons that Buzzfeed just raised a whole lot of money, and Joe Scarborough blames those reporters who got arrested in Ferguson.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KURTZ: And here are a few of your top tweets, are the media covering the unrest in Ferguson fairly or inflaming the situation? Farenell Photography, ""considering police keep contradicting their own public statements and how they're treating reporters, coverage is justified."" Carl Gottlieb, ""the media have no idea if witnesses actually saw anything, often stories change when cops interview. Saw it for 40 years."" Fairflattaxnow, ""The liberal mainstream media's performance this past week is nothing short of disgraceful, they should really be ashamed."" A response from Zuckman, ""Ashamed of what? Reporting of the racist behavior of a corrupt police department? That's their job.""

ASHBURN: Not quite fair to say that the entire police department is corrupt.

KURTZ: Or racist.

ASHBURN: You don't know every member of the police department.

KURTZ: Right. On the other hand, there have been some good reporting about the fact that in many towns, you have majority white police departments, majority black communities, and often that leads to friction.

Buzzfeed, the viral web site with a monster traffic just scored an eye- popping $50 million investment in Silicon Valley. The site mixes solid reporting with LOL stuff and cat pictures and of course lists. 13 awkward moments everyone has at the doctor's office. 18 things people who can't swim are tired of hearing.

And finally, after Washington Post reporter Wes Lowery was arrested in that McDonald's in Ferguson, Missouri, the host of ""Morning Joe"" blamed him and his colleague, and Lowery was quick to respond.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SCARBOROUGH: When the cops tell you, for like the 30th time, let's go, you know what that means, son? It means let's go.

LOWERY: I would invite Joe Scarborough to come down to Ferguson and get out of 30 Rock where he's sitting sipping his Starbucks smugly.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ASHBURN: It is too easy to criticize when you're sitting in a studio, just like this, and you aren't on the ground, you don't know what happens, you don't know what the conditions are. However, I do think that you need to be able to listen, you have to listen to the police, what they say, sometimes.

KURTZ: Scarborough is entitled to his opinion, absolutely. And a lot of people think Wes Lowery went too far and should have gotten out of there faster. I would have gotten out of there faster because I would have been worried about getting arrested. (CROSSTALK)

ASHBURN: Not getting the story, Howie?

KURTZ: But to be actually arrested, and the charges were so trumped up that they were shown out, shows just what a difficult situation it was, and I don't agree with what Joe Concha earlier said, that Wes Lowery was doing this to promote himself.

BREAM: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.

Texas Governor Rick Perry has made a number of headlines in recent weeks. First, it was his center stage clash with President Obama over the crisis on our border. Then, his campaign stop in Iowa during speculation about a 2016 presidential run. But late this week, news broke that the governor had been indicted on felony charges over alleged abuse of power.

Joining us now from Austin, Governor Rick Perry.

Welcome, Governor.

GOV. RICK PERRY, R-TEXAS: Good morning, Shannon.

BREAM: All right. We want to explain to folks what you're facing here. You have been indicted on two felony accounts, abuse of power. The grand jury indictment alleges this, that you, quote, ""With the intent to harm another, intentionally or knowingly misused government property, and by means of coercion, intentionally or knowingly influenced or attempted to influence Rosemary Lehmberg, a public servant."" She is the D.A. in Travis County.

The head of the Texas Democratic Party said this, quote, ""Governor Rick Perry has brought dishonor to his office, his family, and the state of Texas."" They're calling for you to step down.

How do you respond?

PERRY: Well, I think it's important for people to understand the details of this. And the D.A., the highest ranking prosecutor in Travis County, who also has oversight for state officials -- this individual was stopped driving while drunk. She had almost three times the legal limit of alcohol, .238 I believe is what it was.

When you look at the video, not only of the stop, if you look at the video of Ms. Lehmberg when she was being booked into the county jail, the abusiveness, she was kicking on the door. She was abusing the law officials. She had to be restrained.

And when you look at that and you have to make a decision on whether or not $7.5 million of Texas taxpayer money is going to go to the unit that she oversees, I very clearly, I very publicly said as long as that individual is going to be running that agency, I had lost confidence in her. The public had lost confidence in her, and I did what every governor has done for decades, which is make a decision on whether or not it was in the proper use of state money to go to that agency, and I vetoed it.

That's what the rule of law is really about, Shannon. And I stood up for the rule of law in the state of Texas, and if I had to do it again, I would make exactly the same decision.

BREAM: Well, a special prosecutor in this case says he thinks you should take this seriously. He's looked at the law, he's looked at the facts, interviewed more than 40 people. You know these charges on conviction could result in more than 100 years in prison. He's convinced a grand jury, it is a different game with a jury.

But is there any small part of you that's worried at all that that will happen?

PERRY: Well, I certainly take everything I do seriously. The rule of law in particularly I take seriously.

But let me just -- let me just share with you, David Axelrod said this was a very sketchy indictment. Professor Dershowitz, who is not exactly my cheerleader, said that it was outrageous. So I think across the board, you're seeing people weigh in and reflecting that this is way outside of the norm. This is not the way that we settle differences, political differences, in this country. You don't do it with indictments. We settle our political differences at the ballot box.

And I think, you know, across the board, when you got David Axelrod and Harvard law professor Dershowitz saying the things that they said, I think it's really reflective of what we're looking at here.

And I also want to say thanks to people like Rick Scott and Jeb Bush and Bobby Jindal and Senator Ted Cruz, that have very publicly stated that they, too, that think this is way outside the realm of any type of thoughtful look at the laws in the state of Texas.

BREAM: You mentioned the David Axelrod tweet. He said the indictment seems to him, quote, ""pretty sketchy."" So, you do have support from an unlikely source there.

Now, something that you and Mr. Axelrod probably don't agree on is the issue of immigration. You have been very vocal about what's going on in Texas and have called the administration to task. They say now the number show that the influx of those unaccompanied children who are coming across the border illegally has dropped significantly.

To what do you attribute that? Do you give the administration any credit for the numbers going down?

PERRY: Well, here's what I know is happening. Almost six weeks ago, we surged into that area of operation with our Department of Public Safety, our Texas Ranger Recon Teams, our Parks and Wildlife.

We brought real attention to the issue. We're sending messages back to Central America that you should not send your children hereby. They're not going to be able to walk across the border. We talked powerfully about surging the National Guard into that area as well.

So, I would suggest to you that the issue here really goes back to that rule of law, if you will. We're not securing the border as the Constitution calls for us to.

When you add the IRS scandal that's going on and the outside of the rule of law there, and then you look at what's happened in Austin, Texas, with this grand jury, I think there is some extraordinary concern in this country about the rule of law not being followed and too many things are being decided in arenas that shouldn't be decided from the standpoint of a government that's out of control.

People want to get back to the rule of law and knowing with certainty that our border is going to be secure, that the IRS is not going to come knocking down their door looking for things, and that the NSA is not listening in on our phone conversations. BREAM: Well, longer term on this particular issue, the administration has signaled that the president is considering executive action, with respect to immigration. He said he's basically been left no choice because of lawmakers.

Here's what he said just before the folks on Capitol Hill left for their August recess.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: If, in fact, House Republicans are concerned about me acting independently of Congress, despite the fact that I have taken fewer executive actions than my Republican predecessor or my Democratic predecessor before that or the Republican predecessor before that, then the easiest way to solve it is pass some legislation. Get things done.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: And the administration's publicly called on you to get behind that. I think a letter back in July than Valerie Jarrett sent specifically and publicly asking you to influence lawmakers to get something done on Capitol Hill. So, is that the solution? And absent that, does the president have no choice left but to act, as he says?

PERRY: Well, here's what I think is very important for the president to understand, and for Washington to understand as well. You're not going to have comprehensive immigration reform until the border is secure.

The American people do not trust this president, and they do not trust Washington to do these two things at the same time. They expect the border to be safe.

When a border patrol agent was killed in Willacy County this last week by an individual who had been deported multiple times, the people of the state of Texas -- and I will suggest to you, all across the country -- are fed up with that. They want this border to be secured. They want to be able to live in their communities and feel like they're safe.

And if this president does not do what's required to secure the border first, I will suggest to you: whatever he does is going to be a failure.

BREAM: Well, to that end, the first wave of National Guard troops that you called up are now positioned there. Estimates it's going to cost anywhere from $12 million to maybe up to $18 million a month to have them there.

One of your frequent critics, Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro says there's no defined mission for these troops. He says, ""Essentially, it appears to be a feel-good show of force without clear purpose.""

There had been questions about whether you would grant these individuals the ability to apprehend, to arrest. What is there role, and how do you respond to critics who say you're using the border to fuel your 2016 ambition?

PERRY: Well, I think that anyone who wants to make this be about politics needs to go to Willacy County and to Mrs. Vega, Ms. Marie Vega, whose son, that border patrol agent, former marine, great American patriot, who was killed -- shot down in cold blood by an individual who had been deported multiple times.

I hope Mr. Castro or anybody else who's being critical of this thinks that that's political.

It's not. The citizens of this country and the citizens of Texas expect to be able to live in safety in their communities. That's what the rule of law is truly all about.

Washington has failed at that. This president has failed. He has had almost six years to address this issue. He refuses to.

That is what must be addressed, and I'm going to do it, and Texas is going to do it. We're going to secure the border of this country and do everything in our power to make sure our citizens are safe.

BREAM: All right, Governor, let's talk beyond Texas. How about we talk about Iowa? Because by our count, you've been there four times since the last election.

You were there last week where conservative leader Bob Vander Plaats said this, quote, ""It was the best I've ever heard Perry. I thought he's raised his game substantially.""

So, what can you tell us about running in 2016?

PERRY: Well, I hope that I can be very helpful between now and the 4th of November so that Joni Ernst will go to the United States Senate representing Iowa. Obviously, Terry Branstad is going to be a fabulous job and win (ph) going our way up there, but there are some other races that we worked with.

Their State Senate is just a couple seats away from having control, Republican control, so that they have both the House, the Senate, the governor, the lieutenant governor, and they can then become an incredibly influential state from the standpoint of economic development.

Between now to November 4th is what I'm focused on. 2016 will take care of itself.

BREAM: All right. November 5th, if you want to come talk to us about 2016, Governor, please do.

(LAUGHTER)

BREAM: Good to see you this morning. Governor Perry, thank you for joining us.

PERRY: Thanks, Shannon. Yes, ma'am.

BREAM: Well, tensions remain high in Ferguson, Missouri, after the police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old sparks outrage across the country. We will have a live report and analysis, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BREAM: Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency in Ferguson yesterday and put a curfew in place for citizens there, midnight to 5 a.m. Clashes between police and protesters have plagued the city ever since the August 9th shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer.

We'll discuss the facts of the case with a former homicide detective in a moment. But first, Fox News correspondent Mike Tobin is live in Ferguson on a very rainy morning.

Good morning, Mike.

MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Shannon.

And we did not make it through the first night of the curfew without clashes. You can't really call a widespread, seven arrests total. Most of them centering around this barbecue restaurant that's physically located at the heart of the demonstrations.

Now, Captain Ron Johnson of the state police made a point of clarifying that the heavier tactics that were used were not directly related to enforcement of the curfew. Rather, a gun was spotted, shots were fired, one person was shot and taken to the hospital in critical condition. Also, a police cruiser was fired upon. Beyond that, police had information that people had broken into a restaurant and were up on the roof.

So, they moved in with smoke canisters, as well as one tear gas canister.

Captain Johnson explained.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CAPT. RON JOHNSON, MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL: The operation tonight, because of our initial response, is to -- was going in Red's Barbecue in the shooting, were operational responses, and the response was not related to the enforcement of the curfew.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TOBIN: As much as Captain Johnson entered this process, a hero embraced by the community, and he embraced it, we're seeing a community that's growing impatient with him, in part because he didn't use enough force to stop the looting, on the other hand, for using too much force and repeating the scenes of the near nightly clashes with police. At a press conference yesterday, he was heckled by people who want punishment for Officer Darren Wilson and aren't taking the time to understand the process. It can really be summed up by one heckler who shouted out over the crowd: Let me get this straight, you have the authority to suppress the people, but you don't have the authority to arrest a killer cop -- Shannon.

BREAM: Mike, thank you very much.

Joining us now with his analysis of the Michael Brown case, former homicide detective and Fox News contributor, Rod Wheeler. He's also there in Ferguson. Detective, thank you so much for your time today.

I want to start out by playing a little of what Governor Nixon had to say about the situation and trying to restore order in Ferguson.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

NIXON: If we're going to achieve justice, we must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: All right. You've been there for a couple days now, seen it firsthand through the day and night. How would you grade this test? How are things going in Ferguson?

ROD WHEELER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think things are a lot better tonight or today, Shannon, than they have been the past two nights. Now, you know, I was here Friday night and I was actually right in the midst, right in the heart of all of the rioting, and it was really total chaos out here that night. There was no police out here. And then, right around 1:30 a.m., that's when police eventually moved in.

Last night, again, the same thing -- I was right in the middle of the curfew, and there was a lot of rioting then.

The good news, though, Shannon, is yesterday, during the day, there was a lot of demonstrations, a lot of protests, and they were all peaceful. As a matter of fact, Reverend Jesse Jackson was here, I was walking with him, and he was preaching nonviolence, and no one was violent yesterday.

Now, the challenge for the police department, the governor, and everyone else is going to be: what's going to happen tonight? And I can tell you that the police are strategically trying to gather intelligence so that they can be prepared for whatever happens.

The community, though -- most people in this community -- want peace, Shannon. BREAM: Well, let me ask you this because you have a great deal of experience in dealing with these kinds of cases and situations. The police chief there in Ferguson, Thomas Jackson, has taken a lot of heat for releasing a video that seems to show the victim in this case, Michael Brown, involved with a robbery prior to him then later being shots and killed.

We understand that federal authorities, Department of Justice, did not want that video released. It was done by local authorities on Friday.

How do you think that's impacted the situation?

WHEELER: Well, that has impacted the situation tremendously. Let me tell you why real quickly.

You know, there's a serious disconnect, Shannon, between the state police and the city police here in Ferguson. They don't even communicate with each other, and a lot of it has to do with the release of that video.

Now, in my opinion as a homicide investigator, I don't see the significance of releasing that video right now because according to the police chief, it has nothing to do with the arrest or the shooting of Michael Brown. If that's the case, then why release it? And that's what the people in this community are saying.

So, I think they're going to have to go back, Shannon, take a look at how this was handled and hopefully not make those serious mistakes again.

BREAM: Quickly, how tough is it for police in this situation? You mentioned trying to protect local businesses, trying to protect local people who want no part of this. They want to peacefully protest against those who are there to do real harm, and the police risk looking like they have too heavy a hand.

WHEELER: Right, and they have been somewhat heavy-handed. But I think right now they have things under control. Again, it's going to have to be working with the community. They're going to have to bridge that gap, because right now, it's a serious gap, a fracture between the community and the police department.

So, they're going to have to clearly work on that going forward, if they're going to be effective in this community.

BREAM: Rod, thank you so much for your time today.

WHEELER: Sure. Thank you, Shannon.

BREAM: And, by the way, we extended an invitation to Missouri Governor Nixon to join this program. He is doing four other Sunday shows today, but he declined our request.

What are your thoughts on the situation in Ferguson? We want to hear from you. Join the conversation on Facebook with other FNS viewers.

Up next, ISIS continues to terrorize Iraq, and Ukraine targets a convoy of Russian military vehicles. Two top members of Congress join us to discuss the U.S. role in escalating situations all across the globe, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BREAM: U.S. airstrikes in Iraq are ongoing. The current operation said to be a joint Kurdish Iraqi and U.S. campaign, aimed at bringing the Mosul dam from ISIS control.

We will talk with two members of Congress in just a moment.

But first, FOX News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot from the city of Irbil with the very latest on the operation -- Greg.

GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, Fox News has learned the U.S. jet fighters and unmanned drones continue to hit ISIS positions around that dam today, and what is clearly the opening up of a new front in the war against militants.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

PALKOT (voice-over): Peshmerga Kurdish fighters are on the move, advancing with Iraqi forces on ISIS militants in an attempt to retake the strategic Mosul dam, held by ISIS, there are fears they could let it burst or blow it up with devastating effect. In coordinated action, the U.S. launched nine airstrikes Saturday against ISIS positions at the dam.

A local Peshmerga commander told us the terrorists can be beaten.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.

PALKOT (on camera): Absolutely?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.

PALKOT: That's the note.

(voice-over): This, as the humanitarian crisis builds, 400,000 refugees fleeing the militants crowding into one Northern Iraqi province alone, 1.5 million are across the region.

Relief workers are coping to keep up.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're very needy. They need food, (INAUDIBLE). They need shelter. They need medical support, like medical supplies. They need -- and then, psychologically, they need help because they're traumatized.

PALKOT: Indeed, ethnic minorities, Yazidi refugees, are still reeling from details of Friday's massacre of Yazidis in a village near Mt. Sinjar. Some 80 men and teenagers were killed by militants, some at close range. At least 100 women and children were kidnapped.

""You cannot even say they're animals,"" this refugee says of ISIS. ""Even in the jungle, animals have laws. They don't abide by any laws. They are really monsters.""

(END VIDEOTAPE)

PALKOT: He called them monsters. There are, in fact, new reports of ISIS militants killing men and kidnapping women. U.S. officials tell us that they are investigating those reports.

Back to you, Shannon.

BREAM: Greg, thank you very much.

Now, let's bring in two key members of Congress. Senator Ron Johnson, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. And Congressman Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee.

Welcome to you both.

REP. ELIOT ENGEL, D-N.Y., RANKING MEMBER, FOREIGN AFFAIRS CMTE: Thank you. Good to be here.

SEN. RON JOHNSON, R-WIS., FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: Good morning, Shannon.

BREAM: I want to start with a question for both of you, and I'll address it to you first, Senator Johnson.

You've heard about the ongoing activity that we have continuing in Iraq. At what point do you feel like the administration needs to come to Congress for any type of authorization?

JOHNSON: Well, first of all, it's a very good sign that President Obama is beginning to act. And, you know, honestly, couple weeks ago, President Obama did invite about eight or nine members of the foreign relations and armed services committee into the White House to speak with his council about a new authorization for the use of military force, which I think is pretty long overdue. They're finding out that trying to act militarily with the current authorization in place is becoming pretty tenuous.

So, that's a good sign that President Obama is recognizing the fact that he's going to need authority to deal with this new asymmetric threat. And we just heard from Greg Palkot. I mean, ISIS method of diplomacy are beheadings, crucifixions, mass executions or live burials, and enslavement of women and forced marriages. These are evil people that need to be defeated. I'm glad that President Obama is finally beginning to act.

BREAM: Congressman Engel, same question to you about getting Congress onboard.

ENGEL: I think Congress has to play an important role in this. This is the way our Constitution works and I think Congress is really tired of presidents just going in by themselves. So, I think there has to be consultation and an assent from Congress.

But I do agree with the senator. I think that what's going on in Iraq is horrific and it warrants a response. We cannot just put our heads in the sand and pretend it doesn't exist, because if we allow ISIS to get bigger and bigger, they're going to plot homeland attacks on us.

BREAM: Well, and here's what deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, said when I asked him earlier this week about what the long term strategy is for the administration regarding ISIS.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BEN RHODES, DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Provide assistance to -- and equipment to those Iraqi forces who are taking the fight to ISIL so that we can squeeze them in the space that they're operating in and ultimately address that threat that they're posing not just to Iraq but to the region and to the United States.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: Senator Johnson, you heard him there specifically mention a threat to the U.S. What do you think needs to be our long term strategy here?

JOHNSON: We need to defeat them.

You know, we had deputy assistant secretary of the state, Brent McGurk, in front of our committee on July 24th. He said that ISIL or ISIS is far more capable of both manpower, and resources, and fighting effectiveness than what we faced in 2007. They're funneling 30 to 50 suicide bombers into Iraq every month. He said they could easily funnel those suicide bombers into Western nations.

We need to be highly concerned about this. This threat is a gathering storm. It's not going away. And like Congressman Engel said, we can't bury our heads in the sand in this one.

We may be war-weary. But I'll tell you, ISIS, ISIL is not war- weary. They've been -- they're highly trained, they are highly organized. They have been very patient setting up this caliphate, and that they're long term aim really is to use that base of operation against the West.

BREAM: And Congressman, we have seen them break through the Lebanon border. There has been great operation, we know, in Syria. I mean there are very big concerns now about Aleppo. What is your concern about that immediate situation in Syria with regard to ISIS?

ENGEL: Well, the Syrian opposition, the Free Syria Army, whom we should have armed two years ago, is facing defeat, and they have called on us to bomb ISIS outside of Aleppo. I think we should consider doing it because this is one war. It's building from Syria into Iraq. The border is obliterated. There's no border anymore, and I think we need to fight ISIS wherever they rear their ugly heads. You know, when we, years ago, when the Russians were thrown out of Afghanistan, and we just sort of looked the other way and didn't really focus, al Qaeda, the Taliban, allowed al Qaeda to plot against the United States and that culminated in September 11th, 2001. If we allow ISIS to get stronger, and stronger, if they take Aleppo, it's the end of the Free Syria Army and also would mean that ISIS would have essentially a no man's land in Syria through Iraq to plot and plan attacks on our homeland. And frankly, our European allies should step up to the fight. They are geographically much closer to Iraq and Syria than we are and I don't hear many good things frankly coming from our NATO allies with the European Union. They need to step up also. We're all in this fight together.

BREAM: And what I'm hearing from both of you is that you do feel that there is a significant threat to the U.S. long term if ISIS isn't stamped out. Now, they do seem very motivated. They don't seem that they're slowing down in any respect. So, can either of you, and I'll start with you, congressman, envision a point where we are, despite as war weary as this country is, that we are putting boots on the ground or we are getting more heavily involved there so we don't have to confront them here?

ENGEL: Well, I don't think we're going to put boots on the ground the way we we did before in Iraq. I don't think anybody really wants to do that. But we do have some boots on the ground right now, and frankly, we need to do everything we can to repel ISIS. I don't think we have the luxury of putting our heads in the sand and saying, well, it's over there and we're not going to do it. I think what we're doing now is effective and we are going to do more of it and ultimately we may have some boots on the ground there. Not something I want, but you know what, we have that choices and the worse choice is to do nothing.

BREAM: Well, Senator, the president clearly campaigned and was elected, in part, on his promises to get us out of that part of the world. A lot of lives were invested, a lot of treasure invested, so what is your take on where we go from here?

JOHNSON: Unfortunately, President Obama bugged out of Iraq, and that was a strategic and historic blunder and we're seeing the results of that. So, right now, what the president has to do is he has to assemble a coalition of the willing. We have to realize there was a German and an Australian suicide bomber the week of July 24Tth. That's what Brett McGurk reported to us. We have seen the first American suicide bomber set himself off in Syria in May. So this is a growing threat to America. And we really do need to, like Congressman Engel said, we have got to assemble NATO, we have to strengthen NATO not only to handle what is happening in Iraq and Syria, but also what is happening in Ukraine and Eastern Europe as well.

BREAM: All right, I want to pivot to Ukraine and Russia, because that has been hitting up, conversations about Russian convoys going across the border. Ukrainian officials saying that they have taken out some of those vehicles. Reports that a Ukrainian jet has been shot down. And I want to look at some new polls that we have out this week. 74 percent of those surveyed say President Obama has not been tough enough on Russia. 77 percent say that Putin does not take President Obama seriously. Congressman, are the sanctions working there? Is our strategy with respect to Russia with the advances of President Putin, is it working?

ENGEL: Well, I think that the NATO alliance is being tested by Putin. You know, for the past 15 or 20 years, the equation for NATO was always that Russia was kind of a partner, that we sort of didn't need to look at Russia as an adversary. That's no longer the case. Putin has clearly indicated he's an adversary of the West, and therefore, the whole equation of NATO has to change or else NATO is dead. So, what it really means is that the clause in the NATO agreement that every country has to spend at least 2 percent of its budget on defense has to be enforced. Right now only three or four countries including the United States spend that much in defense. So, I think that Putin is a bully. And if you don't stand up to a bully early on, you are going to have to stand up to them later on. And, you know, we still have that. I don't like comparisons to Hitler, but in 1938, some of the people said, well, just give Hitler Czechoslovakia. Just give Sudetenland. He's worrying about protecting ethnic Germans, if we do that, everything will be all right. And we saw what happened. Now some people are saying, well, just give Putin Crimea or maybe a little bit of eastern Ukraine. He's protecting ethnic Russians. You can't allow this bully to do that. And I think the way we deal with Putin now is going to set the stage for the next 25 years because he's going to be around for a long time. And if he thinks we're paper tigers, he's going to continue to move with impunity.

BREAM: Senator, have we missed the opportunity to deal more forcefully with him? Where do we go?

JOHNSON: Let's hope we haven't missed the opportunity. But, you know, I keep hearing administration officials saying that they want to offer an off ramp to Vladimir Putin. He's not looking for off ramps. He's looking for on ramps. We should have complied with the Prime Minister Yatsenyuk request for small arms ammunition immediately. We should be very avertly, very vocally, very visibly showing support for Poroshenko right now, saying that we're going to actually honor the Budapest Memorandum, we're going to help Poroshenko assure his -- his territorial integrity and certainly his governing independence, and as Congressman Engel said, that's the way you have to treat a bully. You really do have to achieve peace through strength, and we've got to beef up NATO. You know, defense or foreign minister Sikorski in Poland said that the Polish-American Alliance is useless and it could actually be a counterproductive because it creates a false sense of security. That's the wrong way for our allies to be thinking of America, but, you know, because of the lack of result, the lack of -- the weakness we have shown, that's the how our allies are starting to view us. We have to turn that situation around, we are going to show far greater strength of resolve, we have to make sure that Poroshenko has fully support in his efforts to really secure eastern Ukraine and really defeat the Russian aggression into eastern Ukraine.

BREAM: Senator Johnson, Congressman Engel, thank you both for joining us today.

JOHNSON: Thank you, Shannon.

ENGEL: Have a great day. BREAM: You, too.

Up next, what does Maliki's resignation mean for U.S. engagement in Iraq? Our Sunday panel weighs in, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Now, the situation on the mountain has greatly improved and Americans should be very proud of our efforts, because the skill and professionalism of our military and the generosity of our people, we broke the ISIL siege of Mt. Sinjar, we helped vulnerable people to reach safety and we helped save many innocent lives.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: President Obama praising the U.S. military operation in Iraq before making clear that our involvement there is not over yet. It's time now for our Sunday Group. Syndicating Columnist George Will. ""USA Today"" columnist Kirsten Powers. Fox News contributor Liz Cheney and Amy Walter from ""The Cook Political Report."" Good Sunday morning to all of you. Amy, I'll start with you. The president in that moment, in those remarks from Martha's Vineyard sounded like a teeny bit of a victory last night. We have accomplished our humanitarian mission here, but it is clear -- I mean with air strikes field (ph) going on around the most ...

AMY WALTER, THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT: It's not over.

BREAM: Yeah.

WALTER: That it's not over. But to be able to say we have done something. I said we're going to have very strict parameters around it. It was successful, and now we can move on. It continues with a sort of whack-a-mole strategy, I think from this White House, which is confront the crisis while it's happening, but do not get much more engaged than that, trying to keep the U.S. out of anything that is more direct than that.

BREAM: Well, Liz, I mean you heard the congressman and senator that we had just before this. Both saying that we have to do something decisive with respect to ISIL and ISIS. Nobody wants to think about getting too involved, but it may require that if we don't want them to show up here.

LIZ CHENEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right, now, absolutely, Shannon. ISIS has got to be fought, they have got to be defeated. They can't be contained. And even this limited objective the president set out for himself, we now know that you've had Yazidi slaughtered after he declared that it had been a success. The longer the president waits to take true offensive strategic action, the harder that fight is going to be ultimately, the bloodier the fight will be, the costlier it will be. The fight is coming. And secondly, the more likely it is that we're going to experience, unfortunately, potentially a mass casualty terrorist attack on the home land. It's absolutely clear ISIS is telling people in the intelligence community last week briefed reporters and said that ISIS knows that a war with the United States is inevitable, so it's coming. And for the president to be saying things like, I want a solution in Iraq that has no victor and no vanquished, which is what he said last week, you know, I think frankly you're to the point now where this is very clearly a dereliction of duty on his part. He's unwilling to take any kind of offensive action to defeat ISIS and is watching this threat, which is a grave threat potentially of historic proportions grow by the day.

BREAM: But Kirsten, how does he sell that, though, to the American people when he has been the one saying that the U.S. is too involved in too many places and we need to come home?

KIRSTEN POWERS, USA TODAY COLUMNIST: Well, he has to sell them on the facts, which is what Liz just said. I don't think there's a lot of disagreement over the threat that ISIS poses to the United States and poses to the people of Iraq. And if he's going to come out and say I care about humanitarian issues and I have to come in to save people from a humanitarian crisis, well, there's a lot more work to be done because he's incorrect when he says that he has somehow dealt with the humanitarian crisis. There are hundreds of thousands of refugees, well, internally displaced people, there are actually refugees in their own country, right now who don't have food or water or shelter and who are under threat by ISIS. So I think that he would have to sell that, and look, I think Americans have shown that they're pretty supportive of these air strikes. Even 65 percent of Democrats in the Fox News poll supported these air strikes. So, I don't think it's correct to think that Americans won't support doing something. They don't want a full-scale ground war, but they support what he's doing so far.

BREAM: George, can we neutralize ISIS, sort of that?

WILL: From the air? I doubt it very much. Something much bigger is happening. Yugoslavia was born at 1918 and died a few years ago of internal contradictions. There is nothing compared to those in Iraq. Iraq was born in 1920. Eight years ago, the senator from Delaware, Joe Biden, suggested partitioning Iraq along sectarian grounds. Well, it's doing it to itself now, the question for Liz and Kirsten and everyone, who's going to take back the cities of Fallujah, Tikrit, and Mosul? The Iraqi army? What is the Iraqi army fighting for? The Iraqi state? The Iraqi state barely exists now. A leader of the Kurdish fighters said there's an asymmetry in the motivation. So, the ISIL people want to die and go and have lunch with Mohammed. Our people want to fight and then go home to have dinner with their families. Those are the Kurds who have actually built a nation and know what they're fighting for. What would the Iraqi army be fighting for? And absent that, who will take the cities back?

CHENEY: Well, George, I mean you're right that it is a complete disaster and it is a sectarian mess, but I think that the security of the nation requires that we focus on what is the direct threat to us. And part of the problem in the president's policy to date has been, he has been saying, well, we have got to wait until we have a political solution before I'll take action. We've now had a political solution. Maliki is gone, but what we learned with the surge, for example, is that the military action, demonstrating to people that we will be there, we will be fighting with them, is critical. And at the end of the day, you know, granting everything you just said about the conditions on the ground, ISIS is a direct, immediate, grave, strategic threat to the security of the United States of America, and the president as commander in chief has an obligation to respond to that.

POWERS: And also, I don't think it is Iraqi Army. It's the Kurds and fair point about that they're not as diabolical as ISIS, but they have said that, you know, that they want to fight them. They have been deplaced (ph) where the refugees have been able to flee, they are taking care of them, and they need to be armed, they need to be given more arms than they are being given, they need -- and they have been asking for this for years, and really, in the last couple of months have been very aggressively asking for help.

WILL: It's one thing, however, to defend Kurdistan, it's another thing to do with the Marines -- terrible cost, which is a take back cities with urban warfare. And I'm not sure that Kurds have an appetite for that.

BREAM: I want to make sure that we touch on the situation in Ukraine and Russia as that continued to heat up. And, you know, there are these new polls, that we mentioned, how the president, our president, is doing on Russia. 74 percent say not tough enough. And when we were asked does Putin take Obama seriously, 77 percent said no, he doesn't take him seriously. So, Amy, where does that leave us?

WALTER: Well, I thought another interesting thing in this poll was when asked about how Americans think the president is doing on the issue of Ukraine, 20 percent didn't even have any opinion at all, which I think goes to the heart of the issue here, which is there are a lot of Americans. They see Putin, they think Cold War. It brings up a lot of those memories, but they don't exactly know what's happening in the Ukraine. So, judging him purely on if he's standing up to Putin or not, is -- that's pretty easy. Saying, what should we be doing, what should he be doing in Ukraine? How do we judge his efforts there, that's much tougher for the American public. So, I think it's just an overall sense, look, so much of what's happening right now in terms of the frustration Americans are having is also based on what is happening at home. There's a very deep frustration that politicians have been spending a whole lot of time talking about what is going on overseas, there's been a lot of talk about how we can help overseas, not enough about helping regular people. So, when people at home feel like the domestic issues haven't been solved, they get even more cocooned, and that is part of why you have this war weariness.

BREAM: And even though as we do have domestic issues raging and they may not understand the nuances of what's happening in Ukraine and Crimea and Russia and all that. It is still happening, and we do have to give it some attention, so George, where do we go from here?

WILL: Well, we go to the specific questions. As Amy (INAUDIBLE). It's one thing to say he should be stronger. It's another thing to say what should we do about it? Let's be blunt. 20 percent of Americans, you say, have no opinion on Ukraine. Not nearly 20 percent of Americans could find Ukraine on a map ...

(LAUGHTER)

WILL: Let alone the Crimea, which once upon a time was part of the Ukraine and is now conceded as departed. So, these polls are I think of very limited information.

BREAM: Well, we will continue our discussion, but not on international affairs. We're going to take a break here. When we come back, we're going to talk about Hillary Clinton. She's brought controversy when she criticized President Obama's foreign policy with an all part of her 2016 strategy. Plus, what would you like to ask the panel? Go to Facebook or Twitter @Foxnewssunday. We may use your question on the air.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)

HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Absolutely. Yes, we're looking forward to it. Going to be there tonight.

ERIC SCHULTZ, DEPUTY WH PRESS SECRETARY: They continue to agree on a broad majority of issues confronting our country even if they have the occasional policy difference. The president appreciates her counsel and advice, but more importantly, he appreciates her friendship. And that's why he's looking forward to seeing her this evening.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: Hillary Clinton and White House spokesman Eric Schultz downplaying any rifts between President Obama and his former secretary of state after Clinton publicly criticized the president's foreign policy. We're back now with the panel. Kirsten, I'll start with you. I kind of caught your eye. It was so awkward, the position that Hillary was signing a book, she was kind of caught in the moment with that question. Trying to say everything is fine.

POWERS: Well, they apparently were at this party for Vernon Jordan's wife and were, you know, dancing on the dance floor and having a blast together, so allegedly, nothing is wrong between them. But I think pretty clearly, as much as she has said that she has reached out to the president to reassure him she didn't mean anything by it, I think she was really differentiating herself from him, very clearly. This was not a subtle statement. I think it was actually a pretty harsh statement for her to make about his foreign policy, and yes, she has already -- we all knew that she wanted to arm the Syrian rebels, but the way that she really, I think, attacked the president over his foreign policy philosophy I think is a much bigger attack than just disagreeing on maybe one particular country. BREAM: Just so people know, a little bit of what she had to say in this interview, as far as the U.S. moving faster to arm Syrian rebels fighting Assad, she said quote, ""the failure left a vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled."" She also said, ""great nations need organizing principles and 'don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle.""

We have indications that they knew how this was going to play with the administration, that her staffers had reached out to White House staffers. So clearly, she knew there was going to be some tension over these remarks.

WALTER: I agree with Kirsten. I don't think this was just a mistake, that this just happened to flow out of her mouth. I think it's very clear that she has been setting all along on this book tour, the guide posts or planting the flags for 2016. So that when we come back and have these interviews and say, gosh, is she just positioning herself now that it's 2016, she can say, oh, no, no, I told you in 2013, I told you in 2014, I told you on the book tour, I told you in this interview, this is where I stood. Trying to get that laid out now, and then when we go into 2016, we have the markers set.

BREAM: We have an interesting comment from Facebook. This comes in from Phil Holstead (ph). He said, ""Why did she turn around and apologize to Obama for doing so after she had made these remarks?"" If she is trying to differentiate herself, was it a little more explicit than she thought it was going to be? Why the apology after the fact?

CHENEY: I think it's a Washington game, the apology piece of it. She has two problems. One is substantive and one is political. And the substantive problem is that we're watching the complete and total collapse of the Obama foreign policy. And you are watching -- you have the secretary of defense basically saying the world is a disaster right now. And so Secretary Clinton is in a position where she's got to try to differentiate herself from that, but essentially that means differentiating herself from herself, since she oversaw this policy for four years. And that's very difficult, not to mention Benghazi, which she has yet to answer for.

But the political problem is she's attempting here to move right. It is going to anger those on the left. She's going to lose what support she has from those on the left of her own party, and she's not certainly going to gain support from those on the right, from those in my party, from people who will say, we have seen this before. You know, we know, for example, from Bob Gates' book, that Secretary Clinton has a history of taking political positions and overruling national security issues because of her own political gain. So it's a tough, complicated situation for her, and I think it's probably beyond her capacity to maneuver.

BREAM: We got this from Twitter. Bob Prosioso (ph) says why does Hillary behave like a whistle-blower who had no involvement in the events taking place during her tenure as secretary of state?"" George, does it ring true to you?

WILL: That's surely the question. She's differentiating herself, certainly, defining herself. The question is, and I want to put this politely, how much ballast of belief does she actually have? She looks clever in what she's doing, but it's never clever in politics to look clever. Remember, in Bob Gates' memoir, he talks about how dismayed he was when she said to Obama in front of Gates that she had opposed President Bush's surge in Iraq for political reasons having to do with the competition with Obama in the Democratic primaries. You have the world, what, 18 months after she leaves secretary of state, exploding. That's the words of the president's own secretary of defense, and she can't really say everything was fine and then it suddenly exploded.

WALTER: Well, and let's also be clear. I know we're focusing on foreign policy, as we should be, but I think her bigger problem going into 2016, this is not so much about the primary but the general election, is distancing herself if the economy is not doing as well, than distancing herself from what's happening overseas.

So the bigger issue in 2016, as it is with every presidential election, is how do people feel about the economy? If there is -- that's going to be a tougher balancing act. Voters are going to attach every Democrat to what's happening with this president. And finding a way to differentiate herself, to say another four years of a Democrat in the White House is going to be a better economy because why? And having an answer for that question.

BREAM: We have another poll that may sound a little bit lighthearted, but there's some truth, probably, a nugget in here. The Fox News poll about who you would rather spend your summer vacation with. Hillary and Bill, 42 percent. Michelle and Barack Obama, 25 percent. Neither 27 percent, maybe that's the biggest number we should look at. But Hillary and Bill, way out in front on the summer vacation choices there. Is she aware -- the two of them at this point, maybe, it seems are more likable than the current president, but when you're in office, you're the one who's making all the tough decisions.

CHENEY: I think part of that summer vacation question, part of the answer to that is based on sort of like, which one is going to be more of a circus.

(CROSSTALK)

CHENEY: Yes, and you know, I think you know if you're hanging with the Clintons, it's going to be a circus. And I think, you know, this goes to Bill Clinton as well, also, we were talking about this before, the extent to which people look at him, look at how he's behaved, how he continues to behave, and not that that should blame Hillary for that, but more, do you really want that person living in your White House again?

WALTER: I will say this, nobody would have predicted this in 1999, but a poll recently out from NBC Wall Street Journal, Bill Clinton, related to other world leaders, he and the pope tied. The pope, tied in terms of likability -- in terms of their approval rating. OK? So nobody would have predicted that in the height of the impeachment scandal. BREAM: That's true. Who thinks he's a plus or minus for her?

POWERS: Who, Bill?

BREAM: Yes.

POWERS: A plus, definitely. In fact, I think -- I wish they would have just done would you rather be with Hillary or Obama. Because I think if you take Bill out of the equation, you might get a different number.

BREAM: George, what do you think?

WILL: He's a plus until people think of him wandering the corridors of the White House, footloose, fancy-free and bored.

BREAM: Bored being the key situation. All right, thank you all very much. That's it for the panel, and that's it for today. Chris Wallace will be back next week, and hope you have a great week, and of course, we'll see you next ""Fox News Sunday"" from right here in Washington.",NA,NA,NA,NA

RON POLLACK, FAMILIES USA:  One of the hall marks of our insurance system prior to the Affordable Care Act was we had insurance that didn't insure. 

You had lots of holes in coverage.  So the Affordable Care Act does mandate certain kinds of coverages. 

SUSAN PRICE, SMALL BUSINESS OWNER:  I'm married to someone of the same sex, but yet I'm being made now to purchase birth control coverage and I'm being made to purchase pregnancy coverage.  I'm 50. My partner is 57. I don't think we need those types of coverages.  I'm quite sure we don't need birth control. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SHANNON BREAM, ANCHOR:  We are back with our panel.  We're just giggling a little bit, I might add.  ObamaCare back in the news.  Bret has done a series of pieces and had this special that raises a lot of the questions that are still out there, a lot of objections that are still out there.  But we also have now, Steve, this week another e-mail mystery. 

STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Right.  I mean, any time you see an e-mail from a senior government official involved in something that is imploding, like ObamaCare was at the time that the e-mail was sent, it has to raise questions.  It appears that the e-mail was not ultimately permanently deleted because we have seen it now.  But you have to ask the question, why was Marilyn Tavenner so eager not to have this information shared more broadly?  It's reminiscent certainly of the IRS and Lois Lerner and her instructions to her colleagues not to share e-mails and not to send things, sensitive information on e-mail. 

BREAM:  And I was remiss not to let folks know, by the way, that is was what won the Friday Lightning Round is this discussion of ongoing issues with ObamaCare.  Nina? 

NINA EASTON, COLUMNIST, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: Well, I actually don't think this e-mail thing has legs.  The e-mail is there.  I think what does have legs are these issues, the one size fits all that comes out of ObamaCare, the unintended consequences.  You have got Obama crisscrossing the country, previous to his vacation, calling for a raising the minimum wage at the same time that a report comes out that shows that the so-called Cadillac tax, which will tax companies that have too generous of insurance plans, that that will actually cost workers about $100 a year because companies are making them pick up more of their health care tab.  So those are those bottom line issues that I think is what comes back to haunt ObamaCare. 

BREAM:  Charles? 

KRAUTHAMMER:  I pay for lactation services that I don't think I really need. 

(LAUGHTER)

BREAM:  I'm going to go on record saying you probably don't. 

Alright, I want to play a little bit of sound from our second topic tonight, which is what is going on in Ferguson. And this is the highway patrol captain Ron Johnson who was put in charge of overseeing operations of what's going on there, and here is a bit of what he had to say earlier today. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RON JOHNSON:  I agree that this is not a black and white issue because we all have sons and daughters, and we do need to communicate better, because you saw what communication did yesterday.  So we do need to communicate better.  And we're going to do that. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM:  He has gotten a lot of praise for how he has handled the situation since he has taken over in just the last 24 to 48 hours. But today, the police taking a lot of criticism for releasing video that appears to show, they say that it is Michael Brown.  It's alleged to be him taking part in shoplifting or theft at a store, and his family is outraged by that, Charles. 

CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, the family lawyer, spokesman said that that is the young man in the video, and he appears to be engaged in a robbery.  He wasn't armed. 
He was strong-arming.  And the family saying this is character assassination.  I beg to differ.  People are wondering, what actually happened?  How did the cop and the kid encounter each other?  It was not a random encounter.  It was apparently answering a call about a robbery because the encounter happened 15 minutes later.  So this is very important information.  If we are going to get to the bottom of what happened, the context and history of this is extremely important. 

BREAM:  And it seems like there are now maybe conflicting statements from the police chief that this was related to the robbery, it wasn't related to the robbery.  They had some kind of dustup that was separate from that. But Nina, clearly this is far from settled. 

EASTON:  They created more confusion today.  Was this police responding to this robbery?  Was this police officer just dealing with this guy that was blocking traffic?  It's unclear what his motivation was. And I thought we saw more bungling by the local police today in terms of how to handle this.  I think Ron Johnson does deserve praise.  I think he has come in it's a breath of fresh air.  But the local law enforcement mostly has not done a good job of communicating how they have treated not the rioters but the peaceful protesters. 

BREAM:  The Attorney General, Eric Holder, reached out to the family, confirmed, you know, he and the president, there is a parallel federal investigation that will go on as well, Steve. 

HAYES: Well, I don't think that will be reassuring to many people.  It certainly isn't reassuring to me.  I agree Captain Ron Johnson has been a calming presence.  He has been helpful.  But the local police have got to get their stories together.  We need to have full transparency, not partial transparency.  You can't use the information in a way that's misleading in one way or another.  It was inevitable that this video was going to come out.  It's relevant.  It may be highly relevant.  So you had to put it out. But you can't allow people to infer from that that this was the cause. There is just too many conflicting stories. 

BREAM:  OK, now very briskly to get through all of your winners and loser, Steve? 

HAYES:  I can be very brisk.  The winner is the Alaska Republican Party Joe Miller candidate for Senate there yesterday said that he would back whoever the eventual nominee is.  There was some question as to whether he would.  He will.  I think that helps them in November.  The loser are the Yazidis. 
President Obama took a victory lap yesterday and we learned about another slaughter today. 

EASTON:  Winner is Hyundai Motors little car Kia because that was the choice of the Pope as he's started his, launched his tour of Korea.  They got a big publicity boost out of that.  The loser is former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell.  He and his wife, of course, are under corruption charges.  It's been quite a soap opera, and they tried for an acquittal today and they were turned down. 

BREAM:  Super quick.

KRAUTHAMMER:  I'll be just happy stuff, only a winner.  Vernon Jordan reappears in public view as the uber Democratic insider hosting the hug-a-thon between the great two dynasties Obama and Clinton.

PERINO: Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel made an alarming announcement about the terror threats posed by ISIS.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CHUCK HAGEL, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The Iraqi people, the government of Iraq, the country of Iraq, is now under threat from some of the most brutal, barbaric forces we've ever seen in the world today. It's a force in a dimension that the world has never seen before.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: While President Obama has said that he will not allow a caliphate to be established in Iraq and Syria, can we with confidence say that current operations are all that's needed to beat back the threat? That's in question.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JONAH GOLDBERG, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"" ONLINE: You need a truly global strategy but how are you going to deal with something like this. The Pentagon is saying this is going to take 10 or 20 years to deal with ISIS alone. Why aren't we arming the Kurds in Syria? Why aren't we bombing ISIS in Syria? Why aren't we actually trying to get rid of ISIS? Instead, we're doing all of this cosmetic stuff that may get us through the news cycle, but it isn't going to solve the problem.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: The White House said troops that go to Iraq will not engage in combat. And I think one asks the question if it's smart to limit our response that way. Let's listen to this montage.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: American forces will not be returning combat in Iraq.

JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president has made clear American military action in Iraq would not include combat boots on the ground.

BEN RHODES, DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: I think the key point here is that the U.S. forces, the role of U.S. forces is not one of re- entering combat on the ground.

(END VIDEO CLIPS)

PERINO: Greg, we're talking about this a little bit earlier. I want to get your take on it. Why would we as the United States, if the threat is so large as Chuck Hagel was saying from the Pentagon, if it's so big, why would we limit our troops in any way when they are there to fight the terrorist?

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I mean, I suppose if we can blame ISIS for global warming then President Obama might take it seriously, but he's continually telling our enemies to keep going. But even -- even if it's true, we're not going to put troops down there, you don't tell them that.

This philosophy -- my sense is the great strength that America has is our military is perceived as a detriment by our president. It's a flaw. And that has -- that has been, I guess cultivated in his life as an academic, as a progressive, that the greatest thing we create happens to be the thing that the world hates us for.

He's like a little man scared of his own big dog. His distrust of our greatest asset is helping to create a terrorist state. It's frustrating.

Here you have Hagel -- Chuck Hagel contradicting what President Obama says. I mean this administration changes their tune more than a jukebox. I can't keep up with what they believe in.

PERINO: Well, somebody that just left the administration, Eric, is General Michael Flynn. He was heading up the Defense Intelligence Agency from June of 2012 until just recently. He did an interview with ""Breaking Defense,"" which is a trade publication, and he basically criticizes the approach for -- the terrorism fighting approach and he said that we knew that decapitating leadership is not a good strategy. He says decapitation alone was a failed strategy because even if you take out leadership, they keep growing. He says this over a career.

I go back to that point that the 9/11 Commission made. It's the first time in a decade they had done a report. And they said that we are more complacent, we are now at a point where we are more complacent than we were before 9/11.

Do you think that the response is proportionate to the threat that's being described outside of the White House?

ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Well, I don't think there is a response yet. I think the 130 advisors that he sent there on the mountain right now aren't going to be the final response from the White House. I would think that wasn't the case.

That said, can we just talk a second -- look, can I point something out about Chuck Hagel. He's at the Pentagon in a polo shirt?

PERINO: He's at Camp Pendleton.

BOLLING: OK. He's at Camp Pendleton, a little bit better. Sorry about that.

But still, he was a little low key on this. If you want to stir up people and change the debate away from President Obama calling them the jayvee, and talk about what ISIS really is, which is blood-thirsty terrorist murderers, then get a little bit animated about that, in my opinion.

Let's just talk for a second whether or not we should put boots on the ground. There's one thing we definitely should do. There's no one who is going to dispute. There are up to 30,000 Yazidis still on that mountain. They are starving, they are dying.

There are reports, credible reports of friends of ours at Sky News reporting that parents are cutting themselves so their children can drink the blood because they are dying of thirst. They are literally dying of thirst.

So, what we need to do first and foremost worry about the military options later. Right now, we're humanitarians, get it there now. Get some C-130s, drop a bunch of food and water and medicine to those people right now, and we'll work out the rest of it in the best way possible. But first things first.

PERINO: That's an interesting point.

Bob, I read a story earlier today about a Yazidi woman who was rescued, and they said, how did she survive? She had a baby. Her milk had run dry and she coaxed a goat to allow the baby to suckle.

And I wonder about the propaganda war that ISIS is being so brutal and using social media to show severed heads, that this is how they fight. And we're trying to be humanitarian.

Is there anyway or what do you think the United States should be doing to try to counterbalance what is not just the physical aspect of fighting terrorism but the psychological one as well?

BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: I think it's begun already. I mean, even some of the Muslim countries are beginning to speak out against these guys. They are obviously afraid of them but they are speaking out against them.

I don't think they are nearly the kind of organized force that al Qaeda was. I don't believe for a second they pose a threat to the United States directly.

I think we can do what we did in Balkans over two wars, which was we did it by air power and we beat them. We beat the Serbs who were equal -- I don't want to say they're equally as nasty, but they're pretty tough guys.

I think the idea of us doing -- this guy that was cosmetic for a news cycle taking out artillery batteries is not cosmetic, my boy.

PERINO: Well, the Pentagon itself said that what they are doing now will not have an impact.

BECKEL: No, no, but they have to increase it. They have to expand it.

But let's keep in mind, again, you have to have a military in Iraq who is going to be there willing to fight and they don't have it yet.

PERINO: But in the meantime -- so, Kimberly, some of these ISIS fighters that were trained in Syria have western passports. How concerned do you think we should be when, I think that's the point Greg made. You have the Pentagon, you have the defense intelligence chief, other intelligence officials saying how dire the threat is and that the White House saying it's jayvee. I tend to believe that the White House actually might understand how big the threat is, but I don't understand their reluctance to just calling it what it is.

KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: I think they're playing it dumb because it looks like, once again, they have egg on their face -- that they misjudged and miscalculated and hoping this storm would pass after the midterm elections, and they wouldn't be in a position of compromise, that there they sit, and now, they have to own it.

While the death of Osama bin Laden was cathartic, it was only the beginning of a new chapter on terrorism. That's what General Flynn and others are trying to get this administration to understand and to wake up, that this fight is now, that it is real, that it cannot be postponed, that we are otherwise derelict in our duties to this country, because -- Bob, I disagree with you.

This is a much more serious threat than al Qaeda ever was. I'm going to listen to the experts that know and have the benefit of intelligence.

BECKEL: Well, there are a lot of experts who say the opposite. But we just finished playing the longest war in our history. You want to keep it going for 20 more years?

GUILFOYLE: You know what? You don't give up. They're not giving up.

PERINO: The enemy doesn't give up.

GUILFOYLE: This is their sustenance. This is what pumps through their blood every day. They will not stop until they see the destruction of the United States and the Western way of life.

BECKEL: The reason Osama bin Laden did well because we did terribly. We didn't have --

(CROSSTALK)

PERINO: We walked away.

GUTFELD: But these two angles are correct. The philosophy which I think is part of the White House philosophy is you don't exaggerate the power of ghouls by paying attention to them because that makes them seem larger than they really are. However, you don't have to romanticize the horrors of these degenerates. You can still kill roaches without thinking how great they are.

The problem with this administration in the last six years or so, obsessed with internal problems within our borders so the external threats have been ignored for so long. In Obama's eyes, a pro-life Tea Partier is more of a threat than an imam with hooks for hands, because that's what he believes. He believes in hope and change within our borders. Therefore, externally, these things are allowed to fester and grow, until you see the -- what's going on in the hills.

BOLLING: You know what's an interesting compromise. A lot of people say let's not get involved in another ten-year war, but there are other ways of doing it. There are other ways of pushing back ISIS without the United States actually putting up 50,000, 60,000 troops on the ground.

You can support the Kurd, there's 100,000 Kurd troops you can support. You can go back and retrain or -- I don't know, refocus the Iraqi army. What? It's 200,000 Iraqi armies.

PERINO: They have to have confidence that we're going to be there.

BOLLING: Just hear me out for one second. So, there's 300,000 people in place in position trained --

BECKEL: Against 5,000.

BOLLING: That's 10,000, that with the right focus hopefully lend them a hand, give them the assistance they need, give them the money, the aid and the military might that they need. Let them fight it. Let them do it. Then, you're not the infidel killing fellow Muslims.

GUILFOYLE: Guess what? Cockroaches expect to be killed. OK? They know they are nasty.

And when you don't kill them, they are a little confused, and they excited, and they populate and breed more cockroaches. Snuff them out while you have a chance. Otherwise, you're going to live in regret in the future. We had the opportunity to do it, like we did to arm the Kurds and we didn't. Then, they have to come again begging for us while they're getting killed and genocide is happening on the mountain.

We know better. We know better.

(CROSSTALK)

BECKEL: This is not Gaza. It's not a place where Hamas can hide in the school buildings. You got ISIS, I think we do need to increase our bombing of them and we do need to increase probably special forces, but there's no reason for us nor is there a possibility of us going back in and putting a whole lot of soldiers on the ground and starting over. The Iraqi army --

(CROSSTALK)

PERINO: We could be beaten by a straw man army. Our will is being beaten by a straw man. No one is going to put 100,000 troops on the ground. No one is talking about that.

BECKEL: I know that. But why don't -- why are we sitting back here and not blaming the Iraqi army that we've trained?

PERINO: You know what? Because we don't have a luxury of doing that when you have 20,000 -- up to 20,000 foreign fighters with Western passports train by Assad's fighters that have become -- I didn't say it, Chuck Hagel said this is a force and dimension that the world has never seen before and it actually does have a direct impact on us.

GUILFOYLE: Right. So, now, do you believe it since it's coming from him?

GUTFELD: Imagine working for the Defense Department under President Obama. It's the least attractive priority in governance for him. It's like running the tofu stand at the county fair. No one is coming to you. You're alone.

So, what should -- I mean, he should be running really a PC and not a country. He has the soul of an IT worker. And that's why you -- his ambivalence energizes these guys.

When these guys, 10,000, 5,000, whatever, they have the will. We don't have the will because we telegraphed it. We should take them out.

BECKEL: They have the will, but 300,000 Iraqis and Kurds don't?

GUTFELD: We left too soon. We should have been training them.

GUILFOYLE: What did Dana say? It's about the psychological momentum, too. Let them know when they see those bombs coming down, that we are actually behind them, that we have their back, that we have their (INAUDIBLE). Without that they might feel defeated.

BOLLING: I'll give you another option. You know how the Iranians want us to green light all their stupid nuclear ambitions with power and whatnot. You want the green light on that.

You come down -- you come down -- this is -- you want to talk about ISIS really getting a signal. If the Iranians said ISIS enough, that's it, you're done here. That would be the --

PERINO: The Iranians then -- I mean, that could happen, right, because they support Abadi to do well because they want more of a bargaining chip with the United States at the table and they might get it because that's the way this all turning out.

(CROSSTALK)

BOLLING: Well, that's a good deal. Wouldn't that be a good deal?

PERINO: I don't think a deal with Iran, no.

GUTFELD: I still say, blame ISIS for global warming and you will get the EPA, yes. The celebrities will be out. They'll be out marching.

(CROSSTALK)

GUTFELD: Yoko Ono -- Yoko Ono will lead the charge against ISIS.

PERINO: All right.

GUTFELD: It's true.

PERINO: Coming up on -- that is a visual.

GUTFELD: It really is.

PERINO: Yoko Ono leading the charge against ISIS. FIVE fan Photoshop, work on that.

Coming up on ""The Five,"" something much scarier than Shark Week, a threat greater to us all than what swims in the ocean. Greg will have us on our toes, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GUTFELD: Shark Week is here. You can thank ""Jaws"" for that. That flick, shark attack is common when really they are quite rare. But humans prefer their fears to be tangible, which is large threats are avoided.

Let's change that. Instead of Shark Week, why not --

(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)

GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.

GUTFELD: After all, sharks may be scary but they won't end civilization. Sharks might want your foot, radical Islam wants your head on a stick.

So, here's the schedule. Monday let's begin with al Shabaab, a nasty bunch who slaughtered 67 in a Kenyan mall. And it wasn't because the Nike store ran out of shoes. It was because w ran from Allah.

Tuesday, we got Jemaah Islamiyah, Indonesian scum behind many bombings including a 2002 attack that killed 202 people. Their weapon of choice: potassium chloride and religion.

Wednesday, we got Boko Haram, killing hundreds in Nigeria and enslaving girls. Their weapons of choice were bullets, fear and YouTube.

Thursday, remember al Qaeda? The godfathers of gore, they knocked down the World Trade Center, bombed London and Madrid. Choice of weapons: planes, trains and automobiles.

And it's casualty Friday. Lashkar-e-Taiba unleashed the 2008 Mumbai attacks, killed 164 people with both bombings and shootings. They were truly varsity never jayvee.

Finally, it's ISIS Saturday. No one saw them coming. Well, except for everyone. Intent on a caliphate they are called the jayvee squad, but tell that to the headless.

Now, I've left out the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Hezbollah. I figured six days is enough.

Oddly, there seems to be a really persistent thread that runs through all these terrors. Maybe they saw ""Jaws."" Say anything otherwise and that would be Islamophobic.

PERINO: Fantastic.

GUTFELD: Eric, remember when all we had to worry about were the Russians?

GUILFOYLE: My gosh.

PERINO: We forgot about the Russians.

GUTFELD: Remember, I want the Cold War.

GUILFOYLE: Putin is going to be mad at you.

BOLLING: Scarier and scarier. Yes, you're 100 percent right. You forgot Sunday. Sunday is a day of rest.

GUTFELD: I did. For us, it was.

BOLLING: There's so many others you can plug in on Sunday.

Look, you're 100 percent right. It's spreading. A caliphate -- I'm not sure it's caliphate, but it's spreading. Is it any worse than it was 20 or 30 years ago? I'm not sure. It's been bad for a long time. They've been fighting for 3,000 years.

GUTFELD: Yes. You know what's great? But now, they have technology. See, they are against technology.

Yes, they are against technology but now they use planes. They want to go back to the sixth, seventh century but they use planes to kill us.

BOLLING: But my point is, technology, are we seeing it more of it? Because it's YouTube and it's our cell phones. Are we seeing it more? It's like that old thing. Is crime going up or are we just seeing -- is violent crime going up? Or are we just seeing more? I'm not sure.

PERINO: I think the attacks are more catastrophic and also the potential for them to get their hands, one of those terrorist groups get their hands on a biological or nuclear weapon is so great that I think what you just laid, though, is that we are in the middle of World War III. We just don't call it that yet.

GUTFELD: Yes.

PERINO: But that -- and I -- I think the only way for us to win is to be better, smarter and stronger and not just militarily but economically as well.

GUTFELD: K.G., do you believe we should have a terror week and would you host it?

GUILFOYLE: I would gladly host it. I would welcome the opportunity.

BOLLING: With Bob.

GUILFOYLE: Bob and I, there will be a midnight kiss when we defeat terror completely.

But you know it's a bad situation when even the pope was calling for their head.

GUTFELD: I know.

GUILFOYLE: The pope was like, forget the New Testament, we're going Old Testament against terror. That's when I know we're on the right side.

I mean, really, he's coming out against it. This is something that needs to have attention. We were behind the ball already. So, let's get out in front of it. I think it's very clear and very obvious the choices.

GUTFELD: Bob, Kimberly raises the good point -- the Vatican demand his Muslim counterparts to condemn these Islamic states or they're going to lose credibility. Do you think they will listen?

BECKEL: Well, I would hope they listen some, but it took the Vatican a long time to get to that specific statement. But once again the Muslims are not paying attention to it because they are afraid of it.

Now, do I think it's World War III? No. Do I think we vastly overrate these thugs? Yes.

Do I think they can pull off again a 9/11 the way they did before? The answer is I don't think they can pull it off.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, you do think.

(AUDIO GAP)

BECKEL: Look like idiots from a psychiatric institute.

PERINO: Better.

BECKEL: What?

PERINO: Terrorists.

BECKEL: What are you talking about?

(LAUGHTER)

GUTFELD: This is the best. Speaking of Muslim leaders speaking up about terror, Hannity had a man on and was asking him about the existence of terror.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS: Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, the Muslim Brotherhood, al Qaeda, ISIL, Islamic Jihad, you agree with me they are all terror groups, right?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know these groups.

HANNITY: You don't know anything about those groups? Is al Qaeda a terror group?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know al Qaeda.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUTFELD: All right. Well, here's --

PERINO: You don't know al Qaeda.

GUTFELD: Thinking of al Qaeda, I was thinking about this, you know, when we were told that al Qaeda -- was it really just overrun by its competitors? It seems like it was less important as these feigns --

PERINO: That's what -- well, I'm going to mention General Michael Flynn who just left the Defense Intelligence Agency, that's what he was saying, is that he'd been involved in the counterterrorism efforts from our government for a long time, and that decapitating works for a while.

And they celebrate death, right? They get to heaven through killing Westerners, Western civilization. They hate our way of life. So, they are not going to stop.

I think the only way for us to fight them is for to be more determined, right? Because we fight to live, that is why we're fighting for a better way of life.

BOLLING: Do we -- look, I don't want to open up a can of worms here but do we fight them on all the fronts? You went through six different groups and left three for another day. I mean all of those groups -- I don't think we have --

GUTFELD: I think we have to get them before they get here.

(CROSSTALK)

PERINO: A lot of it is financial, cutting off their money.

BOLLING: I love that idea.

GUILFOYLE: There's a way to do it. Smart, I'm telling you.

BOLLING: One quick though, the way to do it. There's one common denominator and it's not anything about Muslim or Islam, or anything like that. Common denominator is Iran. Iran funds a good percentage --

GUILFOYLE: Yes, but you got to cut off the money.

BOLLING: Agreed.

GUILFOYLE: There you go.

BECKEL: Terrorism has been around a long time. You forget the Puerto Ricans shot up the House of Representatives in 1951. There's been terrorism for a long time.

GUILFOYLE: What are you talking about the Puerto Ricans now?

BECKEL: The Puerto Ricans, yes, they did.

There was a Puerto Rican terrorist group that shot up the House of Representatives. Go to your history. Read it. You'll see it.

GUTFELD: All right.

GUILFOYLE: I understand. I'm aware of the history. Why did you jump on the Puerto Ricans?

BECKEL: Because I'm talking about terrorism being around a long time. You could cower ourselves, into keeping, locking all of our government doors, putting up jersey barricades everywhere, and we're overestimating this, and we're overestimating our ability, finally, to intercept these people.

You think somebody with a Muslim name, is a young guy is going to get through any airport in America? Absolutely not. They didn't in the 19 --

GUILFOYLE: Well, they just have one this weekend.

GUTFELD: Next on ""The Five,"" a joint practice between the Cowboys and Raiders turns ugly. A fan gets caught in the chaos after a brawl broke out on the field. Details ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BOLLING: Going back to the fastest seven minutes in news. We have a hot block today. Three fiery stories, seven feverish minutes, one febrile host.

First up, this video is awesome. Check it out for some dumb reason the Dallas Cowboys and Oakland Raiders held a joint practice yesterday in Oxnard, California, where gangs live. Police were present just in case the gang-bangers got out of control.

But it wasn't the gangs that the cops should have been concerned about. Behold, boys being boys.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

(EXPLETIVES DELETED)

(INAUDIBLE)

GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.

BOLLING: OK. Well, you start it. Go ahead.

GUILFOYLE: I mean, this is no surprise to me. I grew up knowing one thing: don't date an Oakland Raider. They are the bad boys of the NFL. No good can come of it. This is what happens.

They always draw the most penalties the whole deal. I'm not -- I mean, there's two sides to everything, but no surprise.

BOLLING: So, no Raider nation for you.

GUILFOYLE: No, baby, forever.

BOLLING: Bobby?

BECKEL: They are a bunch of beefs and they're acting like a bunch of idiots.

GUILFOYLE: Are you bleeping yourself, self-bleeping?

BECKEL: Yes, I am. Of course, let someone start doing that.

(CROSSTALK)

BECKEL: I got (INAUDIBLE) politically correct, I think that's wonderful footage to run because they are all idiots.

BOLLING: OK. Dana -- Dana, go ahead.

PERINO: I wrote -- well, the thing is I don't want to copy you, because I wrote down boys will be boys. I was thinking about how from February to now, there was no football really and so --

BOLLING: So sad.

PERINO: I kind of miss the ball when it goes away, but now I'm like, oh, here it comes again.

GUILFOYLE: Oh, really?

PERINO: Yes, because that means the days are going to get shorter, and then it's going to be cold.

GUILFOYLE: I know, but a good idea for Sunday nights, your crock pot.

BOLLING: What if we did -- I don't know, we did a practice show with someone from MSNBC. I don't know. Wouldn't we end up in a big brawl like that?

GUTFELD: Yes. But is it necessary to brawl during a football game? It's like snacking during dinner. I mean, you don't need it.

BECKEL: Practice.

GUTFELD: But by the way, I have to argue with you on the Raiders.

GUILFOYLE: You do?

GUTFELD: 1976, Stabler, Casper, Biletnikoff, Hendricks, Matuszak, Tatum, Upshaw, Art Shell...

GUILFOYLE: Oh, I remember Matuszak.

GUTFELD: ... Cliff Branch.

BOLLING: I know.

GUTFELD: Mark van Eeghen. Mark van Eeghen. The greatest Super Bowl team ever.

GUILFOYLE: No, he hasn't...

GUTFELD: I loved it.

BECKEL: Bleeping idiots in all football.

BOLLING: Let's move on to our next up. Jimmy Fallon is crushing it at late night.

GUILFOYLE: Forty-Niners.

BOLLING: Check out Fallon making some very poignant and accurate observation about the similarities and differences between Hillary Clinton and President Obama. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JIMMY FALLON, HOST, NBC'S ""THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JIMMY FALLON"": Next up it's height. For Hillary it's 5'7."" For Obama it's 2009. After that there's biggest inspiration. Hillary's is John F. Kennedy. Obama's is that guy in the Corona commercial who gets an important call and throws the phone into the ocean.

And finally, we have personal motto. Hillary Clinton's is ""2016 Can't get here fast enough."" Obama's is ""Ditto.""

So I guess they're not that different after all.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

PERINO: Still, it's kind. Still...

GUILFOYLE: That was, like, not even mean.

The sad thing is we flock to these bits like geese after stale bread crumbs. Because it's so rare. We know once that once there's a Republican in the picture for 2016, all sniping at the Democrats will cease, and the wagons will circle. And nobody ever gets hurt.

BOLLING: Isn't there a lot of comic material with Hillary Clinton between Bill and all the things...

GUTFELD: Whoever comes up against her will get it.

BOLLING: Yes, yes, go.

BECKEL: I was going to say, there's so much comic material surrounding Republicans. I mean you couldn't miss...

BASH: It writes itself.

GUTFELD: Yes, and because the Democrats are so perfect.

BECKEL: Well, they're pretty -- Compared to those idiots.

GUTFELD: Compared to Obama. The most incompetent president.

BECKEL: Oh, come on.

GUTFELD: Yes. Incompetent.

GUILFOYLE: That was so nice. I'm with Dana. That's totally nice. I don't know.

BECKEL: Yours.

GUTFELD: Lincoln was a great president.

GUILFOYLE: And you like Jimmy Fallon. I still love Jay Leno and Jimmy Kimmel.

BOLLING: So Do you think he's cutting Democrats slack?

GUILFOYLE: Still.

BOLLING: All right. How about this one? Robin Williams' death left a big gaping hole in the hearts of many. Check out how late night comedians handled the loss of one of the most talented men to ever walk the earth.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SETH MYERS, HOST, NBC'S ""THE LATE SHOW WITH SETH MYERS"": We just want to say that we miss Robin. We're also very lucky to have had -- had him at all.

FALLON: We like all of you were shaken up a bit last night. Genius comedian and actor Robin Williams passed away. And you watched him, and you would cry laughing. He was like the Mohamed Ali of comedy.

CONAN O'BRIEN, HOST, TBS'S ""CONAN"": Five years ago I went through publicly kind of a bump in the road. Out of the blue, Robin Williams buys me a bicycle. He's the first person to buy me a bicycle since my parents bought me a bicycle. And so often I would just look at that silly bike and think what a wonderful spirit.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: So Bobby, here's the question. There was a lot of coverage of Robin Williams when he passed. There was a lot of coverage the following day. There's a smattering of coverage today. Are our attention spans so short that, as of tomorrow, no one's going to cover Robin Williams?

BECKEL: I think it's going to run a little longer. Look, in the midst of all that we're putting up with in this world today, this is the guy that brought laughter, you know? Laughter is such an incredibly smooth -- it's the one thing we need more of.

And he -- the sad part of it is to know that behind that laughter there was a -- somebody who was very, very sad and depressed. But I think this -- I tell you, like I said yesterday, Princess Diana, John Lennon, Robin Williams, they all deserve that much -- those are the three big ones.

GUTFELD: Dom DeLuise.

BECKEL: Well, I'm not sure about that.

BOLLING: Kimberly.

GUILFOYLE: Yes.

BOLLING: Let me ask you. A lot of the debate back and forth going today was whether or not he killed himself because of money problems. I mean...

GUILFOYLE: I don't believe that for a minute. I don't believe that for a minute. And I don't think anybody in his family or anyone who knew him well would believe that. This is a man who was rich because he had tremendous generosity of spirit and humor, and he went out of his way to make people feel better about themselves, no matter what kind of day they were having.

He was incredibly supportive to many charities. I worked on a number of them with him. You know, I thought he was great. I mean, to meet him was to just truly be inspired by someone who was always giving back.

BOLLING: Thoughts on...

GUTFELD: Well, I mean, he is the pope for comedians. You know, he's the guy that shows up. When he shows up everybody just stops, and he's very friendly, so it's no wonder. It's devastating to those people who influenced him. Just have to be careful about extravagant tributes, because...

GUILFOYLE: Why?

GUTFELD: ... people fantasize about such responses in their own lives, and, you know, that's...

BOLLING: Copy cats?

GUTFELD: Yes.

GUILFOYLE: I feel bad for his children.

BOLLING: Anybody in the wings that could take -- fill his shoes, partially, at least?

GUTFELD: No. He was pretty -- he was one-of-a-kind.

BOLLING: OK.

PERINO: I liked the story that Conan O'Brien told. And I think it is a good reminder that, you know, you can pass on the suicide hotline number and all sorts of other things. But that one story about just a random act of kindness when somebody is down, like to do something really nice for them. That's something we should all keep in mind once in a while.

BOLLING: Even in a kind act, he was wildly creative. Right?

PERINO: Yes.

BOLLING: A bicycle. Who would think to give someone a bicycle?

All right. Ahead Dr. Ben Carson warns looters in Missouri to be careful about jumping to conclusions about the police before they know all the facts. You're going to hear from the doctor next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GUILFOYLE: Another night of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, after a black teen was shot and killed during a confrontation with a cop on Saturday. Police are asking protestors to peacefully rally only during the day to ensure everyone's safety.

The identity of the officer who shot 18-year-old Michael Brown is still not being released, and Ben Carson is cautioning rioters not to rush to judgment before all the facts are out.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BEN CARSON: How can you possibly even understand how these parents feel? But at the same time, we also need to recognize that police are individuals, too. They have feelings also. And we need to hear from this police officer. We need to understand why did he decide to shoot to kill instead of shoot to stop?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUILFOYLE: That's what an investigation is for. Whenever you're an officer involved in a shooting like this, they do what's called an officer involved shooting investigation. They'll do -- put together a murder book, find out whether or not any charges should be filed.

And that's the job of the investigators to do this and determine whether or not it was a valid shooting meaning accidental and not some kind of manslaughter, homicide, et cetera.

BOLLING: Yes, and a couple of the facts surrounding going what's going on now.

There was a group that leaked the name and phone number and address of the -- the chief of police of Ferguson, Missouri. His family is all nervous now. They're getting death threats, as well.

So really, honestly Dr. Carson is right. Let's just wait and see what happens. If there's something wrong that happened then prosecute. I think Eric Holder has announced that he's going to take a look into it, as well. So, we'll get the facts.

But in the meantime looting and rioting is just absolutely plainly stupid and shouldn't be done.

PERINO: This is just so far out of my experience and expertise that all I know what to do is trust the authorities, whether that be at the justice department and the attorney general and also the police officers. I agree that no one wants an escalation, but I just have to believe that the police officers are trying to handle the situation as appropriately as possible right now.

GUILFOYLE: All right. Greg?

GUTFELD: In matters of race you can always count on the media to make it worse. And every talking head that's asked to be on a show has to come up with a position or else they won't be on TV shows.

And so the culprits are all of this is the ""us versus them"" machine, as if every issue is mandated by law to have two sides when there might be five; there might be ten different sides.

Why do I have to pick a side? Why do I have to say that I'm pro- police. Why do I have to say I'm with -- I'm with the protesters? Why can't I say, ""We need calm and justice."" That's all you have to say.

This is the reason why we saw so much crap with the Trayvon Martin stuff because people need to fill the buckets of news with information, and it gins up more outrage when, in fact, you can just say why does it have to be them versus them? Why can't we just say we want the same thing?

GUILFOYLE: What about that, Bob?

BECKEL: I find it amazing the name of this policeman hasn't leaked. That's incredible to me. Four days this has gone on.

The other thing I think we ought to underscore here is the people who are protesting, and rightfully so, I mean, there's been a history of this, and the guy may be just fine. I wish he would speak out.

But the fact is that the number of looters are very small compared to the community at large, and yet the number of camera people are with the looters and not with the peaceful protesters which is too bad.

GUILFOYLE; You feel that maybe perhaps they are fueling the situation and the unrest?

BECKEL: Sure. I mean, I think they're feeding into a stereotype of a poor black neighborhood where everybody goes in whenever there's an opportunity and rouse people. Yes, there are people who do that. People in the white community would do that.

The problem is, they're not taking into account right down the street from where the drivers (ph) were taking place, there were thousands of people gathering in a memorial for this kid. And yet, they took the cameras down where they broke into stores.

GUTFELD: Tonight I have a question for you. Kimberly, because you're smarter than me.

GUILFOYLE: I know you're looking at the same gear in the city streets that you would normally see on patrol in Afghanistan. You see -- there used to be just one SWAT Team. Everybody looks like they're -- it's SWAT. And they're wearing camouflage in the city.

Is there a theory behind this, in the sense that, if you look intimidating, the conflict will be resolved without actual conflict? Because that's the only thing I'm thinking. Now, if you see something that scary you stop.

GUILFOYLE: But it's also special protection for the officers. It's their riot gear. And I think it does have beyond the tactical effect; it has the psychological effect. So they're being well-equipped. They have to protect themselves with extra body gear.

GUTFELD: Right. Body armor makes sense.

GUILFOYLE: Because in a situation like this you're kind of out in the open. You're exposed. You're not necessarily in your vehicle, which provides a layer of protection. So you can get somebody to come at you behind all angles. You're quite vulnerable in the field in that sense, that they have a responsibility to make sure their officers are safe.

BAIER: I told you she would have the answer.

PERINO: Great question.

GUILFOYLE; Up next, does ""The Five"" know how to flirt? You're about to find out. How's that for a tease?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BECKEL: Trouble. Now, a new study out about flirting, and apparently there's some misconceptions about flirting, that you don't necessarily have to be the best looking man or woman to be successful or score.

And in my case, I like to consider myself a ladies man, but I'm not exactly what you'd call the most handsome guy in the world. But I do score on occasion.

Now, I'm going to turn to the biggest flirt...

GUILFOYLE: Wait a minute.

BECKEL: I want to turn to the biggest flirt on ""The Five"" and ask what your best flirtatious moves are -- Dana.

PERINO: If you went to Kimberly, I was going to be very offended. Although I did write, ""Ask K.G. She's the expert."" She is. You're the best flirter I know.

GUILFOYLE: Thank you so much.

BECKEL: Yes but...

(CROSSTALK)

GUILFOYLE: No, it's not.

PERINO: Is Bob a flirt? Am I a flirt? What is the question?

BOLLING: No. What's your best flirting move.

PERINO: oh, I don't really have -- no.

BECKEL: All right. Greg? You remember when you flirted last?

GUTFELD: No, you know what? This study is bogus. Because if ikimf flirting as a variable remains constant, then looks will always win. Physical beauty signals unavailability, basically saying, ""I'm out of your league."" Flirtation says you've got a chance. Has nothing to do with attraction but availability.

PERINO: Whoa.

GUTFELD: So, if you make -- if you make flirting constant, like to Kimberly, who -- if both me and George Clooney were flirting with you, you would choose Clooney. So flirting means nothing.

PERINO: You gave this a lot of thought.

GUILFOYLE: That's interesting.

BECKEL: Yes. Who would you pick?

GUILFOYLE: Who would I pick?

BECKEL: Yes.

GUILFOYLE: You mean Clooney or Gutfeld?

GUTFELD: Come on. Rosemary Clooney.

GUILFOYLE: Is this, like, mean-spirited day?

BECKEL: You're talking about flirting. You said it sounded like I was giving you a hard time. You're the one that asked me in the break about the...

GUTFELD: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

GUILFOYLE: No, Bob.

GUTFELD: Bob, remember when you said to us...

GUILFOYLE: Hover over the button.

GUTFELD: ... please touch you off before you get into trouble? We're doing it.

BECKEL: Is that what it was?

GUILFOYLE: Yes. No.

BECKEL: It was a money something.

It also says in this study.

GUILFOYLE: I'm going to purify your mind for a second. Hard to do, but I think it's in the eyes.

BECKEL: I see. Right.

PERINO: Flirting is in the eyes?

BECKEL: They say that...

GUILFOYLE: In the eyes and a little swagger when you leave the room.

BECKEL: ... a woman who is not so good looking. She walks away and doesn't pay any attention to you. Now Eric, this happened to you years ago before you got whipped.

BOLLING: It's been a while.

BECKEL: But do you remember it was not necessarily the best looking girl. If you saw a woman who was, like, an eight but she was available, sending out signals she was available...

BOLLING: Can I go the other way?

GUTFELD: Yes, please do.

BOLLING: Like -- no, no, no. Like...

PERINO: What did you say, Mom?

BOLLING: As I recall my wife, I saw her across -- she wasn't my wife. I'd never met her before, and I saw her across the room. Some guy was hitting on her. He was flirting, you know, full force. And I walked by and I heard, like, the worst pick-up line ever. And I just waited for, like, the opportunity. He turned away or he ordered a drink someplace, and I said, ""Is that line going to work with you?"" And that was it. And that's where it happened.

GUILFOYLE: But you're kind of out alpha male.

PERINO: I did flirt on the airplane when I met Peter.

GUILFOYLE: You did, Dana.

BECKEL: You did? What happened on that? Who flirted first?

PERINO: Well, he asked me if he could put my bag up above in a British accent. British accent is the No. 1 thing that women, American women like. But then I didn't let him put my bag up above, because my feet don't reach the floor of the airplane. And I like it there so I can use as a foot rest.

BECKEL: Did you tell him that?

PERINO: Later.

BECKEL: Oh, I see.

PERINO: Years later.

BECKEL: Greg, tell us about how you flirted with your wife the first time?

GUTFELD: I actually -- I don't think I did. Just -- because we just -- we were at a conference together.

PERINO: She's Russian. She doesn't have to flirt.

GUTFELD: I just stared at her for three days. And then I got drunk, and I went up to her and I told her she was hot. And she said, ""I would have expected more from you.""

GUILFOYLE: She still says that.

GUTFELD: Yes, every day.

BECKEL: Well, how do you know when a woman is attracted to you?

GUTFELD: When she's not pressing charges.

BECKEL: I won't do that because it gets me beat (ph)...

GUILFOYLE: What?

BOLLING: When she's not pressing charges.

GUILFOYLE: Dana, give it up. That was amazing. I love it.

BECKEL: There's only been a very few of those, by the way. The only time a woman flirted with me is when she divorced me.

OK. ""One More Thing is up next. If you take multiple medications, a dry mouth can be a common side effect.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" And we're going to start with Greg.

GUTFELD: All right. It's time for...

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GUTFELD: Greg's secrets to happiness.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUTFELD: So, you know, let's roll this tape here.

GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.

GUTFELD: When you have idle hands it leads to nothing but destruction, self-destruction, looting, terrible things. However, one of the key solutions is sports and recreation. I have it on good authority that this goat, if he wasn't playing soccer, would have knocked over a liquor store. Instead, he got himself involved in school sports, learned a trade and now is married and has three children and runs his own aerobic...

PERINO: You think he does? He does have three children.

GUTFELD: Three kids.

PERINO: Three kids!

GUTFELD: Well done, little one.

GUILFOYLE: Oh, you know, you're such a kidder.

GUTFELD: Anyway, there's a lesson in that. OK. I think that we'll figure out what that lesson is after the show.

GUTFELD: It was cute stuff.

PERINO: K.G. is next.

GUILFOYLE: OK. I have a good one. And it doesn't involve the royals, although American royalty, Madonna. So all 16 of the icons that were named dropped in Madonna's ""Vogue"" are now gone with the passing of Lauren Bacall, who was the last one on the list mentioned who just passed away.

PERINO: Yes, she was beautiful. Gorgeous woman -- Eric.

BOLLING: OK, so my original ""One More Thing"" got bumped for whatever reason. But I'm going to do this. This morning I was on ""FOX & Friends"" and there was a 13-year-old girl who is only the 17th female to enter the Little League World Series, I'm sorry, in 70 years of that championship.

Her name is Mornet (ph) Davis. She throws a 70 mile-an-hour fast ball and a bunch of curveballs, and she challenged me that if they win she was going to pitch me and see if I could hit against her.

GUILFOYLE: Do you have -- are you nervous?

BOLLING: We don't have a picture of this. You know what? I'm going to -- I'm going to point to center-field and hit one out. What do you think?

GUILFOYLE: I know what you're going to do. You're going to go to the batting cages.

BOLLING: Yes, I am.

BECKEL: I will give you $500.

BOLLING: To strike me out?

BECKEL: I'll throw 500 on top of that.

PERINO: Anybody else in? Anybody else in? OK.

GUTFELD: Ten bucks.

PERINO: All right. Bob, you're next.

BECKEL: The -- well, first of all, my ""One More Thing"" was also taken away but had to do with pictures. Sara Moynihan -- I think I pronounced that right. Moynihan, who is a young lady who got a double heart lung transplant where the government said you couldn't do it because it was adult lungs. She got it finally, and she blew out the candles recently on her 12th birthday. Congratulations.

BOLLING: Amen. Amen.

GUILFOYLE: God bless her. That's a very great story. Great, Bob.

PERINO: OK. My ""One More thing"" got bumped, too, because Peter, my husband...

GUILFOYLE: What is going on here?

PERINO: If you scene me something that's so funny and cute for ""One More Thing"" it has to be real and not a hoax. OK? There's that.

So instead I'm going to to tell you about something else. If you go to One.org, one campaign which deals with HIV, poverty all around the world started by Bono, I got to be the curator for this month, talking about women and girls.

The U.S. had previously only been willing to allow the Iraqi government to get U.S. weapons and equipment, but the rapid advances of ISIS and weakness of Iraq's Prime Minister has led to a change of heart. Kurdish forces have retaken two cities that ISIS had taken over in Kurdish areas of Iraq. That's thanks to U.S. airstrikes which have given Kurdish peshmerga forces air cover. There was a fourth day of airstrikes Sunday, and President Obama says they will continue for a long time to come.

Democrats are not happy. They’re divided over the ongoing military intervention in Iraq, a dispute made more difficult by the fact that Americans increasingly see the U.S. as obliged to subdue the Islamist militants there. And on the home front, the party is tearing at itself over the unrest in Ferguson, Mo. where local and state Democratic leaders are dropping the hammer on {increasingly violent}<hyperlink=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/19/ferguson-protest-turns-tense-as-demonstrators-throw-bottles-at-police/> protests to the outrage of liberal activists. And what does the Democratic president say about all of this? Well, it’s complicated. President Obama, in Washington for a two-day vacation from his vacation, took essentially the same attitude to both current crises, saying that the individuals involved needed to work things out on their own and that the federal government would be judicious in its involvement. Got it. That equivocal attitude got Obama a broadside today in the {NYT}<hyperlink=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/us/aloof-obama-is-frustrating-his-own-party.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSumSmallMedia&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news> for being disengaged and aloof from his own party. That’s nothing new, especially coming from moderate Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. But what about Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid?

[The cabinet, ranked in scatological magnetism - According to Politico, President Obama {refers}<hyperlink=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-survivor-108018.html#ixzz3AqRxKxpj> to his confidante and point man on the Missouri unrest, Attorney General Eric Holder, as his administration’s designated “s***t magnet.”]

‘Reid seethed quietly’ - From NYT: “The meeting in the Oval Office in late June was called to give President Obama and the four top members of Congress a chance to discuss the unraveling situation in Iraq. But Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, wanted to press another point. With Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, sitting a few feet away, Mr. Reid complained that Senate Republicans were spitefully blocking the confirmation of dozens of Mr. Obama’s nominees to serve as ambassadors. He expected that the president would back him up and urge Mr. McConnell to relent. Mr. Obama quickly dismissed the matter. “You and Mitch work it out,” Mr. Obama said coolly, cutting off any discussion. Mr. Reid seethed quietly for the rest of the meeting, according to four separate accounts provided by people who spoke with him about it. After his return to the Capitol that afternoon, Mr. Reid told other senators and his staff members that he was astonished by how disengaged the president seemed.

[Not almost heaven - “Asked to characterize his relationship with the president, Mr. Manchin, a centrist Democrat who has often been a bridge builder in the Senate, said: ‘It’s fairly nonexistent. There’s not much of a relationship.’”]

BAIER TRACKS: THE WORLD IS WATCHING…
“The media is focused like a laser on the unrest in Ferguson, Mo. And as is often the case, the news frenzy feeds itself once ratings surge or the number of clicks increase. That’s certainly not to say that the story doesn’t merit full and extensive reporting, but the wall-to-wall coverage given to such stories encourages Americans to see individual stories as passing events rather than part of a larger narrative about our world and our lives. The media tendency is to focus on one chapter of our American story and then turn the page, moving on and forgetting about the passions of the previous moment. We see the chapters, but we don’t always read the book.

It’s also been interesting to note the extensive, sometimes gleeful, foreign press coverage. Russian and Chinese outlets are hammering the U.S. for civil rights abuses and Reuters {reports}<hyperlink=http://www.businessinsider.com/egypt-urges-us-restraint-over-missouri-unrest-2014-8> that Egypt’s foreign ministry is warning against harsh treatment of protesters, even echoing the language used in U.S. statements to the government in Cairo urging “security forces to exercise maximum restraint and caution” during the 2013 crackdown on protestors backing Egypt’s deposed Islamist government.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services denied a Freedom of Information Act request made late last year by the Associated Press amid concerns that Republicans raised about the security of the website, which had technical glitches that prevented millions of people from signing up for insurance under ObamaCare. In denying access to the documents, including what's known as a site security plan, Medicare told the AP that disclosing them could violate health-privacy laws because it might give hackers enough information to break into the service. ‘We concluded that releasing this information would potentially cause an unwarranted risk to consumers' private information,’ CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said in a statement.”

CAMPAIGN STOP, ALASKA STYLE
You know you’re on the frontier when a Senate candidate traveling the open road, pulls his campaign RV over and exercises his inner first-responder on the day before the primary. Republican primary frontrunner Dan Sullivan and campaign staffer, retired Air Force Col. Otto Feather, did just that on Monday. The two were among the first on the scene of an accident after a semi-truck rear-ended a Princess Tours bus on a remote stretch of the George Parks Highway, near Hurricane Gulch, Alaska. According to Sullivan’s campaign, the candidate and the colonel “assessed the scene, notified Mat-Su Valley Emergency Services, and assisted in removing passengers from the tour bus. In addition, Colonel Feather directed the landing of the first responders’ helicopter on the Highway.” State troopers reported only minor injuries in the accident {according}<hyperlink=http://www.adn.com/article/20140818/parks-hwy-closed-injuries-reported-after-2-wrecks-including-bus-semi-collision> to Anchorage Dispatch News.

The winner will be gunning for vulnerable Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, in a key race in the Republican quest for control of the Senate this fall. The other two GOP contenders are Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell, whose Alaskan political pedigree reaches back to the late 70s, and Tea Party favorite and 2010 Senate candidate Joe Miller.

She’s also expected to headline fundraisers for the rest of the party’s major campaign committees…Though Clinton is one of Democrats’ most coveted campaign surrogates, she’s largely stayed away from electoral politics thus far this cycle, only hosting a fundraiser for a Pennsylvania Democratic House candidate who ultimately lost her primary bid.”

PELOSI PROVIDES PLUMS FOR STEYER
Billionaire Tom Steyer, a Democratic mega-donor, seems to get what he wants. As Washington Examiner’s Tim Carney {details}<hyperlink=http://washingtonexaminer.com/give-to-democrats-profit-from-earmarks-the-tom-steyer-story/article/2552114?custom_click=rss>: “…[W]hy did the federal government give $10 million in taxpayer money to develop [San Fran Cisco’s Mission Bay] transit? House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi cheerfully announced in 2012 that the federal government would shell out eight figures in stimulus funds for ‘street additions, highway off-ramps, bike lanes, pedestrian walkways, and transit additions.’ Why are the bike lanes for the millionaires of Mission Bay the responsibility of taxpayers in Green Bay? As always, follow the money — and the lobbying. And no surprise, the trail leads you to the West Coast mansion of liberal Billionaire Tom Steyer, the Democrats’ top funder in the 2014 elections…Steyer raised money for President Obama and donated to Pelosi while Pelosi pushed for the federal money that profited Steyer — and that Steyer’s fund, Farallon Capital, lobbied on.”

GRIMES CAMPAIGN GETS GOODIES FROM DAD’S FIRM
A {review}<hyperlink=https://www.politicopro.com/go/?id=37487> conducted by Politico finds Allison Lundergan Grimes’s campaign vehicle could place her add odds with federal election laws. According to the review Grimes’ father, Jerry Lundergan, a former Blue Grass State Democratic Party chairman and state lawmaker, is renting a campaign bus to the campaign far below market value. Lundergan who was forced from office in 1989 for accepting a no-bid contract for catering an event in violation of a state law. Grimes campaign is refuting the claims saying it has gone above and beyond to ensure that its payments reflect comparable prices of similar vehicles.

PICK SIX: WALLEYES ON MINNESOTA
The stakes are high for Democrats come November as they need to limit Republican gains in the Senate to five or fewer in order to retain control of the upper chamber. If the GOP can flip six seats from blue to red this year, the dynamics in Washington will change in a big way. Fox News First wants to know which six Democratic-held seats are most vulnerable. The current consensus among readers: Arkansas (13.6%), Montana (12.1%), Louisiana (11.7%), West Virginia (11.3%), South Dakota (10.8%) and North Carolina (9.5%).  Reader Rich Fitzmorris feels Sen. Al Franken D-Minn., “will be defeated by Minnesota voters” because of his support of ObamaCare and President Obama’s use of executive actions.

IMPEACHMENT CLAMOR BRINGS DOUGH FOR DEMS
Suggesting House Republicans are pushing to impeach President Obama has proved profitable for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, netting $7 million in donations online donations to raise a record $11.5 million in July. The Hill: “The $7 million raised by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee online in July is just $1 million less than the total raised from all sources by its GOP counterpart. The DCCC now has $56.7 million cash on hand to the National Republican Congressional Committee’s $48 million, a cash advantage the Democratic committee has used to reserve more fall airtime than the NRCC and to ramp up its ground operation earlier than ever before.”

HE WAS READY FOR PRIME TIME, EVEN WHEN THEY WEREN’T
Don Pardo, who told America “Live from New York, it’s Saturday Night…” for more than four decades, died Monday at his home in Arizona at the age of 96. Pardo was one of the original voice talents for the game show “Jeopardy.” Pardo’s booming voice was one of the first to tell the nation of the death of President John F. Kennedy. SNL Producer Lorne Michaels said he wanted Pardo to be voice of authority for the newly launched sketch show. Pardo did that but also proved to be game for comedy bits and self-parody. Along the way, Pardo’s voice became known to five generations of Americans and, no matter how flat the season of the long-running sketch show, the sound of hope that the next Eddie Murphy or Phil Hartman was waiting in the wings to be discovered. Watch Pardo deal with more verbose copy and watch a flashback to 2008 when Pardo celebrated his 90th birthday on air featuring guest host, then-Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark.

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…
“What [President Obama] should be saying is that [rioting is] wrong. We’re a democratic society you don’t do that. And I’d like to hear him say that ringingly rather than, saying “on the one hand and on the other hand.” We really have the law on the one hand. We have rioters on the other. It isn’t a hard choice between them.” –Charles Krauthammer, “On Special Report with Bret Baier.” Watch {here}<hyperlink=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/18/krauthammer-obama-should-condemn-violence-in-ferguson/>.",NA,NA,NA,NA
FoxNews,fox95,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/18/youtube-video-captures-purported-witness-backing-police-version-in-ferguson/,YouTube video purportedly captures witness backing police versions in Ferguson shooting,The Associated Press ,08/18/2014,01/26/2016,"A purported conversation captured on a YouTube video apparently shot in the immediate aftermath of the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown has a possible witness saying the unarmed 18-year-old charged at the officer who fired the shots that have led to more than a week of sometimes violent demonstrations in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.

Amid angry condemnations of the police and pledges to move away from the mean streets of Ferguson, one man describes what he saw as he witnessed the shooting. He seems to describe how the 6 foot, 4 inch, 300-pound Brown tussled with Police Officer Darren Wilson and charged him, an account that may corroborate Wilson's story and cast doubt on claims of other purported witnesses who say Wilson shot Brown as he ran away, his hands in the air.

""I mean, the police was in the truck [sic] and he was, like, over the truck,"" the man says. ""So then he ran, police got out and ran after him.

“The next thing I know, he comes back towards them.""

- Purported witness to shooting of Michael Brown
“The next thing I know, he comes back towards them. The police had his guns drawn on him.""

The graphic, 10-minute video, which has been viewed nearly 1 million times on YouTube, begins with the camera operator walking toward the street where Brown's body can be seen lying on the pavement on the other side of yellow police tape. The reliability of those heard speaking cannot be verified, but Ed Magee, spokesman for the St. Louis County Prosecutor's Office, said investigators are aware of the video and others allegedly taken at the scene and are trying to track down witnesses through them.

""Killed him for no reason,"" the camera operator says as he moves toward the scene in the broad daylight of early afternoon on Aug. 9.

A group of residents stands several yards away from one side of the body, and three Ferguson Police Department SUVs are parked on the other side, with police officers walking toward them. Three minutes into the video, a man witnesses say is Brown's father approaches the prone body and then is quickly ushered away by two police officers.

The camera operator and another man are heard claiming that the police officer, who authorities later identified as Wilson, shot Brown as he held up his hands and said 'Don't shoot,' then stood over him and ""shot him some more."" But the camera operator acknowledges only hearing shots and not witnessing the shooting, and attributes the account to ""that's what they said."" 

""They say he had his hands up and everything, and they just shot him anyway,"" the unidentified camera operator says.

With the police vehicles to the camera operator's left, and Brown's body facing them, a purported witness describes how Brown ran from the police.

""He was running away?"" one man asks. ""Why his body come this way, though?""

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was with him when he was shot and is suspected to have been present moments earlier when Brown carried out a strong-arm theft of a box of cigars at a liquor store, has claimed Brown was never reaching over or into Wilson's squad SUV. He has claimed that Wilson struck Brown with the vehicle door as he got out, then fired at Brown as he ran away, continuing to shoot even after Brown turned to face him, his hands in the air in surrender.

An autopsy conducted at the request of Brown's family by Dr. Michael Baden, the noted former chief medical examiner of New York, reportedly determined that Brown was hit with six bullets, four to the right arm and two to the head, all to the front and none from close range. One of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward.

“This one here looks like his head was bent downward,” Baden told {The New York Times.}<hyperlink=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=LedeSumLargeMedia&module=a-lede-package-region&region=lede-package&WT.nav=lede-package&_r=1> “It can be because he’s giving up, or because he’s charging forward at the officer.”

Police have said Wilson confronted Brown because he was walking in the middle of the street and have given differing information about whether Wilson was aware that Brown was a suspect in the robbery. Police said Brown struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon after being confronted, though several witnesses have claimed Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer.

Wilson is in seclusion and his account has not been made public. But a woman who claimed to be a close friend of his family told a {St. Louis radio program}<hyperlink=http://danaloeschradio.com/alleged-friend-of-officer-darren-wilson-offers-his-side/> that when Wilson tried to get out of his vehicle, Brown slammed the door shut on him. When Wilson finally managed to exit the SUV, Brown rushed him and punched him, according to the woman, whose association with Wilson's family was not verified by the radio program

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has approved a third autopsy on Brown's body, which will be conducted by a federal medical examiner.

The shooting touched off several days of protests that have ranged from peaceful to violent, and have included looting. Police have been blamed for exacerbating the protests with a military-style response that critics say inflamed demonstrators and turned the city of 21,000 into what some have likened to a ""war zone.""

The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting, and President Obama has called for calm and issued a statement expressing condolences to the family and the community. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and implemented a midnight-to-5-a.m. curfew in the city.",NA,5333,NA,NA
