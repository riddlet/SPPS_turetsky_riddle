NYTimes,nyt1,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/business/media/view-of-ferguson-thrust-michael-brown-shooting-to-national-attention.html?_r=0,View of #Ferguson Thrust Michael Brown Shooting to National Attention,David Carr,08/17/2014,03/23/2016,"Ferguson, Missouri, was just a place — a working-class suburb of St. Louis — before an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, was shot and killed by the police, before protests and looting erupted, before local forces responded with armored vehicles, tear gas and rubber bullets, and Ferguson became #Ferguson.

Last Wednesday night, my {Twitter}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/twitter/index.html?inline=nyt-org""> feed began to explode with videos, photographs and messages, all depicting the kind of mayhem we’re accustomed to seeing in war-torn corners of the globe, except that this was happening smack dab in the middle of America.

The story had already received its share of attention, but now it was breaking in a new and scary way, with reporters arrested, protesters gassed, stun grenades exploding and a line of police in riot gear confronting a group of protesters who were milling about.

The chaos was evident by about 8 p.m. Eastern time. I immediately turned on CNN and found a tribute to Lauren Bacall mixed with wall-to-wall coverage of the rescue effort in northern Iraq.

But the web crackled with one story and one story only. It wasn’t long before cable news made adjustments and a huge story — a militarized response to a mostly nonviolent exercise of free speech — took center stage. For that you can thank Twitter, which is often derided as a platform for banalities but has become much more than that in the age of always-on information.

For people in the news business, Twitter was initially viewed as one more way to promote and distribute content. But as the world has become an ever more complicated place — a collision of Ebola, war in Iraq, crisis in Ukraine and more — Twitter has become an early warning service for news organizations, {a way to see into stories}<hyperlink=""http://zachseward.com/teletype/""> even when they don’t have significant reporting assets on the ground. And in a situation hostile to traditional reporting, the crowdsourced, phone-enabled network of information that Twitter provides has proved invaluable.

Police officials in Ferguson made it clear that they had no interest in accommodating news coverage. Officers in riot gear {tear-gassed a crew}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/6001193/al-jazeera-journalists-teargassed-by-security-forces-in-ferguson""> from {Al Jazeera}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_jazeera/index.html?inline=nyt-org""> working on a stand-up far from the action, then walked over and laid their equipment on the ground after they fled.

(In one bit of irony in the aftermath of the events on Wednesday, President Obama said, “Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their job and report to the American people what they see on the ground.” This from an administration that {has aggressively sought}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/28/us/case-of-james-risen-times-reporter-poses-dilemma-for-justice-department.html""> to block reporting and in some instances criminalize it.)

News organizations learned about the arrest and harassment of their reporters on Twitter and were able to take steps to get them out of jail. In the meantime, important information continues to flow out of Ferguson. As much as any traditional wire service, Twitter spread the remarkable work of David Carson, a photographer at The St. Louis Post-Dispatch who managed to take pictures despite {being pushed around}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/attacked-on-the-job-a-post-dispatch-photographer-s-tale/article_1b6fba60-5ac1-592a-8818-19614f1910aa.html""> by both the police and the protesters.

There is a visceral quality to Twitter that can bring stories to a boiling point. Ron Mott, an NBC correspondent and a social media skeptic, watched Twitter turn up the heat on Wednesday and {tweeted}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/RonMott/status/499751378353680384"">, “As powerful as our press have been through years of our democracy, social media raises temp on public officials like never before.”

In and of itself, Twitter is not sufficient to see clearly into a big story; it’s a series of straws that offer narrow views of a much bigger picture. But as a kind of constantly changing kaleidoscope, it provides enough visibility to show that something significant is underway. And news organizations are beginning to look at how to use Twitter in continuing ways: The Wall Street Journal’s parent company acquired Storyful, which creates narratives from the Twitter stream. CNN has been using Dataminr to help map coverage while NBC News owns {@BreakingNews}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/breakingnews"">, which has nearly seven million followers.

It was, as so many observed, a surreal moment on Wednesday, in which scenes from Gaza, Iraq and Ferguson merged in the fog of war. In June, Matt Apuzzo of The New York Times wrote about how equipment from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan {was now finding its way}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html""> to local police departments in the United States. All of which helps explain the sudden hostilities at home and the response of local law enforcement, which seemed over-equipped and underprepared, with everything in its tool belt save common sense.

Over at MSNBC, Chris Hayes and the producers there got a sense that a dangerous situation was developing. They began stitching together interviews with local television stations, as well as phone interviews with the two reporters who had been arrested. By 10 p.m., CNN had caught up with the story and mixed in live reports with continued coverage of the death of Ms. Bacall and the suicide of Robin Williams, along with field reports from the rescue mission of Yazidi refugees in Iraq. Mr. Hayes said that as early as the previous Saturday, right after Mr. Brown died, his Twitter feed was alive with news and speculation about the shooting, which only grew from there.

“This story was put on the map, driven and followed on social media more so than any story I can remember since the Arab Spring,” he said in a phone interview on Saturday. “On Wednesday night, when things went down, we were putting together live feeds and Twitter reports. Good luck running around there with a camera man and a news crew. You saw what happened to Al Jazeera’s crew.”

On Thursday, Mr. Hayes traveled to Ferguson for his show because it was clear this story was not going away, on Twitter or elsewhere. Twitter still carries a great deal of unverified and sometimes erroneous information, but for all its limitations, it has some very real strengths in today’s media climate. It is a heat map and a window, a place where sometimes the things that are “trending” offer very real insight into the current informational needs of a huge swath of news consumers, some of whom traditional outlets often miss.

While much of mainstream media leaves communities of color unmoved — these are audiences that are underrepresented in terms of broadband access as well — Twitter is a place many black users {rely on}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/if-they-gunned-me-down-protest-on-twitter.html""> for information.

Julie Bosman has been on the ground for The Times and {posting to Twitter}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/juliebosman""> as often as time permits.

On Wednesday night in the thick of things, she was approached by a young black man in the neighborhood. “New York Times?” he asked. “Yes,” she said, introducing herself. “I follow you on Twitter,” he said.

On Thursday, after the chaos, there was a huge in-migration of news media. Perhaps even absent the conflagration on Twitter, journalists would have shown up. Perhaps cable news would have turned hard toward the story, and the kind of coverage that eventually drew the attention of the president and the governor of Missouri would have taken place. Perhaps all the things that led to the security situation in Ferguson being handed over to cooler heads would have ensued. But nothing much good was happening in Ferguson until it became a hashtag.",NA,NA,NA,Unseen tweet reported by scraper
NYTimes,nyt2,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/us/ferguson-mo-complex-racial-history-runs-deep-most-tensions-have-to-do-police-force.html,Deep Tensions Rise to Surface After Ferguson Shooting,Tanzina Vega; John Eligon,08/16/2014,03/23/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Garland Moore, a hospital worker, lived in this St. Louis suburb for much of his 33 years, a period in which a largely white community has become a largely black one.

He attended its schools and is raising his family in this place of suburban homes and apartment buildings on the outskirts of a struggling Midwest city. And over time, he has felt his life to be circumscribed by Ferguson’s demographics.

Mr. Moore, who is black, talks of how he has felt the wrath of the police here and in surrounding suburbs for years — roughed up during a minor traffic stop and prevented from entering a park when he was wearing St. Louis Cardinals red.

And last week, as he stood at a vigil for an unarmed 18-year-old shot dead by the police — a shooting that provoked renewed street violence and looting early Saturday — Mr. Moore heard anger welling and listened to a shout of: “We’re tired of the racist police department.”

“It broke the camel’s back,” Mr. Moore said of the killing of the teenager, Michael Brown. Referring to the northern part of St. Louis County, he continued, “The people in North County — not just African-Americans, some of the white people, too — they are tired of the police harassment.”

The origins of the area’s complex social and racial history date to the 19th century when the city of St. Louis and St. Louis County went their separate ways, leading to the formation of dozens of smaller communities outside St. Louis. Missouri itself has always been a state with roots in both the Midwest and the South, and racial issues intensified in the 20th century as St. Louis became a stopping point for the northern migration of Southern blacks seeking factory jobs in Detroit and Chicago.

As African-Americans moved into the city and whites moved out, real estate agents and city leaders, in a pattern familiar elsewhere in the country, conspired to keep blacks out of the suburbs through the use of zoning ordinances and restrictive covenants. But by the 1970s, some of those barriers had started to fall, and whites moved even farther away from the city. These days, Ferguson is like many of the suburbs around St. Louis, inner-ring towns that accommodated white flight decades ago but that are now largely black. And yet they retain a white power structure.

Although about two-thirds of Ferguson residents are black, its mayor and five of its six City Council members are white. Only three of the town’s 53 police officers are black.

Turnout for local elections in Ferguson has been poor. The mayor, James W. Knowles III, noted his disappointment with the turnout — about 12 percent — in the most recent mayoral election during a City Council meeting in April. Patricia Bynes, a black woman who is the Democratic committeewoman for the Ferguson area, said the lack of black involvement in local government was partly the result of the black population’s being more transient in small municipalities and less attached to them.

There is also some frustration among blacks who say town government is not attuned to their concerns.

Aliyah Woods, 45, once petitioned Ferguson officials for a sign that would warn drivers that a deaf family lived on that block. But the sign never came. “You get tired,” she said. “You keep asking, you keep asking. Nothing gets done.”

Mr. Moore, who recently moved to neighboring Florissant, said he had attended a couple of Ferguson Council meetings to complain that the police should be patrolling the residential streets to try to prevent break-ins rather than lying in wait to catch people for traffic violations.

This year, community members voiced anger after the all-white, seven-member school board for the Ferguson-Florissant district pushed aside its black superintendent for unrevealed reasons. That spurred several blacks to run for three board positions up for election, but only one won a seat.

The St. Louis County Police Department fired a white lieutenant last year for ordering officers to target blacks in shopping areas. That resulted in the department’s enlisting researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, to study whether the department was engaging in racial profiling.

And in recent years, two school districts in North County lost their accreditation. One, Normandy, where Mr. Brown graduated this year, serves parts of Ferguson. When parents in the mostly black district sought to allow their children to transfer to schools in mostly white districts, they said, they felt a backlash with racial undertones. Frustration with underfunded and underperforming schools has long been a problem, and when Gov. Jay Nixon held a news conference on Friday to discuss safety and security in Ferguson, he was confronted with angry residents demanding to know what he would do to fix their schools.

Ferguson’s economic shortcomings reflect the struggles of much of the region. Its median household income of about $37,000 is less than the statewide number, and its poverty level of 22 percent outpaces the state’s by seven percentage points.

In Ferguson, residents say most racial tensions have to do with an overzealous police force.

“It is the people in a position of authority in our community that have to come forward,” said Jerome Jenkins, 47, who, with his wife, Cathy, owns Cathy’s Kitchen, a downtown Ferguson restaurant.

“What you are witnessing is our little small government has to conform to the change that we are trying to do,” Mr. Jenkins added. “Sometimes things happen for a purpose; maybe we can get it right.”

Ferguson’s police chief, Thomas Jackson, has been working with the Justice Department’s community relations team on improving interaction with residents. At a news conference here last week, he acknowledged some of the problems.

“I’ve been trying to increase the diversity of the department ever since I got here,” Chief Jackson said, adding that “race relations is a top priority right now.” As for working the with Justice Department, he said, “I told them, ‘Tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.’ ”

Although experience and statistics suggest that Ferguson’s police force disproportionately targets blacks, it is not as imbalanced as in some neighboring departments in St. Louis County. While blacks are 37 percent more likely to be pulled over compared with their proportion of the population in Ferguson, that is less than the statewide average of 59 percent, according to Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

In fact, Mr. Rosenfeld said, Ferguson did not fit the profile of a community that would be a spark for civil unrest. The town has “pockets of disadvantage” and middle and upper-middle income families. He said Ferguson had benefited in the last five to 10 years from economic growth in the northern part of the county, such as the expansion of Express Scripts, the Fortune 500 health care giant.

“Ferguson does not stand out as the type of community where you would expect tensions with the police to boil over into violence and looting,” Mr. Rosenfeld said.

But the memory of the region’s racial history lingers.

In 1949, a mob of whites showed up to attack blacks who lined up to get into the pool at Fairground Park in north St. Louis after it had been desegregated.

In the 1970s, a court battle over public school inequality led to a settlement that created a desegregation busing program that exists to this day.

A Ferguson city councilman caused a stir in 1970 when he used racially charged language to criticize teenagers from the neighboring town of Kinloch for throwing rocks and bottles at homes in Ferguson. The councilman, Carl Kersting, said, “We should call a black a black, and not be afraid to face up to these people,” according to an article in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.

Eventually blacks broke down the barriers in the inner ring of suburbs, and whites fled farther out. But whites fought hard to protect their turf.

In the mid-1970s, Alyce Herndon, a black woman, moved with her family to what was then the mostly white town of Jennings in St. Louis County. She said some of their white neighbors stuck an Afro pick in their front lawn and set it on fire. Ms. Herndon also recalled tensions flaring between black and white students at her school after the television mini-series “Roots” first aired in 1977.

For all its segregation and discrimination, St. Louis did not have the major riots and unrest during the 1960s that was seen across the country.

St. Louis’s black leaders “were able to pressure businesses and schools to open their doors to black people and employers to hire black workers,” Stefan Bradley, the director of African-American studies at St. Louis University, wrote in an email. “These concessions may have been enough to prevent St. Louis from taking what many believed to be the next step toward redress of injustice: violent rebellion.”

But the fatal shooting of Mr. Brown has brought submerged tensions to the surface.

“St. Louis never has had its true race moment, where they had to confront this,” said Ms. Bynes, the Democratic committeewoman. Without that moment, she added, blacks have been complacent when it comes to local politics. “I’m hoping that this is what it takes to get the pendulum to swing the other way.”

Ms. Herndon, 49, said she moved her family to Ferguson in 2003 because she felt it was a good community, safer than the unincorporated portion of the county where they lived previously and with better schools for her children.

The town, she said, offers everything — places to shop, eat and drink. There is a farmers market on Saturdays. She frequents a wine bar across from a lot where a band plays on Fridays. She has white and Asian neighbors on either side of her, and there are other black families on her block. She has not experienced the racial tensions of her childhood in St. Louis County, she said, but she understands that the younger generation is living a different experience than she is.

“I understand the anger because it’s psychological trauma when you see so many people being shot or people being falsely accused,” said Ms. Herndon, who over the past week has avoided the streets that have been filled with tear gas and rubber bullets in clashes between police and protesters.

But now, a population of young black men who often feel forgotten actually feel that people are finally listening.

“If it wasn’t for the looting,” said one man, who declined to give his name, “we wouldn’t get the attention.”

Mr. Moore went one step further. He does not condone the violence that erupted during some of the protests, he said, but he does understand the frustration. And if he were younger, he said, he probably would have joined them.",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt3,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html#,Midnight Curfew in Effect for Ferguson, Julie Bosman; Alan Blinder,08/16/2014,03/23/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri on Saturday imposed a midnight to 5 a.m. curfew in this small city, declaring a state of emergency as violence flared anew after a week of street protests over the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer.

“This is not to silence the people of Ferguson, but to address those who are drowning out the voice of the people with their actions,” Mr. Nixon, a Democrat, told reporters and residents at a Ferguson church. “We will not allow a handful of looters to endanger the rest of this community. If we’re going to achieve justice, we must first have and maintain peace.”

Mr. Nixon added: “This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching.”

As the curfew took effect, heavy rains began to fall and the streets, which had been filled with people less than an hour before, were largely deserted.

Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, the state Highway Patrol commander whose officers have overseen public security in Ferguson since Thursday, did not say how long the curfew would be in force or whether violators would be arrested.

The announcement prompted cries of protest and anguish from some members of the public who attended the news conference, with many of them arguing that a curfew would lead only to new and fierce confrontations. Some people begged to be able to go into the streets themselves to try to calm any violence. But Captain Johnson said the curfew would be put in place and enforced.

“We won’t enforce it with trucks, we won’t enforce it with tear gas, we will enforce it with communication,” Captain Johnson said. “We will be telling people, ‘It’s time to go home.’ ”

Clusters of protesters remained standing in a parking lot after midnight and officers slowly walked down West Florissant Avenue, a hub for demonstrators in recent days, in their direction. Other officers, in riot gear, stood in a line in front of businesses that had previously been looted. As the curfew took effect, police radio traffic crackled with reports of demonstrators in other locations.

Mr. Nixon announced his decision at the Greater St. Mark Family Church, near the site of the unrest. The news conference quickly became frenzied, with the governor and Captain Johnson confronting a volley of aggressive questions, most of them from residents. It came a week after the death of Michael Brown, 18, who was shot by Officer Darren Wilson. The police said that Mr. Brown had been stopped for walking down the middle of the street and that a scuffle had ensued, ending in gunfire; other eyewitnesses have disputed that account.

At times, Mr. Nixon and Captain Johnson both appeared chagrined by the spectacle, the governor curtly telling one prospective questioner, “I’ll let you yell at me next.”

Mr. Nixon described the looting and violence as the work of an isolated few, but emphasized that a curfew was necessary to restore order in a community where residents have complained that basic services, like summoning an ambulance through a 911 call, have been disrupted by the protests.

“Small groups took to the streets with the intent of committing crimes and endangering citizens,” Mr. Nixon said after he praised “the courage and resolve of peaceful protesters.”

The curfew came under quick attack from some people in the church and from protesters whom Captain Johnson credited with assisting the police in maintaining order.

“Right now, I want to make sure that my people don’t get hurt tonight,” said Malik Z. Shabazz of Black Lawyers for Justice. He said his group would bring a lawsuit challenging the treatment of Ferguson residents by the police in the initial days of turmoil.

He added: “It’s Saturday night. Midnight is an early time, and I have to be able to go to my people with credibility in order for them to come out of those streets. Twelve midnight is early. I cleared it Thursday at 1:30, no problem. But if I can get till 1:30, 2 tonight, it would all go peacefully, no problem. Twelve midnight is a problem.”

Some residents shouted at the governor, including one man who said, “We will not get sleep until we get justice for Michael Brown!”

Another man shouted, “Sleep is not an option, Governor Nixon!”

Steven W. Hawkins, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement: “It’s hard to build trust if the governor doesn’t meet with community members and restricts their movements with a curfew.”

But the announcement was greeted with relief from some elected officials, who have struggled to hold off the faction of protesters who have engaged in looting.

“I don’t know what the answer is, but there has to be some type of response because it’s only getting worse out there,” Patricia Bynes, a black Democratic committeewoman for Ferguson Township, said on Saturday. “People are fed up with police brutality and police harassment. There is still so much racism and discrimination in this region, ingrained in the business world and the communities. This is what happens when institutional racism continues.”

The shooting is being investigated by the Justice Department. Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been flooding into Ferguson, seeking witnesses. Locally, the case is being handled by the St. Louis County prosecutor, Robert McCulloch, but there have been calls to have the case shifted to a special prosecutor, in part because of criticism that Mr. McCulloch has not been rigorous in prosecuting law enforcement officers in high-profile cases.

Since last Sunday, Ferguson has seesawed between extremes: order and unrest, protests and looting.

It has seen peaceful demonstrations by day and often ugly clashes at night between highly militarized police officers and angry protesters calling for justice for Mr. Brown. On Thursday, President Obama urged an end to the violence and the governor ordered the state Highway Patrol to take over security from local law enforcement.

Residents have taken to the streets each day, holding placards condemning what they say is a long history of harassment and abuse of African-Americans at the hands of the largely white Ferguson police force. Groups of people have silently confronted police officers, facing them with their hands in the air, as witnesses said Mr. Brown did before he was shot.

And late at night, a small number of unruly people in the crowd have turned violent, smashing shop windows and stealing hair supplies and liquor. For several days, television networks have replayed clips of people looting, burning down a convenience store and throwing glass bottles and gasoline bombs at heavily armed police officers, drawing comparisons to scenes from a war-ravaged city.

Earlier, Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police had dismissed the idea of a curfew, saying that such an action would not hinder people determined to cause violence, while negatively affecting residents engaging in innocent activity, like walking home from the bus stop after a late shift of work.

But Mr. Nixon, increasingly desperate to bring the situation in Ferguson under control, said he embraced the tactic reluctantly.

Earlier Saturday, in a new sign of discord among the authorities over the handling of the investigation into Mr. Brown’s death, the Justice Department said that it had opposed the release of a video that the Ferguson Police Department said showed the teenager apparently involved in a robbery at a convenience store.

The Justice Department asked the Ferguson Police Department not to release the video because of concerns that “it would roil the community further,” a United States law enforcement official said on Saturday. The Ferguson department released the video on Friday and the Justice official said it “occurred over the objection of federal authorities.” The official said a copy of the video had been in possession of federal investigators, as well, “and there were never any plans by the federal investigators to release that copy.”

The dispute showed further divisions among the authorities in the handling of the case. The surveillance video appeared to show Mr. Brown stealing a box of cigarillos. Shortly after the release of the video, Captain Johnson expressed his displeasure, saying he had not been told that the police planned to release it.

Mr. Brown’s family and many protesters accused the police of trying to harm the teenager’s reputation and to divert attention from the officer who killed him. The police have said that Officer Wilson was not aware of what had happened at the convenience store when he encountered Mr. Brown. The police identified the officer for the first time on Friday; he has been put on administrative leave and his whereabouts were unknown. Neighbors on his block in Crestwood, a suburb of St. Louis, said that he left his home several days ago and has not been seen since. On Saturday, the house appeared deserted, the blinds in the windows closed tightly.

On Friday night, hundreds of protesters returned to the streets in anger over the shooting and the handling of the investigation. The confrontation between the police and demonstrators, the first serious one since the Highway Patrol assumed responsibility for security operations, ended at about 4 a.m. when the authorities, prompted by the gradual dispersal of demonstrators, pulled back to their nearby command post. The Associated Press reported that one law enforcement official had been injured overnight.

Ferguson continued to draw African-American leaders, who appeared at protests and held prayer vigils. On Saturday, dozens of clergy members, including the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and hundreds of people, including residents from Ferguson, greater St. Louis and beyond, gathered on Canfield Drive, the street where Mr. Brown was killed, in front of two makeshift memorials decorated with candles, stuffed animals and flowers.

“We choose futures over funerals,” Mr. Jackson said.",1566,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt4,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html#,Violence Flares in Ferguson After Appeals for Harmony,Alan Blinder; Tanzina Vega,08/17/2014,03/23/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Hours ahead of a second night of a mandatory curfew, the most chaotic violence in a week of unrest broke out here Sunday evening, with law enforcement officers facing off against angry protesters and responding to reports of gunfire and fire bombs.

The violence began about 9 p.m. along West Florissant Avenue, one of the city’s main streets, within two blocks of where Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was fatally shot. Hundreds of police officers turned out in riot gear, shooting rubber bullets and firing canisters of tear gas in an effort to disperse protesters. Some in the crowd retrieved the smoking canisters and threw them back toward the officers.

It was not immediately clear what set off the violence, but there were reports that the police feared that some of the protesters were trying to encroach on their command post in a shopping center parking lot. Protesters said the police fired without provocation.

Key Smith, 46, a veteran who served in Iraq, said that he, his wife and their 7-year-old son had traveled two hours from Fort Valley, Ga., to attend a church rally to honor the memory of Mr. Brown and that they were caught up in the violence as they were trying to get home.

“I just came out to see a peaceful rally,” Mr. Smith said. “It takes away from his death, his memory.”

Mr. Smith said he did not blame the police for their response. “You have to disperse the crowd if the crowd gets wild,” he said. “This is getting out of hand. It’s kind of sad that it’s come to this. If you really want to hit them in the right way, get out there and vote.”

After the initial barrage of tear gas, the police formed into ranks and moved down the street, pushing the protesters from the area.

Scattered clashes and violence had flared early Sunday morning during the first hours of the curfew, which began at midnight and continued to 5 a.m. But the trouble Sunday evening was a sharp contrast to the mood of the rest of the day. At churches across the area, ministers, the police and civil rights figures joined parishioners in trying to tamp down the anger that has followed the Aug. 9 death of Mr. Brown, 18.

In a packed sanctuary at Greater Grace Church, not far from the site of evening demonstrations, Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, the Missouri State Highway Patrol official brought in by the governor to take over security here, spoke with the cadence of a preacher as he apologized to the family of the teenager. “My heart goes out to you, and I say that I’m sorry,” Captain Johnson said. “I wear this uniform, and I should stand up here and say that I’m sorry.”

Before a mostly black audience, Captain Johnson, who is African-American, spoke of his own “black son, who wears his pants saggy, wears his hat cocked to the side and has tattoos on his arms.” He added, “That’s my baby.”

“Michael’s going to make it better for our sons so they can be better black men,” he said, predicting that the treatment of black youths here would somehow change. “We need to pray. We need to thank Michael for his life. And we need to thank him for the change that he is going to make.”

Time and again, he won applause. But in a vivid display of the challenges faced by the authorities in this tumultuous city of 21,000 that has become the center of a national debate about race and policing, a large crowd outside continued to protest Mr. Brown’s death. The shooting of the teenager on Aug. 9 by a white officer, Darren Wilson, is the subject of inquiries by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the St. Louis County police.

Several demonstrators held signs reading “Stop racist police killing,” while many others joined in the chant that has echoed through this city’s streets for days: “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” Hours earlier, just after a midnight curfew went into effect on Saturday, police officers dressed in riot gear and driving heavily armored vehicles engaged in a new clash with angry demonstrators. One person threw a bottle bomb that lit the street ablaze and left a lingering scent of gasoline. Before long, a police caravan, with lights flashing, began rolling slowly toward the protesters.

“You are violating the state-imposed curfew,” an officer said over a loudspeaker. “You must disperse immediately or you’ll be subject to arrest and or other actions.” The crowd did not back down, cheering louder. Eventually a canister of tear gas was lobbed into the crowd. Smoke filled the air. Some people ran away from the police. Bottles crashed onto the pavement. Captain Johnson said the heavy police response had been prompted by reports of armed people at a barbecue restaurant.

Someone also had fired a gun toward a police car, he said.

Seven people were arrested and accused of failing to disperse, and one man was critically wounded in an overnight shooting, apparently by another protester. The authorities said the police had not opened fire.

Officials extended the curfew, which runs from midnight until 5 a.m., for another night and said they would decide each day whether to continue its enforcement.

On Sunday, civil rights organizations called on Gov. Jay Nixon to rescind the state of emergency and the curfew in Ferguson.

The American Civil Liberties Union, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund said in a statement that the governor’s action “suspends the constitutional right to assemble by punishing the misdeeds of the few through the theft of constitutionally protected rights of the many.”

In St. Louis, about 100 people turned out in a show of support for Officer Wilson, according to local media reports.

In churches here, the calls for calm continued.

At the Greater St. Mark Family Church in Ferguson, the state attorney general, Chris Koster, said he came to pray and grieve with the mostly African-American parishioners. “You have lost a member of your community at the hands of a member of my community,” he said. “Not just the Caucasian community, but the law enforcement community. And that is painful to every good-hearted person in this city.”

He said he feared that the armored vehicle the police used on West Florissant Avenue was a symbol of the armor that had grown between the black community and law enforcement.

“This week is a 50-year flood of anger that has broken loose in this city the likes of which we have not seen since Dr. King was killed,” he said, referring to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “And I am sorry that I have not done more from the law enforcement community to break down that wall of anger, that wall of armor.”

At the Sunday morning service at New Jerusalem Missionary Baptist Church here, about 40 people gathered. On a screen hanging above the pulpit, Jaquan Vassel, 24, the church deacon, played a video that he had seen the night before on his Facebook news feed. In it, two black men were reading from the Book of Psalms during a protest on West Florissant Avenue. “I commend them for trying to look to God,” Mr. Vassel told the congregants, “but you hear the anger in their voices.”

“They are angry at the police officers,” he added. “We have to show them how to forgive, just like God forgave us.”

Forgiveness was also emphasized by Alonso Adams Jr., the assistant pastor of the church, who spoke after Mr. Vassel. “How many of us have killed people with our lips?” he asked. “How many brothers and sisters, white or black, have we defamed with our words?”

Mr. Adams acknowledged the anger toward the police, in particular toward Officer Wilson. But, the pastor added, “If he came into this church this morning and asked Jerusalem to forgive him, how many of you would offer up your arms?”

And later at Greater Grace Church, where cars were lined up for at least a mile, the Rev. Al Sharpton called the killing of Mr. Brown “a defining moment on how this country deals with policing and the rights of its citizens to address how police behave in this country.”

Mr. Sharpton recalled Marlene Pinnock, a black woman who was assaulted by an officer in Los Angeles this summer; Eric Garner, a black man in Staten Island who was put in a chokehold by an officer and who later died; and the death of Mr. Brown, saying: “We have had enough.”

One woman in the crowd raised a handwritten sign that equated the Ferguson Police Department with the Ku Klux Klan.

Mr. Sharpton admonished the crowd not to loot in Mr. Brown’s name. “We are not looters,” he said. “We are liberators.”",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt5,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/opinion/in-ferguson-black-town-white-power.html,"In Ferguson, Black Town, White Power",Jeff Smith,08/17/2014,03/23/2016,"POLITICS, wrote the political scientist Harold Lasswell in 1936, is about “who gets what, when, and how.” If you want to understand the racial power disparities we’ve seen in Ferguson, Mo., understand that it’s not only about black and white. It’s about green.

Back in 1876, the city of St. Louis made a fateful decision. Tired of providing services to the outlying areas, the city cordoned itself off, separating from St. Louis County. It’s a decision the city came to regret. Most Rust Belt cities have bled population since the 1960s, but few have been as badly damaged as St. Louis City, which since 1970 has lost almost as much of its population as Detroit.

This exodus has left a ring of mostly middle-class suburbs around an urban core plagued by entrenched poverty. White flight from the city mostly ended in the 1980s; since then, blacks have left the inner city for suburbs such as Ferguson in the area of St. Louis County known as North County.

Ferguson’s demographics have shifted rapidly: in 1990, it was 74 percent white and 25 percent black; in 2000, 52 percent black and 45 percent white; by 2010, 67 percent black and 29 percent white.

The region’s fragmentation isn’t limited to the odd case of a city shedding its county. St. Louis County contains 90 municipalities, most with their own city hall and police force. Many rely on revenue generated from traffic tickets and related fines. According to a study by the St. Louis nonprofit {Better Together}<hyperlink=""http://www.bettertogetherstl.com/"">, Ferguson receives nearly one-quarter of its revenue from court fees; for some surrounding towns it approaches 50 percent.

Municipal reliance on revenue generated from traffic stops adds pressure to make more of them. One town, Sycamore Hills, has stationed a radar-gun-wielding police officer on its 250-foot northbound stretch of Interstate.

With primarily white police forces that rely disproportionately on traffic citation revenue, blacks are pulled over, cited and arrested in numbers far exceeding their population share, according to a recent {report from Missouri’s attorney general}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf"">. In Ferguson last year, 86 percent of stops, 92 percent of searches and 93 percent of arrests were of black people — despite the fact that police officers were far less likely to find contraband on black drivers (22 percent versus 34 percent of whites). This worsens inequality, as struggling blacks do more to fund local government than relatively affluent whites.

By contrast, consider the city: After decades of methodically building political power, blacks in St. Louis City elected a black mayor in 1993 and black aldermen or alderwomen in nearly half the city’s wards, and hold two of three seats on the powerful Board of Estimate and Apportionment, which must approve all city contracts. Well-established churches, Democratic ward organizations and other civic institutions mobilize voters in black wards. But because blacks have reached the suburbs in significant numbers only over the past 15 years or so, fewer suburban black communities have deeply ingrained civic organizations.

That helps explain why majority-black Ferguson has a virtually all-white power structure: a white mayor; a school board with six white members and one Hispanic, which recently suspended a highly regarded young black superintendent who then resigned; a City Council with just one black member; and a 6 percent black police force.

Many North County towns — and inner-ring suburbs nationally — resemble Ferguson. Longtime white residents have consolidated power, continuing to dominate the City Councils and school boards despite sweeping demographic change. They have retained control of patronage jobs and municipal contracts awarded to allies.

The North County Labor Club, whose overwhelmingly white constituent unions (plumbers, pipe fitters, electrical workers, sprinkler fitters) have benefited from these arrangements, operates a potent voter-turnout operation that backs white candidates over black upstarts. The more municipal contracts an organization receives, the more generously it can fund re-election campaigns. Construction, waste and other long-term contracts with private firms have traditionally excluded blacks from the ownership side and, usually, the work force as well.

But there’s a potential solution that could help Ferguson reinvest in itself and also help African-Americans compete for a bigger share of the pie: consolidation with surrounding municipalities, many of which face similar challenges. The St. Louis region has seen some preliminary support for the idea, with resistance concentrated in smaller political units whose leaders are loath to surrender control.

Consolidation would help strapped North County communities avoid using such a high percentage of their resources for expensive public safety overhead, such as fire trucks. It could also empower the black citizens of Ferguson. Blacks incrementally gained power in St. Louis City in part because its size facilitates broader coalitions and alliances. Another benefit of consolidation is the increased political talent pool. Many leaders just aren’t interested in running a tiny municipality.

In shrinking cities, politics is often a nasty, zero-sum game. But consolidation could create economies of scale, increase borrowing capacity to expand economic opportunity, reduce economic pressures that inflame racial tension, and smash up the old boys’ network that has long ruled much of North County.

When the state patrol and the national television cameras leave Ferguson, its residents will still be talking about how they can move forward. And they may be ready to expand the conversation so that it’s not just about black and white, but green.",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt6,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html,Missouri Tries Another Idea: Call In National Guard,Monica Davey; John Eligon; Alan Blinder,08/18/2014,03/23/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Missouri National Guard troops entered this battered city on Monday even as an overnight curfew was lifted, the latest in a series of quickly shifting attempts to quell the violence that has upended this St. Louis suburb for more than a week.

In the days since an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, was shot to death by a white police officer here on Aug. 9, an array of state and local law enforcement authorities have swerved from one approach to another: taking to the streets in military-style vehicles and riot gear; then turning over power to a State Highway Patrol official who permitted the protests and marched along; then calling for a curfew.

Early Monday, after a new spate of violence, Gov. Jay Nixon said he was bringing in the National Guard. Hours later he said he was lifting the curfew and said the Guard would have only a limited role, protecting the police command post.

At the same time, more details emerged from autopsies performed on Mr. Brown. {One showed that he had been shot at least six times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html"">; another found evidence of marijuana in his system.

{In Washington, President Obama said}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/us/calling-for-calm-in-ferguson-obama-cites-need-for-improved-race-relations.html?_r=0""> Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. will go to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with F.B.I. agents conducting a federal civil rights investigation into the shooting. He seemed less than enthusiastic about the decision to call in the National Guard.

Mr. Obama said he had told the governor in a phone call on Monday that the Guard should be “used in a limited and appropriate way.”

He said he would be closely monitoring the deployment.

“I’ll be watching over the next several days to assess whether in fact it’s helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson,” said Mr. Obama, who emphasized that the State of Missouri, not the White House, had called in the Guard.

He again tried to strike a balance between the right of protest and approaches to security.

“While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions,” Mr. Obama said.

As darkness set in, along West Florissant Avenue, one of the city’s main thoroughfares and a center of the weeklong protests, demonstrators were required to keep moving. There were several skirmishes.

After more of than hour of peaceful protests, some in the crowd began to throw bottles at police, who brought out armored vehicles and tactical units. But many peacekeepers in the crowd formed a human chain and got the agitators to back down.

At another point, as protesters gathered near a convenience store, some of them threw objects; police responded with stun grenades and tear gas.

A few blocks away, at the police command post, National Guard members in Army fatigues, some with military police patches on their uniforms, stood ready.

Residents seemed puzzled and frustrated by the continually changing approaches, suggesting that the moving set of rules only worsened longstanding tensions over policing and race in the town of 21,000.

“It almost seems like they can’t decide what to do, and like law enforcement is fighting over who’s got the power,” said Antione Watson, 37, who stood near a middle-of-the-street memorial of candles and flowers for Mr. Brown, the 18-year-old killed on a winding block here.

“First they do this, then there’s that, and now who can even tell what their plan is?” Mr. Watson said. “They can try all of this, but I don’t see an end to this until there are charges against the cop.”

The latest turn in law enforcement tactics — the removal of a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew imposed Saturday and the arrival of members of the Guard — followed one of the tensest nights so far. Police officers reported gunfire and firebombs from some among a large group, and responded with tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets.

By Monday, the police seemed intent on taking control of the situation long before evening and the expected arrival of protesters, some of them inclined to provoke clashes. The authorities banned stationary protests, even during the day, ordering demonstrators to continue walking, particularly in an area along West Florissant, not far from where the shooting occurred. One of those told to move along was the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson.

Six members of the Highway Patrol, plastic flex-ties within easy reach, stood guard at a barbecue restaurant that has been a hub of the turmoil. Just north of the restaurant, about 30 officers surrounded a convenience store that was heavily damaged early in the unrest. Several people were arrested during the day, including a photographer for Getty Images, Scott Olson, who was led away in plastic handcuffs in the early evening.

Explaining his decision to call in the National Guard, Mr. Nixon recounted details of the tumult on Sunday night, and described the events as “very difficult and dangerous as a result of a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community.”

Yet Mr. Nixon also emphasized that the Guard’s role would be limited to providing protection for a police command center here, which the authorities say came under attack. Gregory Mason, a brigadier general of the Guard, described the arriving troops as “well trained and well seasoned.”

“With these additional resources in place,” said Mr. Nixon, a Democrat in his second term, “the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard.”

While Mr. Obama and other leaders called for healing and more than 40 F.B.I. agents fanned out around this city to interview residents about the shooting, emotions remained raw, and the divide over all that had happened seemed only to be growing amid multiple investigations and competing demonstrations.

A recent survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press showed that Americans were deeply divided along racial lines in their reaction to Mr. Brown’s killing. The report showed that 80 percent of blacks thought the case raised “important issues about race that need to be discussed,” while only 37 percent of whites thought it did.

Blacks surveyed were also less confident in the investigations into the shooting, with 76 percent reporting little to no confidence in the investigation, compared with 33 percent of whites.

Supporters of Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who fired the fatal shots, gathered outside a radio station over the weekend in St. Louis.

Mr. Brown is now the subject of three autopsies. The first was conducted by St. Louis County, the results of which were delivered to the county prosecutor’s office on Monday. That autopsy report showed evidence of marijuana in Mr. Brown’s system, according to someone briefed on the report who was not authorized to discuss it publicly before it was released.

Another, on Monday, was done by a military doctor as part of the Justice Department’s investigation.

On Sunday, at the request of Mr. Brown’s family, the body was examined by Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner.

The findings showed that he was shot at least six times in the front of his body and that he did not appear to have been shot from very close range because no powder burns were found on his body. But that determination could change if burns were found on his clothing, which was not available for examination.

In a news conference on Monday, the Brown family lawyer, Benjamin L. Crump, said that the autopsy he had performed confirmed witness accounts that Mr. Brown was trying to surrender when he was killed.

Daryl Parks, another lawyer for the family, said the autopsy proved that the officer should have been arrested. The bullet that killed Mr. Brown entered the top of his head and came out through the front at an angle that suggested he was facing downward when he was killed, Mr. Parks said. The autopsy did not show what Mr. Brown was doing when the bullet struck his head.

“Why would he be shot in the very top of his head, a 6-foot-4 man?” Mr. Parks said. “It makes no sense. And so that’s what we have. That’s why we believe that those two things alone are ample for this officer to be arrested.”

Piaget Crenshaw, who told reporters that she had witnessed Mr. Brown’s death from her nearby apartment, seemed unsurprised by the eruptions of anger, which have left schools closed and some businesses looted. “This community had underlying problems way before this happened,” Ms. Crenshaw said. “And now the tension is finally broken.”

For businesses here, the days and long nights have been costly and frightening. At Dellena Jones’s hair salon, demonstrators had tossed concrete slabs into the business as Ms. Jones’s two children prepared for what they had expected to be a first day back to school.

“I had a full week that went down to really nothing,” she said of her business, which has sat mostly empty. “They’re too scared to come.” As she spoke, a man walked by and shouted, “You need a gun in there, lady!”

In his news conference, Mr. Obama said that most of the protesters had been peaceful. “As Americans, we’ve got to use this moment to seek out our shared humanity that’s been laid bare by this moment,” Mr. Obama said.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the tactics changed, the nighttime scene did not.

Late Monday night, peaceful protests devolved into sporadic violence, including gunshots, by what the authorities said was a small number of people, and demonstrators were met with tear gas and orders to leave. Two men were shot in the crowd, officials said in an early-morning news conference, and 31 people — some from New York and California — were arrested. Fires were reported in two places. The police were shot at, the authorities said, but did not fire their weapons.

“We can’t have this,” said Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, the Highway Patrol official, who stood near a table that held two guns and a Molotov cocktail that had been seized. “We do not want to lose another life.”

Captain Johnson, who is coordinating security operations, gave no sense of whether the police would change their tactics again on Tuesday. But he urged peaceful protesters to demonstrate during daylight hours so as not to give cover to “violent agitators,” and he pledged, despite the repeated nights of tumult, “We’re going to make this neighborhood whole.”

Adding to the turbulence was confusion over the curfew. Although it was no longer in force, the police demanded around midnight that the crowd disperse, a move the authorities attributed to increasingly unsafe conditions.

Also on Monday, more details emerged from autopsies performed on Mr. Brown’s body. One showed that he had been shot {at least six times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html"">; another found evidence of marijuana in his system.

At another point, as protesters gathered near a convenience store, some of them threw objects; the police responded with tear gas.

And near midnight, the police began announcing over loudspeakers that people needed to leave the area or risk arrest after what the police said were repeated gunshots and a deteriorating situation.

A few blocks away, at the police command post, National Guard members in Army fatigues, some with military police patches on their uniforms, stood ready but never entered the area where protesters were marching. State and local law enforcement authorities oversaw operations there.

Hours later, the Missouri governor, Jay Nixon, ordered the state highway patrol to take over security operations from local law enforcement.

Clashes between {heavily armed}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-missouri-in-wake-of-clashes-calls-to-demilitarize-police.html""> police officers and furious protesters in Ferguson have defined the aftermath of an officer’s fatal shooting of an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, on Saturday, and the latest moves came as federal and state officials scrambled to quell the {growing crisis}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-missouri-town-under-siege-after-police-shooting.html"">. Alarm had been rising across the country at images of a mostly white police force, in a predominantly African-American community, aiming military-style weapons at protesters and firing tear gas and rubber bullets.

Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, the highway patrol official appointed by the governor to take over the response, immediately signaled a change in approach. Captain Johnson told reporters he had ordered troopers to remove their tear-gas masks, and in the early evening he accompanied several groups of protesters through the streets, clasping hands, listening to stories and marching alongside them.

The local police, who had been criticized for not identifying the officer who shot Mr. Brown, said Friday morning that they would release the name of the officer involved.

On Thursday night, the armored vehicles and police cars were gone, and the atmosphere was celebratory. A street barricaded on previous nights was filled with slow-moving cars blasting their horns. A man played a drum across the street from a convenience store that was looted this week. And there were few signs of police officers, let alone a forceful response.

Kimaly Diouf, co-owner of Rehoboth Pharmacy, said the reason for the difference was simple: “Because they’re not tear gassing us tonight.”

Captain Johnson, who is African-American and grew up in the area, said: “We’re just starting today anew. We’re starting a new partnership today. We’re going to move forward today, to put yesterday and the day before behind us.”

Governor Nixon, appearing defensive at times at a briefing in St. Louis County on Thursday afternoon, did not criticize the local police but said of Ferguson, “Lately, it’s looked a little bit more like a war zone, and that’s not acceptable.” He said he had met with residents and listened to their concerns, and said of Mr. Brown, the 18-year-old killed by the police in disputed circumstances on Saturday, that “a young man, a man not much younger than my own sons, lost his life.”

Mr. Nixon, a Democrat, who was state attorney general before being elected governor in 2008, did not describe specific changes to police practices, uniforms or equipment, but said it was time for a “different tone” that balanced the need to prevent looting with the right of residents to assemble and demonstrate.

“Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence, but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,” Mr. Nixon said.

President Obama, speaking to reporters at a hastily arranged news conference on Martha’s Vineyard, where he is vacationing, denounced attacks both on the police and on protesters, and pleaded for “peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.” He said he had spoken to Mr. Nixon and confirmed that he had instructed the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to investigate the fatal shooting, “to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done.

“ On Thursday, a group identifying itself as Anonymous, the computer hacking collective, {disclosed}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-case-roils-collective-called-anonymous.html""> what it said was the name, but the St. Louis County police said it was wrong.

Mr. Obama said that local officials had “a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death.” And he said the Justice Department was consulting with the local officials about appropriate responses to the protests.

“There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,” he said. “There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Mr. Obama also criticized the detentions by local police of two reporters on Wednesday who were recharging their phones and working on their articles at a local McDonald’s, saying, “Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.”

To many, though, the president seemed less emotional and personal than he had been two years ago, when he called for “soul searching” after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, a young black man in Florida. “You know, if I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon,” he said then.

Multiple national officials criticized the decision of the police in Ferguson to use military-style garb and equipment to respond to the protests. “At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a statement. Later on Thursday, Mr. Holder called Mr. Brown’s parents and promised a full, independent investigation, according to a Justice Department official.

Across the {political spectrum}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/politics/seeing-missouri-unrest-views-begin-to-shift-among-conservatives.html"">, officials seemed to agree. “The militarization of the response became more of the problem than any solution,” Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, {told reporters in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/mccaskill-i-came-out-here-to-support-ferguson-318148675869"">.

{Elsewhere in the country}<hyperlink=""http://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/live-updates-on-police-shooting-in-ferguson-mo/#scenes-from-vigils-shared-on-social-media"">, rallies were held to demand justice for Mr. Brown and to protest police tactics. In Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Phoenix, thousands of protesters gathered in public squares with their hands up in gestures of surrender, chanting slogans like, “Hands up, don’t shoot.” In Miami, eight people were arrested.

In Ferguson, officials were unapologetic on Thursday for their tough response to the protesters, which they said had been necessitated by violence and criminality: The police said some protesters had thrown rocks, bottles and even a firebomb at officers. If the situation warrants it, “the tactical units will be out there,” said the Ferguson police chief, Thomas Jackson. “If the crowd is being violent and you don’t want to be violent, get out of the crowd.”

The county executive, Charlie A. Dooley, called on residents to “calm down, stand down and be reasonable.” But the mayor of St. Louis, Francis G. Slay, struck a different tone, describing himself as “sad and angry” and {saying}<hyperlink=""http://www.mayorslay.com/from-fgs/justice-must-be-served-and-reported"">: “Justice must happen. The grieving must be comforted. The angry must be heard. The innocent must be protected.”

Local police units were still helping to patrol Ferguson, but under a new command. The changes were obvious.

Captain Johnson, walking through the streets on Thursday, was approached by Karen Wood, who had been clutching a bright green sign against police brutality. “Do you have a minute to at least talk to, you know, a parent?” Ms. Wood asked.

The captain, a veteran law enforcement officer assigned to oversee security here, stopped. As sweat stained his blue uniform, he clasped Ms. Wood’s right hand and stood, for several minutes, listening to her story.

“Our youth are out here without guidance, without leadership,” Ms. Wood told Captain Johnson. “It’s important that they know there is an order.”

When Ms. Wood finished, Captain Johnson patted her right shoulder and said softly: “I thank you. I thank you for your passion, and we’re going to get better.”

He then joined a group of passing protesters, marching with them as his eyes scanned the roadway. “I know a lot of them,” he said. “Our police department, we have to be reflective of our community, and that’s why we’re all out here.”

Jessica Daniel, who was marching with her young children, said she had listened to speeches by Ms. McCaskill and Mr. Nixon and perceived a change. “The whole tone just turned around,” she said. “Now I feel like they are letting us know they think it’s tragic, too. It’s a beautiful thing.”

Outside a restaurant, London’s Wing House, Kristopher Conner said he was upset both by Mr. Brown’s death and by the violence that followed it. He put up a sign saying proceeds from soda purchases would benefit Mr. Brown’s family. And as officials hoped for calm, so did he.

“I just want it to get back to normal,” Mr. Conner said. “Before everything happened, it was peaceful. You’d come to work, and now some people are just kind of worried that something might start up again.”",1484,NA,NA,Unseen tweet reported by scraper
NYTimes,nyt9,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/us/darren-wilson-identified-as-officer-in-fatal-shooting-in-ferguson-missouri.html,Emotions Flare in Missouri Amid Police Statements,Tanzina Vega; Timothy Williams; Erik Eckholm,08/15/2014,03/23/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — One day after roiling tensions over the police shooting of a black teenager here began to subside, emotions flared anew on Friday as the police identified the officer involved but also released evidence that the victim was a suspect in a convenience store robbery moments before being shot.

The manner in which the police here released the information, which included a 19-page police report on the robbery but no new details about the shooting, led to the spectacle of dueling police news conferences, one led by a white officer who seemed ill at ease and defensive, and the other dominated by a charismatic black officer who expressed solidarity with the crowd even as he pleaded for peace.

The white officer, Thomas Jackson, the police chief in Ferguson, gave a series of incomplete accounts that sowed confusion about whether the officer who shot the teenager knew he was a suspect in the robbery. The black officer, Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, expressed his displeasure with how the information had been released.

“I would have liked to have been consulted,” he said pointedly about the pairing of the shooter’s identity with the robbery accusation.

All week, community members had demanded the name of the officer who killed Michael Brown, 18, last Saturday, but when it finally came, it was accompanied by surveillance videotapes that appeared to show Mr. Brown shoving a store clerk aside as he stole a box of cigarillos.

Mr. Brown’s family, their lawyer and others in the community expressed disgust, accusing the police of trying to divert attention from the central issue — the unexplained shooting of an unarmed young man.

“It is smoke and mirrors,” said Benjamin L. Crump, a lawyer for the Brown family, of the robbery allegations. “Nothing, based on the facts before us, justifies the execution-style murder by this police officer in broad daylight.”

The videotapes seemed to contradict the image portrayed by Mr. Brown’s family of a gentle teenager opposed to violence and on his way to college.

Captain Johnson, who grew up in the area and had been brought in by the governor on Thursday to restore peace after days of confrontations between demonstrators and the police in riot gear and military-style vehicles, said he had not been told that the authorities planned to release the video of the robbery along with the name of the officer. But he sought to calm people down, saying, “In our anger, we have to make sure that we don’t burn down our own house.”

Captain Johnson won over many but also faced skepticism over his role along with anguished questions about who the police really represent and the lack of educational and economic opportunities in Ferguson.

“I find it utterly disgusting,” one man shouted at him. “What am I supposed to tell my people? It looks like you’re a figurehead.”

Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, stood next to Captain Johnson at their news conference and emphasized that the details released Friday were not “the full picture.” He added, “I think the focal point here remains to figure out how and why Michael Brown was killed and to get justice as appropriate in that situation.”

Later Friday, the Justice Department, which is conducting a separate civil rights investigation into the killing, announced that teams of F.B.I. agents would be canvassing the neighborhood where shooting took place in the next several days.

The day began when Chief Jackson said at a news conference that the officer who shot Mr. Brown was Darren Wilson, who has served almost three years in Ferguson and two in another local department and had no disciplinary charges. Officer Wilson, who is white, has been placed on leave, and his location is unknown.

But the release of his name was overshadowed by the simultaneous announcement of the robbery allegations, leading to questions about timing and motives.

In a later news conference, on Friday afternoon at Forestwood Park, a sports complex in Ferguson, Chief Jackson said that Officer Wilson had not been aware that Mr. Brown “was a suspect in the case” and instead had stopped him and a companion “because they were walking down the street blocking traffic.”

But that only highlighted the central issue: How did an officer’s interaction with an unarmed young man escalate into a deadly shooting?

The videotapes, from an unidentified convenience store, show a tall burly man, identified by the police as Mr. Brown, shoving aside a clerk as he left the store with an unpaid-for box of Swisher Sweets cigarillos. According to a police report, Mr. Brown was accompanied at the store by his friend Dorian Johnson, who was also with him when he was shot.

Mr. Johnson has admitted being in the convenience store with Mr. Brown and told investigators from the F.B.I. and St. Louis County that Mr. Brown did “take cigarillos,” Mr. Johnson’s lawyer, Freeman Bosley Jr., a former mayor of St. Louis, told MSNBC.

Standing near a store that was vandalized during protests this week, Mark Jackson, who has participated in the demonstrations, expressed skepticism about police motives in describing the robbery. “They just want to make the case seem more reasonable on their side,” he said. “But at the end of the day, the man didn’t have a gun, so they didn’t have to shoot him.

In his afternoon appearance, Chief Jackson sought to explain why the information was released on Friday. “All I did was release the videotape because I had to,” he said. “I had been sitting on it.” He said his hand was forced by requests by the news media under public records laws. He acknowledged that he had not alerted the other police departments about the tape. “I should have done that,” he said.

Chief Jackson described Officer Wilson as “a gentle, quiet man” and “a distinguished officer.”

Greg Kloeppel, a lawyer for the union representing the Ferguson police, said Officer Wilson received an award for “extraordinary effort in the line of duty” in February.

The police have not released the official report on the shooting because it is now the subject of federal and local investigations. In the robbery report released Friday, an officer wrote that “it is worth mentioning that this incident is related to” the fatal shooting of Mr. Brown.

After seeing Mr. Brown’s body and reviewing the surveillance video, “I was able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect” in the robbery, the officer wrote.

Any suggestion that Officer Wilson sought out Mr. Brown and Mr. Johnson because they were robbery suspects, however, was dispelled by the police chief at the afternoon news conference. Adding to the day’s confusion, Chief Jackson told {The St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/robbery-report-could-have-made-ferguson-officer-more-wary/article_2e863e1b-11ce-5cc3-9098-3075c105d596.html""> later on Friday that while Officer Wilson did not originally approach the two youths as suspects, he was aware of the nearby store robbery.

The officer has said that once he saw cigars in Mr. Brown’s hand, he “realized that he might be the robber,” Chief Jackson said.

After the revelations of the day, the atmosphere in Ferguson on Friday night remained peaceful, though boisterous. Cars clogged streets as horns blared and music played. Hundreds of demonstrators clutched signs and chanted slogans, but many others danced to music. On one street, six people danced atop a white delivery truck.

The police presence was limited. But among the officers on the street was Captain Johnson, who walked among the crowds, posing for pictures and shaking hands.

“I’m pleased with how it’s going,” he said.",1886,NA,NA,NA

The shooting of Mr. Brown, who was unarmed, led to three days of protest, some of it violent, and several tense confrontations between residents of the St. Louis suburban town of 21,000 and the police.

But it doesn’t take a federal investigation to understand the history of racial segregation, economic inequality and overbearing law enforcement that produced so much of the tension now evident on the streets. St. Louis has long been one of the nation’s {most segregated metropolitan areas}<hyperlink=""http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Data/Report/report2.pdf"">, and there remains a high wall between black residents — who overwhelmingly have lower incomes — and the white power structure that dominates City Councils and police departments like the ones in Ferguson.

Until the late 1940s, blacks weren’t allowed to live in most suburban St. Louis County towns, kept out by restrictive covenants that the Supreme Court prohibited in 1948. As whites began to flee the city for the county in the 1950s and ’60s, they used exclusionary zoning tactics — including large, single-family lot requirements that prohibited apartment buildings — to prevent blacks from moving in. Within the city, poverty and unrest grew.

By the 1970s, many blacks started leaving the City of St. Louis as well. Colin Gordon, a professor at the University of Iowa who has {carefully mapped the metropolitan area’s residential history}<hyperlink=""http://mappingdecline.lib.uiowa.edu/"">, said black families were attracted to older, inner-ring suburbs like Ferguson in the northern part of the county because they were built before restrictive zoning tactics and, therefore, allowed apartments.

As black families moved into Ferguson, {the whites fled}<hyperlink=""http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/segregation2010/city.aspx?cityid=2923986"">. In 1980, the town was 85 percent white and 14 percent black; by 2010, it was 29 percent white and 69 percent black. But blacks did not gain political power as their numbers grew. The {mayor and the police chief are white}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html"">, as are five of the six City Council members. The school board consists of six white members and one Hispanic. As Mr. Gordon explains, many black residents, lacking the wealth to buy property, move from apartment to apartment and have not put down political roots.

The disparity is most evident in the Ferguson Police Department, of which only three of 53 officers are black. The largely white force stops black residents far out of proportion to their population, according to {statistics kept by the state attorney general}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/Reports.php?lea=161"">. Blacks account for 86 percent of the traffic stops in the city, and 93 percent of the arrests after those stops. Similar problems exist around St. Louis County, where earlier this year the state chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. {filed a federal civil rights complaint}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/naacp-files-civil-rights-complaint-against-st-louis-county-police/article_5e3ddfee-b883-55a1-bf08-948f74c96e47.html""> alleging widespread racial profiling by police departments.

The circumstances of Mr. Brown’s death are, inevitably, {in dispute}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/us/looting-and-unrest-follows-vigil-for-st-louis-teenager.html"">. Witnesses said he was walking home from a convenience store when stopped by an officer for walking in the middle of the street, and they accused the officer of shooting him multiple times when his hands were raised over his head. The police said Mr. Brown had hit the officer. State and federal investigators are trying to sort out the truth.

What is not in dispute is the sense of permanent grievance held by many residents and shared in segregated urban areas around the country. Though nothing excuses violence and looting, it is clear that local governments have not dispensed justice equally. The death of Mr. Brown is “heartbreaking,” as President Obama {said}<hyperlink=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/12/president-obama-issues-statement-death-michael-brown""> Tuesday, but it is also a reminder of a toxic racial legacy that still infects cities and suburbs across America.",582,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt11,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-images-evoke-civil-rights-era-and-changing-visual-perceptions.html?_r=0,Ferguson Images Evoke Civil Rights Era and Changing Visual Perceptions,Randy Kennedy; Jennifer Schuessler,08/14/2014,04/05/2016,"Danny Lyon, one of the photographers whose work came to define the civil rights upheaval in the South in the 1960s, said he was struck on Thursday when he saw a news image from the racially torn suburb of Ferguson, Mo., showing four police officers arrayed in a phalanx.

In part, it was because Mr. Lyon had taken a picture in 1963 in Birmingham, Ala., that looked very much like it: four officers standing in front of a police car with rifles and helmets, in a city where highly publicized clashes between protesters and the police helped turn the tide of public opinion toward the civil rights movement. But the image from Ferguson, for all its formal similarities, could not have been more different. Today’s riot police officers were wearing military-style camouflage and carrying military-style rifles, their heads and faces obscured by black helmets and gas masks as they stood in front of an armored vehicle.

“It didn’t look like America. It looked like Soweto,” Mr. Lyon said, referring to the South African township that was a hotbed of protests against apartheid. “It looked like soldiers. And soldiers’ job isn’t to protect. Their job is to kill people and to be ready to die.”

The photographs that have emerged during several days of unrest in Ferguson after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer have drawn mournful comparisons to pictures of the Deep South in the 1960s or of more recent racial unrest, like the 1992 Los Angeles riots. But they have also prompted a flood of commentary about the differences half a century has made in the visual economy.

They have raised questions about whether photos have the same power now to sway public opinion and political will; about the increasingly sophisticated ways an image-saturated public reads a picture’s racial and political subtext; and about the rapid transformation of the protests, even more so than the Los Angeles riots or the Occupy movement, into a war of images. The war pits what appears to be a large-scale paramilitary police presence against crowds of African-American protesters walking with their hands raised in surrender — or people throwing things and looting.

The Philadelphia Daily News was a case in point in the speed with which 21st-century image parsing can occur. In the wee hours of Thursday morning — in response to readers’ comments on Twitter about a photo the newspaper had planned to run on its front page, showing an African-American protester in Ferguson about to hurl what looked like a firebomb — editors {changed their minds}<hyperlink=""http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/08/14/daily-news-cover-changed-overnight-changed/""> and instead used a photograph of an African-American woman standing in front of police officers, holding a sign urging answers in the death of the teenager, Michael Brown.

An assistant city editor wrote on Twitter to those objecting to the first picture that they would be able to understand the whole story, in a “sympathetic treatment,” if they opened the paper. But a reader responded, “Yes, in ten-point font I can see the fine print, which is completely overwhelmed by the picture.”

In the civil rights era, the visual stamp of the movement was determined by newspapers and the nightly news. Today, the imagery one sees depends on the filters one uses. One person’s Twitter feed may be full of footage of police firing tear gas or of peaceful protesters with their hands up. But David J. Garrow, a historian at the University of Pittsburgh’s law school and the author of {several books}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/books/driven-to-martyrdom.html""> on the civil rights movement, noted that when he searched for images of Ferguson on Google, roughly half showed what appeared to be looting.

Such images look “more like Watts in 1965 or Newark in 1967, not Birmingham in 1963 or Selma in 1965,” Dr. Garrow said. And historically, he said, such photos were “deadly when it came to white public opinion.”

In Ferguson, the police seem to be just as worried about the dominance of certain imagery. The city’s police chief, Thomas Jackson, said during a news conference Thursday that officials were meeting “to talk about not only the tactics but the appearance” of the police force, whose resemblance to American soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan has quickly become a social media theme.

Some visual echoes of the 1960s, like the Ferguson police’s use of dogs, may be unintentional. (During the 1963 March on Washington, President John F. Kennedy forbade the use of dogs for crowd control, knowing how badly it would play.) But on the protesters’ side, there have been deliberate efforts to evoke the nonviolent protests of the civil rights era, like T-shirts with the slogan “I Am a Man,” {borrowed from signs}<hyperlink=""http://civilrightsmuseum.org/exhibit/i-am-a-man/""> carried during the 1968 Memphis sanitation strike.

Diane McWhorter, the author of “{Carry Me Home}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/03/18/reviews/010318.18shiplet.html"">: Birmingham, Alabama, the Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution,” said she also saw echoes of those signs in the protesters’ hands-up gesture, an instantly recognizable cue that seems to be both born of the quick-read Internet news cycle and able to shape it.

“In one case, it’s a kind of mass witness of personhood,” Ms. McWhorter said of the “I Am a Man” signs, “and in the other case, a mass witness of innocence. Those images are very powerful.”

Some historians see dangers in those visual echoes. Martin A. Berger, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the author of “{Seeing Through Race}<hyperlink=""http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520268647"">: A Reinterpretation of Civil Rights Photography,” said that while images of a protester throwing a firebomb or of the police spraying tear gas may start conversations, the historical associations can also distort public understanding.

“We can look at these pictures and say that Ferguson is the same as Los Angeles or Birmingham, because it looks the same,” Dr. Berger said. “But we have to ask not just, ‘What is the same?’ but also, ‘What are the ways in which America has changed?’ To just have another conversation that stops at the level of police brutality doesn’t really get us very far.”",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt12,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-police-cite-safety-risk-in-decision-not-to-name-officer-in-shooting.html,Missouri Police Cite Threats in Deciding Not to Name Officer Who Shot Teenager, Julie Bosman; Timothy Williams,08/12/2014,04/05/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The chief of police here said Tuesday that he had reconsidered his decision to release the name of the police officer involved in the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager and would not do so because of concerns about the officer’s safety.

The Ferguson Police Department had said it would release the officer’s name by noon on Tuesday, but then it reversed itself after it said that threats had been made on social media against the officer and the city’s police.

“The value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family,” the police chief, Thomas Jackson, said in announcing a decision that was quickly criticized. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.

The change came amid another day of protests in the St. Louis suburbs where the teenager, Michael Brown, 18, was shot several times on Saturday by an officer as he and a friend walked from a convenience store. The circumstances remain in dispute. The police say Mr. Brown hit the officer and tried to steal his gun; Mr. Brown’s family and friends deny that.

The F.B.I. has opened a civil rights inquiry into the shooting, and the case is being investigated by the St. Louis County Police. The results of an autopsy on Mr. Brown have not been released.

The protests have at times turned violent: Stores have been looted, and at least one business was set on fire. The police have made more than 40 arrests since Sunday and fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators.

A gathering on Tuesday night turned into another skirmish with police officers, who used tear gas to disperse the remnants of a bigger crowd. Two shooting incidents were also reported nearby, but authorities told local media that it was unclear whether they were related to the protest. In one incident, a woman was injured in what appeared to be a drive-by shooting. In the other, the local media reported that police shot a man who had pulled a gun on an officer. Police, according to media reports, were responding to reports of several men with guns and wearing ski masks.

During a peaceful protest march on Tuesday to the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office in Clayton, Mo., the seat of St. Louis County, demonstrators chanted “Don’t shoot!” and raised their hands over their heads — the pose they say Mr. Brown was in when he was shot.

Also Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration barred aircraft from flying below 3,000 feet over Ferguson. The county police department had asked the agency to issue the ban on Monday after its helicopters were shot at “a couple of different times,” Officer Brian Schellman, a department spokesman, said.

President Obama, in his first comments about the shooting, called the death of Mr. Brown heartbreaking but urged residents to remain calm. “I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions,” the president said in a statement on Tuesday, “but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Mo., and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.”

In {an interview on Tuesday with MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri"">, Dorian Johnson, a friend of Mr. Brown’s, gave a description of the shooting. He said that he and Mr. Brown had been walking in the street when an officer drove up and told them to get onto the sidewalk. The two stayed in the street after telling the officer that they were close to Mr. Johnson’s house. The officer, who had passed them, then backed up, almost hitting them in doing so. He then tried to open his door, which hit Mr. Brown, and when the door bounced shut, the officer reached out and grabbed Mr. Brown.

“Mike was trying to get away from being choked,” Mr. Johnson told MSNBC. At that point, he said, the officer pulled a gun and fired, striking Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown “did not reach for the officer’s weapon at all,” he said.

Mr. Johnson said that he and Mr. Brown began to run, and while he ducked behind a car, Mr. Brown kept going. After Mr. Brown was shot a second time, Mr. Johnson said, he turned to face the officer with his hands up, the officer fired several more shots, and Mr. Brown fell.

Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing the Brown family, said Tuesday that Mr. Johnson had yet to be called in for questioning by the police and wanted to speak only to federal authorities.

“He does not trust the local law enforcement community,” Mr. Crump said. “How could he? He saw his friend executed.”

Mr. Crump, who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager who was shot and killed by a neighborhood-watch volunteer in Florida in 2012, criticized the Ferguson police chief’s decision not to reveal the name of the officer who killed Mr. Brown. He said it only deepened the mistrust among blacks in the city, which is about two-thirds African-American but has a police force that is predominately white.

Chief Jackson said a provision of state law allowed police departments to withhold an officer’s name if there were concerns about personal safety. Normally, a department has 72 hours to disclose a name.

The rash of threats on social media, Chief Jackson said, led to his decision. He said he had also ordered his officers to ride two to a car because rocks were being thrown at patrol cars.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, at a news conference on Tuesday in St. Louis with the Brown family, called for an end to the violence in Ferguson. “Some of us are making the story about how mad we are,” he said. “To become violent in Michael Brown’s name is to betray the gentle giant that he was.”

Michael Brown Sr., the victim’s father, echoed that sentiment. “I need justice for my son,” he said.

Later, a crowd gathered outside a church where members of the Brown family appeared with Mr. Sharpton. Many people urged calm, reminding one another that television cameras were present; some people made sure others did not spill into the streets.

“Stay on the sidewalks,” one man said. “The whole world is watching.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

There have been passionate but peaceful protests to be sure, but there has also been some violence and looting. Police forces in the town responded with an outlandish military-like presence more befitting Baghdad than suburban Missouri.

There were armored vehicles, flash grenades and a seemingly endless supply of tear gas — much of it Pentagon trickle-down. There were even officers perched atop vehicles, in camouflage and body armor, pointing weapons in the direction of peaceful protesters.

Let me be clear here: Pointing a gun at an innocent person is an act of violence and provocation.

Americans were aghast at the images, and condemnation was swift and bipartisan. The governor put the state’s Highway Patrol in charge of security. Tensions seemed to subside, for a day.

But then on Friday, when releasing the name of the officer who did the shooting, the police chief also released details and images of a robbery purporting to show Brown stealing cigars from a local convenience store and pushing a store employee in the process.

The implication seemed to be that Wilson was looking for the person who committed the convenience store crime when he encountered Brown. But, later in the day, the chief said Wilson didn’t know Brown was a robbery suspect when they encountered each other.

Something seemed off. The police chief’s decision to release the details of the robbery and the images — without releasing an image of Wilson — struck many as perfidious. In a strongly worded statement, Brown’s {family and attorneys}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/michael-brown-family-statement_n_5682546.html""> accused the chief of attempting to assassinate the character of the dead teen.

Some also deemed it an attempt at distraction from the central issue: An officer shot an unarmed teenager who witnesses claim had raised his hands in surrender when at least some of the shots were fired, which the family and its attorneys called “a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.”

The Justice Department is even investigating whether Brown’s civil rights were violated. This would include the excessive use of force. As the {department makes clear}<hyperlink=""http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/polmis.php"">, this “does not require that any racial, religious, or other discriminatory motive existed.”

It’s impossible to truly know the chief’s motives for his decision to release the robbery information at the same time as the officer’s name, but the effect was clear: That night, a fragile peace was shattered. There was more looting, although peaceful protesters struggled heroically to block the violent ones.

On Saturday, the governor issued a midnight curfew for the town. A small band of protesters defied it and some were arrested.

The community is struggling to find its way back to normalcy, but it would behoove us to dig a bit deeper into the underlying frustrations that cause a place like Ferguson to erupt in the first place and explore the untenable nature of our normal.

Yes, there are the disturbingly repetitive and eerily similar circumstances of many cases of unarmed black people being killed by police officers. This reinforces {black people’s beliefs}<hyperlink=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/12/vast-majority-of-blacks-view-the-criminal-justice-system-as-unfair/""> — supportable by actual data — that blacks are treated less fairly by the police.

But I submit that this is bigger than that. The frustration we see in Ferguson is about not only the present act of perceived injustice but also the calcifying system of inequity — economic, educational, judicial — drawn largely along racial lines.

In 1951, Langston Hughes began his poem “{Harlem}<hyperlink=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/175884"">” with a question: “What happens to a dream deferred?” Today, I must ask: What happens when one desists from dreaming, when the very exercise feels futile?

The discussion about issues in the black community too often revolves around a false choice: systemic racial bias or poor personal choices. In fact, these factors are interwoven like the fingers of clasped hands. People make choices within the context of their circumstances and those circumstances are affected — sometimes severely — by bias.

These biases do material damage as well as help breed a sense of disenfranchisement and despair, which in turn can have a depressive effect on aspiration and motivation. This all feeds back on itself.

If we want to truly address the root of the unrest in Ferguson, we have to ask ourselves how we can break this cycle.

Otherwise, Hughes’s last words of “Harlem,” referring to the dream deferred, will continue to be prophetic: “does it explode?”",628,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt14,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/us/lack-of-leadership-and-a-generational-split-hinder-protests-in-ferguson.html,Lack of Leadership and a Generational Split Hinder Protests in Ferguson,Julie Bosman,08/16/2014,04/05/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The unrest in Ferguson began one week ago, on the quiet side street of Canfield Drive, when residents were startled by a series of gunshots and poured out of their homes. They watched and wept as the police stood guard for hours over the body of 18-year-old Michael Brown, splayed face down in the street.

But over time, the demonstrations have changed to become an amalgam of peaceful protesters — some furious about what they say is endemic abuse of African-Americans by the police — and separate groups that have carried out acts of violence and looting.

Early Saturday morning, the divisions became even more evident during a four-hour standoff with the police. One group, some of its members wearing bandannas, broke into a liquor store and left clutching bottles of alcohol. But at other retail outlets, like a beauty supply store, demonstrators blocked the looters’ way.

Arguments ensued on the streets, with some people pleading to avoid confrontations, while others tried to encourage the crowd to take on law enforcement officers.

Gov. Jay Nixon cited the violent acts on Saturday when he declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew.

“We will not allow a handful of looters to endanger the rest of this community,” he said.

Night after night the streets have attracted disparate groups, some from within Ferguson, and some from hundreds of miles away. As demonstrators gather each evening, it is not unusual to see some people carrying handguns while only a block away parents push their toddlers in strollers. Neither the peaceful protesters nor the hotheaded elements appear to have any direction or a unified leadership.

Many of those on the street say they have shrugged off guidance from elders in the African-American establishment, and even from the Brown family, which has repeatedly pleaded for calm.

One protester, DeVone Cruesoe, of the St. Louis area, standing on Canfield Drive last week said, “Do we have a leader? No.” Pointing to the spot where Mr. Brown was killed, he said, “You want to know who our leader is? Mike Brown.”

The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson arrived at the protest on Friday night. “People were so warm,” he said. “It was that kind of celebration.”

But he said on Saturday morning that the violent tone of the protest reflected anger over police tactics. Ferguson, he said, is “a metaphor for urban America,” where many minorities and poor whites lack access to jobs, transportation and health care.

Many African-American civic leaders in St. Louis said they were frustrated by their inability to guide the protesters.

At an emotional meeting at a church on Thursday, clergy members despaired over the seemingly uncontrollable nature of the protest movement and the flare-ups of violence that older people in the group abhorred.

“We had the so-called power brokers here on Tuesday,” said the Rev. Robert C. Scott, pastor of Central Baptist Church in St. Louis, referring to a meeting earlier in the week. “Nothing has changed. It has exacerbated. We should not be on the news looking like Iraq or Beirut.”

Derrick Robbins, another pastor in attendance, said there had been no negotiations between the police and protesters.

“Everybody’s trying to be a leader, but it’s not working,” he said. “I wish we could come together and have a unified front. That is not happening.”

Some people have suggested that there is a generational divide. George Richardson, who works for the building department in East St. Louis, said the younger protesters were acting independently, ignoring advice from their parents.

“There is a gulf between the leadership and the boots on the ground,” Mr. Richardson said. “These kids do not understand why the nonviolence movement is the best way to get done what we need to get done. They don’t really know what to do.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist and television host, mentioned that voter turnout in Ferguson, Mo., was a mere 12 percent in the last election, and pledged to help boost that number with a registration drive. Twelve percent, he said, was “an insult to your children.” He wasn’t the first to think of channeling the anger over Mike Brown’s death in this particular direction. {Twitter users}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/BusquedaJess/statuses/500708766208114690""> on Saturday noted voter registration tables in front of the makeshift memorial where the unarmed teenager was shot by a police officer.

Encouraging more participation in the democratic process in a community that feels alienated from political power  — hence the demonstrations — seems like an obviously good idea; and one that’s particularly compelling because it’s so simple. Voting is an alternative to protesting in the streets.

And yet, the executive director of the Missouri Republican Party, Matt Wills, denounced the plan.

Mr. Wills told the right-wing website Breitbart: “If that’s not fanning the political flames, I don’t know what is. I think it’s not only disgusting but completely inappropriate.”

On another right-wing site, Red State, Dan McLaughlin {also argued}<hyperlink=""http://www.redstate.com/2014/08/18/ferguson-missouri-fog-partisanship-ideology/""> that there was something indecent about the registration drive. Ferguson presents an opportunity for “Right and Left” to find “common ground,” he wrote. But “the minute you turn your energies into just another effort to register Democratic voters and fire up the Democratic base in advance of an election,” he argued, “the harder you make it to keep the common ground from vanishing in the fog.”

In case you’re wondering, Mr. Sharpton did not say that the residents of Ferguson should vote for Democrats; he said they should vote, full stop. He didn’t even mention the ideological composition of the area’s governing bodies; though he did mention their racial composition (lopsidedly white in a majority black community). And of course the residents of Ferguson, once registered, will have the ability to vote for anyone they please — not just Democrats.

Isn’t it telling that both Mr. Wills and Mr. McLaughlin make no distinction between voter registration and Democratic registration? Mr. Sharpton, a Democrat, may well assume the same, and that’s telling, too.

Both sides here seem to think that enlarging the franchise is good for Democrats and that, conversely, keeping it small is good for Republicans — a dynamic that also exists at the national level. Republicans try to make voting more difficult to vote, by passing voter ID laws, and Democrats resist these changes, confident that high turnout is better for liberals.",165,NA,NA,Unseen tweet reported by scraper
NYTimes,nyt16,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teenager-and-officer-scuffled-before-shooting-chief-says.html,Anonymity in Police Shooting Fuels Anger in Missouri,Julie Bosman; Erik Eckholm,08/13/2014,04/05/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — In the five days since an unarmed young black man was fatally shot by a police officer here, the selective release of information about the shooting, and especially the anonymity granted to the officer, has stoked frustrations in this largely African-American community north of St. Louis, where residents describe increasingly tense relations with the police.

The police chief, Thomas Jackson, has repeatedly declined to identify the officer, who has been put on administrative leave. But on Wednesday, the chief did offer a new detail about the shooting, which has kindled nights of racial unrest and an unyielding police response with tear gas, rubber bullets and arrests.

Chief Jackson said that the officer who shot Michael Brown, 18, on Saturday was struck in the face during the encounter and treated at a hospital. Touching his own cheek, the chief said that a side of the officer’s face was swollen from what the police have described as a struggle in which Mr. Brown assaulted the officer and tried to take his gun — an account disputed by a witness, a friend of Mr. Brown’s who said his hands were raised when the last of several shots was fired.

Despite persistent and increasingly angry calls from the public to release the officer’s name, Chief Jackson said the officer required protection after numerous death threats had been made. Computer hackers, saying they were outraged by police conduct, now have also joined the fray.

Anonymous, the loosely organized group of international hackers, said on Twitter that it had broken into Ferguson’s municipal computer system. It released details about city workers and posted photos of Jon Belmar, the chief of the St. Louis County police who is conducting the investigation into the shooting, as well as his wife, son and daughter. It also posted his address and phone number. The group threatened to bring down city, county and federal networks if the police overreacted to rallies and protests.

On Wednesday night, scores of police officers in riot gear and in armored trucks showed up to disperse protesters who had gathered on the streets near the scene of the shooting. Some officers perched atop the vehicles with their guns trained on the crowds while protesters chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot.” A police spokesman said that some demonstrators had thrown Molotov cocktails at officers and that some had tried to set fires. The police used tear gas on demonstrators, and some protesters said rubber bullets had been fired at them. Police said one officer appeared to have suffered a broken ankle after being hit by a brick.

The police made more than 10 arrests. Among those arrested was Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman, who had been documenting the protests on social media, his wife said on Twitter.

Two reporters covering the protests also said they had been arrested inside a McDonald’s for trespassing and later released without charges or an explanation. The reporters, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of The Huffington Post, both said they had been handled roughly by the police.

Chief Jackson and the St. Louis County prosecutor, Robert P. McCulloch, held news conferences on Wednesday to try to allay concerns without divulging the officer’s name or details of the investigation. Neither would say how many times Mr. Brown had been shot.

Mr. McCulloch promised a thorough investigation but refused to say how long it would take. “There is no timeline,” he said. But he added that all the evidence would be made public, whether or not there was an indictment.

Whether to identify an officer in a charged situation like a shooting has been a continual tug of war around the country, pitting the desire of police departments to protect their own against the demands of victims’ relatives and the public for accountability.

“I get why they want to protect him,” said Meko Taylor, 36, of Ferguson, who was at a protest on Wednesday. “But the people want answers. When we get answers, things will calm down.”

David A. Harris, an expert on police misconduct and accountability at the University of Pittsburgh Law School, said: “Police departments do not welcome disclosure or the input of outsiders. So when you have a problem like this, it’s hardly surprising to see that they are very reluctant to give out information.”

That reflexive, insular stance is increasingly being questioned in the courts, said Merrick J. Bobb, a Los Angeles-based consultant on police oversight. “What is happening is that in a number of jurisdictions, voluntarily or as a result of a lawsuit, the ability of police to keep the name of the officer secret has been constrained,” he said.

In Missouri, legal groups citing the state’s sunshine law, which requires government agencies to release most documents to the public, have joined with community leaders to press for information about the officer who shot Mr. Brown.

On Tuesday, the Missouri office of the American Civil Liberties Union wrote to the Ferguson and St. Louis County Police Departments requesting unredacted copies of the “incident reports” describing the death of Mr. Brown. The A.C.L.U. said it had been told by the St. Louis County police that it would not release an incident report because the investigation was continuing. Adding to the pressure, the National Bar Association, an organization of African-American lawyers and judges, also filed a records request on Wednesday with the Ferguson Police Department.

By law, police departments have three days to comply, but if they choose to withhold an officer’s name, they could argue that circumstances warrant an exception. Then the petitioning groups would have to file lawsuits.

There is no federal constitutional right, under the First Amendment, to information about government activities, including internal police reports, said Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. Rather, individual states have disclosure laws with varying degrees of bite, and the country’s thousands of law enforcement agencies have their own rules and subcultures regarding disclosures.

The inconsistency in policies, even when a freedom of information law is on the books, is illustrated in New York City. In most cases, the New York Police Department refuses to release the names of officers who have shot people, at least in the days immediately afterward. If a shooting attracts widespread attention, however, the officer’s name rarely remains a secret for long.

In the July 17 case of Eric Garner, who died after being wrestled down by the police, including one officer who apparently used a forbidden chokehold, the department did reveal the name of the officer — but after two days, and only after wide public viewing of a videotape of the fatal confrontation. By that time, the news media had already reported the officer’s name based on unnamed sources.

Mr. Harris said that while it was understandable that police officials would try to protect their officers from threats and unfair accusations, silence also had its risks. “This case is not being tried yet, but the narrative is being forged in the public arena,” he said of the Ferguson shooting. “When that goes on, information is put out selectively and withheld selectively.”

“There is real danger in that,” he said, “because ultimately law enforcement depends on the trust of the people they serve.”

On Wednesday, the St. Louis County medical examiner’s office said it would take two to three weeks to complete the autopsy of Mr. Brown, including a toxicology report, which is standard procedure in such deaths.

Suzanne McCune, a forensic administrator at the office, said that a preliminary autopsy was completed Monday and found that Mr. Brown had died of gunshot wounds, but she gave no other details. She added that Mr. Brown’s body had been released to his family. Ms. McCune said the police department would decide whether to approve the release of the report once it was complete.

Benjamin L. Crump, a lawyer representing the Brown family, said that arrangements were being made for a private autopsy to be performed in the next week or so. “The family wants an autopsy done by somebody who is objective and who does not have a relationship with the Ferguson police,” Mr. Crump said.

Trying to control protests that have sprouted up daily in Ferguson and intensified after dark, the mayor and the City Council posted a letter on Wednesday on the city website asking protesters to limit their demonstrations to daylight hours.

The police have made over 50 arrests since Sunday.

“We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner,” the letter said. “Unfortunately, those who wish to co-opt peaceful protests and turn them into violent demonstrations have been able to do so over the past several days during the evening hours.”

Chief Jackson said the request did not amount to a curfew.

As to the actions of Anonymous in releasing the names of department personnel, Chief Jackson said protection had been assigned to some and others had taken vacation.

Anonymous also released on Wednesday what it said were county 911 tapes from the time of the shooting on Saturday. Most initial calls seemed to be about crowd control, but the tapes also suggested that dispatchers learned from an early call that a police officer was involved. Chief Jackson said he had not heard the tapes.",182,NA,NA,NA

As a resident of St. Louis, she has long been aware of strained race relations in the area. What she did not expect, however, was to be caught in the middle of it.

Ms. Curtis, 36, is a freelance photographer who has been covering the unrest since Sunday, taking pictures of protests, often late into the night when clashes occur between small groups and the mostly white police force. In recent days, she said, it has gotten harder to cover the events since police have been cutting off streets and {making it difficult for reporters}<hyperlink=""http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/263179/rtdna-to-fergusons-chief-of-police-journalists-need-full-and-fair-access/""> to have access. Last night, police arrested then released two reporters, one from the Washington Post and the other from the Huffington Post, who said they had been subjected to excessive force.

Ms. Curtis, who herself was hit in the leg by a projectile earlier in the week, said access to public streets has been severely curtailed by officers in military-like tactical gear.

“It has become increasingly worse,” she said this morning. “Two journalists were taken into custody while trying to transmit from a McDonald’s. I feel the police have been more aggressive; more forceful. There have been officers who have seen me out there every night, and even they have been more aggressive with me, trying to push me out.”

Although Ms. Curtis trained as a photojournalist and had covered spot news earlier in her career, she found herself in more recent years doing corporate and nonprofit work. Although she has never covered this kind of confrontation before, she did have some training — a few years ago before going to Haiti on an editorial assignment, she paid her own way to attend hostile-environment and first-aid training.

A similar initiative led her to start her assignment early. She had been asked by the {National Desk to cover}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-police-cite-safety-risk-in-decision-not-to-name-officer-in-shooting.html""> a protest on Monday, but she ventured out on her own the day before to cover a vigil where the family of Michael Brown was expected. She figured it would be a good way to ensure she had pictures of the family as well as a sense of the story on the streets.

The vigil, she said, started out peacefully.

“It wasn’t until the vigil started to break up and the crowd dispersed that I went to leave and couldn’t,” she said. “The police had blocked off the main road to Ferguson with barricades at each end of the road.”

As the night progressed, she said, people from outside the neighborhood — “a handful” — started vandalizing and looting local businesses.

“The police stood their ground and watched as the looters destroyed some businesses,” she said. “After the damage had been done, the police cleared everybody out, even if they lived in the area.”

She said she stuck close to the police for about a half-hour, until two officers escorted her back to her car and out of the area. In the intervening days, she said, things have stayed relatively peaceful until nightfall. Yesterday, she said, police forced protesters into a neighborhood where they tossed tear gas. She also saw a tear-gas canister tossed at a television crew on the street.

“All it seems to take is one rock or bottle thrown at the police and things just completely escalate,” she said.

But most of the protesters, she said, have been peaceful, even if they are clearly upset by their daily dealings with the police. At the same time, she said, she found them welcoming of coverage.

“I really feel they want their story to get out there,” she said. “They want people in the greater St. Louis area and the United States to understand the larger issue they are dealing with, which is racial tension.”

The events were organized on Twitter by a loose network of Twitter users and social media activists under the hashtag {#NMOS14}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NMOS14&src=typd"">, which stands for National Moment of Silence.

Organizers have also {used Facebook to invite and register}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/NMOS2014""> participants for the vigils in each city. A {Facebook page for the vigil in Civic Center Park in Denver}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1459381507666962/"">, for example, listed about 200 people out of 1,400 invited indicated that they planned to attend. The {vigil at Malcolm X Park in Washington}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/events/622649584500191/""> had 1,400 registrants out of the 7,800 who were invited. Washington and Chicago are so far, expected to have the largest turnouts, organizers said.

In a document listing the Facebook pages for the cities hosting vigils, organizers asked participants to tie a red cloth around their arms, except “in areas where doing so can cause conflict.” The vigils will begin at 7 p.m. Eastern time and a moment of silence is planned at 7:20 p.m.

Kelly Hayes, who is helping to coordinate the Chicago vigil, which will be at the Richard J. Daley Center, said the event was expected to be peaceful and would include participants holding signs with the names and details of victims of “folks from Chicago and all around the country who have fallen to police violence.”

Ms. Hayes said the Chicago vigil would also include poetry readings and music by members of a nonprofit organization called the {Black Youth Project}<hyperlink=""http://www.blackyouthproject.com/"">. “We want to make sure that the voices heard are coming out of the most heavily impacted communities,” she said.

The vigils coincide with another set of rallies said to be organized by the hacktivist collective Anonymous that will be held in many of the same locations as the National Moment of Silence, a move that has been criticized by some of the vigil organizers.

“In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,” Mr. Obama said at the White House. “In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear.”

“We’ve made extraordinary progress” in race relations, he said, “but we have not made enough progress.”

Mr. Obama’s comments were a notable moment for the first African-American president during the most racially fraught crisis of his time in office, set off by the {fatal shooting of Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/us/ferguson-mo-michael-brown-and-darren-wilson-2-paths-to-a-fatal-encounter.html"">, an unarmed black teenager, by the police. Mr. Obama and his administration are working to restore peace in Ferguson and ensure an evenhanded investigation into the shooting all while responding to anger — in Missouri and elsewhere — among blacks about what they say is systemic discrimination by law enforcement officials.

“To a community in Ferguson that is rightly hurting and looking for answers, let me call once again for us to seek some understanding rather than simply holler at each other,” the president said in his first extended comments on the chaos there.

Mr. Obama took pains to make clear that he was not issuing a blanket indictment of either the protesting crowds or the law enforcement officers responding to the demonstrations. He criticized both the “small minority” of protesters who he said were exploiting the anger over Mr. Brown’s death to loot Ferguson stores as well as the police who used violence of their own against demonstrators.

“While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos,” Mr. Obama said during questioning by reporters.

Still, he emphasized, “there’s no excuse for excessive force by police or any action that denies people the right to protest peacefully.”

Mr. Obama has mostly avoided speaking about himself or his agenda in explicitly racial terms, but he has increasingly been less reticent to do so.

“I’m personally committed to changing both perception and reality,” Mr. Obama said, making explicit reference to the $200 million, five-year initiative known as “My Brother’s Keeper” that he started in February to address the plight of black youth.

It was inspired in part by the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, another unarmed black teenager, in 2012 in Florida and the acquittal of the man who killed him, George Zimmerman.

“If I had a son,” Mr. Obama said after Mr. Martin’s death, “he’d look like Trayvon.”

The president’s aides have said the situation in Ferguson has affected him in similar ways.

“You have young men of color in many communities who are more likely to end up in jail or in the criminal justice system than they are in a good job or in college,” Mr. Obama said on Monday. He said part of his job was to “to get at those root causes.”

The president spoke after receiving a formal briefing from Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. on the situation in Ferguson.

Mr. Holder announced Sunday that a federal medical examiner would conduct an independent autopsy of Mr. Brown.

The Police Department in Ferguson has been {harshly criticized}<hyperlink=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/us/darren-wilson-identified-as-officer-in-fatal-shooting-in-ferguson-missouri.html""> for refusing to clarify the circumstances of the shooting and then escalating tensions by responding to protests using military weapons and gear.

Beavers; Michael Shank,08/14/2014,04/07/2016,"WASHINGTON — FERGUSON, Mo., has become a virtual war zone. In the wake of the shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, outsize armored vehicles have lined streets and tear gas has filled the air. Officers dressed in camouflage uniforms from Ferguson’s 53-person police force have pointed M-16s at the very citizens they are sworn to protect and serve.

The police response has shocked America. The escalating tension in this town of 21,200 people between a largely white police department and a majority African-American community is a central part of the crisis, but the militarization of the police is a dimension of the story that has national implications.

Ferguson’s police force got equipped this way thanks to the Pentagon, and it’s happening all over the country. The Department of Defense provides military-grade weapons and equipment to local law enforcement agencies through the 1033 program, enacted by Congress in 1997 to expand the practice of dispensing extra military gear. Due to the defense industry’s bloated contracts, there is a huge surplus. To date, the Pentagon has donated military equipment worth more than $4 billion to local law enforcement agencies. And the giving goes on, to police forces in all 50 states in the union.

Ferguson’s police department {is just one recipient}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-michael-brown-militarization-column/14006383/"">; {small towns all over America}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/03/10/america-police-military-weapons-column/5789445/""> are now the proud owners of “MRAP” armored vehicles. The largess has gotten so out of hand that a congressman, Hank C. Johnson, is introducing a bill to block the 1033 handouts.

Whereas the Department of Defense hands over weapons directly, the Department of Homeland Security provides funding for arms. It has distributed more than {$34 billion}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/12/20/local-cops-ready-for-war-with-homeland-security-funded-military-weapons.html""> through “terrorism grants,” enabling local police departments to acquire {such absurd items}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/12/20/local-cops-ready-for-war-with-homeland-security-funded-military-weapons.html""> as a surveillance drone and an Army tank.

For a police department like Ferguson’s, the path to becoming a paramilitary force is a short one. After loading up with free military gear, it is no surprise that law enforcement agents want to use it. In fact, the 1033 program’s regulations require that the police use what they receive within one year.

In the absence of extreme violence or actual terrorist threat, what happens — as the {American Civil Liberties Union has documented}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing""> — is that the equipment and weapons are used by SWAT teams in routine situations, such as low-level drug raids or the execution of search warrants. As Ferguson shows, this militarizing of routine police work exacerbates tensions and increases the likelihood of disorder. This, in turn, appears to justify a militarized police response, and so the cycle continues.

The federal government can stop this increased militarization at its source. The Pentagon must end its transfer of military-grade weapons through the 1033 program. And the Department of Homeland Security should stop handing out the terrorism grants. The ease with which police departments can avail themselves of Homeland Security funding for enormous caches of weapons and ammunition in the name of counterterrorism is deeply disconcerting.

Veteran police chiefs who have served on the front lines of America’s biggest police forces are voicing their concern. {Norman H. Stamper, the former police chief of Seattle}<hyperlink=""http://www.thenation.com/article/164501/paramilitary-policing-seattle-occupy-wall-street"">, has written with regret about the military-style tactics employed during the protests against the 1999 World Trade Organization conference in Seattle; he now advocates “an authentic partnership in policing the city,” involving rank-and-file officers, civilian employees and community representatives.

Militarizing our police officers does not have to be the first response to violence. Alternatives are available. {Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.’s statement Thursday}<hyperlink=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-854.html""> highlighting resources like the Department of Justice’s Community Oriented Policing Services office is welcome. This is where the government should be investing — instead of grants for guns.

Police militarization is a growing national threat. If the federal government doesn’t act to stop it, the future of law enforcement everywhere will look a lot like Ferguson.",471,NA,NA,NA

They caused the city’s web servers to crash, forcing officials to communicate by text. They posted the names and address of the county police chief’s family. And then on Thursday they released what they said was the name of the police officer who killed Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, on Saturday.

Members of Anonymous — the shadowy, snide international collective of hackers and online activists — have played a key role in the growing confrontation outside St. Louis over Mr. Brown’s death, goading and threatening the authorities, and calling the effort Operation Ferguson.

Operations in the collective’s decade-long history have included taking down the World Cup website to protest poverty, helping identify assailants in a rape case in Ohio, cheering on the Occupy Wall Street movement and carrying out coordinated cyberassaults on repressive foreign governments. But this one ran into trouble faster than most.

The St. Louis police said on Twitter that the name given out was wrong, and that the man was not even a police officer. Within Anonymous there was an unusual amount of dissent. In interviews, in private chat channels and on Twitter, members accused those who had initially posted details of producing faulty information and putting one another in harm’s way by openly chatting about their methods online.

On Thursday, Twitter suspended @TheAnonMessage, the account that had posted the dubious information about the officer, although Twitter officials declined to say why. Those behind the account said in an email that they would post information from a backup account, {@TheAnonMessage2}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TheAnonMessage2"">, while other Twitter accounts affiliated with Anonymous tried to distance themselves from the post.

“But for the record, one last time. Operation Ferguson has NOT, repeat NOT released the name of Mike Brown’s killer, nor have we claimed to,” the individual behind the {Operation Ferguson account said on Twitter.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/OpFerguson/status/499953836472037377"">

Gabriella Coleman, an anthropologist who studies Anonymous and teaches at McGill University in Montreal, said she was taken aback that members of Anonymous would be so quick to release unverified information, and would speak so openly about their methods in online chat channels.

“My jaw was dropping,” Ms. Coleman said, reading members’ communications. “I was surprised because what I was seeing was suggestive but not definitive. Anonymous tends to care about its image quite a bit, and if they were wrong, it would be really bad.”

In private chat channels early Thursday, she said, members argued about the release of a photo of a man who resembled one of the officers at the scene of Mr. Brown’s shooting.

Some of it was reminiscent of past Anonymous campaigns, such as that prompted by a {rape case in Steubenville, Ohio}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/sports/high-school-football-rape-case-unfolds-online-and-divides-steubenville-ohio.html?pagewanted=all"">, and another { three years ago in Manhattan}<hyperlink=""http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/145523/anonymous-publicly-identifies-nypd-officer-who-cowardly-pepper-sprayed-protesters/"">, when hackers identified a high-ranking police officer who pepper-sprayed Occupy Wall Street protesters.

In the Ferguson case, many were drawn to the Anonymous campaign after Tef Poe, a St. Louis rapper, began posting live video and news updates to his Twitter, Vine and Instagram feeds this week. By Monday, the Operation Ferguson Twitter account had been set up, and prominent members of Anonymous had joined the effort.

Members assert that the organization is not a group but a loose collective working to advance similar ideals — but sometimes contradictory ones. While Anonymous espouses privacy, its members also use the release of others’ personal information as a tactic in cases where they believe the authorities are not acting in the public interest, or the news media has not released pertinent information. Members are quick to condemn any individual who claims to speak for the entire collective, and dissent and infighting are common.

Members also sought to explain the internal bickering and uncoordinated communications.

“For those new to Anonymous, it’s a global collective of millions of autonomous individuals and groups,” an Operation Ferguson post on Twitter said. “Each is responsible for themselves only.”

Since a prominent Anonymous hacker, Hector Xavier Monsegur, became a federal informant more than two years ago, members of the collective have taken great pains to use Internet security and anonymity software tools.

Some members were desperate in their pleas this week that the man’s photo not be released until more definitive information had been gathered. Ultimately, some members held a vote and decided to release the photo.

But within hours, many had backtracked. Some openly said the “dox” — a hacking term for the release of an individual’s personal information — had been wrong. “The original dox were faulty, it happens, an excess of zeal,” one Anonymous member said in a direct message on Twitter.

The infighting seemed to have taken its toll. Those behind the @TheAnonMessage2 account, who were behind the initial disclosures, had grown considerably more circumspect.

“ANNOUNCEMENT: We are ceasing any future dox releases until further notice,” they {posted on Twitter.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TheAnonMessage2/status/499964994159931392"">",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt24,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html,Police Say Mike Brown Was Killed After Struggle for Gun in St. Louis Suburb,Julie Bosman; Emma G. Fitzsimmons,08/10/2014,04/07/2016,"The fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager Saturday by a police officer in a St. Louis suburb came after a struggle for the officer’s gun, police officials said Sunday, in an explanation that met with outrage and skepticism in the largely African-American community.

The killing of the youth, Michael Brown, 18, ignited protests on Saturday and Sunday in Ferguson, Mo., a working-class suburb of about 20,000 residents. Hundreds of people gathered at the scene of the shooting to question the police and to light candles for Mr. Brown, who was planning to begin college classes on Monday.

Mr. Brown’s stepfather, Louis Head, held a cardboard sign that said, “Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son.”

At a news conference on Sunday morning, the St. Louis County police chief, Jon Belmar, said that a man had been shot and killed after he had assaulted a police officer and the two had struggled over the officer’s gun inside his patrol car. At least one shot was fired from inside the car, Chief Belmar said.

“The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,” Chief Belmar told reporters.

But elected officials and advocacy groups called for a full investigation and questioned the tactics of the police, who acknowledged that Mr. Brown had been unarmed. Antonio French, a city councilman in St. Louis, was at the scene of the protests on Sunday and said in an interview that more than 100 people had gathered, most of them silently standing in groups, some leaving behind teddy bears and balloons to memorialize Mr. Brown.

Mr. French said he was unsatisfied with the police department’s explanation of the shooting.

“I find it hard to believe,” he said, adding that he was disappointed with the police response in the aftermath of the shooting, which further distressed Ferguson residents and members of Mr. Brown’s family.

“It’s a textbook example of how not to handle the situation,” Mr. French said. “Ferguson has a white government and a white mayor, but a large black population. This situation has brought out whatever rifts were between that minority community and the Ferguson government.”

Esther Haywood, the president of the {N.A.A.C.P.}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_association_for_the_advancement_of_colored_people/index.html?inline=nyt-org""> in St. Louis County, said in a statement: “We are hurt to hear that yet another teenaged boy has been slaughtered by law enforcement, especially in light of the {recent death of Eric Garner in New York}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/nyregion/staten-island-man-dies-after-he-is-put-in-chokehold-during-arrest.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A8%22}&_r=0"">, who was killed for selling cigarettes. We plan to do everything within our power to ensure that the Ferguson Police Department as well as the St. Louis County Police Department releases all details pertinent to the shooting. We strongly encourage residents to stay away from the crime scene so that no additional citizens are injured.”

The police on Sunday said they were still trying to sort out the exact details, but they released what they said was the fullest account of the shooting that they could provide. Just after noon on Saturday, the police said, an officer in a patrol car approached Mr. Brown and another man. As the officer began to leave his vehicle, one of the men pushed the officer back into the car and “physically assaulted” him, according to the police department’s account.

A struggle occurred “over the officer’s weapon,” and at least one shot was fired inside the car, Chief Belmar said. The two left the car, and the officer shot Mr. Brown about 35 feet away from the vehicle, the police reported. Several shots were fired from the officer’s weapon.

The medical examiner for St. Louis County is investigating to determine how many times Mr. Brown was shot, the police said.

Chief Belmar said that the Ferguson police chief, Thomas Jackson, had called him personally and asked that his department to look into the shooting because Chief Jackson wanted an independent investigation. Chief Belmar said that the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney would determine whether the shooting was justified or charges should be filed.

As Chief Belmar spoke at a televised news conference, chants of “Don’t shoot!” and “We want answers!” could be heard from the protesters who had gathered outside the Ferguson police headquarters.

At a candlelight vigil on Sunday evening, the heightened tensions between the police and the African-American community were on display. A crowd estimated in the thousands flooded the streets near the scene of the shooting, some of them chanting “No justice, no peace.” They were met by hundreds of police officers in riot gear, carrying rifles and shields, as well as K-9 units.

Witnesses described a peaceful protest that later turned volatile, and there were scattered reports of violence. Images and videos captured on cellphones and posted on social media sites appeared to show people spray-painting and looting a QuikTrip gas station and other stores. Rioters shattered the windows of the gas station and damaged several police cars, said Brian Lewis, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department.

It was not immediately clear if anyone was injured or arrested during the protests. County officials did not return calls and messages seeking comment.

Community and civic leaders pleaded for calm and to allow the investigation to run its course.

“We have to do this in a constructive manner,” Mayor James Knowles III of Ferguson said in an interview with a local Fox television station.

The officer who shot Mr. Brown has been on the force about six years and will be interviewed extensively by detectives on Sunday, the police said. They did not identify the officer involved by either name or rank.

“Any other details, including the reason as to why the encounter occurred and the initial struggle ensued, are still a part of the continuing investigation,” the police said in a statement.

Family members of Mr. Brown said that he had been walking to his grandmother’s house when the shooting occurred. His body remained in the street for some time, guarded by the police, while neighbors gathered in the area.

Police officials, fearing civil disorder, dispatched officers with police dogs to control the crowds. In response, some Twitter users posted pictures of the dogs at the Ferguson gathering on Saturday next to photos of police dogs used to control African-American crowds during the Jim Crow era.

Mr. Brown had just graduated from high school and was planning to attend Vatterott College, his mother, Lesley McSpadden, told reporters. His family has retained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer who represented Trayvon Martin’s relatives.

“You took my son away from me,” she told the television news station KMOV. “Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many. Because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they don’t got nothing to live for anyway. ‘They’re going to try to take me out anyway.’ ”",NA,NA,NA,NA

The protests in Ferguson reached new levels of violence last night, even as Missouri National Guard troops arrived, the latest in a series of quickly shifting attempts to quell the chaos. Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri ordered a curfew, then lifted it when it became clear protesters would not obey. Reports of tear gas, rubber bullets and the back and forth of live shots fired began to flood Twitter.

Throughout the evening, growing crowds of protesters had kept walking, partly to avoid charges of unlawful assembly. They began reporting that there were few places for them to get off the street.

Reports spread that a large number of protesters had come to Ferguson from out of town, some from around the country, to incite further unrest. The police continued to issue orders to disperse. Journalists reported being ordered to present identification.

The Missouri protests, which have drawn the National Guard and even the White House into efforts to restore calm, are drawing comparisons to unrest in other American cities dating back to the civil rights era and beyond. Michael Wines and Erica Goode write {that history can provide examples}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/us/cities-rocked-by-past-unrest-offer-lessons-in-what-and-what-not-to-do.html""> of what to do and what not to do in order to prevent more violence in a city like Ferguson, where the shooting of Michael Brown’s inflamed existing tensions between residents and law enforcement.

On “St. Louis on the Air,” broadcast by St. Louis Public Radio, {William H. Freivogel}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/so-why-wasnt-officer-wilson-arrested-plus-answers-other-questions-about-law"">, the director of the journalism school at Southern Illinois University Carbondale and a professor at the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute, discussed legal issues in the Ferguson case and answered questions about why Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Michael Brown, was not arrested.

Tuesday’s front page for {The St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/""> showed the police firing tear gas after bottles were thrown from crowds gathered near the QuikTrip on West Florissant Avenue.

Michael Brown’s parents, Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden, appeared on NBC’s “Today” show on Tuesday and said that bringing the police officer who shot their son to justice was the way to stop the violence in Ferguson. “Justice will bring peace,” Ms. McSpadden said.

Time magazine {published a letter}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3136685/travyon-sybrina-fulton-ferguson/""> to Michael Brown’s mother written by the mother of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager who was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., in 2012. “Your own feelings will bounce between sorrow and anger,” Mr. Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton, wrote about the women’s shared experience. “Even when you don’t want to think about it because it is so much to bear, you will be forced to by merely turning on your television or answering your cellphone.”

To the Brown family,

I wish I had a word of automatic comfort, but I don’t. I wish I could say that it will be all right on a certain or specific day, but I can’t. I wish that all of the pain that I have endured could possibly ease some of yours, but it won’t. What I can do for you is what has been done for me: pray for you, then share my continuing journey as you begin yours.

I hate that you and your family must join this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence. Of particular concern is that so many of these gun violence cases involve children far too young. But Michael is much more than a police/gun violence case; Michael is your son. A son that barely had a chance to live. {Read the full letter »}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3136685/travyon-sybrina-fulton-ferguson/"">

But will the president’s involvement actually have a positive effect? Many who have called on Mr. Obama to speak up may not realize that it could be counterproductive for him to be visibly involved in the debate.

Mr. Obama’s statement reflected these competing tensions.

President Obama today assured everyone that the Justice Department was on the case, investigating the death of Michael Brown. And that Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri, for whom Mr. Obama seems to have a high regard, is going to personally make sure the current situation calms down. Of course, an investigation won’t address the deeper {underlying issues}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/opinion/racial-history-behind-the-ferguson-protests.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss""> here, like the iron ring of segregation and deprivation that surrounds so many American cities. And an investigation will do nothing to bring back Michael Brown.

“It’s important to remember how this started,” President Obama said. “We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again.”

Mr. Obama said that “the local authorities, including the police have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death,” which has not exactly been happening.

He said that “there is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting.” But he added: “There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. And here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.”

Nancy Pelosi, {in a statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/pelosi-statement-ferguson-protests/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pelosi-statement-ferguson-protests""> issued today, suggested an investigation of a larger scope, recommending that the justice department “also examine the longstanding issues between the citizens of Ferguson and their elected officials and local laws enforcement.”

And Rand Paul, the libertarian senator, called attention to the obvious racism that’s rampant in our justice system. He wrote in {Time}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/"">: “Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.”

He also took the opportunity to criticize the “the militarization of our law enforcement,” which he argued “is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm.”

Mr. Paul finds Big Government lurking behind every problem in American life. In this particular case, I can’t argue with him. The country needs to take a hard look at whether police forces in towns like Ferguson really need to bristle with so much arms and armor. Is it possible that weapons somehow create the urge to use them?

A video from the Associated Press shows peaceful protests Thursday night in Ferguson, Mo., a sharp contrast from the images of violent clashes between police and protesters the night before.

Earlier in the evening, CNN’s Jake Tapper spoke to Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol. At the request of Missouri’s governor, Captain Johnson is now supervising security in this suburb north of St. Louis.

“A young man lost his life and so I grieve for that family because I have a son,” Mr. Johnson said. “We are going to look at this from a personal standpoint.”

He vowed that he would not put officers on the street with tear gas or other military-style equipment unless such resources were needed.

Eight people, protesting the killings of unarmed young people by police, were arrested in Florida on Thursday after refusing to leave the office of the United States Attorney in Miami, a civil rights group said.

When police arrived, they chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot.”

The Dream Defenders, a group that organized the protest, said in a post on Twitter that they were demanding a federal investigation into the death of Israel Hernandez-Llach, an 18-year-old graffiti artist {who was killed last year by a Miami Beach police officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/03/06/3978777/teen-shot-by-miami-beach-police.html""> who shot him with a Taser stun gun.

“At the present time, we have no trust in the Ferguson Police Department, Mr. Davis said. “They have not been transparent. We’re still looking for answers.

As our colleague Tanzina Vega {reports,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-missouri-shooting-vigils-police-brutality.html""> organizers are {planning vigils}<hyperlink=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CzREs1eBjZhUrUpZY_sr7kf13m9NhAba4aOh3Z-s-Ys/preview?sle=true""> starting 7 p.m. Eastern, Thursday in more than 90 cities around the country to commemorate victims of police brutality.

Most of the events were organized on social media by a loose network of Twitter and Facebook users {under the hashtag #NMOS14}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NMOS14&src=typd"">, which stands for National Moment of Silence.

A {Facebook page }<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/NMOS2014""> was also created to list events.

Organizers asked participants to join them in “peaceful vigils honoring the innocent lives lost.” They asked people to wear a red ribbon or bandanna and to observe a “moment of silence” starting at 7:20 p.m. Eastern.

Organizers in Washington, D.C. and Chicago are expecting the largest crowds.

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, appointed by the governor to supervise security efforts in Ferguson, said he would be taking a different policing approach with protesters starting Thursday night.

Captain Johnson, who is black and grew up in the area, said he planned to meet with demonstrators on Thursday evening. “My boots will be on the ground,” he said.

“I understand the anger and fear the citizens of Ferguson are feeling, and they’ve been heard,” he said. “I plan on walking myself to the QuickTrip, which has been called Ground Zero, and talking to folks myself.”

He added, “We will have a different approach today.”

In response to concern that local and county police officers have been using military equipment and military-style tactics to control crowds, Captain Johnson said that he would consider removing resources that police did not need.

However, he said, “when we do need resources, they will be there.”

Gov. Jay Nixon asked Captain Johnson to take over the security responsibilities from local and county police officers following widespread criticism of police tactics believed to have fueled tensions in the aftermath of a police shooting of an unarmed young black man on Saturday.

The change is part of what the governor referred to as “an operational shift” to try to reduce tensions in the St. Louis suburb.

The people of Ferguson “want their streets to be free of intimidation and fear” he said, but during the past few days, “it looked a little bit more like a war zone and that’s not acceptable.”

“Ferguson will not be defined as a community torn apart by violence,” he said.

The governor said there will be an immediate difference in policing beginning Thursday evening, which will include employing force “only when necessary” and for officers to generally “step back a little bit.”

Officers, he said, will be “maintaining the peace but allowing more movement – try to bring in a different tone.”

“All of us have seen some level of escalation,” he said. “We feel we need to dim that acceleration — provide folks an avenue for speaking.”

However, he said the more nuanced approach “doesn’t mean we’re giving up on the rule of law.”

Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri said that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would take over the supervision of security responsibilities in Ferguson, Mo., where local and county police officers have clashed with protesters in the five days since Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, was shot and killed by a police officer on Saturday.

He said leaders from the highway patrol division would supervise policing during protests and crowd control.

Mr. Nixon said the highway patrol officers, however, would not be involved in the investigation into the shooting.

He said that he welcomed the Justice Department’s “parallel” investigation into the death of Mr. Brown, who was 18 years old.

“We’re going to all need to join hands,” Mr. Nixon said, adding that he had been listening to local residents who want peace and not intimidation on their streets.

“Lately, it looks more like a war zone,” Mr. Nixon said.

Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, {published an opinion article in Time}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> calling for the demilitarzation of local police departments.

“The outrage in Ferguson is understandable — though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting,” Mr. Paul wrote. “There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.

“The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.”

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. {issued a statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-854.html""> after his meeting with President Obama on Thursday about the situation in Ferguson, expressing concern that the “deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.”

Mr. Holder said that officials from the Justice Department had conveyed these concerns to the local authorities.

He also said that local officials had accepted the department’s offer to provide “technical assistance” to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.

The full statement:

This morning, I met with President Obama to discuss the events in Ferguson, Missouri. Like the President, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of Michael Brown. While his death has understandably caused heartache within the community, it is clear that the scenes playing out in the streets of Ferguson over the last several nights cannot continue.

For one thing, while the vast majority of protests have been peaceful, acts of violence by members of the public cannot be condoned. Looting and willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers who are genuinely trying to protect the public do nothing to remember the young man who has died. Such conduct is unacceptable and must be unequivocally condemned.

By the same token, the law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them. Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.

At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message. At my direction, Department officials have conveyed these concerns to local authorities. Also at my direction, the Department is offering – through our COPS office and Office of Justice Programs – technical assistance to local authorities in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force. The local authorities in Missouri have accepted this offer of assistance as of this afternoon.

Department officials from the Community Relations Service are also on the ground in Missouri to help convene law enforcement officials and civic and faith leaders to plot out steps to reduce tensions in the community. The latest such meeting was convened in Ferguson as recently as this morning. Over time, these conversations should consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities.

All the while, the federal civil rights investigation into the shooting incident itself continues, in parallel with the local investigation into state law violations.

Mr. French has been documenting the protests on Twitter and Instagram in the aftermath of the shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer. On Thursday afternoon, he posted photos of protesters outside police headquarters.

Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri said that the police response had become “more of the problem” than the solution.

“It escalated the situation,” she said, speaking to reporters at a firehouse in Ferguson. “It didn’t de-escalate the situation.”

Ms. McCaskill said that the “military” approach that the police had embraced was not working. She called on police officers to get back to “good, solid police work” that would keep protesters safe.

A Twitter account that was used by Anonymous, the loose hacker collective, has been suspended after posts were made claiming to identify the police officer involved in the shooting of an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Mo., on Saturday.

Thomas Jackson, the police chief in Ferguson, said the name that was published by Anonymous does not belong to an officer in St. Louis County or in Ferguson. He also said officials were discussing whether to name the officer, whose identity has been kept secret since the shooting.

Anonymous, which was using a Twitter account called @theanonmessage, is now posting updates on another account, {@theanonmessage2}<hyperlink=""http://twitter.com/theanonmessage2"">.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch {reported }<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/twitter-suspends-anonymous-account/article_8602d482-e248-5a88-bd56-a417d638eff8.html""> that a group of hackers who say they are associated with Anonymous claimed responsibility for bringing down the county government’s website.

Thomas Jackson, the police chief in Ferguson, Mo., defended police tactics during protests in the aftermath of the shooting on Saturday of an unarmed black man by a police officer.

“If anybody was arrested, as far as I can understand, it was because they were in an area that was being cleared by police,” Chief Jackson said.

He said that heavily armed officers with military-style equipment would continue to be deployed if the authorities determined that circumstances warranted it.

“The tactical units will be out there,” Chief Jackson said.

“If the crowd is being violent, and you don’t want to be violent, get out of the crowd,” he said.

Chief Jackson also said that various federal, state and local officials were meeting Thursday to discuss the police response to the protests, in part to determine if the actions of officers have exacerbated the conflict.

“We’re going to talk about not only the tactics,” he said, “but the appearance” of the officers, who have been equipped with riot gear and assault rifles during the demonstrations.

Chief Jackson said that officials were also discussing whether to release the name of the officer, but that a decision had not yet been made.

“We’re having some conversations about that today,” he said.

Chief Jackson said a name released by the hacker group Anonymous was incorrect.

“That’s not the name,” he said.

President Obama, who has asked the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to investigate the shooting of Michael Brown, said the attorney general “should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened, and to see that justice is done.”

He also { called on law enforcement officials in Missouri to be “open and transparent”}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=LedeSum&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news""> about the investigation of the shooting.

Speaking from Martha’s Vineyard, where he is vacationing with his family, Mr. Obama was also critical of the tactics used by local law enforcement officers in Ferguson during protests. He also questioned the arrests of reporters in Ferguson.

“In the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are trying to do their jobs,” Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama said that he had spoken to Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri. “I expressed my concern over the violent turn of events,” he said.

“Now’s the time for healing. Now’s the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,” he said.

The governor of Missouri, Jay Nixon, said he was canceling his plans for Thursday in order to visit Ferguson.

In a {statement}<hyperlink=""http://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/statement-gov-nixon-events-ferguson"">, he asked for calm and urged law enforcement to respect the rights of residents.

The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans. While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.

I have been closely monitoring the situation and will continue to be in communication with local leaders, and I will be in north St. Louis County Thursday. As governor, I am committed to ensuring the pain of last weekend’s tragedy does not continue to be compounded by this ongoing crisis. Once again, I ask that members of the community demonstrate patience and calm while the investigation continues, and I urge law enforcement agencies to keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press during this difficult time.

Two reporters, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan J.

Mr. Brown’s death has triggered days of protests that have brought national attention to racial tension between the police and the African-American community in the St. Louis suburb.

The protesters showed up in droves, marching along the streets near where Mr. Brown was gunned down and staying well into the night.

NYTimes,nyt30,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/us/ferguson-mo-michael-brown-and-darren-wilson-2-paths-to-a-fatal-encounter.html,"A Youth, an Officer and 2 Paths to a Fatal Encounter",Julie Bosman; John Schwartz; Serge F. Kovaleski,08/15/2014,04/07/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Michael Brown let his 16th birthday come and go without bothering to apply for a driver’s license. There was no need, his family said. He preferred to walk.

In Ferguson, where Mr. Brown was living with his grandmother, he walked nearly everywhere: on Canfield Drive, where his grandmother kept a small apartment, and several blocks away on the bustling commercial strip of West Florissant Avenue, a four-lane road full of hair salons and cheap restaurants that is the de facto downtown of the neighborhood.

It was during one of Mr. Brown’s walks down Canfield Drive one week ago when he would have an unlikely collision. It involved Mr. Brown, a black teenager who seemed to have avoided most of the traps that dragged down many of his peers, and a white police officer, Darren Wilson, with an admirable record. When it was over, {Mr. Brown was dead}<hyperlink=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html""> and Officer Wilson was facing an uncertain legal and professional future.

Chief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson Police Department, at a hastily called news conference on Friday morning, revealed Officer Wilson’s name for the first time. He has been a police officer for about five years, but Chief Jackson offered scant information about his life and work.

Officer Wilson, 28, who has roots in Texas, has worked for almost three years in Ferguson, an inner-ring suburb that has the feel of a place in transition: One business strip has been spruced up with a historic Main Street feel, with cheerful painted signs, a wine bar and a frame shop. The neighborhood where Mr. Brown died is a less appealing pocket of town: a two-bedroom apartment in his grandmother’s building goes for about $550 a month.

Before that, Officer Wilson worked two years in the police department in Jennings, a neighboring suburb.

He lives a half-hour drive away, in the town of Crestwood, southwest of St. Louis, interviews and property records show. About six months ago, neighbors said, Officer Wilson moved into a new house, a fixed-up ranch with a small pool in the back and a wicker love seat on the porch. The mailbox rises from a tub of flowers, and letters on red, white and blue stars hung from the door spell out “Welcome.”

Records indicate that he was divorced last year and now lives there with Barbara Spradling, also a police officer, who has received an award for valor. The two rarely mixed with neighbors or struck up casual conversation, neighbors said.

Two middle-aged women sat across the street from Officer Wilson’s home on Friday; one, who gave her name only as Kathy, was visiting her 93-year-old grandmother who bought the house when it was built in 1958.

“All of the neighbors will tell the same story,” she said. “People would just see him and wave, and that’s it.”

Officer Wilson’s professional record suggests someone who has avoided trouble. There has been no disciplinary action taken against him, Chief Jackson said Friday.

“I’ve known the officer for years and have every confidence in him,” Chief Jackson said.

Officer Wilson received a commendation for “extraordinary effort in the line of duty” in February. Greg Kloeppel, a lawyer for the union representing Ferguson police officers, confirmed the commendation that Officer Wilson received, but he declined to provide information about what kind of person the officer is or any details about his life.

One neighbor said he knew Officer Wilson was on the Ferguson police force, and figured out that he might be linked to the shooting of Mr. Brown when police cars, marked and unmarked, started showing up in the neighborhood several days ago. Then on Tuesday, Officer Wilson began mowing his lawn, but “he did not finish,” said the neighbor, who wore a faded Cardinals T-shirt and camouflage shorts. “It appears they left in a hurry.”

Since then, people have come to take the couple’s mail in and picked up their dogs, but the two have not been seen.

“I don’t expect them to return,” the neighbor said.

Ron Gorski, who lives on the block and was walking his English bulldog, Darla, told reporters that he did not know Officer Wilson, but that his 15-year-old grandson and his friends were allowed to swim in the officer’s pool. “When he finds out all this happened, he’ll be shocked,” Mr. Gorski said.

He said Mr. Wilson cleared out days ago, but “we knew something was going on because police were going up and down the block for a few days now.”

Twenty miles away, in Ferguson, the Brown family said it was no closer to understanding the circumstances that led an unarmed 18-year-old to be shot to death by a police officer in the middle of the day.

They were outraged that the Ferguson police on Friday released surveillance video and photos of Mr. Brown apparently stealing cigarillos from a convenience store on West Florissant and shoving a clerk as he walked out.

“Whatever happened in the store is irrelevant,” said Benjamin L. Crump, a lawyer for the family.

He added, “They are not trying to solve the murder, they are trying to justify it.”

The family insisted that Mr. Brown had no history of violence or aggression. He had no adult arrest record, according to the police, who said they could not speak to whether he had been arrested as a juvenile.

Administrators at the chaotic public high school he attended, one of the worst in the state, said he was quiet, shy and a little awkward, hardly one of the “trouble kids,” of which there were plenty.

“You’d sit in a house with him, watching TV and hanging out, and you’d forget he was there,” said Tim Sneed, 23, a close friend and neighbor. “He had not one enemy. I’ve never heard of him getting in one fight.”

Mr. Brown was still a teenager: He smoked marijuana with friends in the neighborhood, they recalled, and drank cans of Bud Light with them when he ducked away from the watchful eyes of his family.

Finishing high school was an effort that required the push of his parents and extended family, who scolded him on the days that he slept late and missed morning classes.

But he was determined to avoid many of the missteps frequently taken by his peers. “He wasn’t like all these cats out here, selling drugs and having babies with different women,” Kathy Gary, 22, a relative, said earlier this week. “We tried so hard to keep him in school. Sometimes he’d skip classes, and he needed a push. But he wanted to do something.”

Last Saturday, the day Mr. Brown died, dawned sunny and warm, around 80 degrees, a typically hot August day in Missouri. With a friend, Dorian Johnson, Mr. Brown set out to West Florissant, wearing a white T-shirt, khaki shorts and a red Cardinals cap.

About 10 minutes before noon, they entered Ferguson Market and Liquor, a run-down store with shelves lined with potato chips, Boone’s Farm wine and tequila.

Mr. Brown, who was 6-foot-4, had an intimidating appearance — his friends nicknamed him Bodyguard because he was so tall.

According to the surveillance video, Mr. Brown approached the counter, leaned over and grabbed a handful of Swisher Sweets, then turned for the door. He pushed a clerk who tried to stop him, then left the store.

At 11:51 a.m., the police said, someone called 911 to report a robbery.

After leaving Ferguson Market, Mr. Brown and Mr. Johnson walked north on West Florissant, passing a McDonald’s, a hair-braiding shop and a Chinese restaurant. They turned right at the corner of Canfield Drive, where a fence at the corner bears a sign: “We are watching to report suspicious activities or persons to Ferguson Police Dept.”

Several blocks later, at 12:01 p.m., they were confronted by Officer Wilson while they continued down Canfield, a quiet street that curves gently as it weaves through apartment buildings and one-story brick houses.

They were stopped not because the police were looking for a robbery suspect, Chief Jackson said Friday, but “because they were walking down the street blocking traffic.”

Devin Stone, 28, a friend of Mr. Brown’s, was home in his apartment at the time, across the street from the place where the men were confronted by the police.

Sitting outside his building, Mr. Stone said he was jolted by the sound of two gunshots, followed by several more in rapid succession. The second series of shots “sounded automatic,” he said. “They let it rip.”

Mr. Stone ran outside and saw two police officers, both white men, standing near Mr. Brown, who was lying on his stomach, his arms at his sides, blood seeping from his head. Another neighbor, a woman who identified herself as a nurse, was begging the officers to let her perform CPR.

They refused, Mr. Stone said, adding, “They didn’t even check to see if he was breathing.”

On Friday, speaking to reporters, Chief Jackson said the shooting was “absolutely devastating” to Officer Wilson. “He never intended for any of this to happen.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

But since Mr. McMullen boarded up his business after demonstrators shattered some of his windows last week, he has kept the doors open to try, mostly in vain, to remind potential customers that automobile insurance is still for sale.

“He’s here to watch the back door because I have to sit and face the front,” Mr. McMullen said on Monday after another night of violent confrontations between the police and protesters angry about the Aug. 9 shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer. “If someone wants to come through the back while I’m taking care of business, he’ll at least let me know that they’re there.”

In this city of about 21,000, West Florissant is a major thoroughfare and is lined with nail and hair salons, a few restaurants and an array of retailers. It is common to see commercial jetliners fly overhead as they arrive or depart from the nearby Lambert-St. Louis International Airport.

But for more than a week, the road has been {a battleground nearly every night.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html"">

On Sunday night, police officers in riot gear marched through smoke-filled streets. As midnight approached, the roadway was filled with debris: spent canisters of tear gas, wooden and rubber bullets, gray cinder blocks and shattered bottles.

But by the time the lunch hours arrived on Monday, the street was largely swept clean, sometimes by volunteers clutching black trash bags.

It was not so simple for Dellena Jones, who runs a hair salon where the door frame was free of glass on Monday. The night before, demonstrators had tossed concrete slabs into the business as Ms. Jones’s two children prepared for what had been scheduled as the first day of school.

As Ms. Jones waited for a wooden board to place over her door, she fretted about what might become of her business as customers have chosen to stay away.

“I had a full week that went down to really nothing,” she said. “They’re too scared to come.”

As she spoke, a man walked by and shouted, “You need a gun in there, lady!” If the unrest continues, Ms. Jones said she may have to meet customers elsewhere.

“I may have to go for a minute and work somewhere else,” she said. “But I’m paying rent here, so I will have to pay somewhere else to work, which is not fair.”

On Monday afternoon, the authorities appeared intent on taking control of West Florissant early in the day, well before the time the large numbers of demonstrators typically arrive. Six members of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, with plastic flex-ties within easy reach, stood guard at a barbecue restaurant that has been a hub of the turmoil.

Just north of the restaurant, about 30 officers surrounded a convenience store that was heavily damaged early in the unrest. The officers barred people from stopping or congregating in the area, an order that provoked angry responses from some passers-by and demonstrators.

Earlier in the day, the authorities had approached a small group of demonstrators, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and told them to move along.

“We’re not doing anymore static protesting,” one state trooper said.

With the more forceful approach taking shape, Mr. McMullen was hopeful the police would soon quell the disturbances here. But he couldn’t predict precisely when that would take place.

“There will be an end in sight, but I don’t see it,” Mr. McMullen said.",NA,NA,NA,NA

But as has been the case since Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the State Highway Patrol first entered the drama of race, violence and trust swirling in this St. Louis suburb, the veteran trooper dominated it.

Captain Johnson, a burly and plain-spoken Missouri native, cited the Bible, preached tolerance and simultaneously represented both law and order and the fear and anger of seething residents. He turned a news conference into a town hall meeting, waded into the crowd and seemed to listen as much as he spoke while he stood at the podium, the governor by his side, to discuss the fallout from the {shooting death of Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html""> by a Ferguson police officer.

He listened as resident after resident voiced angry and emotional concerns about law enforcement tactics. He made plain his frustration with the local authorities. And he pleaded with a city to maintain the order that on Thursday night allowed the air to be filled with honking horns and cigarette smoke, not cries of pain and plumes of tear gas.

“We have to make sure that we don’t burn down our own house, that we don’t go down there and vandalize our own buildings,” Captain Johnson said. “We can stand on the sidewalk and we can talk about our issues, we can talk about what we want and what we need, and a conversation that needs to happen, we can make that happen. What I don’t want is us to go down and burn our own neighborhood. That does not prove a point.”

Since Captain Johnson, who is black and grew up in the area, was assigned on Thursday to coordinate security operations here after nights of violent unrest, he has become the public face of law enforcement and, in an unexpected twist, the demonstrators being policed.

Instead of sitting at the command post erected in a shopping center parking lot, he has walked the streets, hugging and greeting residents, and banished military-style weaponry in an effort that worked, at least on Thursday night, to defuse the volatile situation that had seemed ready to deteriorate even further.

In his deep, unwavering voice, Captain Johnson, 51, has asked people to draw near and tell their stories, and his large hands have clasped countless others. But amid all of that, perhaps what resonated most was when, within hours of his appointment, he walked alongside protesters, including some who marched toward a convenience store that had been largely destroyed early this week.

By Friday morning, he stood again at the store and invited residents to join his scheduled news conference with Gov. Jay Nixon, who has been criticized for his slow response to the turmoil.

“They have questions, and they’ve got concerns,” Captain Johnson said after he tried, unsuccessfully, to speak to a man without a swarm of reporters watching. “I can’t know them if I’m up there and they’re down here.”

And so the residents came, held back at first behind yellow police tape until Captain Johnson urged them to join the crowd near the podium. He began answering questions and recounting conversations, including one with his daughter after he returned home early Friday. They talked about the story of Jesus Christ and an apostle, Peter, walking on water.

“She said, ‘When Peter got scared, Jesus picked him up and said, have faith,’ ” Captain Johnson said. “And I’m telling you today, we need to be just like Peter because I know we’re scared.”

The crowd cheered.

In an interview, Captain Johnson said his policing strategy had its origins not far from here, where he spent his childhood.

“I was raised about treating people with respect,” he said. “I think both of my parents demanded that. They did that to people, so that’s where it starts. I grew up at a time where you said ‘yes, ma’am’ and ‘yes, sir.’ And I find myself talking to 16-year-old kids and 17-year-old kids and when I say ‘yes, ma’am’ and ‘yes, sir,’ they kind of look at me in a strange way, so sometimes I have to catch myself.”

Captain Johnson, whose uncle was a police officer, said he admired law enforcement officials from an early age. But it was in college when, as a student near here, a black state trooper stopped the future Captain Johnson for speeding, and he decided he wanted to join the State Highway Patrol. “The black trooper that stopped me looked so good in that uniform, and had so much pride,” Captain Johnson recalled. “And then I knew that I wanted that.”

The captain and his wife live in the St. Louis metropolitan area and have a son and a daughter.

He joined the State Highway Patrol in 1987, state officials said, and began his career in the same troop he now commands, which spans 11 counties in eastern Missouri. He was assigned for a brief time to a troop near Kansas City before he returned to this region. He served on the agency’s SWAT team and developed a reputation as an empathetic trooper who reached through the ranks to develop relationships.

“If a retiree passes away, he makes sure we send troopers to that retiree, whether it be a trooper that passed away or a driver examiner or a motor vehicle specialist or a radio operator, a spouse of one of those, he watches the whole operation,” said Capt. Norman A. Murphy, an academy classmate of Captain Johnson who now commands the State Highway Patrol’s Gaming Division. “When he talks about respect, that’s the highest thing. He really takes care of his people.”

Despite the captain’s sudden positive appearance in the limelight, he has faced tough questions, including some from residents who were frustrated that he was not consulted before Chief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson police released the identity of the officer who fatally shot Mr. Brown.

“This is all figurehead stuff,” one black man complained to Captain Johnson on Friday morning. The captain stared straight toward the man from the podium. “I can tell you that’s not the case,” he replied.",NA,NA,NA,NA

A peaceful vigil on Sunday was followed by rioting and looting that led to 32 arrests overnight. On Monday, scenes of unrest continued.

Protesters gathered on West Florissant Avenue, a commercial strip where much of the looting had occurred on Sunday night. A New York Times reporter, Julie Bosman, was on the scene. Instead of a notebook, she used Twitter to describe what she was seeing.

[tweetbegin 498988053885911040 tweetend]

Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who participated in the protests, also used social media to describe what was happening.

[tweetbegin 499002337114193920 tweetend]

There were several hundred people, Ms. Bosman wrote. Traffic was backed up, and the police had arrived and formed a line, clad in riot gear. The protesters started yelling at the police, and the police drove them back into the surrounding residential neighborhood.

[tweetbegin 499001993831387137 tweetend]

The police were trying to prevent further looting, Ms. Bosman said.

[tweetbegin 499000196953817089 tweetend]

The scene was chaotic. People were jumping on cars, though that was limited.

[tweetbegin 499005470443847680 tweetend]

[tweetbegin 499004535978090497 tweetend]

Then the police started to set off tear gas. Ms. Bosman said she could see the gas billowing. People were running away as it stung their eyes and throats.

The police then started shooting rubber bullets at people, including reporters and photographers.

[tweetbegin 499045164644831233 tweetend]

The standoff went on for several hours. The police were asking the crowd to disperse and go home, but most of the protesters did not live in the area, and the police were blocking their way out.

[tweetbegin 498999766333022208 tweetend]

By 10 p.m., the crowds had thinned and people started to go home.

Watching the news from Ferguson, Mo., I felt that I could have been viewing scenes from Iraq, Syria, Ukraine or the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago.

Tanks, tear gas and the riot police have no place on the streets of America in the 21st century, especially as a response to peaceful protests by rightfully outraged citizens over yet another racially charged killing.

President Obama, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri must do more than pour empty words onto the open sore that Ferguson has become. Calm will be restored only when justice is done.

HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN New York, Aug. 15, 2014

 

To the Editor:

The rationale behind numerous anti-mask laws on the books is that they aid the police in identifying people and that the anonymity provided by masks gives license to protesters to act violently. Recent events in Ferguson, Mo., raise serious questions about whether we also need similar policies to address anonymity on the side of the police.

A disturbing part of the emerging militarized riot uniforms is the complete disguising of police faces and other identifiers. We can see video of police overreach and even of reporters being arrested, yet have no way of ever holding people responsible for their actions, giving those who would abuse such authority license to do so.

Local governments should be pushed to mandate that riot gear be emblazoned with large and clearly visible identifier numbers. As of now, we have no mechanism for holding individual officers accountable, and that is contributing to the abuses we see unfolding on the streets of Ferguson.

MICHAEL MacKENZIE New York, Aug. 15, 2014

The writer is an associate professor of social work at Columbia University.

 

To the Editor:

I am a professor, a novelist and a scholar, and a native white Mississippian. Thirty years ago in Austin, Tex., I was arrested after questioning a police officer who brandished his nightstick over a young Chicano. The young man was a stranger, but his terrified face was familiar to me from having grown up in the racial violence of the 1960s.

I was handcuffed, driven to the police station and clubbed into unconsciousness by the arresting officer, whose name I will never forget.

Over the years, I have tried to write about that trauma. Every time, it was too painful to recall the memories, documents and photographs, and worse, the disbelief of people I trusted. Thankfully, the chairman of my dissertation committee supported me.

I write now on behalf of Michael Brown and every victim of police brutality. It can happen to anyone, regardless of race, gender, class, citizenship or educational level.

Our indifference cannot continue. We need accountability and community awareness. Those of us who carry private scars, internal and external, must speak out.

To the Editor:

Thoughts of a black mother to a mixed-race child:

The other night, I had to have him go over the rules again.

“But, Mom,” he whines, “I don’t go out at night.” At 10, he can think only of McDonald’s as the most interesting place he can go to after dark is. “Go over them for me anyway.” He sighs. Wiggling under his covers, he leans back on his fuzzy green pillow and recites:

“Don’t run after dark. It doesn’t matter if your little buddies are running or not. Don’t you run.

“Don’t put your hood up. People will think that you’re hiding your face. Keep your hands visible at all times. If you reach in your pocket, people will assume that you have a weapon. Always be scrupulously polite. Yes, sir, ma’am, officer. No, sir, ma’am, officer.

He looks at me and asks why. Why must he learn these strange rules that won’t apply until “forever from now”? And I hesitate. How to explain my fear? That six or seven years isn’t forever from now.

How do I explain the pure selfishness of my motives? That I see Emmett Till, murdered at 14 in Mississippi, in his eyes, Michael Brown in his height. That I’m afraid that I could never be as strong as their mothers were forced to be.

I brush the curls off his forehead. And I lie: “For the same reason I taught you to be careful around the stove long before I let you cook. Because if you follow the rules, you’ll be safe.”

NYTimes,nyt35,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/us/looting-and-unrest-follows-vigil-for-st-louis-teenager.html,F.B.I. Steps In Amid Unrest After Police Kill Missouri Youth, Julie Bosman; Erica Goode,08/11/2014,04/12/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The F.B.I. on Monday opened a civil rights inquiry into the fatal shooting by a police officer of an unarmed black teenager here as protests bubbled into a third night in this St. Louis suburb.

Officers donned riot gear and warily faced off against hundreds of people in response to looting and violence on Sunday night that resulted in 32 arrests.

On Monday night, police officers using tear gas and rubber bullets tried to disperse the crowd of mostly African-Americans, who had been gathering through the day under the hot sun. The protesters questioned the role that race — and simmering tensions between residents and the Police Department — may have played in the killing of Michael Brown, 18, who was to start college this week.

The standoff lasted for more than an hour, with about a dozen men approaching officers with their hands up saying, “Don’t shoot me.” At least 100 police officers were on the scene, shining bright lights into the crowd and telling people to return to their homes.

At one point, the sound of gunfire was heard from within the area where the police had barricaded streets in Ferguson. Earlier in the night, several people threw rocks at officers.

Chief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson police told The Associated Press that the officers used tear gas and shot “beanbag rounds” after members of the crowd threw rocks at officers and gunfire came from the crowd.

Chief Jackson said the police blocked off the area where most of the looting and vandalism occurred Sunday night out of concern that cars passing by might hit demonstrators in the street.

Brian Schellman, a public information officer with the St. Louis County police, said late Monday that the police had made several arrests for offenses including assaulting a police officer. He said they had no reports of injuries to the police or protesters. Officials have so far declined to identify the police officer who shot Mr. Brown or disclose his race. The officer was put on administrative leave.

“You have to begin with the frustration,” said one of the protesters, Wayne Bledsoe of St. Louis. “Treatment of these communities is not equal. In white communities, the police truly protect and serve. In black communities, that is not the case.”

The situation appeared to have calmed down by about 10:30 p.m. local time, the police said. A local news station {aired}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/11/protesters-at-quiktrip-on-west-florissant-approach-police-line/""> footage of one man who was reportedly taken to a hospital for injuries from a rubber bullet.

Ferguson, a city of 21,000 northwest of St. Louis, has shifted substantially over the last decade, with blacks, once a minority, now making up two-thirds of the residents, after many white families moved out to surrounding suburbs. The town’s leadership and the police have remained predominantly white.

In 2013, the suspension of a black superintendent of schools by an all-white school board stirred protests. And the Justice Department has a continuing investigation into racial disparities in legal representation for juveniles in Family Court.

“The community is still highly segregated,” said Karen Knodt, interim pastor of the Immanuel United Church of Christ, whose congregation has 800 members, only four of whom are black. “The institutions of power don’t yet reflect the changing demographics of the county.”

At a news conference on Monday, Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief, who said his department was asked by the Ferguson police to take over the investigation of the shooting, pleaded for the public’s patience.

“I understand that the public has a right to be skeptical, and I appreciate that and I would expect that the public be skeptical oftentimes of government or some forms of it,” he said. “But I would also ask the public to be reasonable, because it takes a long time to make sure we do this investigation the right way.”

On social media, reaction to Mr. Brown’s killing was fierce, with many accusing the police of again shooting an unarmed black youth. It included a Twitter campaign called “IfTheyGunnedMeDown” prompted by a photograph of Mr. Brown that was used in some news reports about his killing. In the photo, Mr. Brown is shown with fingers of his right hand extended in what some considered a peace sign, while others called it a gang sign.

Mr. Brown’s parents said at a news conference that he was nonviolent and good-natured, and would have objected to the looting. Their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, compared the case to another one in which he represented a family, that of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old shot to death in Florida two years ago by a neighborhood watch coordinator.

“We need justice for our son,” said Mr. Brown’s father, Michael Brown, as his lawyer asked witnesses to step forward with testimony or videotape. “If any of you have information, please give it to us,” he said. “We don’t want no violence.”

“Because Michael wouldn’t want no violence,” said Lesley McSpadden, his mother, weeping.

The circumstances of Mr. Brown’s death on Saturday afternoon as he and a friend walked from a convenience store were disputed. The police said he had hit the officer who shot him; his family and friends denied that.

In a local television interview, the friend who was walking with him, Dorian Johnson, said the officer opened fire when the young men refused to move from the middle of the street to the sidewalk. He said Mr. Brown’s hands were over his head. The autopsy showed Mr. Brown was shot a number of times.

The Ferguson police said they do not have videocameras running in their patrol cars. Residents of Ferguson said they were shaken by the unrest that swept the town on Sunday night, bringing 500 officers to the streets.

One school district nearby canceled classes on Monday, citing safety concerns. Many businesses refused to open or boarded up their windows as a protective measure. On West Florissant Street, the aftermath of Sunday’s protest was still visible in a burned-out convenience store, the smashed windows of a thrift shop and lottery tickets that littered a parking lot.

“It was a miracle that no one was shot,” Chief Belmar said of the looting.

Outside the Police Department, groups of residents criticized the police but also condemned the looting from the night before.

“We don’t want any more violence around here,” said Carolyn Teague, a nurse, as she wiped away tears. The tension, she said, had one source: “Prejudice in this town still lives on.”

Patrice McHaskell, a teacher at a nursery school, said that in a town where the police force is mostly white and residents are mostly black, police officers have acquired a reputation for frequently stopping young black men, often for trivial things.

The shooting has tapped into longstanding resentments, she said: “They’re just outraged and they’re tired of the police messing with them. It brought out all the anger and tension that everybody’s been holding in.”

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. seemed to echo concerns from residents, saying in a statement on Monday that the episode “deserves a fulsome review.”

He added, “Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”

The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department sometimes begins its own investigation into police departments that appear to show a pattern and practice of using excessive force, as it did this year in Albuquerque, after a series of shootings by the police involving people suffering from mental illness.

The shooting mobilized supporters, including Cornell Williams Brooks, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., who flew into St. Louis on Monday. He said he was committed to seeking justice.

“Note that he was nonviolent,” he told reporters on Monday. “If you want to honor his memory, honor his memory by seeking justice nonviolently.”

Charlie Dooley, the St. Louis County executive, cautioned that the local investigation would not come to a quick conclusion.

“This is a difficult and complex situation,” he said. “There are many sides to the story. There are many answers.”",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt36,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-missouri-in-wake-of-clashes-calls-to-demilitarize-police.html,"In Wake of Clashes, Calls to Demilitarize Police",Julie Bosman; Matt Apuzzo,08/14/2014,04/12/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — For four nights in a row, they streamed onto West Florissant Avenue wearing camouflage, black helmets and vests with “POLICE” stamped on the back. They carried objects that doubled as warnings: assault rifles and ammunition, slender black nightsticks and gas masks.

They were not just one police force but many, hailing from communities throughout north St. Louis County and loosely coordinated by the county police.

Their adversaries were a ragtag group of mostly unarmed neighborhood residents, hundreds of African-Americans whose pent-up fury at the police had sent them pouring onto streets and sidewalks in Ferguson, demanding justice for Michael Brown, the 18-year-old who was fatally shot by a police officer on Saturday.

When the protesters refused to retreat from the streets, threw firebombs or walked too close to a police officer, the response was swift and unrelenting: tear gas and rubber bullets.

To the rest of the world, the images of explosions, billowing tear gas and armored vehicles made this city look as if it belonged in a chaos-stricken corner of Eastern Europe, not the heart of the American Midwest. As a result, a broad call came from across the political spectrum for America’s police forces to be demilitarized, and Gov. Jay Nixon installed a new overall commander in Ferguson.

“At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said, “I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.”

Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, voiced similar sentiments.

But such opposition amounts to a sharp change in tone in Washington, where the federal government has spent more than a decade paying for body armor, mine-resistant trucks and other military gear, all while putting few restrictions on its use. Grant programs that, in the name of fighting terrorism, paid for some of the equipment being used in Ferguson have been consistently popular since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. If there has been any debate at all, it was over which departments deserved the most money.

{Department of Homeland Security}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/homeland_security_department/index.html?inline=nyt-org""> grant money paid for the $360,000 Bearcat armored truck on patrol in Ferguson, said Nick Gragnani, executive director of St. Louis Area Regional Response System, which administers such grants for the St. Louis area.

Since 2003, the group has spent $9.4 million on equipment for the police in St. Louis County. That includes $3.6 million for two helicopters, plus the Bearcat, other vehicles and night vision equipment. Most of the body armor worn by officers responding to the Ferguson protests was paid for with federal money, Mr. Gragnani said.

“The focus is terrorism, but it’s allowed to do a crossover for other types of responses,” he said. “It’s for any type of civil unrest. We went by the grant guidance. There was no restriction put on that by the federal government.”

While the major Homeland Security grants do not pay for weapons, Justice Department grants do. That includes rubber bullets and tear gas, which the police use to disperse crowds. A Justice Department report last year said nearly 400 local police departments and more than 100 state agencies had bought such less-lethal weapons using Justice Department grant money.

The grants also paid for body armor, vehicles and surveillance equipment. It was not immediately clear if those grants had paid for equipment being used in Ferguson.

The military also sent machine guns, armored trucks, aircraft and other surplus war equipment to local departments. Compared with other urban areas, however, St. Louis County has received little surplus military equipment.

All these programs began or were expanded in response to the Sept. 11 attacks, when the authorities in Washington declared that local police departments were on the front lines of a global war on terrorism. Terrorism is exceedingly rare, however, and the equipment and money far outpaced the threat.

“You couldn’t say that back then with as much certainty as you can say that now, though,” said Frank J. Cilluffo, director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University. After Sept. 11, few people asked whether the police would use the equipment against protesters, Mr. Cilluffo said. “By and large, I don’t recall an outcry of any sort historically along these lines.”

In most instances, the government did not require training for police departments receiving military-style equipment and few if any limitations were put on its use, he said.

The increase in military-style equipment has coincided with a significant rise in the number of police SWAT teams, which are increasingly being used for routine duties such as conducting liquor inspections and serving warrants.

For years, much of the equipment has gone unnoticed. But as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have drawn down, police departments have been receiving 30-ton, mine-resistant trucks from the military. That has caught the attention of the public and caused controversy in several towns.

Nowhere has the deployment of military-style equipment been on starker display than this week in Ferguson.

The center of the protests is West Florissant Avenue, a run-down commercial strip that runs north-south. On it stands a nail salon, a barbecue restaurant and the burned-out remnants of a QuikTrip convenience store that looters targeted on Sunday night.

Late each afternoon, hundreds of people have trickled onto West Florissant, milling around on sidewalks and holding signs at television cameras.

As more protesters gathered, the police followed in greater numbers. They set up barricades of traffic cones so that cars could not enter. Protesters, usually young black men, have approached the police with their hands up in the air, a gesture that has become a taunt. (A witness to the shooting on Saturday said Mr. Brown had his hands up when he was shot.)

For three nights, the police made the same tactical move: When they determined that the protest was no longer peaceful, they used tear gas to force protesters off West Florissant and into the two residential neighborhoods on either side of it.

Once the protesters had been pushed onto side streets of small, one-story houses and low-slung apartment buildings, some of them said, they were effectively trapped on the wrong side of Florissant.

“Disperse! Go back to your homes!” the police shouted, often from the top of armored vehicles, through megaphones whose orders echoed throughout the streets.

“We don’t live here!” several people shouted back.

Keonta Finch, 21, waited hours for the police to open the barricade on Monday. “There’s no way out,” she said. “I can’t get home. I was just here to be peaceful, and now I’m stuck.”

Ms. Finch echoed a common complaint from protesters: The police seemed unable to differentiate between people in the crowds who were causing trouble and those who were not.

A woman who was identified as a pastor tried to calm some unruly members of the crowd on Wednesday; later that night, she was shot in the abdomen with a rubber bullet.

“Peaceful protesters are being conflated with rioters and looters,” said Christopher Leonard, who joined a group of quiet protesters on Wednesday evening.

Journalists have also been caught up by the police use of weapons. On Monday night, the police aimed directly at a group of photographers and a reporter as they covered the growing protest. One photographer was hit with a rubber bullet. A police officer on Wednesday tossed a tear-gas canister directly at a television crew for Al Jazeera.

On Wednesday night, in the neighborhood on the east side of Florissant, several dozen people were drawn to the site where Mr. Brown was shot, on a gently looping street called Canfield Court. They stood in small groups and shared stories of harassment by the police; some people sat on their front stoops and smoked marijuana.

Suddenly, just after 10 p.m., explosions boomed from what sounded like a few blocks away, stopping conversations cold.

“Firecrackers,” one woman said, staring in the direction of Florissant. “No, no, gunshots,” a man said, telling everyone to drop to the ground.

In a few minutes, it was clear what had happened: Tear gas was drifting into the neighborhood, enveloping houses, cars and people, who ran for cover in cars and houses, coughing and gasping as their eyes stung and vision blurred.

Police officials have said that they felt they had no choice but to use tear gas and rubber bullets. They could not allow looting to happen again, they said, and dispersing the crowds was the only way to stop it.

Chief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson police defended the use of force against demonstrators during the past five days and said heavily armed officers with military-style equipment would continue to be deployed if the authorities determined that circumstances warranted it.

The tactical units will be out there if firebombs are being thrown at officers or if demonstrators are otherwise behaving violently, Chief Jackson said.

“If the crowd is being violent,” he said, “and you don’t want to be violent, get out of the crowd.”",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt37,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html,Autopsy Shows Michael Brown Was Struck at Least 6 Times,Frances Robles; Julie Bosman,08/17/2014,04/12/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager who was killed by a police officer, sparking protests around the nation, was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, a preliminary private autopsy performed on Sunday found.

One of the bullets entered the top of Mr. Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury, according to Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, who flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family’s request to conduct the separate autopsy. It was likely the last of bullets to hit him, he said.

Mr. Brown, 18, was also shot four times in the right arm, he said, adding that all the bullets were fired into his front.

The bullets did not appear to have been shot from very close range because no gunpowder was present on his body. However, that determination could change if it turns out that there is gunshot residue on Mr. Brown’s clothing, to which Dr. Baden did not have access.

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. {said Sunday that the Justice Department would conduct its own autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/politics/independent-michael-brown-autopsy-planned-by-obama-administration.html"">, in addition to the one performed by local officials and this private one because, a department spokesman said, of “the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family.”

The preliminary autopsy results are the first time that some of the critical information resulting in Mr. Brown’s death has been made public. Thousands of protesters demanding information and justice for what was widely viewed as a reckless shooting took to the streets here in rallies that ranged from peaceful to violent.

Mr. Brown died Aug. 9 in a confrontation with a police officer here in this suburb of St. Louis. The police department has come under harsh criticism for refusing to clarify the circumstances of the shooting and for responding to protests with military-style operational gear.

“People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day 1,” Dr. Baden said in an interview after performing the autopsy. “They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.”

Dr. Baden said that while Mr. Brown was shot at least six times, only three bullets were recovered from his body. But he has not yet seen the X-rays showing where the bullets were found, which would clarify the autopsy results. Nor has he had access to witness and police statements.

Dr. Baden provided a diagram of the entry wounds, and noted that the six shots produced numerous wounds. Some of the bullets entered and exited several times, including one that left at least five different wounds.

“This one here looks like his head was bent downward,” he said, indicating the wound at the very top of Mr. Brown’s head. “It can be because he’s giving up, or because he’s charging forward at the officer.”

He stressed that his information does not assign blame or justify the shooting.

“We need more information; for example, the police should be examining the automobile to see if there is gunshot residue in the police car,” he said.

Dr. Baden, 80, is a well-known New York-based medical examiner, who is one of only about 400 board-certified forensic pathologists in the nation. He reviewed the autopsies of both President John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and has performed more than 20,000 autopsies himself.

He is best known for having hosted the HBO show “Autopsy,” but he rankles when he is called a “celebrity medical examiner,” saying that the vast majority of what he does has nothing to do with celebrities.

Dr. Baden said that because of the tremendous attention to the case, he waived his $10,000 fee.

Prof. Shawn L. Parcells, a pathologist assistant based in Kansas, assisted Dr. Baden.

“You do this for the families,” Mr. Parcells said.

The two medical experts conducted the four-hour examination Sunday at the Austin A. Layne Mortuary in St. Louis. Benjamin L. Crump, a lawyer for Mr. Brown’s family who paid their travel expenses, hired them.

“The sheer number of bullets and the way they were scattered all over his body showed this police officer had a brazen disregard for the very people he was supposed to protect in that community,” Mr. Crump said. “We want to make sure people understand what this case is about: This case is about a police officer executing a young unarmed man in broad daylight.”

A spokesman for the Ferguson Police Department, Tim Zoll, said the police had not seen a report of the autopsy and therefore had no comment on it.

Dr. Baden said he consulted with the St. Louis County medical examiner before conducting the autopsy.

One of the bullets shattered Mr. Brown’s right eye, traveled through his face, exited his jaw and re-entered his collarbone. The last two shots in the head would have stopped him in his tracks and were likely the last fired.

Mr. Brown, he said, would not have survived the shooting even if he had been taken to a hospital right away. The autopsy indicated that he was otherwise healthy.

Dr. Baden said it was unusual for the federal government to conduct a third autopsy, but dueling examinations often occur when there is so much distrust of the authorities. The county of St. Louis has conducted an autopsy, and the results have not yet been released.

He stressed that his examination was not to determine whether the shooting was justified.

“In my capacity as the forensic examiner for the New York State Police, I would say, ‘You’re not supposed to shoot so many times,’ ” said Dr. Baden, who retired from the state police in 2011. “Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.”

No matter what conclusions can be drawn from Dr. Baden’s work, Mr. Brown’s death remains marked by shifting and contradictory accounts more than a week after it occurred. The shooting is under investigation by St. Louis County and by the F.B.I., working with the Justice Department’s civil rights division and the office of Attorney General Holder.

According to what has emerged so far, on Saturday, Aug. 9, Mr. Brown, along with a companion, Dorian Johnson, was walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a fistful of cigarillos in Mr. Brown’s hand, police say, which a videotape shows he stole from a liquor store on West Florissant Ave.

At 12:01 p.m., they were stopped by Darren Wilson, a police officer, who ordered them off the road and onto the sidewalk, Mr. Johnson, who is 22, later said.

The police have said that what happened next was a physical struggle between Mr. Brown and Officer Wilson that left the officer with a swollen face. Mr. Johnson and others have said that it was a case of racial profiling and police aggression from a white officer toward a black man. Within minutes, Mr. Brown, who was unarmed, was dead of gunshot wounds.

The sequence of events provided by law enforcement officials places Mr. Brown and Mr. Johnson at Ferguson Market and Liquors, a store several blocks away on West Florissant Ave., at about 11:50 a.m. After leaving the store with the cigarillos, the two walked north on West Florissant, a busy commercial thoroughfare, toward Canfield Drive, a clerk reported to the police.

Mr. Brown was a big man at 6-foot-4 and 292 pounds, though his family and friends described him as quiet and shy, a homebody who lived with his grandmother.

It is about a 10-minute walk from Ferguson Market to the spot where Officer Wilson, 28, with six years’ experience, approached Mr. Brown and Mr. Johnson.

The police tell of an officer who was enforcing the minor violation of jaywalking, as Mr. Brown and Mr. Johnson ignored the sidewalk and strolled down the middle of the road instead.

The morning after the shooting, Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County police said that Officer Wilson was leaving his police car when Mr. Brown “allegedly pushed the police officer back into the car,” where he “physically assaulted the police officer.”

“Within the police car there was a struggle over the officer’s weapon,” Chief Belmar said. “There was at least one shot fired in the car.” At that point, the police said, Officer Wilson left his vehicle and fatally shot Mr. Brown. “More than a few” shell casings were recovered from the scene.

Mr. Johnson, who declined to be interviewed, has described the events differently in television interviews. While he and Mr. Brown walked, he said, Officer Wilson stopped his vehicle and told them to get on the sidewalk. When they refused, Officer Wilson slammed on his brakes and drove in reverse to get closer.

When the officer opened his door, it hit Mr. Brown. With his left hand, Officer Wilson reached out and grabbed Mr. Brown by the neck, Mr. Johnson said.

“It’s like tug-of-war,” Mr. Johnson said. “He’s trying to pull him in. He’s pulling away, that’s when I heard, ‘I’m gonna shoot you.’ ”

A witness, Tiffany Mitchell, {said in an interview with MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word-with-lawrence-odonnell/watch/eyewitness-to-brown-shooting-tells-her-story-318326851993""> that she heard tires squeal, then saw Mr. Brown and Officer Wilson “wrestling” through the open car window. A shot went off from within the car, Mr. Johnson said, and the two began to run away from the officer.

According to Ms. Mitchell, “The officer gets out of his vehicle,” she said, pursuing Mr. Brown, then continued to shoot.

Mr. Johnson said that he hid behind a parked car and that Mr. Brown was struck by a bullet in his back as he ran away, an account that Dr. Baden’s autopsy appears to contradict.

“Michael’s body jerks as if he was hit,” Ms. Mitchell said, “and then he put his hands up.” Mr. Brown turned, Mr. Johnson said, raised his hands, and said, “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!”

Officer Wilson continued to fire and Mr. Brown crumpled to the ground, Mr. Johnson said. Within seconds, confusion and horror swept through Canfield Drive. On that Saturday afternoon, dozens of neighbors were at home and rushed out of their apartments when they heard gunshots.

One person who claimed to witness the shooting began posting frantic messages on Twitter, written hastily with shorthand and grammatical errors, only two minutes after Officer Wilson approached Mr. Brown. At 12:03 p.m., the person, identified as {@TheePharoah}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TheePharoah"">, a St. Louis-area rapper, wrote on Twitter that {he had just seen someone die}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TheePharoah/status/498152572062945281"">.

That same minute, {he wrote}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TheePharoah/status/498152622012907520"">, “Im about to hyperventilate.”

At 12:23 p.m., he wrote, “dude was running and the cops just saw him. I saw him die bruh.”

{A 10-minute video}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdL9dqkyjhM""> posted on YouTube appeared to be taken on a cellphone by someone who identified himself as a neighbor. The video, which has collected more than 225,000 views, captures Mr. Brown’s body, the yellow police tape that marked off the crime scene and the residents standing behind it.

“They shot that boy ’cause they wanted to,” said one woman who can be heard on the video.

“They said he had his hands up and everything,” said the man taking the video, speaking to a neighbor.

Mr. Brown’s body remained in the street for several hours, a delay that Chief Jackson said last week made him “uncomfortable.” Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who has been active in this case, {said on ABC on Sunday}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/video/embed?id=25013581""> that the body had remained in the street for nearly five hours.

At one point, a woman can be heard shouting, “Where is the ambulance? Where is the ambulance?” The man taking the video, who remained off-camera, said, “God rest his soul. He’s gone.”",2745,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt38,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/us/shooting-accounts-differ-as-holder-schedules-visit.html,Shooting Accounts Differ as Holder Schedules Visit to Ferguson,Frances Robles; Michael S. Schmidt,08/19/2014,04/12/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — As a county grand jury prepared to hear evidence on Wednesday in the shooting death of a black teenager by a white police officer that touched off 10 days of unrest here, witnesses have given investigators sharply conflicting accounts of the killing.

Some of the accounts seem to agree on how the fatal altercation initially unfolded: with a struggle between the officer, Darren Wilson, and the teenager, Michael Brown. Officer Wilson was inside his patrol car at the time, while Mr. Brown, who was unarmed, was leaning in through an open window.

Many witnesses also agreed on what happened next: Officer Wilson’s firearm went off inside the car, Mr. Brown ran away, the officer got out of his car and began firing toward Mr. Brown, and then Mr. Brown stopped, turned around and faced the officer.

But on the crucial moments that followed, the accounts differ sharply, officials say. Some witnesses say that Mr. Brown, 18, moved toward Officer Wilson, possibly in a threatening manner, when the officer shot him dead. But others say that Mr. Brown was not moving and may even have had his hands up when he was killed.

The accounts of what witnesses have told local and federal law enforcement authorities come from some of those witnesses themselves, law enforcement authorities and others in Ferguson. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing investigation.

The new details on the witness accounts emerged as Attorney General {Eric H. Holder Jr.}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/eric_h_holder_jr/index.html?inline=nyt-per""> was scheduled to visit Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with {F.B.I.}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_bureau_of_investigation/index.html?inline=nyt-org""> agents who have been conducting a civil rights investigation into the shooting.

Mr. Holder and top Justice Department officials were weighing whether to open a broader civil rights investigation to look at Ferguson’s police practices at large, according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal talks. The issue came up after news reports revealed a 2009 case in which a man said that four police officers beat him, then charged him with damaging government property — by getting blood on their uniforms.

Under Mr. Holder, the Justice Department has opened nearly two dozen such investigations into police departments, more than twice as many as were opened in the previous five years, according to department data.

Also on Tuesday, federal authorities learned the results of an autopsy performed on Mr. Brown by military coroners that showed that he had been shot six times, though they declined to release further details until their investigation was finished. An autopsy conducted on behalf of Mr. Brown’s family also found that he had been shot at least six times — including once in the face and once in the top of his head — with all bullets striking him in the front. The county has also done its own autopsy, which found evidence of marijuana in Mr. Brown’s system.

The Brown family has scheduled a funeral for Monday.

Clashes between the police and protesters have become a nightly ritual, although the scene on Tuesday was initially calm. The authorities took their positions before sunset, and Missouri National Guard soldiers staffed checkpoints at the shopping center that is now a police command post. Demonstrators marched without incident while officers watched. The quiet nature of the protests raised hopes that they had entered a calmer phase, but more confrontations were reported overnight, with 47 people arrested.

In a statement on Tuesday night, Gov. Jay Nixon expressed sympathy for the Brown family and praised residents for “standing against armed and violent instigators.” But he also said that “a vigorous prosecution must now be pursued.”

“The democratically elected St. Louis County prosecutor and the attorney general of the United States each have a job to do,” Mr. Nixon said. “Their obligation to achieve justice in the shooting death of Michael Brown must be carried out thoroughly, promptly and correctly, and I call upon them to meet those expectations.”

The fatal confrontation began on Aug. 9 shortly after the police received reports that two men had robbed a convenience store in Ferguson. Officer Wilson, who was not responding to the robbery, had stopped to speak with Mr. Brown and a friend, Dorian Johnson. The Ferguson police chief, Thomas Jackson, said that it was around the time that Officer Wilson started talking to the two that he realized they fit the description of the suspects in the convenience store robbery.

A lawyer for Mr. Johnson said that his client was interviewed by the F.B.I. and the St. Louis County police last week for nearly four hours. In that interview, Mr. Johnson admitted that he and Mr. Brown had stolen cigarillos from the store, said the lawyer, Freeman R. Bosley Jr.

Mr. Bosley said that the officer told the two to get off the street, adding that Mr. Johnson told the officer that he lived nearby. They got into a bit of a verbal dispute with the officer about whether walking in the street constituted a crime, Mr. Bosley said.

Contrary to what several witnesses have told law enforcement officials, Mr. Bosley said that the officer then reached out of the window with his left hand and grabbed Mr. Brown by the throat.

He said Mr. Brown pushed him off, and the officer then grabbed Mr. Brown’s shirt.

“My client sees the officer pull a gun and hears him say, ‘I’ll shoot you’ — then ‘pow!’ there was a shot,” Mr. Bosley said, referring to the one that apparently went off in the car. “He did not describe a scuffle. It was more of a scuffle for him to get away.”

Asked if Mr. Brown had punched the officer, Mr. Bosley said that Mr. Johnson “did not observe that.”

However, law enforcement officials say witnesses and forensic analysis have shown that Officer Wilson did sustain an injury during the struggle in the car.

As Officer Wilson got out of his car, the men were running away. The officer fired his weapon but did not hit anyone, according to law enforcement officials.

Mr. Johnson took cover near a parked car as he saw the officer confronting Mr. Brown, Mr. Bosley said.

A man who lives nearby, Michael T. Brady, said in an interview that he saw the initial altercation in the patrol car, although he struggled to see exactly what was happening.

“It was something strange,” said Mr. Brady, 32, a janitor. “Something was not right. It was some kind of altercation. I can’t say whether he was punching the officer or whatever. But something was going on in that window, and it didn’t look right.”

Mr. Brady said he had been interviewed by county investigators, but not the F.B.I.

Mr. Brady said he could see Mr. Johnson at the front passenger side of the car when he and Mr. Brown suddenly started running. Mr. Brady did not hear a gunshot or know what caused them to run. But he said he did see a police officer get out of the patrol car and start walking briskly while firing on Mr. Brown as he fled.

What happened next could be what the case turns on. Several witnesses have told investigators that Mr. Brown stopped and turned around with his arms up.

According to his account to the Ferguson police, Officer Wilson said that Mr. Brown had lowered his arms and moved toward him, law enforcement officials said. Fearing that the teenager was going to attack him, the officer decided to use deadly force. Some witnesses have backed up that account. Others, however — including Mr. Johnson — have said that Mr. Brown did not move toward the officer before the final shots were fired.

A lawyer for the police union, Greg Kloeppel, did not return calls for comment.

The F.B.I., Mr. Bosley said, pressed Mr. Johnson to say how high Mr. Brown’s hands were. Mr. Johnson said that his hands were not that high, and that one was lower than the other, because he appeared to be “favoring it,” the lawyer said.

James McKnight, who also said he saw the shooting, said that Mr. Brown’s hands were up right after he turned around to face the officer.

“I saw him stumble toward the officer, but not rush at him,” Mr. McKnight said in a brief interview. “The officer was about six or seven feet away from him.”

Also Tuesday, a few miles from Ferguson, St. Louis Metropolitan Police officers shot and killed a 23-year-old black man. The shooting threatened to further inflame a community still reeling from Mr. Brown’s death.

Sam Dotson, the chief of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police, said two officers encountered a man at the Six Stars Market in northwest St. Louis behaving “erratically” and brandishing a knife. The officers repeatedly warned, “Stop, drop the knife,” but he refused, Chief Dotson said.

The man approached the officers, knife raised, and was shot after he came within three or four feet, the chief said.

In a sign of how tense the situation remains, Chief Dotson went out into a crowd at the scene of the shooting to tell it what the police understood had occurred. “I think it’s important that people understand what happened,” he said. He said witnesses, including a local alderman, had confirmed the account of the officers. “I want this message to be out as truthfully and quickly as possible,” the chief said.

But not all in the crowd were willing to listen. A small group of protesters, most of them black, gathered at the scene chanting, “Hands up! Don’t shoot!”

“Even if this is a legitimate shooting, they are going to capitalize on this and try to use it for their martial law agenda,” said Christopher Hobbs, 21, who had joined dozens of other residents at the scene.",1527,NA,NA,NA

The anger, however, is misplaced. The focus should not be on police gear, but on police conduct, which is increasingly appalling. The vast amount of tear gas fired just last night seemed wholly unjustified.

There is no doubt that too many police departments have over-indulged on homeland security grants and military surplus over the last 13 years, preparing for civil unrest or terror attacks that are highly unlikely to ever affect low-density suburbs or rural towns. As Matt Apuzzo {wrote in The Times in June}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html"">, even tiny Neenah, Wis., population 25,000, which hasn’t had a homicide in more than five years, now owns a 30-ton armored combat vehicle built to withstand land mines. But there was in fact a serious riot in Ferguson, Mo., beginning on Sunday, a day after a police officer shot to death an unarmed, 18-year-old black student. Bands of looters and vandals burned down a QuikTrip store and trashed at least 12 other businesses. If police officers feel they need to be protected head to toe in Kevlar, or intimidate violent crowds with a display of automatic rifles, that’s O.K. with me. Sometimes a show of force can prevent the use of actual force in the most volatile situations.

I’m more interested in how the police act than in how they’re dressed or what weapons they possess. They didn’t need heavy equipment, after all, to begin the entire incident by shooting Michael Brown on Saturday; that was done with a handgun. Why, for example, did a police officer in Ferguson climb atop an armored vehicle on Tuesday night and aim a sniper rifle at an unarmed, peaceful crowd, as {the Riverfront Times reported }<hyperlink=""http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2014/08/peaceful_protesters_dispersed_by_heavily_militarized_police_force_in_ferguson.php"">yesterday? (This unnecessary threat has been repeated throughout the demonstrations.) Why did officers {fire tear gas on Monday night}<hyperlink=""http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2014/08/police_in_ferguson_fire_tear_gas_on_protesters_with_hands_up_in_their_own_backyard.php""> at a group of protesters who were flinging no more than profanities in their direction, even chasing one of the protesters into his backyard with a tear gas canister? Why are they insisting on breaking up peaceful demonstrations of protest, while suppressing press reporting of their activity? On Wednesday, they {arrested and briefly jailed two reporters}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/washington-post-reporter-arrested-in-ferguson/?hpid=z3""> who were simply doing their jobs while sitting in a McDonald’s near the protest site.

When does the loosing of police dogs and the indiscriminate swing of a riot baton have the effect of creating more anger and violence than it was intended to stop? Radley Balko, a reporter at the Washington Post who has written about the rise of police militarization, {argues}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/55857456/#.U-vC4vk8B8H""> that the accumulation of equipment and the constant anti-terror training creates a mentality that turns residents into threats. That concern is particularly valid if military tactics begin to replace much more effective strategies like community policing, regular dialogue with local residents, and a real effort to make police forces reflect the makeup of their cities.

As The Times editorial board {wrote Wednesday morning}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/opinion/racial-history-behind-the-ferguson-protests.html"">, much of the anger in the streets of Ferguson can be traced to decades of racial discrimination and overbearing law enforcement in the area, much of it directed by white police officers against low-income black residents. This week’s actions, however, will create their own lasting memories, and in the words of the St. Louis Post Dispatch editorial board, are “doing incalculable harm, and not just to community relations in Ferguson” but around the region.

Armored vehicles aren’t themselves the problem. But the act of rolling them onto the streets for anything short of a mass terror attack is an admission that better police work is needed in Ferguson and any other town where they are used. A single police shooting in isolation wouldn’t cause a riot if trust hadn’t already broken down between an overwhelmingly white police force and a largely black town. If the people in power would spend more time talking to those without it, they would need a lot less Kevlar.",147,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt40,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/ferguson-robin-williams-and-the-russian-convoy.html?_r=0,"Ferguson, Robin Williams and the Russian Convoy",Serge Schmemann,08/15/2014,04/12/2016,"A psychiatrist once told me that people tend to focus more on bad news because human beings are genetically wired to identify dangers they should thereafter avoid. If so, people following the rioting in the small Missouri town of Ferguson most likely came away sensing that the danger to avoid was not the rioters, angered by the police killing of an unarmed 18-year-old African-American, but the police confronting the demonstrators, decked out like Marines preparing to retake Falluja.

Looking over the other news that attracted the most attention over the past week suggests that identifying dangers is not all that draws people to certain events.

There is also the bizarre. The slow journey of over 250 white-painted Russian trucks, driven toward Ukraine by men identically dressed in khaki shorts, T-shirts and caps, to deliver what was described as humanitarian assistance was more B-movie than reality. The strangeness of the convoy was heightened when Ukraine, caught by surprise and not entirely sure what to do about the Russian move, decided to send its own humanitarian convoy toward the embattled eastern provinces.

Conversely, entertainment became sad reality in the suicide of Robin Williams. The death of the brilliant comedian drew innumerable tributes, commentaries and analyses, recalling everything from his greatest lines to his love of bicycles and his history of depression.

Death of a Comedian

The complexity and confusion of our times was a major source of the instant quips that filled the extraordinarily rapid-fire monologues of Robin Williams. “The world is changing now, it’s beyond arithmetic,” he said in a Playboy interview in 1992. “It’s like into some Malthusian nightmare. In two seconds, governments are gone. Oops. It’s Lithuania — no, it’s Yugoslavia — no, it’s two countries. It’s changing that quick. And there’s so much to play off.” After he hanged himself at his home on Monday, we learned of his bouts with depression, alcohol and drugs, and of his incipient Parkinson’s. If anything, the revelations of his suffering made Mr. Williams seem all the more endearing, and his genius all the more remarkable. When his routines and movies are replayed — and they will be, again and again — we will be reminded that the ability to laugh at the foibles of the world, and at oneself, is not a simple burden. But it is a gift, which he shared with all.

The Mystery of the Convoy

Conflicts are by nature complex and hard to follow, but the fog over the Russia-Ukraine spat has been unusually thick. One reason is that a major weapon deployed by Russia, and to a lesser degree by Ukraine, has been propaganda and outright lies. Russia, for example, has denied that the secessionist rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk are even supported by Russia, though there is no lack of evidence that they are not only armed and backed by Russia, but that many of them are Russian citizens.

The long line of white trucks that as of Friday was parked near the Ukraine border — evidently repainted army trucks, driven by identically dressed “volunteers” who declined to identify who sent them and purportedly filled with humanitarian supplies — blends perfectly into this fog.

According to the Russians, the 262 trucks are a good-will gesture, bringing food and supplies to residents of war-ravaged eastern Ukraine. Reporters for whom one truck was opened saw sacks filled with buckwheat and boxes filled with sleeping bags. The reporters said the inside of the truck was still painted green.

According to Kiev, the trucks are either a cynical propaganda gimmick or a Trojan convoy, bringing unknown reinforcement to the secessionist forces. In either case, Kiev has said it will allow the trucks in only if they are first checked out by Ukrainian inspectors and then driven in under Red Cross supervision.

In parallel with the convoy, Western journalists reported on Thursday that they saw several Russian armored personnel carriers crossing into Ukraine. NATO confirmed that it had observed a Russian “incursion,” and the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, claimed on his website that most of the Russian vehicles had been destroyed. Mr. Poroshenko offered no proof.

Moscow, for its part, denied that any of its vehicles, civil or military, had cross into Ukraine.

The Militarized Police

The shooting on Feb. 9 of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, by a white policeman reportedly investigating a holdup at a convenience store was a tragically familiar reflection of the systemic discrimination that persists against black and Hispanic youths and men across America. The details of the shooting are under investigation, and at week’s end the Ferguson police finally made public the name of the police officer who shot Mr. Brown.

The less familiar part of the story was the militarized police force that appeared in the streets of Ferguson, a town of only 21,200, to confront angry protesters. The millions of dollars of military equipment on display along Ferguson’s West Florissant Avenue — including a $360,000 BearCat armored truck, helicopters and most of the body armor worn by police officers — was clearly not designed for crowd control.

On the contrary, the police, with their assault rifles, combat helmets and armored vehicles, only further angered the crowds. It was only when Gov. Jay Nixon finally sent an officer of the state’s highway patrol to take charge, and Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, an African-American native of Ferguson, sent the heavy armaments away and started talking to the protesters, that the passions ebbed.

The images of militarized police taking aim at people they are sworn to protect has put a spotlight on the programs that have enabled police departments across the United States — including many small ones, like Ferguson’s 53-strong force — to acquire combat gear. Much of it has come from Department of Homeland Security grants dispensed since the “war on terror” was declared in the wake of 9/11. Since 2003, the St. Louis Area Regional Response System of the Department of Homeland Security has spent $9.4 million on equipment for St. Louis County, which includes Ferguson, according to the executive director, Nick Gragnani.

Law enforcement agencies across the United States have also received military gear from the Pentagon under the 1033 program, enacted in 1997 to distribute surplus military gear.

There are few restrictions on the use of any of the gear, and until now there has been little debate about its distribution.

But apart from the question of whether fighting terrorism requires arming local cops to the teeth, Ferguson demonstrated the inherent danger of deploying aggressive and highly militarized police in a confrontation where the goal, as Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said, was “to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

The rioting this past week in Ferguson, Mo., by contrast, follows more than a decade of economic stagnation and worse for many black Americans, a trend that appears unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future.

The week of violence in L.A. began just five days after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed {the Voting Rights Act}<hyperlink=""http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php""> of 1965, and 13 months after he had signed {the Civil Rights Act}<hyperlink=""http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act/""> of 1964 – the impact of which had not yet been felt in the daily lives of African-Americans.

During the decades following this landmark legislation, African-Americans made immense progress. The percentage of blacks over the age 25 with a high school degree {more than tripled}<hyperlink=""http://www.census.gov/prod/99pubs/99statab/sec04.pdf"">, going from just under 20 percent, or less than half the white rate, to more than 70 percent, nearly matching the white rate. The percentage of blacks over 25 with a college degree quadrupled from 3 to 12 percent over the same period.

Similarly, {black median household income grew,}<hyperlink=""http://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/p60-213.pdf""> in inflation-adjusted dollars, from $22,974 in 1967 to $30,439 in 2000, a 32.5 percent increase, more than double the 14.2 percent increase for whites. Although black household income remained well below white levels in 2000 – 66.3 percent of the white median – it was significantly better than it had been in 1967, when it was 57.1 percent of white median income.

Things went off track, however, as the 21st century approached. The riots in Ferguson follow a period of setback for African-Americans, despite the fact that we have a sitting black president in the White House.

While {the economic downturns}<hyperlink=""http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/11/art2full.pdf""> of the last decade-and-a-half have taken their toll on the median income of all races and ethnic groups, blacks have been the hardest hit. By 2012, black median household income had fallen to 58.4 percent of white income, almost back to where it was in 1967 — 7.9 points below its level in 1999. ({This Census Bureau chart}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2014/08/20/opinion/20edsall.html""> shows the long-term income trends for major demographic groups in America.)

Income is a powerful measure of well-being, but equally important is the chance a person has of improving his or her position in life — of whether expectations are rising or falling.

Inequality in America is not news, and there have been {a number of studies}<hyperlink=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w19843""> published recently that challenge the old notion that the United States is the land of opportunity for all, but for African Americans, the findings are particularly bleak.

From 1965 to 2000, the poverty rate among blacks {fell}<hyperlink=""http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33069.pdf""> from 41.8 percent to 22.5 percent. Since then, it has risen to 27.2 percent. The white poverty rate also rose during this period, but by a more modest 3.2 points.

Blacks suffered more than whites as a result of the 2008-9 financial meltdown and its aftermath, but the negative trends for African-Americans began before then.

A 2007 pre-recession Brookings Institution {study}<hyperlink=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2007/11/blackwhite-isaacs""> by Julia Isaacs, “Economic Mobility of Black and White Families,” found that “a majority of blacks born to middle-income parents grow up to have less income than their parents. Only 31 percent of black children born to parents in the middle of the income distribution have family income greater than their parents, compared to 68 percent of white children from the same income bracket.”

White children, Isaacs reports, “are more likely to move up the ladder while black children are more likely to fall down.” Thirty-seven percent of white children born to families in the middle quintile of the income distribution move up to the top two quintiles, compared with only 17 percent of black children. Forty-five percent of black children from solidly middle class families “end up falling to the bottom of the income distribution, compared with only 16 percent of white children,” Isaacs found.

A {more recent April 2014 study}<hyperlink=""https://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/economic_perspectives/2014/1Q2014_part1_mazumder.pdf""> of black and white mobility by Bhashkar Mazumder, a senior economist at the Chicago Federal Reserve, showed similar results. That report is even more explicitly pessimistic.

The Chicago Fed study found that among black children born between the late 1950s and the early 1980s into families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution, half remained there as adults, compared with 26 percent of whites born in the bottom quintile.

Of black children born to families in the top half of the income distribution, 60 percent fell into the bottom half as working age adults, compared with 36 percent of similarly situated whites.

Mazumder concluded that if future generations of white and black Americans continued to experience the same rates of intergenerational mobility, “we should expect to see that blacks on average would not make any relative progress.” He noted that this recent time period stood “in direct contrast to other epochs in which blacks have made steady progress reducing racial differentials.”

One optimistic note is that the white reaction to events in Ferguson, including the commentary of some outspoken white conservatives, has been sympathetic to the anger and outrage over the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager. This stands in sharp distinction to the aftermath of the violence in Los Angeles in 1965.

Watts – and the {string of urban riots}<hyperlink=""http://www.socsci.umn.edu/~uggen/myers_asr_97.pdf""> in African-American neighborhoods from 1964 to 1968 — was crucial to the expansion of the conservative coalition that dominated most federal elections from 1966 to 2004. Fear of violence helped elect Ronald Reagan governor of California in 1966 and Richard Nixon to the presidency in 1968. Law and order, white backlash, the silent majority, and racial integration became core political preoccupations for once loyal Democratic whites as they converted to the Republican Party.

Just two years after the Democratic landslide of 1964, in the 1966 midterm election, Republicans picked up 47 seats in the House. “How long are we going to abdicate law and order favor of a soft social theory that the man who heaves a brick through your window or tosses a firebomb into your car is simply the misunderstood and underprivileged product of a broken home?” Gerald Ford, then the House minority leader, {asked}<hyperlink=""http://cdn.worldheritage.org/articles/Law_and_order_(politics)in"">, with the answer assumed by the question.

Nearly half a century later, however, conservatives have voiced ambivalent responses to the Ferguson rioting. On Aug. 15, Erick Erickson, a popular conservative blogger at Red State, wrote a widely circulated posting titled “{Must We Have a Dead White Kid}<hyperlink=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/08/15/must_we_have_a_dead_white_kid_123663.html"">?”

“Given what happened in Ferguson, the community had every right to be angry,” Erickson wrote. “The police bungled their handling of the matter, became very defensive and behaved more like a paramilitary unit than a police force. Property damage and violence by the citizenry cannot be excused, but is also the result of a community seeing those who are supposed to protect and serve instead suiting up and playing soldier.”

Erickson was {by no means alone}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/politics/seeing-missouri-unrest-views-begin-to-shift-among-conservatives.html""> among conservatives. Sharing his views were {Senator Rand Paul}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> of Kentucky, a prospective Republican presidential candidate, and Charles C. W. Cooke, a National Review columnist, {who argued}<hyperlink=""http://www.nationalreview.com/article/385162/rights-wrong-reaction-missouri-shooting-charles-c-w-cooke""> that conservatives should “acknowledge that — even when our understanding of the facts is limited — incidents such as this open old and real wounds.”

The fatal shooting of Michael Brown has produced a rare right-left convergence, a shared recognition that the overwhelmingly white police department of Ferguson has become a hostile occupying force for much of the town’s majority black population.

There is, however, no left-right consensus about how to turn back the grim economic trends for African-Americans, much less what caused them.

Competing explanations for the difficulties that continue to plague African-Americans are a central element in the contemporary polarization between left and right; in fact, they help define it.

Liberals and conservatives disagree vehemently over the role of such factors as the decline of manufacturing jobs, the rise of single parenthood, racial discrimination, the poor quality of public schools, residential segregation, high incarceration rates, test score differentials, parental investment, crime rates, welfare incentives, the lack of engaged fathers – the list goes on.

Democrats in the main are convinced that impediments to black advancement are structural, amenable to government intervention: a strong and better-funded safety net; public investment in manufacturing and infrastructure employment; more rigorous enforcement of anti-discrimination laws.

Many Republicans focus instead on what they see as moral collapse and the erosion of such values as hard work and traditional family formation among the poor. Government spending on social programs, according to this view, creates disincentives to work and more trouble.

The urban riots of the second half of the 1960s prompted Washington to pump out money, legislation, judicial decisions and regulatory change to outlaw de jure discrimination, to bring African-Americans to the ballot box, to create jobs and to vastly expand the scope of anti-poverty programs.

Civil unrest also drew attention to {the necessity of addressing police brutality}<hyperlink=""http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/get-involved/constitution-activities/fifth-amendment/miranda-criminal-defense/facts-case-summary.aspx%20and%20http://crdl.usg.edu/events/ny_race_riots/?Welcome"">.

Today, however, political and policy-making stasis driven by gridlock — despite a momentary concordance between left and right on this particular shooting — insures that we will undertake no comparable initiatives to reverse or even stem the trends that have put black Americans at an increasing disadvantage in relation to whites — a situation that plays no small part in fueling the rage currently on display in Ferguson.",373,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt42,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/if-they-gunned-me-down-protest-on-twitter.html,Shooting Spurs Hashtag Effort on Stereotypes,Tanzina Vega,08/12/2014,04/12/2016,"When Tyler Atkins heard about the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., he posted on Twitter a picture of himself in a tuxedo, with a saxophone around his neck, next to a {photograph}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/blackflautist/statuses/498637765790019584""> of himself dressed in a black T-shirt with a blue bandanna tied around his head and his finger pointed at the camera.

Like hundreds of young African-Americans, he placed his pictures under the hashtag {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/IfTheyGunnedMeDown?src=hash"">, protesting Mr. Brown’s killing by a police officer and the way young black men are depicted in the news media. He said that Mr. Brown’s identity was distorted and filtered through negative stereotypes, and that the same would have been done to him with the bandanna image if he found himself the victim of a similar event.

The first picture was taken after a jazz concert at the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Houston, where Mr. Atkins, a senior, studies music. The other was taken during a recording for a {rap video}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er_W1MotDSg""> he made with friends for a school math project.

“Had the media gained ahold of this picture, I feel it would be used to portray that I was in a gang, which is not true at all,” Mr. Atkins, 17, wrote in an email.

The speed with which the shooting of Mr. Brown has resonated on social media has helped propel and transform a local shooting into a national cause, as African-American commenters draw attention to continued episodes of violence directed at African-Americans and the media portrayals of young black men. “This affects me deeply because the stories of Mike Brown, Renisha McBride, Trayvon Martin, Sean Bell, Amadou Diallo and many more could have been me,” Mr. Atkins wrote, referring to the shooting deaths of blacks, some at the hands of police officers.

On Tuesday, President Obama issued a {statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/08/12/statement-president-passing-michael-brown""> calling the shooting “heartbreaking” and urging Americans to remember Mr. Brown “through reflection and understanding.”

Mr. Obama said, “I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions,” adding, “We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.”

Brittney Gault, 28, a student at DePaul University, said the {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/IfTheyGunnedMeDown?src=hash""> campaign gained popularity because of the strength of black Twitter users collectively known as “Black Twitter.”

“They are really a media response team,” Ms. Gault said. “Everybody is tapped into Black Twitter.”

And the social media chatter and anguish have become part of a complicated sea of viral words and images — a picture Tuesday of police officers in combat gear pointing military-style rifles at a young black man in jeans and a blue T-shirt was one of them — that have created a new and charged environment for social activism.

According to data from the Pew Research Internet Project, 40 percent of African-Americans ages 18 to 29 use Twitter, compared with 28 percent of whites of the same age.

Since the {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/IfTheyGunnedMeDown?src=hash""> campaign began, the phrase has been used on Twitter more than 168,000 times. Commenters on Twitter are also hoping to organize a series of vigils called the National Moment of Silence, which is meant to commemorate victims like Mr. Brown. The St. Louis County N.A.A.C.P. urged people on Twitter to use the hashtags #MikeBrown and #blacklifematters “so that your posts can be seen nationally.”

Local authorities in Ferguson are less enthusiastic about social media’s role, blaming it for inciting looting and violence following after the events. “They have the ability to understand where they’re all going to be, and they can basically plan where they want to go next,” said Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief. “So it’s a really efficient way to communicate.”

Local officials have also declined to release the name of the officer who shot Mr. Brown, citing concerns about the officer’s safety because of threats on social media.

The {image}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/NBCNews/statuses/498526729728565250""> of Mr. Brown that spurred the campaign on Twitter showed him with the fingers of his right hand extended in what some considered a peace sign, but which others called a gang sign. A spokeswoman for NBC News, one of the outlets that published the photograph online, said it was taken from Mr. Brown’s personal Facebook page, where it was his profile picture.

Tosan Tutse-Tonwe, 32, a blogger, consultant and co-founder of a nonprofit group called Act 4 Accountability, said photographs remove context from a situation, particularly in the wake of negative stereotypes about black men.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Mr. Tutse-Tonwe posted a photograph of himself wearing a T-shirt from his group and another with a black male friend who is flashing peace signs. Mr. Tutse-Tonwe said he chose to post the photograph with his friend after the image of Mr. Brown making the same hand gesture was circulated.

“Mike was throwing up a peace sign and people thought it was a gang sign? You’ve got to be kidding me,” Mr. Tutse-Tonwe said. “People make these leaps and there’s no basis in them and they go unchecked.”

Jeremy Connally, 24, a student studying computer science at University of Texas at Arlington, agreed. “They’re portrayed as if they deserved it, cop versus robbers, good guys versus bad guys,” he said. The Twitter engagement is part of broader efforts to use social media as a tool for education and engagement, particularly among the young. Few things have been more of a spur to passionate campaigns on Twitter and other social media than some of the racially charged killings of young blacks in recent years.

Last week, when The Associated Press published a Twitter message announcing that Theodore P. Wafer had been found guilty of second-degree murder for killing Ms. McBride, Twitter users reacted swiftly, criticizing the post that described Mr. Wafer as a “suburban Detroit homeowner” and Ms. McBride as a “woman who showed up drunk on porch.”

In response, Twitter users posted African-American history images, including one featuring a slave ship with the headline, “Families board wrong ship, end up in wrong place.”

Yemisi Miller-Tonnet, 19, a student at Spelman College in Atlanta, said social media movements should be taken seriously. “Hashtag activism is activism,” Ms. Miller-Tonnet said. “We might be tweeting from a couch, but we’re also getting up and doing the work that needs to be done.”",676,NA,NA,NA

Konstantin Dolgov, the Russian foreign ministry’s commissioner for “human rights, democracy and rule of law,” {also weighed in Tuesday}<hyperlink=""http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/745732""> on the police response to {the protests in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/12/us/13police-shooting-of-black-teenager-michael-brown.html""> over the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, on Aug. 9. Taking note of “the high degree of tension in U.S. society, which remains split along racial lines,” Mr. Dolgov said that the U.S. “should take care of large-scale internal problems and take effective measures to resolve them.”

The ministry’s official Twitter feed shared a report on Mr. Dolgov’s comments with a photograph of Hedy Epstein, a 90-year-old Holocaust survivor and political activist based in St. Louis, {being arrested on Monday}<hyperlink=""http://www.jta.org/2014/08/19/news-opinion/united-states/holocaust-survivor-activist-arrested-in-st-louis-protests""> for protesting the Missouri governor’s decision to deploy the National Guard in Ferguson.

[tweetbegin 501821925820088320 tweetend]

“While urging other countries to guarantee the freedom of speech and not to suppress antigovernment protests, the United States authorities at home are not too soft with those actively expressing discontent over persistent inequalities, actual discrimination and the situation of ‘second class’ citizens,” Mr. Dolgov added.

The “extreme mayhem” has also become a major focus for the Kremlin-funded news network Russia Today, or RT, which targets viewers abroad through broadcasts in English, Spanish and Arabic that often highlight America’s shortcomings with a neo-Soviet zeal.

This week, RT’s main English-language channel featured regular updates from the “war zone” by its correspondent Anastasia Churkina — a daughter of Russia’s United Nations ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin.

RT’s news agency, Ruptly, has filled its YouTube channel with {live streams from Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://youtu.be/cHfVrTl62m0"">, raw footage of tear gas victims and a drone’s-eye view of protesters near a looted and torched gas station.

Absent from this coverage was any mention of the laws that effectively ban street protests in Russia or the jailing of prominent bloggers and dissidents. Then again, as the Russian-American writer Julia Ioffe {explained in The New Republic}<hyperlink=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119078/ferguson-civil-rights-cold-war-russia-protests""> last week, officials in Moscow have long relied on discussions of racial inequality in the United States to counter criticism of their own human rights abuses. “The now sacred Russian tactic of ‘whataboutism’ started with civil rights,” Ms. Ioffe wrote. “Whenever the U.S. pointed to Soviet human rights violations, the Soviets had an easy riposte. ‘Well, you,’ they said, ‘lynch Negros.'”

While the unrest has also shocked American observers and foreign correspondents from other Western democracies — including British and German reporters who have been struck by the “sounds of battle” and {endured arrest}<hyperlink=""https://medium.com/@monberl/the-day-the-u-s-police-became-my-enemy-81dd63ddb669""> — some of the most strident criticism of the police violence in Ferguson has come from authoritarian nations where the police are often venerated and dissent is scarcely tolerated.

Coverage that echoes the broadcasts from Moscow has also appeared on Iran’s state-run Press TV, in reports about the use of force “to suppress protests in Ferguson,” that also make no mention of how demonstrations are dispersed in Iran.

A series of updates to the Twitter feed of Iran’s nation’s ruling cleric, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, took matters further. Several tweets in the ayatollah’s name drew attention to America’s long history of racism.

Other messages from Iran’s supreme leader were premised on the conspiracy theory that American leaders ignore the suffering of their own people because of “Zionist domination” and a preoccupation with the defense of Israel.

Not to be outdone, a spokesman for Egypt’s foreign ministry, Badr Abdel-Atti, {told the official news agency MENA}<hyperlink=""http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/108764.aspx""> on Tuesday that his country was “closely following” the protests in Ferguson. According to the state-owned Ahram Online, Egypt “called on U.S. authorities to exercise restraint and deal with the protests in accordance with U.S. and international standards.” The statement came just days after the first anniversary of the massacre of hundreds of peaceful protesters by the same military-backed government.

As my colleague {Austin Ramzy reported}<hyperlink=""http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/chinese-media-weigh-in-on-aftermath-of-missouri-shooting/"">, China’s official Xinhua news agency also published a commentary this week attacking the United States for racism and hypocrisy when it comes to human rights. “The Ferguson incident once again demonstrates that even if in a country that has for years tried to play the role of an international human rights judge and defender, there is still much room for improvement at home,” {Xinhua editorialized}<hyperlink=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2014-08/18/c_133564928.htm"">. “Obviously,” it concluded, “what the United States needs to do is to concentrate on solving its own problems rather than always pointing fingers at others.”

NYTimes,nyt45,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/europe/in-russia-scenes-from-ferguson-are-played-as-nothing-shocking-its-america.html," In Russia, Scenes From Ferguson Are Played as Nothing Shocking: It’s America",David M. Herszenhorn,08/19/2014,04/12/2016,"MOSCOW — At least once an hour, sometimes more frequently, images of battalions of riot police officers in helmets clashing with demonstrators fill the screen of Rossiya 24, one of Russia’s major government-controlled television channels, and newscasters speaking in grave tones inveigh against the injustice and violence by the authorities.

The images are not from Kiev, Ukraine, or from here in Moscow, where such scenes have been more than familiar in recent years. They are from Ferguson, Mo., where the shooting death of Michael Brown and the crackdown by the authorities against protesters have provided the latest opportunity for Russia to portray its detractors in America as hypocrites.

“Cases of racism are still not rare in the nation of exemplary democracy,” an anchor on Rossiya 24 said on Tuesday, as Ferguson again grabbed a prominent place in the evening news cycle.

In Russia’s more tabloid-style news outlets, close coverage of the events in Missouri, including such details as the rap star Nelly’s appearing in support of the demonstrators, has overshadowed the other big story in recent days: that of a high school music teacher under pressure to resign after she inadvertently posted a naked selfie on VKontakte, the Russian social media site.

The Russian government itself weighed in on Tuesday. In a long statement, Konstantin Dolgov, the Foreign Ministry’s special representative for human rights, baldly accused the United States of hypocrisy, and said Washington would do better to focus on its own problems rather than intervening in other countries “under the false pretext of defending democracy and human rights.”

“While urging other countries to guarantee the freedom of speech and not to suppress antigovernment protests, the United States authorities at home are not too soft with those actively expressing discontent over persistent inequalities, actual discrimination and the situation of ‘second class’ citizens,” Mr. Dolgov said.

He added, “American human rights activists are sounding the alarm.”

Over the years, Washington has persistently condemned the Kremlin’s suppression of political dissent. The United States was sharply critical, for example, when scuffles between the police and huge crowds denouncing President Vladimir V. Putin in 2012 led to dozens of arrests. Criminal trials in some of those cases are still in the news here.

That has given Russia ample motive to gloat whenever accusations arise of heavy-handedness by American law enforcement in the face of public protests.

More recently, of course, the United States — to the Kremlin’s great dismay — sided strongly in favor of street protesters in Kiev, who this year succeeded in ousting Ukraine’s president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. An assistant secretary of state, Victoria Nuland, had visited with the demonstrators in Independence Square and handed out cookies. Several United States officials, including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, also visited Kiev to show solidarity and even addressed the crowd from the stage.

The focus on the Ferguson situation is hardly a surprise.

Russia paid similarly close attention, for instance, when demonstrators from the Occupy Wall Street movement were arrested in New York in 2011, and government-controlled news media outlets have often rebroadcast video of those arrests to make the same point as their coverage of Ferguson: The freedom of assembly enshrined in the Bill of Rights is not as absolute as promoters of American democracy might suggest.

It is not only harsh treatment of protesters that draws Russia’s disapproving eye. Gun crimes, such as school shootings, which are relatively rare in Russia, also get heavy publicity when they occur in the United States.

The police response in Missouri — and Russia’s official smirking — has caused deep consternation among critics of the Kremlin here. They see it as being exploited to excuse Russia’s much more pervasive and deep-rooted restrictions on civil liberties, as well as its often arbitrary — and Kremlin-dominated — law enforcement and judicial systems.

Maria Baronova, who was arrested at one of the white-ribbon protests against Mr. Putin, {posted a photo on Twitter}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ponny1/status/501718257108520960""> on Tuesday of heavily armed St. Louis County police officers in helmets. Ms. Baronova had faced near-certain conviction on charges of inciting a riot, and she avoided a lengthy prison term only because she qualified for an amnesty program ahead of the Sochi Winter Olympics.

“Dear American gvrnmnt,” she wrote alongside the photograph on Twitter. “You can’t imagine how those who fight for freedom in Russia hate you these days. Putin saw this.”

One headline over an opinion feature in the newspaper MK this week asked, “Could Ferguson become a second Donetsk?” The reference was to the rebel-controlled city in eastern Ukraine, which was been ravaged by separatist violence. In the article, an expert contributor helpfully reassured that civil war was not imminent in the United States.

Coverage of the protests in Ferguson on LifeNews, a site close to the Russian authorities, included a picture of the police arresting Hedy Epstein, who the site noted is a 90-year-old Holocaust survivor. It also reported the arrest of Scott Olson, a photographer for Getty Images, “who tried to take pictures of the policemen.” The site added, “He was soon released.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

Many observers had speculated that the Chinese government and state-controlled media would rush to play up Michael Brown’s killing on Aug. 9 and the unrest that followed as an example of how the United States, which frequently criticizes China over its human rights record, has deep problems at home.

Last week {Chinese}<hyperlink=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/world/2014-08/17/c_1112109982.htm""> media coverage of the death of Mr. Brown was limited to short items that relied on foreign news agencies to spell out the bare essentials of the case. That changed late Sunday when the state-run Xinhua News Agency issued a commentary in Chinese, later published on Monday in {English}<hyperlink=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2014-08/18/c_133564928.htm""> with the headline, “Ferguson riot reveals U.S. racial divide, human rights flaw.” The piece quotes Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech and notes that the slain civil rights leader’s vision remains unfulfilled more than 50 years later. It lists the 1992 Los Angeles riots as an example of how racial inequality can “jeopardize social peace and security” in the United States.

It continues:

The Ferguson incident once again demonstrates that even if in a country that has for years tried to play the role of an international human rights judge and defender, there is still much room for improvement at home.

In its annual human rights report issued in February, the United States assaulted almost 200 countries across the world for their so-called poor human rights records.

However, the U.S. human rights flaws extend far beyond racial issues. As revealed by famous whistleblower Edward Snowden, the U.S. government has hacked into emails and mobile phones of ordinary Americans as well as leaders of other countries, including traditional U.S. allies.

What’s more, Uncle Sam has witnessed numerous shooting sprees on its own land and launched incessant drone attacks on foreign soil, resulting in heavy civilian casualties.

Each country has its own national conditions that might lead to different social problems. Obviously, what the United States needs to do is to concentrate on solving its own problems rather than always pointing fingers at others.

While Chinese state news outlets can be highly critical of problems in American society and its government’s actions abroad, they can be slow to comment on events in the United States that may provoke discussion of similar phenomena in China, such as violent crackdowns last spring on protests against a planned chemical plant in the southern city of Maoming. That’s particularly the case with breaking news in which the tenor of coverage can turn, as when the assignment of the state highway patrol to take over security temporarily {eased tensions}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-missouri-police-shooting.html""> last Thursday in Ferguson.

Chinese media are often vocal in response to American fault-finding with China.

With the publication of Xinhua’s discussion of Ferguson, the Chinese public has gradually begun to take up the subject on social media.

But few of those disturbances were as stubbornly resistant to resolution as the Missouri protests, which now have drawn the National Guard and even the White House into efforts to restore calm.

And as the unrest in Ferguson stretched into its ninth day after the black man, Michael Brown, was shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, political and civic leaders in other cities that endured similar violence said their experiences may offer lessons in how to manage such protests — or, in some cases, how not to.

Large mobilizations of police or National Guard forces have played a role in calming many riots. But by studying unrest in Cincinnati, Oakland, Los Angeles and elsewhere, big-city police officials have learned that the speedy release of information and close ties to religious and civic leaders are perhaps even more crucial to stopping violence once it starts, said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the {Police Executive Research Forum}<hyperlink=""http://www.policeforum.org/""> in Washington.

That Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri was forced to summon the National Guard on Monday to restore order in Ferguson speaks to the extent that the situation there has spun out of control, he said.

“Bringing in the National Guard, it’s hard to get your hands around what that strategy does for you,” Mr. Wexler said, “because at the end of the day, you’re going to have to live with the community. And the National Guard are going to be leaving.""

Critics say officials in Ferguson have added to tensions by making contradictory statements, declining to release details about the shooting and dispatching police units bearing military-style equipment into the streets.

But outside experts like Mr. Wexler noted that Ferguson officials began their efforts to quell violence at a disadvantage. Bigger cities can have racial animosity between police departments and minorities that can be even more bitter than the divide in Ferguson. But they also have established networks of neighborhood organizations with ties to City Hall, and years of experience dealing with large protests.

Experts said that Ferguson appears to have little of the social infrastructure that helps other cities restore calm in times of crisis. A suburb of about 21,000 people, it is two-thirds African-American, but only three of its 53 police officers are black.

Nor did its leaders seem prepared to respond to unrest, a lesson some leaders in other, larger cities have had to learn the hard way.

Cincinnati burst into rioting in 2001 after the police shot and killed an unarmed 19-year-old African-American with a record of minor offenses after a chase through the city’s Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. The shooting inflamed tensions between minority residents and the Police Department, which had already led to a lawsuit two years earlier charging the department with discrimination.

After the shooting, “we kind of threw up a wall and said, ‘We can’t talk about it because it’s under investigation,’ ” the mayor at the time, Charles Luken, said in an interview. Protesters besieged City Hall, where the City Council remained inside for hours but issued no statement responding to demands for justice.

“In hindsight I think we now know that the excuse of, ‘We can’t say anything because it’s under investigation,’ that doesn’t float,” Mr. Luken said. “You have to be straight with people, and that was our big lesson.”

The riots lasted four days, and led to a curfew and a stepped-up presence by 125 State Highway Patrol officers brought in to reinforce the local police. Mr. Luken said city leaders made a decision not to call in the National Guard. “We didn’t think that tanks and big military things, that large shows of force were going to help,” he said. Instead, there were times when the police backed off completely and “let people peacefully vent.”

Mr. Wexler, of the Police Executive Research Forum, said: “You have to get information out quickly, you have to build inroads with the community well before something happens, and if you don’t, it’s just an uphill battle from there.” He added, “Cincinnati didn’t do that, and they paid for it.”

On the other hand, experts say, Cincinnati and some other cities in similar situations made the right call by deploying enough police officers to restore order, but limiting the amount of firepower they had.

That was true in Los Angeles in 1992, when riots broke out after a jury acquitted four Los Angeles police officers of brutality in the {infamous beating}<hyperlink=""http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lapd/lapd.html""> of {Rodney King}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/rodney_glen_king/index.html?inline=nyt-per"">, a black man who had fled when the officers tried to stop his car.

“The police stood down in the inner-city communities. They took a lot of heat for that,” said Darnell Hunt, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of “Screening the Los Angeles ‘Riots’: Race, Seeing and Resistance.” “But as a response, it was in some ways better than what Ferguson is doing, in that there weren’t direct confrontations that could have led to a loss of life.”

“Things start to calm down once things run their course,” he said.

Cathy Lisa Schneider, a professor at American University and the author of “Police Power and Race Riots: Urban Unrest in Paris and New York,” said that many riots burn themselves out as anger and frustration are vented.

But “police forces can keep it going, and I think that’s what you’re seeing in Ferguson,” she said. “They’re constantly reinvigorating it by creating a new grievance for people to organize around or explode about.”

She also noted that in Ferguson, there seemed to be an absence of community-based groups that could act as interlocutors, negotiating with the police. In New York and Washington, such intervention has at times prevented rioting in tense situations involving race.

“I’m not sure who you could talk to in Ferguson because we haven’t heard their voices at all,” Ms. Schneider said. “Who is representing the community?”

Oakland rioted in 2009 after a Bay Area Rapid Transit officer {shot and killed}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/us/09verdict.html""> an unarmed black teenager — by accident, he said — as he lay on the ground. The officer immediately resigned and initially refused to talk to the authorities, but the transit agency met with residents and listened to complaints about the shooting for six hours, then agreed to review its policing procedures.

In Miami in 1989, rioting began in the mostly African-American neighborhood of Overtown after two unarmed black men were killed by a Hispanic officer. But the unrest settled a week later, when prosecutors charged the officer with manslaughter, without waiting for the findings of a police review panel or a grand jury.

In Cincinnati, repairing the wounds of the riots took years. The city entered into a voluntary agreement with the Justice Department to review and correct police procedures, and gradually worked through the problems.

“People were generally worried about the future of this city and how it was going to come out,” said Mr. Luken, the former mayor, “but curiously, it has come out of it bigger and better.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

A cousin of Michael Brown appealed for calm amid renewed anger in Ferguson, Mo. toward the police following the release of incident reports and images of Mr. Brown as a robbery suspect on the same day he was shot and killed by a police officer.

“Please support us,” Eric Davis said at a news conference with two of the family’s lawyers Anthony D. Gray and Daryl D. Parks. “But do not get distracted. We do not want to see any violence in the streets.”

Mr. Davis said it was deeply upsetting for Michael Brown’s family to learn that police officials had released information about their son as a suspect in a robbery at a convenience store without making it clear at the time that the robbery was not linked to the shooting.

Several hours after the release of the images and documents, Thomas Jackson, the police chief, told reporters Friday afternoon that the police officer involved in the shooting did not know Mr. Brown was a robbery suspect. He said the officer initially stopped Mr. Brown for walking in the middle of the road and blocking traffic.

Mr. Jackson said he released the documents at the request of media outlets seeking information about events that day. However, he did not release information about the shooting, which is under investigation by local and federal authorities.

“We must remain peaceful,” said Mr. Davis. “Whatever took place had nothing to do with an individual getting on his hands and knees with a universal call for surrender. The officer shot him. We want the truth to come out and we are sure it will. ”

Members of the Brown family hold a news conference outside police headquarters in Ferguson, Mo.

Thomas Jackson, the police chief in Ferguson, Mo., said the police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown did not know about an earlier robbery when he stopped Mr. Brown.

Chief Jackson said the police officer stopped Mr. Brown because he was walking in the middle of the street, blocking traffic.

“This robbery does not relate to the initial contact between the officer and Michael Brown,” Chief Jackson said. “His initial contact was not related to the robbery.”

Chief Jackson came under fire from residents and the family of Mr. Brown, who said that they were “beyond outraged” that police officials released surveillance video and incident reports that say Mr. Brown was involved in a robbery at a convenience store on the day of the shooting.

Chief Jackson defended the release of the video and images, saying that they were requested by numerous media outlets, and that he had to make the information public under state open records laws. He said that he publicly released the name of the police officer at the same time so that he could make public all of the information that he had.

However, he refused to discuss information surrounding the investigation into the shooting.

He described the officer, identified as Darren Wilson, as a gentle person with six years of law enforcement experience. “He never intended for anything like this to happen,” he said.

Live video of news conference with Thomas Jackson, police chief in Ferguson, Mo.

In a statement, the family of Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old black man fatally shot by the police in Ferguson, Mo., said they were “beyond outraged at the devious way” the police chief had made public information about events on the day of the shooting.

Earlier, city officials released an incident report and surveillance photos of a robbery suspect at a convenience store on the day of the shooting. The police said the man in the photos was Mr. Brown.

The family statement said the information was distributed in such a way that it was intended to “assassinate the character of their son.”

The incident report and photos renewed anger among residents in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, where protesters have clashed with the police over the shooting.

The full statement from the family of Michael Brown and their lawyers:

Michael Brown’s family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piecemeal information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.

There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.

The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.

It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.

The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.

At a news conference, Gov. Jay Nixon and Capt. Ronald S. Johnson said no arrests had been made on Thursday night during protests in Ferguson, in sharp contrast to the previous violent clashes between officers and demonstrators.

“Clearly, as we’ve seen over the last 18 to 20 hours, we’ve made progress,” said Mr. Nixon, who sought to ease tensions in the St. Louis suburb by appointing Captain Johnson, of the Highway Patrol, to oversee security.

But the news conference soon turned into what {Alan Blinder, a Times reporter in Ferguson, described as a “town hall” meeting}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/alanblinder/status/500317449221570560"">, with residents bitterly complaining about police officials’ release of a report identifying Michael Brown as a suspect in a robbery at a convenience store on the day of the shooting.

Some residents said that they believed officials released the police report about the robbery as an attempt to justify the shooting.

Faced with renewed anger, Captain Johnson asked for calm and promised that he would return to the streets on Friday night and walk with protesters in an effort to keep peace in Ferguson.

“This inner anger, we have to make sure we don’t burn down our own house,” Captain Johnson said.

In response to requests from news media outlets, city officials in Ferguson, Mo., released the following “still photographs of certain frames of the surveillance video showing the crime giving rise to the initial 9-1-1.”

The security camera video showed a confrontation inside the store about 15 minutes before Saturday’s fatal shooting of Michael Brown. The images show a man, identified by the police as Mr. Brown, who appears to be pushing a store clerk.

The police said that Mr. Brown, who was in the store with a friend, had stolen a box of Swisher Sweets cigars. When confronted by the clerk, Mr. Brown “forcefully pushed him back into a display rack” before leaving, a police report said.

Gov. Jay Nixon on Friday issued a statement after the Ferguson Police Department provided information about the officer involved in the shooting on Saturday of Michael Brown:

I’m pleased that the people of Ferguson and the region began to get some long-overdue information today, and I will continue to call for openness and transparency as the parallel investigations into this tragedy proceed to their necessary conclusions. For the sake of the family, the citizens of Ferguson, and the entire region, it is vital that the investigations into the shooting death of Michael Brown move forward in a thorough, open and transparent manner to ensure that trust is restored and justice is done.

In response to requests from news media organizations and others, Ferguson city officials on Friday released the following police incident report and supplemental statements, in which responding officers reported their observations during the call and the ensuing investigation.

Thomas Jackson, the police chief in Ferguson, Mo., identified the officer involved in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown as Darren Wilson. He said at a news conference that police officers had been responding to a report of a robbery.

Chief Jackson said that Officer Wilson had been alerted to the robbery shortly before the encounter with the teenager, Michael Brown, 18, who was walking home from a store on Saturday when he was shot.

The Ferguson police released security camera video after the news conference that showed a confrontation inside the store about 15 minutes before Saturday’s shooting. The images show a man, identified by the police as Mr. Brown, who appears to be pushing a store clerk.

The police said that Mr. Brown, who was in the store with a friend, had stolen a box of Swisher Sweets cigars. When confronted by the clerk, Mr. Brown “forcefully pushed him back into a display rack” before leaving, a police report said.

After several nights of violent clashes in Ferguson, Mo., between police officers and protesters, calm was restored to the St. Louis suburb overnight after a new police commander introduced a different approach.

In one of his first moves, Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, appointed by the governor to direct security operations, walked alongside several groups of protesters through the streets, listening to people and shaking hands.

He also told reporters that he had ordered troopers to remove their tear-gas masks, among other new tactics, to help ease tensions.

To pay tribute to Michael Brown, thousands of people attended peaceful protests in dozens of cities across the country on Thursday night, with many people sharing images from gatherings on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Here’s what Times Square looked like late Thursday.

NYTimes,nyt49,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-playing-soldier-in-the-suburbs.html,Playing Soldier in the Suburbs,Ross Douthat,08/16/2014,04/14/2016,"TO understand what’s been happening in Ferguson, Mo., where protests and violence following a cop’s shooting of an unarmed teenager summoned up a police response that looked more like a military invasion, it helps to flash back to the heyday of the Symbionese Liberation Army.

The S.L.A., one of the loopiest and most dangerous of the homegrown terrorist groups that flourished in the madhouse of the early 1970s, was already famous for kidnapping and “converting” Patty Hearst when its members engaged in a nationally televised shootout in Los Angeles in the spring of 1974.

The firefight, in which six terrorists died without injury to police or bystanders, helped publicize the innovations of a small group of Angeleno police officers. Eight years earlier, after the Watts riots, they began to develop the combat-ready police unit that played a central role in taking down the S.L.A. That unit was America’s first special weapons and tactics team, or SWAT.

In an era of riots and hijackings, the SWAT model understandably spread nationwide. But as the riots died away and the threat of domestic terror receded, SWAT tactics — helicopters, heavy weaponry, the works — became increasingly integrated into normal crime-fighting, and especially into the war on drugs.

This was phase one in the {militarization}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6003239/police-militarization-in-ferguson""> of America’s police forces, as described in Radley Balko’s essential 2013 book on the subject, “{The Rise of the Warrior Cop}<hyperlink=""http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/book/rise-of-the-warrior-cop/9781610394574"">.” Phase two, in which the federal government began supplying local police with military hardware, began in the 1990s and accelerated after 9/11, under the theory that Islamic terrorists could strike anywhere, and that it might take a cop with a grenade launcher to stop them.

In the name of local preparedness, Washington has been bestowing antiterror grants and Pentagon surplus on communities barely touched by major crime, let alone by terrorism. Tanks and aircraft, helmets and armor, guns and grenade launchers have flowed to police departments from Des Moines (home of two $180,000 {bomb-disarming robots}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/12/20/local-cops-ready-for-war-with-homeland-security-funded-military-weapons.html"">) to Keene, N.H. (population 23,000, murder rate infinitesimal and the proud custodian of an {armored BearCat}<hyperlink=""http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/03/14/10689730-nh-citys-new-military-muscle-raises-some-hackles"">).

Last week, The New Republic’s Alec MacGillis ran the {numbers for Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119081/militarized-police-response-michael-brown-protests-911-legacy""> and found that the state’s Department of Public Safety received about $69 million from the Department of Homeland Security in the past five years alone. Which helps explain why the streets of a St. Louis suburb flooded so quickly with cops in gas masks and camouflage, driving armored cars and brandishing rifles like an occupying army. It’s our antiterror policies made manifest, our tax dollars at work.

And it’s a path to potential disaster, for cops and citizens alike. The “S” in SWAT was there for a reason: Militarized tactics that are potentially useful in specialized circumstances — like firefights with suicidal terrorist groups — can be counterproductive when employed for crowd-control purposes by rank-and-file cops. (The only recent calm on Ferguson’s streets came after state cops started walking through the crowds in blue uniforms, behaving like police instead of storm troopers.)

To many critics of police militarization, of course, the helmets and heavy weaponry are just symptoms. The disease is the entire range of aggressive police tactics (from no-knock raids to stop-and-frisk), the racial disparities they help perpetuate and our society’s drug laws and extraordinary incarceration rate.

Well before Ferguson, this broad critique — long pressed by a mix of libertarians like Balko and left-wingers — was gaining traction in the political mainstream. This is why sentencing reform has a growing number of Republican champions, and why {Rand Paul’s critique}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> of the Ferguson police was more pointed and sweeping than President Obama’s.

The argument for broad reform is appealing; it might also be overly optimistic. To be clear: I cheered Paul’s comments, I support most of the reforms under consideration, I want lower incarceration rates and fewer people dying when a no-knock raid goes wrong. But there may be trade-offs here: In an era of atomization, distrust and economic stress, our punitive system may be a big part of what’s keeping crime rates as low as they are now, making criminal justice reform more complicated than a simple pro-liberty free lunch.

But the {military hardware issue}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/15/us/surplus-military-equipment-map.html"">, the BearCats and grenade launchers and what we’ve seen unfold in Ferguson — that does seem easy, uncomplicated, clear. Crime rates rise and fall, but crime-fighting is a constant for police; dealing with terrorism and insurrection, however, decidedly is not. Yet for decades we’ve been equipping our cops as though the Symbionese Liberation Army were about to come out of retirement, as if every burst of opportunistic lawlessness could become another Watts, as though the Qaeda sleeper cells we feared after 9/11 were as pervasive in life as they are on “24” or “Homeland.”

And this is where it’s ended: with a bunch of tomfool police playing soldier, tear-gassing protesters, arresting journalists and turning Ferguson into a watchword for policing at its worst.

But my own sense, pre-existing but sharpened by watching the reaction to Ferguson in my Twitter feed, is that a crucial force shaping attitudes in these kind of debates right now isn’t ideology alone − it’s ideology filtered through experience and context and observation, all of which are informed by race and class in the obvious ways, but are heavily, heavily influenced by generational experience as well.

Because in the end, my own answer to a question like “how do you feel about cops?” depends heavily on what I fear the most, what I want or need to be protected from, and how serious the threat of disorder at a given moment seems. If the crime rate is sky-high, and the cops seem handcuffed and/or outnumbered and outgunned, then the answer is more likely to be: I feel like cops deserve more support, more money, and in most cases the benefit of the doubt. But if − as is currently the case − the crime rate has been falling for two decades, and we’ve entered an age defined by security theater, {city-wide lockdowns}<hyperlink=""http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/thoughts-on-the-boston-lockdown/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0""> and cops armed more heavily than National Guardsmen used to be, then my answer is likely to be different, more skeptical, less deferential to the men in blue. (Or, in this case, camouflage.) That isn’t because severe police abuses don’t exist in high-crime eras, or because aggressive policing tactics don’t help contribute to lower crime rates, or because we’ve entered some sort of crime-free utopia today in which every tough-on-crime policy can be safely abandoned. ({We haven’t}<hyperlink=""http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/how-rare-is-crime/"">.) It’s because we have to live by generalizations, at least to some extent, and the generalizations about cops and police tactics implied by the landscape of, say, 1968 or 1977 or 1991 are necessarily different from the generalizations implied by the American landscape of today.

Or to bring it to a sharper point: I live in a city that was partially wrecked by riots forty-five years ago, in an era when similar riots devastated cities around the country. If a replay of that kind of sweeping unrest seemed like a live possibility right now, in my home and other cities like it, I would probably look at the images from Ferguson and feel a little more sympathy for the masked, armored-up, guns-drawn police tactics than I do right now. That’s unfair in certain ways: Unfair to the rioters of the 1960s, given the deep historical injustices and specific tragedies shaping that era’s turmoil; and unfair, perhaps, to the cops in Ferguson, given the challenges of policing a potential riot when you haven’t faced that kind of challenge previously. But again, both life and public policy all depend on such slightly-unfair generalizations; you should be aware that they’re unfair, but you still have to make them in order to think, assess, and judge.

So am I more of a police skeptic, a civil libertarian now on these issues, and is my generation more libertarian, than the conservatives who supported tough-on-crime policies in the age of Nixon and Reagan and Bush I? Well, yes, but not necessarily in a way that necessarily speaks to a fundamental shift in first principles or underlying ideological beliefs. Rather, we’re responding to what we’ve lived through and seen happen, in the same way that an earlier generation did. Or to rewrite {a famous quip}<hyperlink=""http://thinkexist.com/quotation/if-you-re-not-a-liberal-at-twenty-you-have-no/347162.html""> about ideology and experience, if the experience of the ’60s and ’70s didn’t make you a little more pro-law-and-order, you might not have a brain; if the experience of the 2000s and 2010s haven’t made you a little more skeptical of expansive police powers − well, you might not have one either.",63,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt51,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/us/holder-and-obama-differ-in-approach-to-underlying-issues-of-missouri-unrest.html,Holder and Obama Differ in Approach to Underlying Issues of Missouri Unrest,Peter Baker; Matt Apuzzo,08/19/2014,04/14/2016,"WASHINGTON — The two men in open-collar shirts sat facing each other, papers and a BlackBerry strewn on a coffee table, sober looks on both their faces. One leaned forward, gesturing with his left hand, clearly doing the talking. The other sat back in his chair, two fingers pressed to his temple as he listened intently.

When violence erupted last week after a police shooting in Missouri, {President Obama}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per""> and Attorney General {Eric H. Holder Jr.}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/eric_h_holder_jr/index.html?inline=nyt-per""> huddled on Martha’s Vineyard where both were on vacation. But as the most powerful African-Americans in the nation confront its enduring racial divide, they come at it from fundamentally different backgrounds and points of view.

Mr. Holder, 63, is the one leaning forward, both {in the photograph released by the White House}<hyperlink=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/14731169340/""> and on the issues underlying the crisis in Ferguson, Mo. A child of the civil rights era, he grew up shaped by the images of violence in Selma, Ala., and joined sit-ins at Columbia University where protesters renamed an office after Malcolm X. Now in high office, he pushes for policy changes and is to fly on Wednesday to Ferguson to personally promise justice in the case of a black teenager who was fatally shot by a white police officer.

Mr. Obama, 53, is the one seemingly holding back in the White House photograph, contemplative, even brooding, as if seeking to understand how events could get so out of hand. He was too young and removed to experience the turmoil of the 1960s, growing up in a multiracial household in Hawaii and Indonesia. As he now seeks balance in an unbalanced time, he wrestles with the ghosts of history that his landmark election, however heady, failed to exorcise.

The differences between the two men have drawn criticism since the death of Michael Brown on Aug. 9, as some African-Americans praise Mr. Holder for his outspokenness and lament or even denounce Mr. Obama for his caution. Michael Eric Dyson, a prominent author and Georgetown University professor, called the president’s public statement on Monday a “stunning epic failure” that seemed to blame black men rather than armed police.

“This is a community aflame with a passion to know the truth, and Obama is treating it dispassionately and with distance,” he said. “There is no blood flowing through the veins with empathy.”

On the other hand, Mr. Dyson said: “Eric feels it in his gut. It rises to his brain. It’s expressed on his tongue.” Mr. Holder, he added, is “an up and down race man who understands the moral consequences of the law on the lives of black people.”

Such sentiments exasperate the White House, which denies any substantive distance between the two. Aides to Mr. Obama said he has been less visceral in his public remarks than his comments after the Trayvon Martin case because there is still an active investigation.

“People shouldn’t presume because the attorney general might be more outspoken on a subject that he’s not consulting with the president and that the president isn’t completely supportive of the steps he’s taking,” said Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser and close friend to both.

Mr. Obama, then heading to the Senate, and Mr. Holder, a former deputy attorney general, met in late 2004 at a Washington dinner party held by Ann Walker Marchant, a public relations executive and niece of Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the Democratic power broker. “They clicked that night and they have been friends ever since,” Ms. Jarrett said.

After Mr. Obama won the presidency in 2008, he made Mr. Holder attorney general in part because of what Ms. Jarrett called “this shared vision” of overhauling the justice system. They have grown so close that they schedule Martha’s Vineyard vacations to coincide. Even closer are their wives, Michelle Obama and Dr. Sharon Malone.

If Mr. Obama gave the impression of wanting to avoid talking about race early in his presidency, Mr. Holder was more direct, such as when the new attorney general declared the United States a “nation of cowards” for not addressing race.

For Mr. Holder, it was personal. His {future sister-in-law}<hyperlink=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html""> was one of two black students who enrolled in the University of Alabama with the protection of the National Guard, and Mr. Holder {recalled his father telling him how to act}<hyperlink=""http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/what-eric-holders-father-told-him-about-cops/""> if he was wrongly stopped by the police. “I thought of my father’s words years later when, as a college student, I was pulled over twice on the New Jersey Turnpike and my car was searched, even though I was sure I hadn’t been speeding,” he recalled in a speech in April.

“I thought of them again sometime after that,” he added, “when a police officer stopped and questioned me in Washington while I was running to catch a movie, even though I happened to be a federal prosecutor at the time.”

As a young lawyer and prosecutor, Mr. Holder started programs intended to bridge the divide between law enforcement and communities. “We all bring our life experiences to the job we do — and that’s exactly what we want our attorney general to do,” said Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court, a former colleague. “He does care, and it just shows the character of the man himself.”

But his time at the Justice Department has been marked by tension with the White House, where aides thought he was politically maladroit.

Frustrated at times during the first term, Mr. Holder has been empowered in the second to take on more longstanding issues of disparity involving sentencing, racial profiling and voting rights.

And throughout, he has focused on cracking down on police departments that violate civil rights, opening 20 such investigations, more than twice as many in the previous five years. He and aides have discussed opening a similar, broader civil rights investigation into Ferguson’s practices, according to officials.

With his last election behind him, Mr. Obama seems more willing to talk about race. He created an initiative called {My Brother’s Keeper}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/education/obamas-my-brothers-keeper-education-program-expands.html""> this year to focus on black and Latino boys. In a meeting of the program this summer, he related his own experiences and told young black men not to fall into stereotypes.

“The notion that there’s an authentic way of being black — that has to go,” he said. “Because there are a whole bunch of different ways for African-American men to be authentic.” In some ways, it seemed he was pushing back against expectations of how he, as the first African-American president, should prove his own authenticity.

Mr. Holder has been tracking {the events in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/12/us/13police-shooting-of-black-teenager-michael-brown.html""> since he read the first reports a few hours after Mr. Brown’s shooting. He dashed off an email to aides asking to be briefed by morning and eventually grew angry that, over his objection, the local authorities released surveillance video showing an apparent robbery by Mr. Brown.

Tension peaked Saturday when the F.B.I. was to canvass the neighborhood for witnesses with the local police and Mr. Holder concluded federal investigators would get more cooperation if they were seen as independent. So the F.B.I. did its own survey.

Mr. Holder has repeatedly weighed in on the conduct of the police in Ferguson. But his brother is a retired police lieutenant, and when Mr. Holder read a draft news release, he told aides to change language that he thought was too critical of police.

“He is a friend of law enforcement,” said Reid H. Weingarten, a lawyer and friend noting that Mr. Holder does not see that in conflict with supporting civil rights. “It’s a complicated issue. Both of these things can coexist.”

Mr. Holder considered traveling to Ferguson as early as last Thursday but waited to see if the state authorities could settle down the streets.

After returning from Martha’s Vineyard, he went to the White House on Monday and told Mr. Obama that he planned to go.

Mr. Obama, however, will not, at least not for now. “Some folks want President Obama to be all things to all people — an activist, a marcher, a poet and a race theorist — when his primary job is to govern,” said Joshua DuBois, a former adviser to Mr. Obama. “In Ferguson, he’s governing.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

LOUIS — An emotionally disturbed 23-year-old black man was shot and killed by St. Louis police officers on Tuesday afternoon, the authorities said, threatening to further inflame a community still reeling after another shooting by an officer in a suburb less than two weeks ago.

The St. Louis police said officers received a call at about 12:20 p.m. regarding a disturbance at the Six Stars Market in northwest St. Louis.

Sam Dotson, the chief of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, said two officers encountered a man behaving “erratically” and brandishing a knife when they arrived. The officers repeatedly warned, “Stop, drop the knife,” but he refused, Chief Dotson said. The man approached the officers, knife raised, and was shot and killed after he came within three or four feet, the chief said.

The shooting at the market came 10 days after an officer shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old African-American, Michael Brown, in the nearby St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. That shooting has triggered protests, looting and general unrest that has put the area on edge.

In a sign of how tense the situation remains, Chief Dotson made a point of going out into a crowd at the scene of Tuesday’s shooting to tell them what the police understood had occurred.

“I think it’s important that people understand what happened,” he said. He said that several witnesses confirmed the account of the officers, including a local alderman. “I want this message to be out as truthfully and quickly as possible,” he said.

Not all of them were willing to listen.

“Even if this is a legitimate shooting, they are going to capitalize on this and try to use it for their martial law agenda,” said Christopher Hobbs, 21, who joined dozens of other residents who quickly came to the scene to see what happened.

Witnesses seemed to confirm the account of the police.

Robert Buchanan, who works at Betterway Auto Repair and Sales, across the street from the shooting, said that the man who had been shot was clearly disturbed.

“The suspect was inside the store and was arguing with them,” he said, referring to the Six Stars Market. “He was cussing them out. And he came out the store. And he was still arguing.”

The police arrived quickly, Mr. Buchanan said, and the man confronted them. “He was hollering, ‘Shoot me! Shoot me!’ ” he said. “I did not know what he had in his hand.”

Then, Mr. Buchanan said, he heard four shots. “I turned around and saw him laying on the ground,” he said.

The police left the scene by mid-afternoon, but a few dozen demonstrators remained in front of the store.

But, perhaps in a sign of preparation, officers were seen on a side street a few blocks away.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Shear; Matt Apuzzo,08/17/2014,04/14/2016,"EDGARTOWN, Mass. — Senior White House aides have made repeated, urgent phone calls to Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri, to state police officials and to civil rights leaders in recent days as {President Obama}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per"">’s administration becomes more deeply involved in trying to maintain peace in Ferguson and to ensure an independent investigation of the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager by a white police officer.

White House officials also said Attorney General {Eric H. Holder Jr.}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/eric_h_holder_jr/index.html?inline=nyt-per"">, who is the administration’s most outspoken voice on racial issues, had been in frequent touch with the governor and State Highway Patrol in Missouri as angry protests continued to simmer there. Mr. Holder is scheduled to provide a formal briefing to the president in Washington on Monday, officials said. Both men were returning Sunday from Martha’s Vineyard, where they had been vacationing for the past week.

Mr. Holder announced Sunday that a federal medical examiner would conduct an independent autopsy of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old who was shot Aug. 9 in Ferguson by Officer Darren Wilson. Officials said the decision was the result of “extraordinary circumstances” in the case, and was part of a civil rights investigation the {F.B.I.}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_bureau_of_investigation/index.html?inline=nyt-org""> is conducting.

The order for an additional autopsy may also help the Obama administration to reassure Mr. Brown’s family and others who are suspicious of the state’s investigation and are eager for an independent inquiry, something that Mr. Holder promised the family personally.

Brian Fallon, a Justice Department spokesman, said the department would also consider the results of the first, state-conducted autopsy. There was no indication that federal investigators saw any problems with the local examination. The family has also had a private autopsy conducted.

After spending two days in Washington, Mr. Obama is scheduled to return to Martha’s Vineyard on Tuesday night to finish his two-week vacation.

Although the president continued to relax on the island, playing golf or going to the beach and taking leisurely dinners with friends since arriving Aug. 9, White House officials said Sunday that the situation in Ferguson had dominated his working time over the past several days. Mr. Obama received briefings several times a day, including at least once each day by Mr. Holder. Valerie Jarrett, who heads the White House office of outreach, has also talked daily with Mr. Nixon, his staff, local elected officials and leaders from national civil rights organizations.

“Any time you have a situation like this that spirals quickly to a boiling point and where people are looting and getting hurt, it’s a concern for the president,” Ms. Jarrett said in an interview from Martha’s Vineyard, where she was also vacationing.

Officials said Mr. Nixon, a Democrat, had not asked for federal troops to help keep the peace in Ferguson. But 40 additional agents from the F.B.I. arrived in Missouri on Saturday to assist with the federal investigation, Mr. Nixon said Sunday.

Officials with the F.B.I. and the Justice Department have said investigators interviewed several witnesses to the shooting and were canvassing the area for others.

“That’s the kind of independent, external, national review and investigation of this that I think will assist everyone in making sure we get to justice,” Mr. Nixon said Sunday on the CNN program “State of the Union.”

The tensions in Ferguson are shaping up as a signature moment for Mr. Holder, who has made civil rights issues a cornerstone of his tenure and who has indicated he will most likely leave office by the end of the year. The attorney general has fought against policies such as racial profiling and mandatory minimum sentences, which he believes discriminate against minorities and undermine their confidence in the criminal justice system. The Ferguson protests have touched on both themes.

White House officials said the shooting of Mr. Brown and the reaction among African-Americans in Ferguson were also another instance in which the president’s policy response is motivated in part by a deep, personal connection to the issues of race and justice.

Mr. Obama has in the past spoken in emotional terms about racial issues, including the shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed young black man in Florida, and the acquittal of the man who shot him, George Zimmerman. The president’s aides said the situation in Ferguson had affected him in similar ways.

“He wants to make sure that he’s doing everything in his power to ensure a thorough investigation,” Ms. Jarrett said. “He wants to make sure that there’s continuing exploration of ways that they are keeping the violence down, reducing it down to zero.”

White House officials said Mr. Obama had not lost confidence in Mr. Nixon or State Highway Patrol officers in Missouri; one official described them as “acting in good faith” to help resolve the situation. But the official stressed that the White House did not necessarily believe the same of the local police in Ferguson.

Behind the scenes, administration officials have sought to minimize the potential for angry reaction on the streets of the city.

The Justice Department asked the Ferguson police not to release surveillance footage of a convenience store robbery in which, police said, Mr. Brown was a suspect, because of concerns that “it would roil the community further,” a federal law enforcement official said on Saturday.

The Ferguson Police Department released the video on Friday, and the official said it “occurred over the objection of federal authorities.” Federal investigators had a copy of the video as well, the official said, “and there were never any plans by the federal investigators to release that copy.”

Mr. Nixon said Sunday that state officials had not known that the Ferguson Police Department intended to release the video. “We were unaware they were going to release it, and we certainly were not happy with that being released, especially in the way that it was,” Mr. Nixon said on ABC’s “This Week.”

Federal law enforcement authorities in Washington, however, said Sunday that the Justice Department had discussed its concerns over the release of the video in advance with members of the governor’s staff.

Mr. Nixon said on Sunday that he believed that the decision by the local police had contributed to the renewed tensions in Ferguson on Saturday night, which took the form of some clashes and a shooting by an unknown assailant. Seven people were arrested.

“I think it had an incendiary effect,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “I mean, when you release pictures and you clearly are attempting to besmirch a victim of a shooting, shot down, a young man in his own street, and at the same you’re releasing information to try to tarnish him, then properly there was a lot of folks that were concerned about that.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

Peters,08/14/2014,04/14/2016,"WASHINGTON — When the police bring the hammer down, whether on Occupy Wall Street in Manhattan’s Zuccotti Park in 2011 or outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, the response from conservatives tend to be fairly consistent: The protesters got what they had coming.

But demonstrations this week over the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., and the overwhelming law enforcement response that followed have stirred more complicated reactions, with many on the right torn between an impulse to see order restored and concern about whether the crackdown is a symptom of a state run amok.

With broadcasts from Ferguson showing the streets engulfed in smoke as officers looked on wearing military fatigues and carrying high-powered rifles, some prominent conservative commentators and leading Republican politicians began questioning whether the police had gone too far.

These reactions point to a larger debate inside the conservative movement today as Republicans struggle with how enthusiastically to embrace an ascendant strain of libertarianism within their ranks. Senator {Rand Paul}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/rand_paul/index.html?inline=nyt-per""> of Kentucky, a likely candidate for president in 2016, starkly laid out one side of the argument in an {op-ed published on Time.com}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> on Thursday.

“There should be a difference between a police response and a military response,” he wrote. “The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.”

Other conservatives have focused on instances in which chaos has broken out in the streets. Images and {headlines on The Drudge Report}<hyperlink=""http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/08/14/raw-video-new-black-panther-party-protesters-take-over-ferguson-police-chiefs-news-conference/""> and {Breitbart.com}<hyperlink=""http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2014/08/11/Riots-in-Missouri""> have singled out acts of violence among demonstrators and shown looters breaking store windows.

In one segment broadcast on Fox News on Thursday, a reporter walked down the street with demonstrators who he said were members of the New Black Panther Party, a radical group.

Since {Richard M. Nixon made cracking down on crime}<hyperlink=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Te_a2RxqXIo&autoplay=1""> a central issue of his 1968 presidential campaign, Republicans have held themselves up as the alternative to a Democratic Party they have derided as soft on issues of law and order. But an appetite for changes in the criminal justice system has been building among Republicans, many of whom believe the tough-justice approach has run its course.

Mr. Paul, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin are among those who say that the federal and state governments need to rethink the way convicts are sentenced and imprisoned, arguing that the current system is inhumane and too costly.

Mr. Paul’s remarks on Thursday were similar to those of other leading conservatives who have weighed in on the events in Ferguson.

“Reporters should never be detained — a free press is too important — simply for doing their jobs,” {Senator Ted Cruz}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/SenatorTedCruz/posts/593610474084590"">, Republican of Texas, wrote on his Facebook page on Thursday, reacting to news that journalists from The Washington Post and The Huffington Post had been held by the police. “Civil liberties must be protected, but violence is not the answer.”

Erick Erickson, a conservative writer, took to Twitter to question why the police needed to display so much firepower. “It is pretty damn insane that people who spend all day writing speeding tickets,” {he wrote}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/EWErickson/status/499910818436501505"">, “hop in tanks with AR-15s at night.”

Many conservatives were unsettled by the militaristic response from law enforcement officials in Ferguson — a show of force that they said dangerously resembled the actions a police state would take.

Mr. Paul, quoting from research by the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute and the conservative Heritage Foundation, noted the trend of police departments’ buying military-style vehicles and weapons, condemning “the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve.”

“When you couple this militarization of law enforcement,” he added, “with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury — national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, preconviction forfeiture — we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.”

But that attitude was not universally shared. In much of the conservative news media, the protesters in Ferguson are being portrayed as {“outside agitators,”}<hyperlink=""http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/hannity/transcript/2014/08/14/ferguson-police-chief-reacts-shooting-unarmed-teen-missouri""> in the words of Sean Hannity, the Fox News host.

Mr. Erickson said, “The natural reaction of conservatives, I think, has always been in defense of law and order.”

But lately, he added, there has been an awakening among many on the right. Many see an increasingly disproportionate response to crime as a sign of a larger problem that should rattle the consciences of conservatives who are wary of centralized authority, he said.

“As more and more people become aware of how overcriminalized the law and regulatory system of the United States is, they become aware of just how easily it is for them to be carted off to jail for innocuous behavior,” Mr. Erickson said. “That necessarily increases distrust of the system over all.”

Another question raised by the unrest in Ferguson — one that poses far more discomfort for Republicans — is how race plays into unequal treatment under the justice system.

On this delicate issue, Mr. Paul went a step further than many other conservatives this week. With a system so broken, he wrote, it is no wonder black people in Ferguson feel singled out.

He added a personal aside. “If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off,” Mr. Paul wrote. “But I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.”

Protesters were told that they could walk up and down the sidewalk but would not be allowed to stand or gather.

Shortly before 10 a.m., about a dozen county and state law enforcement officers approached a small group, including the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, that had gathered at the QuikTrip convenience store in Ferguson. The police told them they were not allowed to congregate.

“We’re not doing any more static protesting,” one state trooper said.

“Here’s the biggest reason we’re asking people to move,” another trooper said. “So we can take care of it before it gets to that stage,” he added, referring to the violence of previous nights.

The move was met with angry shouts from members of the group, who remained in place while milling around.

Mr. Jackson pointed out that all the police officers sent to speak with the demonstrators were white. “In its most generous way, it’s alienation,” he said. “That will just compound the problem.”

Captain Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol provided the following details of violence on Sunday night in Ferguson, Mo., leading up to the governor’s call early Monday to deploy the National Guard and institute a curfew there. The curfew was scheduled to take effect at midnight Sunday.

8:25 p.m. — “The situation first started to deteriorate with a shooting of a civilian on West Florissant and Ferguson avenues at approximately 8:25 p.m. We quickly responded with additional officers to reach the victim and got them to a safe position. That was followed by shots being fired on officers, a number of Molotov cocktails being hurled and then the looting or vandalism of businesses that included the Domino’s Pizza, O’Reilly’s Auto Parts, and Family Dollar store and a self-storage business. All were on West Florissant.” 8:26 p.m. “Shots were fired to the north on Canfield.”

8:27 p.m. “There was a report of a subject down.”

8:28 p.m. “There was a report of eight people with guns.”

8:56 p.m. “Hundreds of protesters marched toward the Northland Shopping Center, where we stand at this moment, the site of this command post. As a crowd approached the shopping center, multiple Molotov cocktails were thrown at police. At that time, police deployed tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and stop the violent action. At that time, we called in additional support from area police agencies.”

9:15 p.m. “There was a call for a large crowd gathering at the McDonald’s on West Florissant.”

9:20 p.m. “It was reported that McDonald’s was being overrun, and employees had locked themselves in a storage room. There were multiple additional reports of Molotov cocktails being thrown. Police were shot at. Makeshift barricades were set up to block police. Bottles and rockets were thrown at police. Based on these conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response.”

1:41 a.m. Email arrives announcing the governor’s deployment of the National Guard

Gov. Jay Nixon {announced}<hyperlink=""https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/following-coordinated-attacks-civilians-and-law-enforcement-governor-nixon-signs""> early Monday that he would deploy the Missouri National Guard to Ferguson to quell chaotic unrest that has paralyzed the city since an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. The governor said in a statement that he chose to activate the National Guard because of “deliberate, coordinated and intensifying violent acts.”

“Tonight, a day of hope, prayers, and peaceful protests was marred by the violent criminal acts of an organized and growing number of individuals, many from outside the community and state, whose actions are putting the residents and businesses of Ferguson at risk. I join the people of Ferguson, and all Missourians, in strongly condemning this criminal activity that included firing upon law enforcement officers, shooting a civilian, throwing Molotov cocktails, looting, and a coordinated attempt to block roads and overrun the Unified Command Center. These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory, and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served, and to feel safe in their own homes. Given these deliberate, coordinated and intensifying violent attacks on lives and property in Ferguson, I am directing the highly capable men and women of the Missouri National Guard to assist Colonel Ron Replogle and the Unified Command in restoring peace and order to this community.”

Young black men, of course, are educated on this reality quite early on: for Millenials, education comes after the murder of Trayvon Martin, and now Michael Brown.

Given their inability to perform basic police functions — like not killing unarmed citizens in broad daylight, or being publicly accountable when they do — it would seem that the Ferguson police department should not be allowed anywhere remotely near machine guns, grenade launchers or mine resistant armored tanks.

In 1820, the Missouri Compromise banned slavery in the American Midwest, with the exception of Missouri, which was allowed to legalize a federally sanctioned slave economy. This compromise was soon overturned, and slavery spread throughout the Midwest.

I propose a New Missouri Compromise: let local police departments across the country keep their rocket launchers and armored tanks in case of terrorist attacks; however, such weapons could only be used at the discretion and direct order of the federal government. In the meantime, the federal government should buy a dozen or so less armored tanks for domestic use and instead invest in police trainings and dashboard cameras for police cars, so that video footage will help us pinpoint specific opportunities to assist officers in not killing so many unarmed American citizens.

I don’t begrudge the cops their tear gas and rubber bullets. Nonlethal force is better than guns. In fact, I wish that the Ferguson police officer who killed Michael Brown had used a stun gun, rather than a deadly one. Then there would have been one less unarmed African-American killed by the police.

It’s a myth that the police sometimes shoot just to disable someone, but not with the intent to kill. Under the law, whenever a cop uses his gun, he means for you to die. Nonlethal weapons, on the other hand, can be used to control and contain. And when a crowd is actually unruly and inciting violence, control and containment is a good thing.

To help resolve the excessive force problem, Ferguson, Mo., should hire officers who look like the people they patrol.

The problem is that the police often have a low threshold for when they need to put their jackboots on. Sometimes it’s triggered by “contempt of cop,” a crime not in any state or federal statutes, but part of the law of the streets.

So it turns out that the police in the United States are excessively armed: They have too much testosterone. They do not like to be questioned, criticized or challenged. They definitely do not like to be filmed. And when it’s black people who are doing any of those constitutionally protected activities, forget about it. The police will show those folks who the real boss is.

The police in Ferguson also wield their whiteness like a weapon. Just {three out of 53 cops are black}<hyperlink=""http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2014/08/13/ferguson-mayor-the-african-american-community-has-something-against-law-enforcement-in-many-ways/"">, even though the town is almost {70 percent}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US""> black. When the demographics between citizens and law enforcement officers are that out of whack, both sides adopt a siege mentality. It’s more like war than “serve and protect.” That’s not just bad news for race relations; it’s a troubling sign for democracy.

As the summer of 2014 starts to resemble the long hot summers of the 1960s, it’s obvious that these are long-term problems with no quick fixes. But it’s a no-brainer that Ferguson needs more cops who look like the people they patrol.

We also found — perhaps not surprisingly, given the appalling way in which the war on drugs has targeted communities of color — that people of color were more likely than whites to be impacted by paramilitary raids.

Readers shared experiences, fears and anguish, and also voiced skepticism about police responsibility for community distrust, which sparked thoughtful debate.

She said she ultimately resigned herself to teaching them submission.

“At first, I instructed them not to consent to being searched, but soon learned that their resistance brought the handcuffs out, and then the ride in the back of the cruiser to the police station where the search would occur anyway,” she wrote. “We had to teach our sons to be polite, passive, compliant in the face of injustice.”

Ms. Diciple said she felt, since the Brown killing, that her family had dodged a bullet themselves. “Our hearts grieve to realize that our children faced the same risk, many times, that Michael Brown faced on that fateful day,” she said. “His fate could so easily have been our own child’s.”

Other Times readers said they encountered discrimination just walking side-by-side with friends, some of whom accepted the unwarranted stops.

“My exposure to racial discrimination … came when I walked on the street with my roommates and was stopped by police who were ‘just checking,’”{Ken H. writes from Athens, Ala}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/opinion/charles-blow-michael-brown-and-black-men.html#permid=12554408"">. “It came when store clerks followed us from aisle to aisle pretending to dust shelves and rearrange merchandise. Most sadly, it came because neither of my roommates recognized that the police and the guards and the clerks were doing anything out of the ordinary.”

When he protested, the white cop stated, ‘This is for Obama,” she wrote. “Now this was one dumb cop, but chilling nonetheless.”

Along with these stories, a theme developed among readers skeptical about police discrimination and violence against black men, and about the stark statistics Blow cited.

“Are black communities doing all they can do to help bring these terrible killings under control? That is not an unfair question,” {Steve C. of Bowie, Md., wrote}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/opinion/charles-blow-michael-brown-and-black-men.html#permid=12555033"">.

“I’ve been raised with a level of cynicism that pushes me to tune out and accept things as ‘the way of the world,’ he wrote. “But the response to the shooting looks like rank oppression to me, and that’s a big explanation for why this story blew up and will continue to blow up.”

Others pointed to institutional factors.

“To all of you who make the ‘breakdown of the African-American family’ argument:How about we STOP incarcerating so many young black men in our failed, racist war on drugs?”{Ross wrote from Chicago}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/opinion/charles-blow-michael-brown-and-black-men.html#permid=12555250:12556733"">. “Do you think there might be more black fathers at home if there were fewer black men in jail?”

A law enforcement officer in New York said he has lived both sides, and called for accountability from police, and from the community.

“As a black man who grew up in the inner-city, who carries a badge and gun and has been drawn down on by NYPD on two occasions, I feel for [Michael Brown’s] mother,”{Aruba G of New York}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/opinion/charles-blow-michael-brown-and-black-men.html#permid=12557699""> wrote. “The anger felt by the black community is justified,” although, he continued: “Yes, the police are killing us, but we are killing us at an astronomically disproportionate rate.”

Here’s what you need to know for Friday:

• Ferguson, Mo., names police officer.

Darren Wilson, {a six-year police veteran}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/us/darren-wilson-identified-as-officer-in-fatal-shooting-in-ferguson-missouri.html""> with no history of disciplinary actions, was identified this morning as the officer involved in the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager.

The police said he had been alerted to a robbery at a convenience store shortly before the encounter with the teenager.

The announcement was made after a night of calm in Ferguson, which was under the supervision of the state highway patrol rather than the local police force.

• Iraq’s leader will step down.

The prime minister’s decision {could lead}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/world/middleeast/iraq-prime-minister-.html""> to the first peaceful transition of power in Iraq’s modern history, and more military support from the U.S.

The incoming leader’s main priority will be to bring together the majority Shiites and the minority Sunnis and Kurds in a new unity government.

• A river of protesters.

Two separate convoys of Pakistanis, one led by an opposition politician and the other led by an antigovernment cleric, {are streaming down}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/world/asia/imran-khan-leads-pakistan-protest-march.html""> a highway to the nation’s capital today.

The crowd of thousands will hold a sit-in, on the streets, and demand the prime minister’s resignation and new elections.

• Parked at Ukraine’s border.

About 200 trucks from Russia, said to carry humanitarian aid for rebel-held cities in eastern Ukraine, {are being inspected}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/15/world/europe/ap-eu-ukraine.html""> by border guards.

There are concerns about a dozen Russian armored personnel carriers that {appear to be headed}<hyperlink=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28798246""> toward the convoy today.

• Election in paradise.

About 7,000 Democrats in a district nestled among lava-formed cliffs in Hawaii {will decide a bitter Senate primary race}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/us/rare-spotlight-on-rural-hawaii-after-storm-leaves-election-cliffhanger.html""> today.

The incumbent leads by only 1,635 votes after the vote last Saturday, when Tropical Storm Iselle shut down polling stations.

• Fighting back.

The Department of Education is holding a bullying prevention conference in Washington today, attended by experts, educators and students. There is {a live webcast}<hyperlink=""http://www.wciconferences.com/BullyingSummit-VirtualMeeting/index.html""> from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks moved lower after early gains. European indexes were mixed following a strong advance, and Asian shares closed ahead.

• Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, said today that it discovered {suspicious accounting}<hyperlink=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/alibaba-discovers-suspicious-accounting-at-film-unit/""> at a Hong Kong film company it purchased two months ago for about $800 million.

• Berkshire Hathaway’s stock surpassed {$200,000 a share}<hyperlink=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveschaefer/2014/08/14/berkshire-shares-top-200000-buffett-worth-nearly-66b/""> Thursday, making Warren Buffett’s fortune worth $65.9 billion.

NOTEWORTHY

• Out in the open.

Marijuana has been legalized in Washington State, and the first stores selling cannabis have opened.

But {Hempfest}<hyperlink=""http://www.hempfest.org/""> goes on. The marijuana advocacy event begins today in Seattle, which has hosted the gathering every year since 1991.

• Packed with action, and stars.

“The Expendables 3,” opening today, is crammed with a cast that only begins with Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Wesley Snipes and Antonio Banderas.

“It’s all a bit like a classic rock tribute concert, or playing with all your action figures at once,” {writes our critic Nicolas Rapold}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/movies/the-expendables-3-featuring-stallone-gibson-and-more.html"">.

• A disappointing dystopia.

“In the end, it taketh — your time, patience and faith in newly imagined dystopias — more than it giveth.”

That’s {the tepid reaction of our critic}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/movies/the-giver-adapts-lois-lowrys-novel.html""> Manohla Dargis on “The Giver,” a film based on the Lois Lowry novel, which opens in theaters today.

• Broadway’s farewell.

Tonight, New York’s main theaters dim their lights for a minute in honor of Lauren Bacall, who died on Tuesday.

They did the same on Wednesday for Robin Williams.

• Two atomic bombs later.

On this day in 1945, Emperor Hirohito surrendered, ending the Asian front of World War II a week after the U.S. dropped Fat Man and Little Boy on the Japanese cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

(In an earlier version, we misnamed the bombs as Little Man and Fat Boy.)

• Still following the yellow brick road.

Today is the 75th anniversary of the Hollywood premiere of “{The Wizard of Oz.}<hyperlink=""http://nyti.ms/1kDVSTP"">” It was one of the first films shot in Technicolor but it wasn’t an immediate blockbuster.

Yet it went on to win three Academy Awards, and Judy Garland’s rendition of “Over the Rainbow” tops the American Film Institute’s {list of the greatest movie songs}<hyperlink=""http://www.afi.com/100years/songs.aspx"">.

BACK STORY

Thousands of students across the country are already heading back to school — on Monday.

Returning to classrooms before September, once unthinkable, is now the norm, according to the research firm Market Data Retrieval.

More than 70 percent of school districts begin their K-12 year in August or earlier.

In rural areas long ago, the school year had breaks in spring and fall for planting and harvesting.

But in the mid-1800s, urbanization and a more mobile work force led reformers to {synchronize}<hyperlink=""http://stateimpact.npr.org/ohio/2011/08/10/six-reasons-students-get-summer-off-and-the-agrarian-calendar-isnt-one-of-them/""> rural and urban schedules, and summers became the break.

Now, standardized testing influences the calendar. Starting classes in August {gives teachers more time}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/06/education/06calendar.html""> to prepare students for exams before the holiday break in December.

The ever-earlier end to summer has spurred protests, with some states passing laws restricting how early schools can open. Virginia, for one, {does not allow}<hyperlink=""http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/article_f071b90a-7a5c-11e3-8030-0019bb30f31a.html""> most districts to begin classes before Labor Day.

Given how things went over the weekend in Ferguson, Missouri, with {last night’s chaos}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSum&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news""> and this morning’s news that the state is sending in the state’s national guard, it’s worth engaging with a contrary view, so here is {the HotAir blogger Jazz Shaw’s case}<hyperlink=""http://hotair.com/archives/2014/08/16/the-militarization-of-police-was-not-only-inevitable-but-necessary/""> that police militarization in some form is both inevitable and necessary:

While I both understand and sympathize with the reminiscing for the good old days, the times have changed. The era of the lovable flatfoot, twirling his baton and wagging a finger at the precocious kid about to steal some penny candy has passed us by. Have we collectively forgotten the riots that took place following the Rodney King verdict? How about the now infamous North Hollywood shootout? And for our friends on the Left, what about the next time somebody goes into an elementary school armed with a Bushmaster and a couple of 9mm Glocks? You don’t want us arming the teachers or having local residents open carrying to keep the school grounds safe. “Leave it to the cops,” you say. But should the cops be going into a situation like that with nothing more than a layer of cotton uniform and a revolver to protect themselves and take down the bad guys? Or should they have to wait until a SWAT unit from an “appropriately large city” shows up, with the shooter mowing down third graders in the meantime?

While the shooting of Michael Brown may provide a teachable moment in terms of police interactions with the community, the nearly immediate mayhem which followed should also serve as a timely reminder. The old assumptions of law enforcement and their unwritten compact with the citizenry relied on a society where the police – and the laws – were respected, and criminals were a minority who would be rejected by the rank and file residents. But when the majority of an entire community decides to break that compact, the formula changes. They realize that they outnumber – and frequently outgun – the cops. A slumbering, snarling beast is awakened and in short order the police can find themselves on the run. This is not a formula for freedom of speech… it’s the path to mayhem and the breakdown of civil society. Before you’re too quick to demand the “demilitarization” of the police, you might want to remember who it is that stands between the neighborhood you have now and South Central L.A circa 1992. And Ferguson has shown us that you don’t need a huge metropolitan area for it to happen.

I haven’t forgotten either the King riots or the North Hollywood shootout, but note that both of those events 1) took place more fifteen years ago and 2) took place in one of America’s largest cities, where having a militarized unit or units within the regular P.D. seems like a perfectly reasonable use of public dollars. Nobody outside the fringes of this debate is arguing that Los Angeles (or Boston, to pick a more relevant recent example) shouldn’t have a SWAT team, or that the N.Y.P.D. doesn’t need to be uniquely prepared for riots, terrorism, and mayhem of all sorts. The question is whether tactics and equipment that are appropriate for large cities and specialized circumstances should be made available (often without accompanying training) to rank-and-file police across the country, whether militarized tactics should be integrated into suburban/small-urban/rural policing (where they are used proactively {far more often}<hyperlink=""http://cjmasters.eku.edu/sites/cjmasters.eku.edu/files/21stmilitarization.pdf""> than reactively), and whether militarization should swiftly follow local unrest, in the way that local and county cops deployed armored vehicles and riot gear and tear gas in Ferguson last week. And on these questions I don’t think the “times have changed” argument necessarily convinces.

First, to take up Shaw’s specific examples of school shootings and spree killings, the evidence that such sprees are sharply increasing is {shaky and debatable}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/17/graph-of-the-day-perhaps-mass-shootings-arent-becoming-more-common/"">, and the evidence that a more militarized police is necessarily crucial to stopping such killers seems thin as well. In Sandy Hook, for instance, the killer committed suicide about ninety seconds after the cops arrived; in Aurora, the killer surrendered to police; at Virginia Tech, the killer shot himself rather than engage with police. (At Columbine, things were more complicated: there were cops surrounding the school who didn’t fully engage until the SWAT teams arrived, which could be a case that the average cop should be trained more like a SWAT member … except that then the SWAT teams moved extremely slowly through the school as well, because even heavily armed and armored cops can be −understandably − loath to rush in without knowing how many active shooters they’re facing.) From the D.C. sniper (picked up at a rest stop) to the Isla Vista killer (dead by suicide after a car chase), there just aren’t that many recent cases where a spree killer has gone down, Symbionese Liberation Army-style, after a long siege or in a hail of bullets that only a militarized police unit could deliver, or where specialized equipment has made all the difference to the cops. It’s much more common for such killers to either take their own lives or surrender, and when they’ve been stopped by {return fire from cops,}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/07/us/california-college-gunman/index.html?hpt=hp_t2""> it’s usually been {regular police units}<hyperlink=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lake_massacre""> rather than SWAT teams that have done the necessary work. None of this means, again, that SWAT teams shouldn’t exist; it should just cast doubt on the idea that every police department needs SWAT equipment and lots of it, and that arming them accordingly will make all the difference when a psychopath comes calling.

Then step back a bit from those specific cases, and look at the overall trends. The violent crime rate is the lowest it’s been in a generation. The terrorist threat, while real, is not producing local bombings or plots or sieges at anywhere the rate that seemed likely after 9/11, or that the country experienced in the chaos of the early 1970s. Policing is a dangerous profession, but in terms of law enforcement fatalities {it’s less dangerous now}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/chuckdevore/status/501096840184741888/photo/1""> than at any point since the 1870s; meanwhile, the number of civilians killed by cops (at least in cases ruled “justifiable homicide”) has been {inching upward}<hyperlink=""http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/P1-BN660A_TWOLI_G_20131022184204.jpg"">. If you’re looking for a heuristic through which to assess current policing strategy, the “old days” of, say, thirty-five years ago look more dangerous than today; the risks to police right now look more modest than in the past; and the case for scrutinizing law enforcement rather than always giving the cops the benefit of the doubt is therefore {at least somewhat stronger}<hyperlink=""http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/trusting-the-police/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body""> than it would have been during the post-1960s crime wave.

Now as I argued in my column, some of these numbers can be interpreted in different ways; it may be that some aggressive police tactics (like some elements of our much-critiqued incarceration policies) have played a substantial role in crime’s post-1990 decline, and that the rollback of some current, controversial policies might be more dangerous than some libertarians and liberals would like to think. (There’s obviously a much longer post or piece to be written on this topic.) But the controversial police tactics that have the most plausible claim to a role in crime reduction are not really militarized tactics: They’re aggressive street-level activities − broken-windows policing, “stop and frisk” − that aren’t generally carried out, and don’t need to be carried out, by police dressed like they’re ready to re-invade Iraq. And while the spread of kevlar has undoubtedly made police officers safer, I am very doubtful that there’s evidence that armored vehicles and camouflage and grenade launchers have done the same, or that the spread of military-grade material can claim any major causal role in crime’s overall decline.

Then to Shaw’s final point … yes, there are moments when the breakdown of civic order has reached a point that you do need a military-style intervention. But the question raised by the trajectory of events in Ferguson is whether the use of military tactics by ordinary cops early in a protest-driven crisis is the best way to forestall such a breakdown, or whether it actually makes that point of breakdown more likely to arrive. Had “the majority of an entire community” in Ferguson actually decided to break the social compact when the armored vehicles starting rolling in, the guns and sniper rifles started getting pointed at protestors, and the tear gas started billowing? Most of us are analyzing this from a thousand miles away, yes, but it seems more like the majority of the community wanted (and still want) to protest peacefully, a minority of troublemakers wanted to riot and loot, and that the cops’ attempt to prevent rioting and looting with a militarized presence ended up treating too many of the protestors like rioters, which escalated tensions and gave the troublemakers exactly the narrative they wanted (in addition to attracting more troublemakers still).

Now that doesn’t mean that there was a brilliant strategy that would have forestalled violence entirely: The reality is that sometimes you’re going to end up with riots no matter what tack you take. But given that we’ve ended up with a national guard intervention anyway, I don’t really see how the weekend’s events in Ferguson are supposed to vindicate the choices made last week, or the equipping that enabled them. If we lived in a world where the cops in the Saint Louis suburbs couldn’t {dress or arm themselves like soldiers}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/6003377/ferguson-military-gear"">, maybe violence would have rippled more quickly and the national guard would have been called in sooner … but given the state of police-community relations in the Ferguson area as of now, maybe that would have been a good thing.

Of course there’s no way to know for sure. But I feel reasonably comfortable, given overall trends in American society, with cops who dress like cops doing their best and then giving way to national guardsmen under extraordinary circumstances … and as an advertisement for the alternative, intermediate, ambiguous, police-as-soldiers stage in crisis management, I don’t think Ferguson looks particularly good.",43,NA,NA,NA

On Friday, just days after the {death of Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html""> and the subsequent civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., J. Cole’s somber protest song {“Be Free”}<hyperlink=""https://soundcloud.com/dreamvillerecords/j-cole-be-free/s-3J4jW""> spread around the world in a matter of hours, fueled by social media and the hip-hop world’s intense online discourse about Mr. Brown, an 18-year-old who was fatally shot by a police officer last Saturday.

Mr. Cole, a 29-year-old rapper from North Carolina, posted the song early Friday to the online audio platform SoundCloud, which lets users upload tracks and easily share them through social media. By late afternoon it had been listened to more than 250,000 times and, with feelings still raw over the situation in Ferguson, it began to quickly ricochet around the Internet.

“All we want to do is take the chains off,” Mr. Cole sings in the track, his voice breaking over mournful keyboards. “All we want to do is be free.”

J. Cole’s “Be Free” was released, publicized and commented on with remarkable speed; according to Billboard, it had become the most talked-about track on Twitter by 10 a.m. Friday, a little more than six hours after it was released. Ann Powers, NPR’s music critic, {called it}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/annkpowers/status/500297020633264128""> “the first fully formed protest song I’ve heard addressing the death of Mike Brown” and said it was “evocative of Nina Simone.”

Mr. Cole’s song punctuated what was already a strong reaction in hip-hop circles, with artists, fans and critics going online to express themselves and debate the issue. And it followed the hip-hop world’s pitched reaction to the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012, which drew {musical responses}<hyperlink=""http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2013/07/trayvon_martin_inspired_hip_hop.php""> by Public Enemy, Dead Prez, Mos Def and others.

“In the many, many instances where tragedies like this have happened,” said Matthew Trammell, an associate editor at The Fader, a music and fashion magazine, “people in hip-hop immediately feel a responsibility to use the platform they have to raise a certain perspective that is not the default.”

On Instagram, the rapper Killer Mike posted a {picture}<hyperlink=""http://instagram.com/p/roanI7gTnB/?modal=true""> of Mr. Brown’s mother and stepfather along with an {impassioned note}<hyperlink=""http://instagram.com/p/rkrM8xS1Mk""> of sympathy that was noted by BuzzFeed, BET and many other outlets. On Tuesday, Wiz Khalifa and Young Jeezy performed in St. Louis wearing “R.I.P. Mike Brown” T-shirts. Young Jeezy also posted a picture of himself at a looted Ferguson convenience store, writing: “The answer is not tearing down our own neighborhoods and communities, the answer is goin to the source of the problem in numbers.”

{Tef Poe}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TefPoe"">, a St. Louis rapper, drew wide attention this week for a barrage of online posts, while at the same time thousands of people on Twitter used the hashtag {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/if-they-gunned-me-down-protest-on-twitter.html""> to criticize the stereotyping of young African-Americans by law enforcement and the news media.

Mr. Brown was an {aspiring rapper}<hyperlink=""https://soundcloud.com/bigmike-jr-brown""> himself, posting his own songs to SoundCloud, a streaming platform that is popular among young listeners and artists — particularly in dance and hip-hop — for its YouTube-like ease in uploading and sharing audio. Mr. Brown’s songs were even subject to insta-analysis by The Riverfront Times, a St. Louis weekly, which at first characterized his lyrics as “gangster” but later removed that word after {criticism}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/CraigSJ/status/498960569211580416"">.

In a {blog post}<hyperlink=""http://www.dreamvillain.net/free/""> unveiling the track, Mr. Cole wrote candidly about Mr. Brown’s death and the feelings it inspired in him. “That coulda been me, easily,” he wrote. “It could have been my best friend. I’m tired of being desensitized to the murder of black men.”

The lyrics to the song allude to Trayvon Martin’s death, with Mr. Cole singing, “I will stand my ground.” But Mr. Trammell of Fader noted that “Be Free” is not a straightforward protest song, avoiding political commentary in favor of an emotional, “fatigued” response to Mr. Brown’s death and all that it represents.

“For hip-hop artists, a lot of whom have come from places or circumstances where occurrences like this are not uncommon, they feel a very personal reaction to it,” Mr. Trammell said. “It’s not about political affiliations, or thoughts about the police or the president. It’s that these are the same kinds of people in the same kinds of places they grew up in.”

Mr. Cole on Friday declined to be interviewed about “Be Free.”

“He’d like the song to stand on its own,” a spokeswoman said.",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt64,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/upshot/americas-racial-divide-charted.html,"America’s Racial Divide, Charted",Neil Irwin; Claire Cain Miller; Margot Sanger-katz,08/19/2014,04/15/2016,"Editor’s note: This article, first published last summer after protests erupted in Ferguson, Mo., remains a telling guide to where America is and is not narrowing the gap between whites and blacks.

America’s racial divide is older than the republic itself, a central fault line that has shaped the nation’s history. This month it has manifested itself in sometimes violent protests in Ferguson, Mo., after a police killing of an unarmed young black man. The resonance of that event is related to deeper racial fissures between blacks and whites; that divide is the reason that the events in Ferguson amount to something bigger than a local crime story.

What is the state of that larger divide? In what areas has there been meaningful progress toward shared prosperity over the last generation, and in what areas is America as polarized by race as ever — or even more so?

Across a broad range of economic and demographic indicators, the data paint a largely depressing picture. Five decades past the era of legal segregation, a chasm remains between black and white Americans – and in some important respects it’s as wide as ever.

The unemployment gap is virtually unchanged over the last 40 years. The income and wealth gaps have actually widened. So has the gap in educational attainment.

There are bright spots, including a rising number of blacks in executive and managerial jobs (not to mention top political jobs) and converging levels of life expectancy. But by most measures, black and white Americans are still living in radically different societies – and there is no reason to believe that will change anytime soon.

Many other gaps – between men and women, between non-Hispanics and Hispanics – have shrunk substantially over the last few decades. But the black-white racial divide remains as central to American life as it has been for centuries.

Let’s look at the numbers:

Through economic booms and busts, the unemployment rate has been persistently higher for African-Americans than for whites across the decades.

The gap is not even narrowing in a meaningful way. Instead, the ratio of the unemployment rate among blacks versus that among whites has been amazingly consistent — between 2 and 2.5 – for the 40 years that official data go back. In 1972, the jobless rate among African-Americans was 2.04 times that among whites. In 2013, the ratio was 2.02.

How much of this is caused by differing educational levels of black workers versus white workers, given that people with advanced education have sharply lower jobless rates than those without? Only some of it is.

Even among people with similar levels of education, the black unemployment rate is higher. There was a 5.7 percent unemployment rate among African-Americans with a bachelor’s degree or higher in 2013, compared with 3.5 percent among white Americans with a bachelor’s degree or higher. Indeed, joblessness is higher among blacks in every education level tracked by the Labor Department.

Moreover, while the proportion of blacks getting a college degree has risen sharply over the last generation, the proportion of whites doing the same has risen even more.

According to census data analyzed by two Harvard economists, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, 21 percent of black 30-year-olds had a college degree in 2012, compared with 38 percent of white 30-year-olds. The 17 percentage point gap between those two numbers is considerably wider than the 10 percentage point gap in 1970.

There is better news to be seen in the types of jobs workers of different races are doing. A rising proportion of the nation’s white-collar professionals are African-American. Some 7.4 percent of managers and executives were black in 2013, up from 5.7 percent in 1990, and the ratio of professionals like lawyers and engineers who are black had risen to 9.3 from 6.7 percent.

Still, blacks are underrepresented in these jobs, and overrepresented in low-skilled jobs. That might be one reason why the rise of a black professional class has not been sufficient to reduce the overall income gap between white and black workers. That gap, if anything, is widening. In 1983, the median weekly pay of white workers was 18.4 percent higher than that of black workers. Three decades later, the premium had risen to 21.6 percent.

The differences in levels of wealth are even more striking. For two people with similar incomes, the level of wealth they accumulate can vary widely, depending on whether they received an inheritance or other help from parents; whether they had to take on student debts or other loans, and how aggressively they save and invest, among other factors.

And this gap has widened during the last recession and the slow recovery since then, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by the Urban Institute. The researchers found that white families were 4.3 times as wealthy as black and Hispanic families in 2007. By 2010, the multiple had widened to 6.1.

As a result, African-American families have less of a cushion to protect themselves if they encounter a financial setback, such as being laid off or encountering an unexpected health problem.

Poverty, by contrast, offers a glass-half-empty/glass-half-full picture. The good news is that the proportion of blacks living below the poverty line has fallen in a meaningful way over the last generation, to 27.2 percent in 2012 from 32.5 percent in 1980.

But the bad news is that 27.2 percent is an astronomical level of poverty, more than double the 12.7 percent level among whites (which has ticked up a couple of percentage points in the same span).

Lower incomes and wealth coincide with greater health problems. For example, 19.6 percent of blacks were diagnosed as having diabetes from 2007 to 2010, compared with 9.5 percent of whites. A similar pattern appears with a range of serious health problems.

Health disparities between people of different races are thought to arise from a number of factors, including poverty; health-insurance rates; housing stock; access to grocery stores and parks; and discrimination in how people of different races are treated by medical professionals.

More blacks than whites had no usual source of health care as recently as 2011-2012. It remains to be seen how the health law now being put into place might change that equation.

The law is likely to help large numbers of blacks, but many living in states that have chosen not to expand Medicaid will remain without coverage.

While the disparity in health is stark, there are some signs of improvement. Life expectancy has risen for people of both races over the last six decades. While newly born white children are still expected to live longer, the gap has narrowed considerably over recent decades, raising the prospect that the racial health gap will become less pronounced over time.

In 1950, white newborns had a life expectancy that was 8.3 years longer than that of black newborns. By 2010 that had narrowed to 3.8, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

But there is one area of health that speaks directly to the tension in Ferguson, Mo., and where progress has been slower in coming: homicides.

Homicide rates have come down across the board since the 1970s, so a smaller proportion of people of all races and ages are killed in any given year. But among young black men, death at the hand of someone else remains a threat to a degree it is not among any other subgroup of the population.

About 76 out of every 100,000 black men between ages 25 and 34 were killed in a homicide in 2010, more than nine times the rate among white men in the same age group and 14 times the rate of the U.S. population as a whole.",491,NA,NA,NA

In May, The New York Times requested and received from the Pentagon its database of transfers since 2006. The data underpinned an {article in June}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html""> and helped inform {coverage of the police response}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-missouri-in-wake-of-clashes-calls-to-demilitarize-police.html""> this month in Ferguson, Mo., after an officer shot Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager.

The Pentagon-to-police transfer program is not new. Congress created it during the drug war, as a way to increase police firepower in the fight against drug gangs. But since 9/11, as the Pentagon geared up to fight two wars, then drew down as those wars ended, the amount of available military surplus has ballooned.

Now, after a week of confrontation between protesters in Ferguson and heavily armed police, members of Congress are criticizing the trickle down of military gear.",48,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt66,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/politics/for-gov-jay-nixon-of-missouri-test-at-an-uneasy-time.html,"For Missouri Governor, Test at an Uneasy Time",Alan Blinder; John Eligon,08/14/2014,04/15/2016,"BELLERIVE, Mo. — When Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri stepped to the lectern at a university here on Thursday afternoon, he confronted one of the toughest challenges of his political career: the police killing of an unarmed black teenager in suburban St. Louis and the violent unrest that followed.

As he announced that he had ordered the State Highway Patrol to take over command of the police in the troubled city of Ferguson, he was by turns defensive and resolute, sentimental and personal.

He pushed away broad questions about healing by saying, “We’re a little focused right now on operational specifics.” At another point, when asked about his relationship with the black community, he spoke of the relationships he had with “so many of my friends over so many years” and went on to say, “I don’t think this is a time to divide.”

Mr. Nixon, 58, has had a successful political career by most measures. He is finishing his second and final term as a Democrat in a solidly Republican state. But when he first ran for national office, seeking a Senate seat in 1988, he was trounced by the incumbent Republican, Senator John C. Danforth. Mr. Nixon rebounded, serving for years in the State Senate, then as attorney general, and winning the race for governor in 2008.

As governor, he has constantly sought a middle ground, sometimes vetoing tax cuts and abortion restrictions from the Republican-led legislature, sometimes allowing certain abortion restrictions to go into effect.

But there has been a history of strain between Mr. Nixon and the black community that dates to the 1990s, when he was attorney general. He fought to end a school desegregation program that bused children from St. Louis schools to surrounding communities with better districts. The program, which was the result of the settlement of a court case, continues to this day.

Even on Thursday, as he was joined by black public officials during the nearly 40-minute news conference, and even though he appeared with black clergy members earlier in the day, some black leaders in Missouri criticized him as being insensitive to their community.

“I truly believe,” said State Senator Jamilah Nasheed, a former leader of the Legislative Black Caucus, “the governor hasn’t been in touch with the black community like he should.”

Mr. Nixon has been criticized as being slow to respond to the shooting and unrest in Ferguson, where the police are still investigating the death of Michael Brown, 18, on Saturday. Mr. Nixon did issue a statement calling for a federal investigation into the shooting two days after it happened. And he did appear this week at a St. Louis County church.

On Thursday, he took his boldest steps yet, canceling an appearance at the Missouri State Fair to come here to announce changes in the police command in Ferguson. Under St. Louis County police supervision, chaos had broken out in Ferguson over several nights, with officers firing rubber bullets and unleashing tear gas on protesters.

Still, some have seen Mr. Nixon’s actions as too little, too late.

“I think his historical lack of authentic connections and engagement with the black community is apparent in this situation by what I consider to be a tardy response to what is happening in Ferguson,” said Gwendolyn Grant, the president and chief executive of the Urban League of Greater Kansas City.

Critics say the governor has a habit of responding to pressing issues for black residents only after he faces great public pressure.

Mr. Nixon said during the news conference that he refused to inject race into the situation.

Over the past year, members of the state’s Legislative Black Caucus have openly feuded with the governor over policy proposals that they said would have deprived the needy of food stamps and taken away housing tax credits for low-income Missourians. Leaders in Kansas City were frustrated when he did not meet with them recently to discuss the city’s struggles with a school district that lost its accreditation a couple of years ago.

Mr. Nixon met with members of the Legislative Black Caucus in January, but they said it had taken a year for them to get him to come to the table.

Before that meeting, Ms. Nasheed, a Democrat, who led the caucus at the time, held a news conference with the lieutenant governor, Peter Kinder, a Republican, to denounce the governor’s threat to eliminate the low-income housing tax credit. When Mr. Nixon walked into the meeting, Ms. Nasheed recalled, “the first thing he said was, ‘I don’t like the fact that the chair of this caucus stood alongside a Republican attacking me.’ ”

Mr. Nixon also has been criticized for the lack of diversity in his administration. In his sixth year in office, the governor has appointed one African-American to direct an executive department. This in a state whose two major cities, Kansas City and St. Louis, have large black populations.

But a spokesman for the governor noted that he had received strong support from black residents for efforts like his push to expand {Medicaid}<hyperlink=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier""> and a veto of legislation that would have eliminated important provisions from the Missouri Human Rights Act. The governor has also appointed blacks to state boards and commissions, as well as the state’s Supreme Court, Court of Appeals and Board of Education.

“It appears to me that he’s working more closely with the African-American community, putting African-Americans in key positions in state government and supporting issues that are important to us,” said Harold Crumpton, a former president of the St. Louis N.A.A.C.P., who now leads a community development organization in the city.",NA,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt67,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/opinion/charles-blow-michael-brown-and-black-men.html,Michael Brown and Black Men,Charles M. Blow,08/13/2014,04/15/2016,"The killing of Michael Brown has tapped into something bigger than Michael Brown.

Brown was the unarmed 18-year-old black man who was shot to death Saturday by a policeman in Ferguson, Mo. There are conflicting accounts of the events that led to the shooting. There is {an investigation by local authorities as well as one by federal authorities}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/us/looting-and-unrest-follows-vigil-for-st-louis-teenager.html"">.

The president has {appealed for reflection and healing}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/12/president-barack-obama-michael-brown-case/13966527/"">.

There is an eerie echo in it all — a sense of tragedy too often repeated. And yet the sheer morbid, wrenching rhythm of it belies a larger phenomenon, one obscured by its vastness, one that can be seen only when one steps back and looks from a distance and with data: The criminalization of black and brown bodies — particularly male ones — from the moment they are first introduced to the institutions and power structures with which they must interact.

Earlier this year, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights released “the first comprehensive look at civil rights from every public school in the country in nearly 15 years.” {As the report put it}<hyperlink=""http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/expansive-survey-americas-public-schools-reveals-troubling-racial-disparities"">: “The 2011-2012 release shows that access to preschool programs is not a reality for much of the country. In addition, students of color are suspended more often than white students, and black and Latino students are significantly more likely to have teachers with less experience who aren’t paid as much as their colleagues in other schools.”

Attorney General Eric Holder, remarking on the data, said: “This critical report shows that racial disparities in school discipline policies are not only well-documented among older students, but actually begin during preschool.""

But, of course, this criminalization stalks these children throughout their school careers.

As The New York Times editorial board {pointed out last year}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/criminalizing-children-at-school.html?_r=1&"">: “Children as young as 12 have been treated as criminals for shoving matches and even adolescent misconduct like cursing in school. This is worrisome because young people who spend time in adult jails are more likely to have problems with law enforcement later on. Moreover, federal data suggest a pattern of discrimination in the arrests, with black and Hispanic children more likely to be affected than their white peers.”

A {2010 report by the Southern Poverty Law Center}<hyperlink=""http://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf""> found that while the average suspension rate for middle school students in 18 of the nation’s largest school districts was 11.2 percent in 2006, the rate for black male students was 28.3 percent, by far the highest of any subgroup by race, ethnicity or gender. And, according to the report, previous research “has consistently found that racial/ethnic disproportionality in discipline persists even when poverty and other demographic factors are controlled.”

And these disparities can have a severe impact on a child’s likelihood of graduating. According to a {report}<hyperlink=""http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/resources/projects/center-for-civil-rights-remedies/school-to-prison-folder/state-reports/sent-home-and-put-off-track-the-antecedents-disproportionalities-and-consequences-of-being-suspended-in-the-ninth-grade/balfanz-sent-home-ccrr-conf-2013.pdf""> from the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University that looked at Florida students, “Being suspended even once in 9th grade is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk for dropping out.”

Black male dropout rates are more than one and a half times those of white males, and when you look at the percentage of black men who graduate on time — in four years, not including those who possibly go on to get G.E.D.s, transfer to other schools or fail grades — the numbers are truly horrific. {Only about half of these black men graduate on time.}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/19/black-male-hs-graduation-_n_1896490.html"">

Now, the snowball is rolling. The bias of the educational system bleeds easily into the bias of the criminal justice system — from cops to courts to correctional facilities. The school-to-prison pipeline is complete.

A {May report by the Brookings Institution found}<hyperlink=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2014/05/10-crime-facts"">: “There is nearly a 70 percent chance that an African American man without a high school diploma will be imprisoned by his mid-thirties.”

This is in part because trending policing disparities are particularly troubling in places like Missouri. As the editorial board of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch {pointed out this week}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/the-platform/editorial-michael-brown-and-disparity-of-due-process/article_40bb2d0e-8619-534a-b629-093ebc79f0a6.html"">: “Last year, for the 11th time in the 14 years that data has been collected, the disparity index that measures potential racial profiling by law enforcement in the state {got worse}<hyperlink=""http://goo.gl/fx2zFx"">. Black Missourians were 66 percent more likely in 2013 to be stopped by police, and blacks and Hispanics were both more likely to be searched, even though the likelihood of finding contraband was higher among whites.”

And this is the reality if the child actually survives the journey. That is if he has the internal fortitude to continue to stand with the weight on his shoulders. That is if he doesn’t find himself on the wrong end of a gun barrel. That is if his parents can imbue in him a sense of value while the world endeavors to imbue in him a sense of worthlessness.

Parents can teach children how to interact with authority and how to mitigate the threat response their very being elicits. They can wrap them in love to safeguard them against the bitterness of racial suspicion.

It can be done. It is often done. But it is heartbreaking nonetheless. What psychic damage does it do to the black mind when one must come to own and manage the fear of the black body?

The burden of bias isn’t borne by the person in possession of it but by the person who is the subject of it. The violence is aimed away from the possessor of its instruments — the arrow is pointed away from the killer and at the prey.

It vests victimhood in the idea of personhood. It steals sometimes, something precious and irreplaceable. It breaks something that’s irreparable. It alters something in a way that’s irrevocable.

We flinchingly choose a lesser damage.

But still, the hopelessness takes hold when one realizes that there is no amount of acting right or doing right, no amount of parental wisdom or personal resilience that can completely guarantee survival, let alone success.

Brown had just finished high school and was to start college this week. The investigation will hopefully clarify what led to his killing. But it is clear even now that his killing occurred in a context, one that we would do well to recognize.

Brown’s mother {told a local television station}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html?_r=0""> after he was killed just weeks after his high school graduation: “Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many. Because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they don’t got nothing to live for anyway. ‘They’re going to try to take me out anyway.’ ”",762,NA,NA,NA

David Goodman; Joseph Goldstein,08/19/2014,04/15/2016,"Amid weeks of protests and calls for federal intervention, the Staten Island district attorney announced on Tuesday that he would open a grand jury investigation into {the death}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/nyregion/staten-island-man-dies-after-he-is-put-in-chokehold-during-arrest.html""> of an unarmed black man during an arrest last month, a process that could lead to indictments of the police officers involved.

The death of the man, Eric Garner, 43, inflamed tensions between the New York Police Department and minority communities, as widely distributed cellphone videos of the confrontation showed Mr. Garner struggling for breath as an officer clung to his neck and back.

Over the past week, civil rights advocates drew a link between those images and the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, Mo., with some, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, shuttling between the two disparate scenes — a largely peaceful Staten Island, and the smoke-filled streets of a community near St. Louis — to press for the prosecution of officers in both episodes.

In New York, demands for criminal prosecutions grew louder after the city medical examiner ruled Mr. Garner’s death {a homicide}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/nyregion/staten-island-man-died-from-officers-chokehold-autopsy-finds.html""> caused by a chokehold as well as the compression of his chest during the arrest. The district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., cited the autopsy, as well as an investigation by his office, in his decision to impanel a grand jury beginning in September.

“I will go wherever the evidence takes me, without fear or favor,” Mr. Donovan said in his statement, declining to comment on details of the grand jury investigation or when it might be completed.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has struggled to maintain a balance between assuaging community outrage at Mr. Garner’s death and supporting rank-and-file officers doubtful of his backing, said in a terse statement that he was “pleased” with the decision, adding, “The legal process is now underway.”

Before Mr. Donovan’s announcement, many advocates urged federal prosecutors to take over the case, questioning whether a district attorney from Staten Island, a borough home to many police officers, would zealously pursue what could prove to be a difficult case against the officers.

{Six members}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/nyregion/six-members-of-congress-ask-holder-to-open-federal-inquiry-in-chokehold-case.html""> of Congress asked Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to open a federal investigation into the case, saying they saw no indication that the local district attorney was “prepared to aggressively prosecute the case.” Mr. Sharpton, who has also urged federal involvement and is planning a demonstration on Staten Island for Saturday, said Mr. Donovan’s announcement did not dampen his calls for a federal civil rights case.

Mr. Holder, who is set to travel to Missouri on Wednesday, has said the Justice Department is monitoring the Staten Island investigation.

But federal authorities have thus far remained on the sidelines of Mr. Garner’s case, in part, former prosecutors said, because a state case can be made more complicated if federal prosecutors go first. The standard for proving a federal case can also be tough, requiring prosecutors to present evidence that the officers intended to deprive Mr. Garner of his civil rights based on his race.

Legal experts and former prosecutors said that despite the medical examiner’s ruling the death a homicide, murder charges {seemed unlikely}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/nyregion/after-eric-garner-chokehold-prosecuting-police-is-an-option.html""> because the episode that ended with Mr. Garner’s death on July 17 began as a routine arrest. Officers are generally given wide latitude to use force within department guidelines and their professional judgment.

A lesser homicide charge, like second-degree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, could be possible, legal experts said.

Before that, however, the grand jury must weigh whether there is enough evidence to go forward with a criminal prosecution, and if so, against which of the officers present. Mr. Donovan said in a statement that he would not comment on any details of the grand jury’s investigation, including the nature of the charges, witnesses and potential targets.

The case is not the first time Mr. Donovan had presented a grand jury with a potential criminal case against officers. In 2008, his office secured indictments against two officers accused of assaulting a 14-year-old boy and leaving him half-naked in a Staten Island marsh. The officers later pleaded guilty to a lesser offense after the boy declined to testify in court, and they received no jail time.

A key question in Mr. Garner’s case is likely to be whether one of the officers, Daniel Pantaleo, used a chokehold to bring the much larger man down, a maneuver the Police Department has prohibited since 1993. Union officials, along with lawyers for the officers, have disputed the medical examiner’s finding that a chokehold was used.

“I’m looking forward to a full fair and thorough investigation by the grand jury,” said Stuart London, the lawyer representing Officer Pantaleo. “The problem with this case has always been the rush to judgment.”

It is not clear whether other officers at the scene might be targets of the grand jury investigation.

In a video recording of the fatal encounter, the officers, in plainclothes, can be seen engaging Mr. Garner after accusing him of selling untaxed cigarettes on the street. When Mr. Garner refused to be arrested, Officer Pantaleo swung an arm around him and brought him to the ground. Mr. Garner, who weighed well over 300 pounds, can be heard saying “I can’t breathe” over and over as officers subdued him.

The police commissioner, William J. Bratton, later said Officer Pantaleo appeared to have employed a chokehold.

Beyond the video, the grand jury will also consider witness accounts of the rough arrest along with other evidence of events before and after the encounter.

For weeks, police union officials defended the officers and clashed with Mr. Sharpton in increasingly strident news conferences and statements. On Tuesday, Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said he was confident the grand jury would deliberate “based on facts, and not emotion or political considerations.”

Deputy Commissioner Stephen P. Davis, the Police Department’s chief spokesman, said that Mr. Bratton had consistently said it was the district attorney’s decision to “decide whether to present it.” Mr. Davis said, “We are willing and intend to cooperate in any way we can with the investigation.”

Some former prosecutors praised Mr. Donovan’s handling of the case as well as his statement on Tuesday, which emphasized the secret nature of grand jury proceedings.

“He’s doing exactly what district attorneys are supposed to do,” said Daniel R. Alonso, a former chief assistant to the Manhattan district attorney. “Use their authority to compel evidence in order to get to the bottom of what happened.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

Officers dressed in camouflage uniforms from Ferguson’s 53-person police force have pointed M-16s at the very citizens they are sworn to protect and serve.”

“The police response has shocked America,” they write, and while extant tensions between the majority African-American town of Ferguson and its predominantly white police department are the focus of the crisis, “the militarization of the police is a dimension of the story that has national implications.”

How did American police departments get their hands on such high-power, military-grade equipment? {National Journal’s Emma Roller}<hyperlink=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/how-congress-helped-create-ferguson-s-militarized-police-20140814""> cites {a New York Times report}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html""> from June, which brought to light the Defense Department’s recycling of U.S. military equipment by giving them to local police precincts. “This despite the fact that violent crime in the U.S. has steadily plummeted since 1993.”

More than 20 years ago, Congress passed a National Defense Authorization Act, “with a clause allowing ‘the transfer of excess personal property’ from the Defense Department to local law enforcement – otherwise known as Section 1208. The clause was included in response to the surge of violent crime and the War on Drugs in the late 1980s,” and “it’s worth noting that at the time, both chambers Congress were controlled by Democrats.”

Voices on both sides of the aisle have called for wide-scale demilitarization of local P.D.s, including Missouri’s own Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill. “We need to demilitarize this situation,” she told reporters on Thursday. “This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution. I obviously respect law enforcement’s work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect and protect that right.”

Senator Rand Paul (R-Ken.) echoed that sentiment in {a column for Time}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/"">: “The outrage in Ferguson is understandable – though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.” And the response in Ferguson foreshadows some worrying prospects about the future of policing, he writes. “When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with a erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury – national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture – we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.

But there may have been reasonable cause for outfitting local police departments with military-grade equipment in the early ’90s, writes Annie Lowrey for {New York magazine’s Daily Intelligencer blog}<hyperlink=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/militarized-police-a-less-violent-public.html"">. The U.S. in the late 1980s was in the midst of a nationwide surge in violent crime. And since the passage of the N.D.A.A. in 1990, “the United States has become a vastly safer place, at least in terms of violent crime,” according to {Department of Justice statistics}<hyperlink=""http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/State/StatebyState.cfm?NoVariables=Y&CFID=54112963&CFTOKEN=b98f00f5c421fedc-ECF5064F-07C0-71E3-699A12BA003CEF1E"">. “That’s also true in the state of Missouri. That state’s population has grown by about 1 million residents since the early 1990s, to 6 million. But the number of violent crimes has decreased to 27,155 from 36,602. The number of robberies has collapsed in half. The number of murders and non-negligent manslaughters has dropped from a high of 590 in 1993 to 389 in 2012.”

While Ms. Lowrey admits there’s no concrete evidence linking military-equipped police departments with the decline in violent crime, she isn’t hopeful that political efforts to demilitarize the police will achieve anything substantial. “There’s now a bipartisan movement to demilitarize the police,” she writes. “But it’s worth remembering that there’s defense money on the line.” In June, Congress failed to pass a partial defunding of a Cold War-era bill that, like the N.D.A.A., approved the transfer of military-grade weapons to local police departments. “On aggregate, the members who voted against the measure received 73 percent more money from defense lobbyists than the representatives who voted for it.”

Political viability aside, and regardless of what the public-safety situation in the late ’80s was, “police militarization was a mistake,” {writes Kevin Drum for Mother Jones}<hyperlink=""http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/08/we-created-policing-monster-mistake"">. “You can argue that perhaps we didn’t know that at the time. No one knew in 1990 that crime was about to begin a dramatic long-term decline, and no one knew in 2001 that domestic terrorism would never become a serious threat. But we know now. There’s no longer even a thin excuse for arming our police forces this way.”",5,NA,NA,NA

The dispute centers on Al Jazeera’s refusal to turn over “tens of millions of dollars” remaining in an escrow account and still owed to the selling shareholders of Current TV, according to a statement from David Boies, the lawyer representing Mr. Gore and a Current TV co-owner, Joel Hyatt, who are suing on behalf of all the selling shareholders.

“Al Jazeera America wants to give itself a discount on the purchase price that was agreed to nearly two years ago,” Mr. Boies said. “We are asking the court to order Al Jazeera America to stop wrongfully withholding the escrow funds that belong to Current’s former shareholders.”

Mr. Gore and Mr. Hyatt filed the case in the Delaware Court of Chancery in Wilmington. Few other details are known, as the complaint has been sealed by the court, but Mr. Gore and the other selling shareholders have petitioned to make the case public.

Dawn Bridges, an Al Jazeera America spokeswoman, said that the network’s outside counsel was reviewing the complaint. “We think it relates to a commercial dispute between former shareholders of Current Media and Al Jazeera America,” she said. “We may have further comment once they’ve fully reviewed everything.”

Backed by the government of Qatar, Al Jazeera snapped up Current TV in January 2013 to lay the foundation for its new round-the-clock news network, Al Jazeera America. The media group had operated its global English-language channel Al Jazeera English since 2006, and with the new network, was seeking to break into the American market and establish itself as a legitimate news outlet here.

The Current TV deal gave Al Jazeera access to 40 million households for the start of the new network. Mr. Gore reportedly received a $100 million payout as part of the deal.

Al Jazeera America made a big public relations splash when it hit the airwaves in August 2013, hiring nearly 900 journalists across about a dozen cities in the United States. Executives pitched the network as an alternative to the sensationalistic and polarizing coverage of its more established cable news rivals.

The network has steadily gained carriage across cable and satellite companies and now is available in 60 million households.

But Al Jazeera America has been slow to develop an audience. The network averaged about 17,000 viewers during prime time since the beginning of 2014 through the end of May, according to Nielsen. That is a small fraction of the 1.7 million average prime-time viewers for Fox News, the 626,000 viewers for MSNBC and the 488,000 viewers for CNN through the end of June, according to Nielsen.

Ms. Bridges, the Al Jazeera America spokeswoman, said that the network had delivered steady ratings growth over the last year and that its coverage of recent conflict in Gaza and protests in Ferguson, Mo., had lured more viewers. Al Jazeera America reached more than 5.1 million viewers in prime time from July 7 through Aug. 10.

Ehab Al Shihabi, the chief executive of Al Jazeera America, has said that it is still early days for the network and that the group is going to spend its second year expanding its distribution, advertising and journalism.

“Let’s put things in perspective. Other cable news networks have been on television for decades — we’re a year old,” he said in a recent note to staff members to observe the network’s one-year anniversary. “We’re still growing our brand awareness as well as our distribution, which is a little more than half of all U.S. cable homes.”",468,NA,NA,NA
NYTimes,nyt72,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/technology/web-trolls-winning-as-incivility-increases.html,Web Trolls Winning as Incivility Increases,Farhad Manjoo,08/14/2014,04/21/2016,"The Internet may be losing the war against trolls. At the very least, it isn’t winning. And unless social networks, media sites and governments come up with some innovative way of defeating online troublemakers, the digital world will never be free of the trolls’ collective sway.

That’s the dismal judgment of the handful of scholars who study the broad category of online incivility known as trolling, a problem whose scope is not clear, but whose victims keep mounting.

“As long as the Internet keeps operating according to a click-based economy, trolls will maybe not win, but they will always be present,” said Whitney Phillips, a lecturer at Humboldt State University and the author of {“This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,”}<hyperlink=""http://billions-and-billions.com/2014/02/13/my-book-officially-forthcoming-with-mit-press/""> a forthcoming book about her years of studying bad behavior online. “The faster that the whole media system goes, the more trolls have a foothold to stand on. They are perfectly calibrated to exploit the way media is disseminated these days.”

“Troll” is the fuzzy term for agitators who pop up, often anonymously, sometimes in mobs, in comment threads and on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, apparently intent on wreaking havoc. The term is vague precisely because trolls lurk in darkness; their aims are unclear, their intentions unknown, their affiliations mysterious.

In recent years the term has become a catchall label for routine, graphically provocative online speech of the sort directed this week at Zelda Williams, the daughter of the actor Robin Williams, as well as abusive posts on the website Jezebel. It has even been applied to the work of the underground hacking group Anonymous, which {inserted itself}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teenager-and-officer-scuffled-before-shooting-chief-says.html""> into the protests over the police shooting of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Mo.

The broader definition of troll reflects, in part, the rise of social media, which has collapsed all distance between celebrity entertainers and media types and their critics. Scholars note that one of the primary motivations of trolling is to titillate other trolls. This sets up one of the central difficulties in confronting trolling: Shedding light on trolling may only encourage it.

“As more high-profile cases come to light, particularly of celebrities and high-profile figures being chased off of social media, more people will view trolling as a way of having an effect on these otherwise apparently untouchable figures from the safety of their own smartphones and homes,” Claire Hardaker, a lecturer in linguistics at Lancaster University in England who has {studied trolling}<hyperlink=""http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/profiles/claire-hardaker"">, said in an email.

Ms. Williams decided to quit Twitter on Tuesday after being {hounded by trolls}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/08/13/robin-williamss-daughter-zelda-driven-off-twitter-by-vicious-trolls/""> who posted doctored images purporting to show her father’s body with bruises around his neck. “Look at what he...did to himself because of you,” one of the trolls tweeted shortly after Mr. Williams’s suicide on Monday. After trying to confront the trolls, Ms. Williams admitted defeat:

I'm sorry. I should've risen above. Deleting this from my devices for a good long time, maybe forever. Time will tell. Goodbye. — Zelda Williams (@zeldawilliams) {Aug. 13, 2014}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/zeldawilliams/statuses/499432576872755201"">

Jezebel, the popular feminist news site run by Gawker Media, disclosed that it had been overrun for months by anonymous people posting violent, pornographic pictures in its comments section. Some of the content included “gory images of bloody injuries emblazoned with the Jezebel logo,” it said.

To weed out such messages, Jezebel’s staff waded through the worst posts and manually deleted them — only to find new images from new anonymous posters at every turn. “It’s like playing Whac-a-Mole with a sociopathic Hydra,” the {staff wrote}<hyperlink=""http://jezebel.com/we-have-a-rape-gif-problem-and-gawker-media-wont-do-any-1619384265/all"">.

A celebrity’s quitting Twitter and a blog’s staff having to delete a few terrible images may not sound like one of the most alarming problems the world faces. But trolling does not happen in isolation, and the routine, collective path of emotional damage left in trolls’ wake can be devastating. This is particularly true for women — especially those who write about feminism or other hot-button topics — who have become a frequent target of trolls.

In {an essay published in Pacific Standard}<hyperlink=""http://www.psmag.com/navigation/health-and-behavior/women-arent-welcome-internet-72170/""> magazine this year, the writer Amanda Hess pointed out that the Internet was becoming “central to the human experience,” a place you cannot escape if you want to work, date, socialize, run for office, mount an advocacy campaign or open a checking account. “Threats of rape, death, and stalking can overpower our emotional bandwidth, take up our time and cost us money through legal fees, online protection services and missed wages,” she wrote, arguing that the unchecked rise of trolling posed nothing less than a civil rights issue for women.

But combating trolling is a fiendish problem, like the cat-and-mouse fight against hackers. Both Twitter and Facebook have ways for people to report abuse, but the features are frequently described as inadequate.

Del Harvey, Twitter’s vice president for trust and safety, said in a statement that the site had suspended the accounts of the people who attacked Ms. Williams. “We are in the process of evaluating how we can further improve our policies to better handle tragic situations like this one,” she said.

{Gawker Media said}<hyperlink=""http://jezebel.com/what-gawker-media-is-doing-about-our-rape-gif-problem-1620742504/+Jessica""> it was setting up a system in which only approved commenters will be allowed to post to the main comment section. Comments from the unapproved will be relegated to a “pending” section that readers will be advised to avoid.

Others have called for more far-reaching efforts, including reducing the possibility of posting anonymously on many online forums, or of posting at all. Responding to the Jezebel situation this week, {Nicholas Jackson}<hyperlink=""http://www.psmag.com/navigation/nature-and-technology/just-kill-comments-already-88188/"">, the digital director of Pacific Standard, and {Margaret Eby}<hyperlink=""http://www.bkmag.com/2014/08/12/the-comments-have-failed-us/"">, a writer at Brooklyn Magazine, argued that new sites should eliminate comments.

But Dr. Phillips, of Humboldt State, pointed out that many efforts to curb trolling ran into a larger problem: “To what extent do you want to make it harder for people to express themselves on the Internet?” she asked.

“This is not the good-faith exchange of ideas,” she said. “It’s just people being nasty, and if anything, it might encourage marginalized groups to not speak up.” She added, “On the other hand, by silencing that valve, there’s a lot of other stuff that is important culturally that might also be minimized.”

If there’s one thing the history of the Internet has taught us, it’s that trolls will be difficult to contain because they really reflect base human society in all its ugliness. {Trolls find a way}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkWeMvrNiOM"">.

“It’s not a question of whether or not we’re winning the war on trolling, but whether we’re winning the war on misogyny, or racism, and ableism and all this other stuff,” Dr. Phillips said. “Trolling is just a symptom of those bigger problems.”",468,NA,NA,NA

Trolling describes a set of {diverse behaviors}<hyperlink=""http://www.flamewarriorsguide.com/index.htm""> -- everything from harmful efforts to destroy a target’s reputation to harmless pranks and serious political activity. Conduct on the Internet is spatially contingent: it depends on the website or platform and using the catch-all label of troll to describe different kinds of conduct has only limited our understanding of this phenomenon.

For instance, trolling has been used to describe Anonymous’s campaigns to bring down websites {by generating more traffic}<hyperlink=""http://imgur.com/EYXnk""> than they can handle, as well as their efforts to expose the identity of individuals the group perceives as criminals.

When Anonymous {accurately identified the football players}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/sports/hackers-of-steubenville-football-teams-web-site-demand-apology-in-rape-case.html?_r=0""> who raped a young girl in Steubenville, Ohio, they were hailed as “hacktivists”; but when they inaccurately identified the police officer who shot a young black man in Ferguson, Mo., they were lambasted as “trolls.”

On 4chan — the popular nonhierarchical forum behind many of the Internet memes in mainstream circulation — trolling is more like tricksterism or like a Zen koan provoking “great doubt” through disruption, reminding 4channers to remain aware of the deceptive discourse. Because users on 4chan are exploiting opportune moments for trickery by gauging what will both interest and outrage their audience, the community anticipates it. The trolls “win” if they incite outrage; the audience “wins” if it refrains from outrage and frees itself from egocentrism.

Sensationalistic coverage of trolling heightens social anxieties and helps conflate hacking, identity theft and sexual predation with even harmless, or useful, disruption.

Twenty-four minutes later, The Times posted its first article. A Times news team — including more than a dozen reporters, the Obituary, National and Metro desks and video producers — was quickly in gear reporting the obituary and related stories that ran in today’s paper. The night note from Tom Jolly, the assistant managing editor, to staff editors provides an inside look at how the unexpected obituary came together.

Good morning,

The first report of Robin Williams’ death broke at 6:54. Dave Itzkoff got confirmation from Williams’ publicist and Emma Fitzsimmons wrote a quick news report that we alerted at 7:18.

Great teamwork continued from there. Itzkoff wrote the obit with Bill McDonald, Peter Keepnews and Dan Gold editing and Brian Fidelman carving out a full-page for the jump and an appraisal that Tony Scott was writing for first City. The Metro and National copy desks also lent hands to slot the obit as it grew for second edition. Lillie Dremeaux, Karen Zraick and Susanna Timmons built out the report with text and video links and other accompanying material and Ian Fisher and Jaimie Abir weighed in with great suggestions.

Jeremy Egner curated video and other Times content for a complementary ArtsBeat post.

Jeremy Zilar was reaching out to Dan Wakin on Soo-Jeong Kang to see if actors around NYC would be willing to share their thoughts on video on Tuesday.

Among them was SketchFactor, an app that offers users a map of their surroundings pinned with googly-eyed faces to indicate where a “sketchy” incident has been reported. A user can report an unpleasant occurrence or use the app’s directions feature to chart a non-“sketchy” route through a city.

An early description of the app (since scrubbed from the website) told the founding story from the perspective of co-founder Allison McGuire: “One time I didn’t walk home because I wasn’t familiar with the area. Turns out, the neighborhood was not sketchy at all and I could’ve walked home. I would’ve saved $15 on a sketchy cab. Ironically, I moved to that same neighborhood one month later.” {Crain’s New York reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140807/TECHNOLOGY/140809904/new-app-will-keep-you-away-from-sketchy-areas#""> that Ms. McGuire lives in New York City’s West Village.

Writers who covered the app found much to criticize. In a {Colorlines}<hyperlink=""http://colorlines.com/archives/2014/08/want_to_avoid_black_neighborhoods_theres_an_app_for_that.html""> piece titled “Want to Avoid Black Neighborhoods? There’s an App for That,” Aura Bogado argued that SketchFactor “essentially crowdsources fear.” Sam Biddle at {Valleywag}<hyperlink=""http://valleywag.gawker.com/smiling-young-white-people-make-app-for-avoiding-black-1617775138""> lamented the use of “sketchy” as a “term young white people use to describe places where they don’t feel safe.” {Citylab}<hyperlink=""http://www.citylab.com/tech/2014/08/people-just-wont-give-up-on-awful-neighborhood-apps/375766/"">’s Kriston Capps was concerned that the app “depends in large part on the wholly subjective judgments of its entirely anonymous and self-selecting user group.”

Some users of the app, which launched Aug. 10, seemed to express a fear of what was different or unfamiliar and made assumptions about people who appeared to be poor or struggle with addiction. Early posts included references to a man who “looked homeless or at least scary,” a “gang of Arab teens hanging out harassing people,” “a bum sticking a needle in his leg and drinking alcohol,” and the discomfort of being near destitution: “There’s a homeless shelter or something that houses the poor here. The residents hang out front and never bother anyone, but it’s uncomfortable as you pass by in an otherwise nice area.”

SketchFactor’s website has been updated with new language to address some of its critics’ concerns. Its most recent {Support}<hyperlink=""http://www.sketchfactor.com/support/""> page says that reports that offend should be “downvoted,” so that they are granted less value. (The reports mentioned above, however, are still visible as of this writing.) The website also admonishes users that “hateful or prejudiced speech” is “not cool and not allowed”; reminds them to be “realistic” (“We can’t prevent you from encountering harm”); and encourages them to be “street smart” (“Looking at your phone while on the street or on public transit can cause you to be a target of smartphone theft.”).

An early description of SketchFactor on its website made reference to a partnership between the app and the {Million Hoodies Movement for Justice}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/MillionHoodies?ref=br_tf"">, an organization founded in the wake of Trayvon Martin’s death to empower communities to address racial injustice and police misconduct. Dante Barry, the deputy director of Million Hoodies, told Op-Talk that part of the organization’s mission was to harness the power of “creative technology, counter marketing, and grassroots organizing.” He said that SketchFactor contacted Million Hoodies to gauge interest in working together. Daniel Maree, Founder and Executive Director of Million Hoodies told Op-Talk that, when SketchFactor contacted them, Million Hoodies recognized the possibilities the app presented as a way to empower young people of color to report racial profiling and incidents of police misconduct. But both Mr. Maree and Mr. Barry denied a formal partnership. Mr. Maree categorized Million Hoodies’ role as that of “a third-party beta tester.” And he said of SketchFactor, “With the knowledge they contacted an organization like ours, it’s hard to believe they had negative intentions.”

Million Hoodies has used other geolocating tools and technology to combat racial injustice and police misconduct and hopes to do so again. As {Alexis Stephens reports}<hyperlink=""http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/sketch-factor-app-racism""> for Next City, Million Hoodies recommends an {NYCLU app}<hyperlink=""http://www.nyclu.org/app""> that allows observers to report incidents of unwarranted stops using video cameras, voice recordings, and geolocation. The app also enumerates the user’s rights, whether when filming the police or after being stopped, searched, or questioned.

Ms. McGuire told Op-Talk in an email that, rather than encouraging discrimination, SketchFactor “created ways to report racial profiling, catcalling, and other issues.” In her words, “SketchFactor is a powerful tool to identify eccentricities and challenges. If your neighborhood has a dangerous intersection, a broken street light, or consistent street harassment, SketchFactor empowers residents and others to weigh in.” Ms. McGuire cited the example of a street corner on the Upper West Side that has a disproportionate number of traffic accidents. “What if SketchFactor had recorded the close calls? Maybe, just maybe, one of those accidents wouldn’t have happened.”

Mr. Capps, however, found dubious the claim that the app could combat racial profiling: “Sketchy,” he argued in his Citylab piece, was “the wrong word to use if the goal is to build an app to stop profiling. Racial profiling is the weaponizing of ‘sketchy,’ and it results in the persecution of minorities.”

But Ms. McGuire denied that the term “sketchy” was vague or offensive. “People understand sketchy,” she said. “Dead pile of rats on the street: sketch. Guy licking his lips at ladies as they pass by: sketch. Low lit, desolate parking lot: sketch.” She also touted SketchFactor’s level of detail: “There have been many apps that have unfairly labeled entire neighborhoods, boroughs, quadrants. We created SketchFactor to do the opposite. In the app, users are able to pinpoint very specific areas – like a street corner.”

The result is a map pocked with reported incidents that threaten danger. Some offer arguably helpful information: A user named Howard writes that he has been “hassled” at Amsterdam Avenue and 62 St. three times in recent years. “This stretch, between 61st and 65th on Amsterdam, is worth avoiding. Walk up Columbus or West End Avenue.” Others are less so: At 50 St. and 8th Avenue, the user Popo writes, “There’s a mobster under my bed and an evil monkey in the closet.”

Michael Brown’s death and the protests in Ferguson have thrown the issues of racial profiling and police misconduct into high relief. Whether SketchFactor will be able to combat these problems — or whether it will merely compound them — remains to be seen.",8,NA,NA,NA

“On first glance, you wouldn’t think this was police,” says Brent McDonald, our senior videographer who has been there since Tuesday, working continuously.

For most of the day, the crowds he witnessed were largely peaceful until the police fired tear gas. He saw a few projectiles thrown, including a Molotov cocktail and a brick, but they didn’t hit anyone.

For protesters, the sight of the heavy weaponry seemed “like salt in the wound of an injustice,” he says.

“The anger was palpable, seething, when confronted with that kind of force.”

The trigger in Egypt’s revolution, Mr. Mackey points out, was police brutality: Two officers were accused of {beating a 28-year-old businessman to death}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/world/middleeast/06face.html""> in Alexandria.

The use of excessive force by the police has fueled rather than quelled protests again and again, he says.

“We watched it happen in Iran, Syria, Bahrain, Ukraine, Turkey and Brazil and with the Occupy movement here.”

“No matter what the grievance the first protests were organized around, there’s an overreaction by the police force and police brutality,” Mr. Mackey says.

• A new chance for Iraq.

The Iraqi prime minister {agreed today to step down}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/world/middleeast/iraq-prime-minister-.html"">, removing an obstacle to creating a more representative government.

Actually forming one will take leadership that can transcend many years of bitter sectarian war.

“Many of the Sunnis and Kurds have become so disenchanted with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki that they are willing to accept any new Shiite leader,” say our Baghdad bureau chief, Tim Arango.

Still, his successor, Haider al-Abadi, likely has his own historical resentments against the government of Saddam Hussein.

And he will have to make serious concessions to bring Sunnis and Kurds in to the fold, Mr. Arango says.

That means the release of Sunnis imprisoned under Mr. Maliki’s nakedly sectarian government, he says.

“With the Kurds, he will probably have to give them more autonomy over their own oil, and accept Kurdish control of Kirkuk,” Mr. Arango says.

• Sharing the field.

The player attracting the most attention at the Little League World Series is a 13-year-old girl with a 70-mile-an-hour fastball.

So how does the i{ncreasing presence of girls}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/sports/girls-in-little-league-world-series-become-less-of-a-novelty.html""> on the field play out for the boys?

“There’s a real split at the moment,” says KJ Dell’Antonia, our parenting blogger.

“It’s no big deal for those who’ve grown up in coed sports,” she says. “They won’t blink an eye at the appearance of a girl in the L.L.W.S. — or in goal at a hockey game, or on the Nascar track.

“That’s an ‘of course’ for them.”

But at 11 to 13 years old, the players tend to reflect their parents’ attitudes.

“The boys whose dads are still using phrases like ‘you throw like a girl’ as an insult may be surprised — and upset — if she strikes them out,” Ms. Dell’Antonia says. “Maybe they’ll cry like a boy.”

• A New York Catholic in the Jewish state.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was following in a long tradition with his visit to Israel, which {wrapped up today}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/nyregion/cuomo-wraps-up-israel-trip-after-visiting-tunnels.html""> with a trip to the Gaza border to see a Hamas tunnel.

Our former chief political correspondent Adam Nagourney says the trip “feels like a bit of a throwback” to a time when New York politicians would bolster their standing with major ethnic blocs by visiting “the three I’s – Israel, Italy and Ireland.”

Even now that the state is far more diverse, Mr. Nagourney says, “Israel remains a big deal to many Jewish voters, and Jewish voters — and I might add contributors — are a big deal in New York elections.”

“I can’t imagine another state where it would have the same kind of resonance,” adds Mr. Nagourney, who is now our Los Angeles bureau chief.

But, he notes, “the governor of California and the mayor of Los Angeles have made trips to Mexico.”

NYTimes,nyt77,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-wheres-the-justice-at-justice.html,Where’s the Justice at Justice?,Maureen Dowd,08/16/2014,04/21/2016,"WASHINGTON — JIM RISEN is gruff.

The tall slab of a reporter looks like someone who could have played an Irish Marine sergeant in an old World War II movie.

“Editors think I’m a curmudgeon,” the 59-year-old admits, laughing.

Eric Lichtblau, the reporter who sits next to Risen in The Times’s Washington bureau and who won a Pulitzer with him for their remarkable stories about the Bush administration’s illegal warrantless wiretapping, says Risen revels in his prickly, old-school style, acting contrary on everything from newfangled computers to the Bush crew’s {fictions about Saddam}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/21/world/threats-and-responses-the-view-from-prague-prague-discounts-an-iraqi-meeting.html""> and W.M.D. to cautious editors.

“He’s pushed to go places that often editors are unwilling to go,” Lichtblau said. “He’s never taken the safe route.”

Once Lichtblau took him to a pick-up basketball game and, naturally, Risen got in a fight with a lobbyist about the rules for being out of bounds.

As Carl Hulse, The Times’s chief Washington correspondent, wryly puts it: “Whether it’s editors or government officials, Jim definitely won’t take no for an answer, but he will certainly give it.”

Over lunch near the White House on Friday, Risen, dressed in his Men’s Wearhouse shirt and khakis and his brown Ecco walking shoes, talked about having the sword of Damocles over his head, as the reluctant star of a searing media-government showdown that could end with him behind bars.

“It’s surreal to be caught up in a news story instead of writing about one,” he said, in his soft voice.

He said he was inspired by the Watergate hearings to get into journalism and that he inherited his skepticism about government from his mom, who grew up in Indiana during the Depression, the daughter of an Irish railway machinist who was often out of work. Every time she saw the pyramids on TV, she would say, “I wonder how many slaves died building that?”

Risen said he’s not afraid that F.B.I. agents will show up one day at the suburban Maryland home he shares with his wife, Penny. (His three sons are grown, and one is a reporter.) But he has exhausted all his legal challenges, including {at the Supreme Court}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/us/james-risen-faces-jail-time-for-refusing-to-identify-a-confidential-source.html"">, against the Obama administration.

“I was nervous for a long time, but they’ve been after me for six years so now I try to ignore it,” he said, musing that he’s already decided what he’ll take to prison: Civil War books and World War II histories.

The Justice Department is trying to scuttle the reporters’ privilege — ignoring the chilling effect that is having on truth emerging in a jittery post-9/11 world prone to egregious government excesses.

Attorney General Eric Holder wants to force Risen to testify and reveal the identity of his confidential source on a story he had in his 2006 book concerning a bungled C.I.A. operation during the Clinton administration in which agents might have inadvertently helped Iran develop its nuclear weapon program. The tale made the C.I.A. look silly, which may have been more of a sore point than a threat to national security.

But Bush officials, no doubt still smarting from Risen’s revelation of their illegal wiretapping, zeroed in on a disillusioned former C.I.A. agent named Jeffrey Sterling as the source of the Iran story.

The subpoena forcing Risen’s testimony expired in 2009, and to the surprise of just about everybody, the constitutional law professor’s administration renewed it — kicking off its strange and awful aggression against reporters and whistle-blowers.

Holder said in May that “no reporter who is doing his job is going to go to jail,” trying to show some leg and signal that his intention is benign, merely to put pressure on Sterling so that he will plead guilty before his trial.

The president and the attorney general both spoke nobly about the First Amendment after two reporters were arrested in Ferguson, Mo., while covering the racial protests in the wake of Michael Brown’s death.

Obama said that “here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.”

Holder seconded the sentiment, saying that “journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.”

So why don’t they back off Risen? It’s hard to fathom how the president who started with the press fluffing his pillows has ended up trying to suffocate the press with those pillows.

How can he use the Espionage Act to throw reporters and whistle-blowers in jail even as he defends the intelligence operatives who “tortured some folks,” and coddles his C.I.A. chief, John Brennan, who spied on the Senate and then lied to the senators he spied on about it?

“It’s hypocritical,” Risen said. “A lot of people still think this is some kind of game or signal or spin. They don’t want to believe that Obama wants to crack down on the press and whistle-blowers. But he does. He’s the greatest enemy to press freedom in a generation.”

Risen points to recent stories about the administration pressing an unprecedented initiative known as the Insider Threat Program, which McClatchy {described}<hyperlink=""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/06/20/194513/obamas-crackdown-views-leaks-as.html""> as “a government-wide crackdown on security threats that requires federal employees to keep closer tabs on their co-workers and exhorts managers to punish those who fail to report their suspicions.”

Risen may be trapped in Ibsen, but Obama is channeling Orwell.",387,NA,NA,NA

NYTimes,nyt79,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/europe/german-leader-emerges-as-key-figure-in-ukraine-talks.html,German Leader Emerges as Key Figure in Ukraine Talks,Alison Smale,08/19/2014,04/21/2016,"RIGA, Latvia — With President Obama facing a host of other problems around the world and at home, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is emerging more and more as a pivotal leader on the Ukraine conflict.

But while the leadership role plays to her image and Germany’s sense of its importance in Europe, it has Ms. Merkel dancing delicately between opposing forces.

On Monday, she descended on Latvia for six hours to deliver a message: She sympathizes with the Baltics’ fears in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and involvement in eastern Ukraine. She agrees that NATO’s treaty about standing behind alliance members in need “is not only a hypothetical possibility, but a very real option that we will act upon when needed.”

“We must be prepared for this,” she said, “and these preparations must be stronger than we thought a few years ago.”

But while that reflected her disillusionment with President Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia, she made equally clear that Germany — and presumably other NATO powers — would not agree to a permanent presence of allied troops in countries bordering Russia at a NATO summit meeting in Wales next month, as the Baltic States have demanded.

That, she said, would flout the NATO-Russia accord of 1997. Instead, she and Prime Minister Laimdota Straujuma of Latvia suggested after talks on Monday, the allies will maintain a “persistent presence,” involving allied troops in air surveillance, near-constant maneuvers or training that keeps NATO forces on the ground much of the time in member states like Poland or the Baltics — a compromise, but not one likely to set off Mr. Putin’s wrath.

Ms. Merkel’s involvement in the Ukraine crisis deepened Tuesday, when it was announced in Berlin that she would travel to Kiev, the capital, on Saturday for talks with Ukrainian leaders. Hours later came the announcement that Ukraine’s leader and Mr. Putin will meet next Tuesday in Belarus — only their second face-to-face meeting and one that the Germans, among others, have been pushing for weeks.Ms. Merkel’s visit to Ukraine on Saturday will be her first since the crisis erupted last fall, and will pointedly take her there a day before Ukraine’s independence day on Sunday. More delicately, it puts her in Ukraine on the 75th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, in which the Nazis and Soviets secretly agreed to divide Poland and bring the Baltic states under Soviet domination.

Memories of those occupations have stirred anew in the Baltics in recent months, particularly when watching the Russian annexation of Crimea or hearing the Kremlin invoke the need to protect Russian minorities abroad. Baltic leaders, each with their own Russian minorities, have demanded an allied, particularly American, military presence. While those demands are certain to be renewed at the Wales meeting, some Latvian leaders signaled acceptance of the “persistent presence” as a credible alternative.

“The role of NATO first of all is deterrence,” Edgars Rinkevics, the Latvian foreign minister, said in an interview. While he insisted that “the deterrence has to be credible,” he did not rule out that a persistent presence could have that effect.

The German chancellor’s visit, he added, “was rather important for many reasons,” and constituted “quite a step forward.”

Ms. Merkel and her foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, have each spent many hours trying to resolve the Ukraine crisis. Ms. Merkel is last known to have discussed Ukraine with Mr. Obama as he headed into his vacation 10 days ago; since then, she has talked at least twice to Mr. Putin and more to President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine.

Ms. Merkel, who speaks Russian, has spoken to Mr. Putin, who speaks German, dozens of times since the Russian leader sent troops into Crimea in late February. With Mr. Obama immersed in crises from Iraq to Ferguson, Mo., and other European leaders facing their own domestic problems — Britain is riveted by Scotland’s referendum on independence, France is mired in economic and political woes — she is ever more the guiding spirit at European summit meetings as well as handling Ukraine in between, diplomats say.

Mr. Steinmeier spent five hours with his Russian, Ukrainian and French counterparts at a villa on a Berlin lake on Sunday. They appear to be aiming for at least a temporary cease-fire in eastern Ukraine. But mindful that previous written declarations from recent meetings remained totally unrealized, Mr. Steinmeier refrained from even framing a document, anxious simply to keep the negotiating momentum going.

Ms. Merkel is sounding equally determined in the face of continued Kremlin flouting of international law. “We can really act with certainty,” she emphasized Monday in terms of supporting NATO partners. “There will be a much bigger, stronger presence here than in the past was the case.”",NA,NA,NA,NA
