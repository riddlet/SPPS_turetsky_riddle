A 25-year-old man, Ezell Ford, Jr. was fatally shot by the LAPD as he was reportedly complying with police orders. This shooting comes a short two days after {Michael Brown’s death at the hands of Ferguson, Missouri police}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2738215/exclusive-interview-with-mike-browns-mother-video/""> took all of our attention.

Family members say the victim–who was mentally handicapped–was lying on the ground and complying with officers when he was shot three times.  A man who did not give his name and identified himself only as a cousin of the victim described what he saw, noting he had been around the corner when the altercation first occurred. “They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back knowing, mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area from the Newton Division knows that this child has mental problems,” the man said. “The excessive force … there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in the back while he’s laying down? No. Then when the mom comes, they don’t try to console her … they pull the billy clubs out.”

Ford’s shooting has sparked a hashtag on social media, {#EzellFord}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23EzellFord&src=typd"">, and a rally is being organized for 3 p.m. Sunday at LAPD headquarters, {according to a Facebook invitation}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1464184837170479/"">.

“My heart is so heavy. My son was a good kid. He didn’t deserve to die the way he did,” Tritobia Ford said in an interview Tuesday evening. Ford’s mother claims that she was pushed to the ground when she became hysterical and tried to find out what happened to her son. Similar to the ambiguous details surrounding what happened in the altercation between police and Brown, details on Ford’s fatal shooting are sparse. Ford’s mother says that police refused to inform her of where her son was hospitalized. The LAPD is also denying that anyone was denied information, though {KTLA is reporting}<hyperlink=""http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/""> that the LAPD said that this shooting was warranted.

In the wake of Brown’s tragic death, this LA shooting has left many wondering, what is going on in our world? Why do we have to fight everyday to prove that there’s value in Black lives? The deaths are a devastating slap to the face, alerting us to the realities of what we’re living through.

Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable President, Earl Ofari Hutchinson said, “The killing of Ezell Ford — coming on the heels of the Michael Brown killing in Ferguson, Missouri — again raises the issue and problem of tense police-community relations. This is the sole reason we have called for a meeting … to get all the facts in the shooting and for assurances that the shooting will be subject to the most rigorous review to determine if there was any wrongdoing in Ford’s death.”

We don’t know all the details of events leading up to Ford’s death, but there’s no denying wrongdoing if he was indeed lying down and complying at the time of his death.

HelloBeautiful,hello2,https://hellobeautiful.com/2739238/prentice-powell-performs-poem-being-a-black-man-in-america/,MUST WATCH: ‘Verses And Flow’ Poet Prentice Powell’s Mic-Dropping Piece On Being A Black Man In America,Ionen J. Williams,08/18/2014,12/25/2016,"The fourth season of TV One’s “Verses And Flow” premieres tonight (August 16) and the program is sure to leave you snapping from your living room!  Presented by Lexus and hosted by Laz Alonso, each 30-minute episode features star-studded musical guests and spoken word performances from some of the most profound poets around.

HelloBeautiful caught up with one such artist, {Prentice Powell}<hyperlink=""http://prentice.maxmobileapps.com/"">, a Oakland, California native who has had the distinct honor of being the only poet to {grace the “Verses And Flow” stage}<hyperlink=""https://theurbandaily.com/2618124/anthonyhamiltononversesflow/?_ga=1.148583474.441115514.1482721996""> every year since the show’s inception. You may have also seen the 2013 NAACP Image Award Nominee on the {“Arsenio Hall Show,”}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2709003/yeezys-in-the-house-kanye-west-makes-surprise-appearance-on-the-arsenio-hall-show/""> touring with {singer Jill Scott}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2732182/jill-scott-cries-essence-music-festival-2014/""> or performing at your nearest slam with his {spoken word poetry collective, Fiveology}<hyperlink=""http://wearefiveology.com/"">, a group of five talented, passionate, and internationally recognized artists. And if you haven’t seen him perform yet, whew, you’re in for a treat! This season of “Verses And Flow,” is unlike any other, he says.

“It was a really really different experience this season for me,” Powell tells us. “Usually I’ve had the opportunity to perform individually but I was blessed by Lexus ‘Verses And Flow’ and asked to be back to be a part of an organization called IconMan which is all about highlighting Black men in general. They highlight your local mailman, your coach who coaches the local basketball team in his free time, Harry Belafonte and other prominent Black men.

So what I was asked to do by ‘Verses And Flow’ is to write and introductory piece for the season. [It] was really different because usually they know your poems, they look and see what they like and you do your own poems, but I was asked to write something specifically for this season. Not only to do that, but to write for four other people as well. So I was able to share the stage with Lance Reddick, Aldis Hodge, Wesley Jonathan and Jay Ellis…it was really wonderful. It was a great experience to get up there and perform with other people who were doing my work — a completely new experience for me.”

Now, he didn’t want to spoil that group performance since it will open tonight’s seasons premiere, but Powell did give us a taste of a poem that he recorded that didn’t make it on the show–and if this is what was left on the cutting room floor, we can’t wait to see more. The piece (in the video above) expresses the poet’s thoughts on what it means to be a Black man in America, a particularly potent narrative and perspective in the wake of {Michael Brown’s death by police}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2739078/darren-wilson-officer-who-killed-michael-brown-ferguson/""> and {the current aftermath in Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/playlist/ferguson-missouri-protest-photos/item/2738869/""> that has shaken the nation.

In addition to Powell, more than 25 other mic-dropping poets will appear on this year’s eight-episode season of “Verses And Flow” that will also feature the soulful sounds of artists including {Maxwell}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2637614/press-play-alicia-keys-maxwell-release-steamy-new-video-fire-we-make/"">, {K.

HelloBeautiful,hello3,https://hellobeautiful.com/2739473/who-is-darren-wilson/,Who Is Darren Wilson? What We Know About Michael Brown’s Killer,Danielle Young,08/18/2014,12/25/2016,"{Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2014/08/15/darren-wilson-officer-who-killed-michael-brown-ferguson/""> was named as the officer who shot and killed 18-year-old unarmed teen, {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2014/08/18/autopsy-shows-michael-brown-was-shot-at-least-six-times-media-releases-photos-of-killer-darren-wilson-reports/""> in Ferguson, Missouri. Since his name has been released to the public, the six-year police veteran has been a topic of many passionate conversations, most of them in dismay of the overzealous officer.

The son of a mother with an extensive criminal past (serial con artist/fraud), Wilson decided against his criminally-saturated upbringing to become a police officer. That decision would be the one that changed the course of his entire life. Now under severe scrutiny (mostly by Mike Brown supporters than actual authorities), Wilson will hopefully be facing murder charges for the death of Mike Brown.

There’s not much that we know about Officer Wilson, but here’s a few facts we’ve been able to gather:

1. He Lives In A Predominantly White Neighborhood

Ferguson, Missouri is a predominantly Black city, despite the racial controversy that’s currently surrounding it after Mike Brown’s death. 64.9 percent of Ferguson’s population is Black. The town Wilson lives in, Crestwood is a shocking 1.3 percent Black. I’m not implying that Wilson is prejudiced, but he does prefer to live a full town over from where he works, most likely because it’s less Black people.

2. He’s An Award-Winning Officer

Six months before shooting Brown, Wilson received a commendation for his “extraordinary effort in the line of duty.” {This image shows Wilson shaking hands and receiving the commendation from Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson}<hyperlink=""http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/.vn8my5Qk_3A.wcMc6wurA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NQ--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/news/2014-08-16/7d8c0020-2561-11e4-a310-2daa976de53c_wilsoncommendation1.jpg"">. In the second photo, Wilson smiles as he returns to his seat with his honor.

3. {He Fled Town Days After Murdering Mike Brown}<hyperlink=""http://colorlines.com/archives/2014/08/ferguson_officer_darren_wilson_fled_town_days_ago.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+racewireblog+%28Colorlines.com%29&utm_content=Netvibes"">

USA Today reporters visited Wilson’s home in Crestwood and an officer stationed out front of his home told them that “Wilson and his family left days ago.” So far, there have been no charges placed against Wilson, therefore, he’s free to leave town. And this is a special case in that Wilson needs protection from the angry public, so the authorities are taking proper precaution. We hope they’re keeping him safe so that he can be brought to trial.

4. Allegedly, Wilson Has A Violent History As An Officer

CNN’s Don Lemon visited Ferguson last week and {spoke with a young woman who claimed to have had a violent encounter with Officer Wilson}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgM7ZspHgeQ"">. The woman alleges that Wilson mistreated her, maced her and threatened her with an arrest. “I looked at his nametag and I was telling myself that I’d never forget who he was and what he did to me,” she explains. When she saw his name in the news this morning, the young woman says she knew exactly who Darren Wilson was.

5. He’s Got Overwhelming Support

Over 100 people rallied in support of Officer Wilson and there’s even a Facebook page up in his honor that was created over the weekend. In just over 24 hours, it has grown to more than 14K likes! At the rally, people carried posters saying, “Support out police! Pray for peace” and buckets were pass around to collect donations for Wilson and his family toward legal fees and any other “financial needs” they may have. This fundraiser is in addition to a GoFundMe.org campaign supporters have started. {It’s being reported}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/photos-ferguson-officer-darren-wilson-received-police-award-earlier-this-year-021255893.html?clear=cache""> that Wilson has been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the multiple investigations of the shooting.",NA,NA,NA,NA

To date, police have not released an image of Wilson who {reportedly “left town days ago”}<hyperlink=""https://newsone.com/3045470/officer-darren-wilson-photo-of-mike-browns-killer-surfaces/""> with family, but social media images of the officer responsible Brown’s death have also been shared with the public.

Yahoo News reports Wilson, 28, received an award for “extraordinary effort in the line of duty” months before he gunned down unarmed teenager Mike Brown and left him in the street for four hours.

“Very proud of my son, Darren Wilson on his receiving a Commendation from his Police Department,” John Wilson wrote on Facebook, February 11, in a caption that was shared with one of two released pictures of the officer. The image shows Darren Wilson smiling with the honor. In a second photo the officer is seen shaking the hand of Ferguson Police Chief Jackson at the same event, earlier this year. Yahoo says they have “confirmed the award through the February 11 {Ferguson City Council meeting minutes}<hyperlink=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/236968228/Ferguson-City-Council-Meeting-Minutes""> and photos Wilson’s father posted to his Facebook page.”

{NBC News has reported they’ve also verified the two Facebook pictures}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/revealed-first-photos-cop-who-shot-michael-brown-emerge-n182516""> of Wilson. “The obvious question that it raises is why did it take so long to get that picture out there?” {Steve Kornacki said}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/up-w-steve-kornacki/watch/photo-of-officer-darren-wilson-identified-318903363538"">, during a broadcast that too released the police officer’s images. During his report, the political writer and NBC television noted that the Ferguson Police Department has not returned calls for comment on the pictures.

But last week, amid protests and calls for answers about the shooting, Ferguson Police Chief Jackson did have other information to release to the public.

Shortly after confirming Wilson killed Brown, the police chief released a convenience store surveillance video of the slain teenager alleging that Brown was suspected of taking a box of cigars in the store earlier in the day before his death. Police Chief Jackson initially told reporters his officer confronted, and eventually shot, the teen after he had been identified as a suspect in the alleged robbery. Hours later, authorities said the robbery was unrelated to the confrontation and Jackson {held a second press conference informing reporters}<hyperlink=""https://newsone.com/3045219/ferguson-police-chief-admits-mike-brown-shooting-not-related-to-robbery/""> that Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson were in fact stopped, “because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.” When the police chief was asked by reporters why his department chose to release the robbery tape if it was unrelated to the shooting, he replied that he had to because “the media asked for it.”

Despite Ferguson Police’s timing on releasing details about Michael Brown’s shooting, even more details about the events leading up to his death are being made public. According to {NewsOne.com}<hyperlink=""https://newsone.com/3045642/ferguson-autopsy-shows-michael-brown-was-struck-at-least-6-times/"">:

A preliminary autopsy of Michael Brown — performed Sunday by Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York — found that the unarmed teenager was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

“People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day 1,” Baden told The New York Times after performing the autopsy. “They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.”

According to Baden, who performed the autopsy at the Brown family’s request, although Michael was shot at least six times, only three bullets were recovered from his body. In a diagram of the entry wounds, he noted that the six shots produced numerous wounds with some of the bullets entering and exiting several times, including one that left at least five different wounds.

Holder Jr. {said Sunday that the Justice Department would conduct its own autopsy}<hyperlink=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/politics/independent-michael-brown-autopsy-planned-by-obama-administration.html"">, in addition to the one performed by local officials and this private one because, a department spokesman said, of ‘the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family.’”

HelloBeautiful,hello6,https://hellobeautiful.com/2739559/actor-jesse-williams-talks-michael-brown-cnn-twitter/,Jesse Williams Was Criticized For Wearing A Hoodie On CNN And A Fan Turned It Into An Incredible Teachable Moment,Ionen J. Williams,08/19/2014,01/08/2017,"Jesse Williams is one of few entertainers lending their voice to speak about Michael Brown’s shooting by police and the aftermath of the teen’s brutal killing, in Ferguson, Missouri. But the “Grey’s Anatomy” star has been using his Hollywood platform — and seven year’s experience as a public school educator before ever hitting your TV screen — to school America, {as he’s done in the past}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2704123/jesse-williams-jordan-davis-michael-dunn-trial/"">.

The actor wore a hoodie for {an appearance  appeared on CNN}<hyperlink=""https://newsone.com/3045626/jesse-williams-mike-brown-ferguson/?_ga=1.78336401.441115514.1482721996""> to discuss Michael Brown’s death and the events in Ferguson, but after all the amazing things he said, some could only focus on his attire. When the actor addressed one critic who said the hoodie made it  hard to take him seriously, one Twitter follower stepped in and taught the most amazing lesson!

It all started with Williams’ on-air appearance where he made powerful statements about media coverage and criticisms of Brown,  {who was brutally shot six times by Ferguson Police officer Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2739441/autopsy-shows-michael-brown-was-shot-at-least-six-times-media-releases-photos-of-killer-darren-wilson-reports/"">:

“We need journalism to kick in and start reporting the story from the beginning,” Williams said on the Sunday broadcast. “This is about finding justice for a kid that was shot. An 18-year-old  that was shot. Period. And this idea that because he stole a handful of cheap cigars, that were what, five bucks from a convenient store? I lived in the white suburbs of this country for a long time, I know plenty of white kids that steal stuff from the convenient store.

This idea that every time a Black person does something, they automatically become a ‘thug worthy of their own death?’ We don’t own drug crimes. We’re not the only ones that ‘sell and do drugs all the time,’ we’re not the only ones who steal, we’re not the only ones who talk crazy to cops. There’s a complete double standard and a complete different experience that a certain element of this country has the privilege of being treated as human beings. And the rest of us are not being treated like human beings. Period. And that needs to be discussed, that is the story…we’re not making this up.”

Now even though the fine actor and former teacher had already given America this much-needed “mic-drop” moment on national TV, he continued the discussion on {his personal Twitter handle}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/iJesseWilliams"">  where Tweeter “Lost In Paradise,”  {slid into his mentions}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/Aroww333/status/501045914694217729""> without raising his hand:

{@iJesseWilliams}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/iJesseWilliams""> A hoodie on the news makes it challenging to take you seriously.

Of course, the focus on the hoodie missed the entire point. Though Williams’ statement — even with the clothing choice — did not go unnoticed by many who watched him speak. The actor himself quickly brushed off the criticism before returning to the discussion at hand:

.{@Aroww333}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/Aroww333""> You’re not even wearing a shirt, which makes this exchange challenging. — jesseWilliams. (@iJesseWilliams) {August 17, 2014}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/iJesseWilliams/statuses/501051927132516352"">

Williams’ response got nearly 400 retweets and the critics’ Twitter mentions were quickly in shambles as some onlookers labeled him “racist.” The ordeal left the Tweeter stunned:

Hoodie = Thug?! How about hoodie on the national news = unprofessional {#NotEveryoneIsARacist}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NotEveryoneIsARacist?src=hash""> {#GetOverYourself}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GetOverYourself?src=hash""> — Lost in Paradise (@Aroww333) {August 17, 2014}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/Aroww333/statuses/501083680429711362"">

By this time the actor had moved on to Tweet to nearly  700,000 of his actual followers who were focused on the his insightful commentary, but one of his followers wasn’t going to let the hoodie diss go so easily…

Knowledge gets you further than anger….had I just met him with the aggression everyone else did, there’s no change. How many lives can he affect? We have to realize that not everyone that doesn’t look like us, speaks out of hate. Sometimes they genuinely just have no clue.”

This conversation is a true testament to the power of words, shared experiences, and yes, even social media! Jesse Williams used his TV access, his follower used Twitter and we can ALL use the different tools and platforms we have available to us, along with our unique perspectives, to shine light!

HelloBeautiful,hello7,https://hellobeautiful.com/2739569/missouri-governor-orders-national-guard-to-ferguson/,Missouri Governor Orders National Guard To Ferguson,Danielle Young,08/18/2014,01/09/2017,"Missouri governor, {Jay Nixon}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2739349/missouri-governor-declares-state-of-emergency-in-ferguson/""> has ordered the National Guard to Ferguson, Missouri.

Nixon has already declared a {state of emergency in Ferguson}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2739349/missouri-governor-declares-state-of-emergency-in-ferguson/"">, MO due to the reactions of {Officer Darren Wilson’s}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2739473/who-is-darren-wilson/""> name being revealed as the man responsible for fatally shooting unarmed teen, {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2739473/who-is-darren-wilson/"">. “We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching,” the governor said during a press conference on Saturday. “We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.” And the governor is taking his own warning seriously because he’s called for backup with the National Guard {without even giving the powers that be at the White House any heads up}<hyperlink=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/white-house-did-not-know-national-guard-was-being-deployed-i?utm_term=.aa6rXlbrPJ#.gvy6WaE6gN"">.

Nixon said the National Guard would help “in restoring peace and order” to Ferguson, where protests over the killing of Mike Brown have entered their second week. Police claimed to have been reacting to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails at them. Many police clad in military gear defended themselves (allegedly) with tear gas, rubber bullets and sonic blasts meant to handicap an attacker.

“These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served and to feel safe in their own homes,” Nixon said in a statement.

The people of Ferguson and Mike Brown supporters are outraged not only by the releasing of Officer Darren Wilson’s name, but the {leaked image of Brown’s autopsy obtained by The New York Times}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2739441/autopsy-shows-michael-brown-was-shot-at-least-six-times-media-releases-photos-of-killer-darren-wilson-reports/""> detailed that Brown was shot at least six times and many of those were defensive wounds, which held up the claims that Brown had been shot while his hands were up, pleading with Wilson not to shoot.

Within the state of emergency that was declared over the weekend, Ferguson erupted in officer versus protester battles three hours before curfew. Officers in riot gear ordered all the protesters to disperse, and many did, but about 100 stood about two blocks away until getting hit by more tear gas. {It’s being reported}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/ferguson-national-guard_n_5687945.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&ir=Black+Voices""> that protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the street in an attempt to block police vehicles, which the police easily plowed through. Someone set a trash bin on fire, and the crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away. It’s even being reported that two people were shot by civilians.

Here’s hoping the National Guard will be the muscle Ferguson needs to end the violence. The Ferguson authorities have tried other tactics to quiet down the rowdy protesters–they have had a curfew implemented, they have appointed a friendlier face as the authority on the streets–{Capt. Ron Johnson}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/ferguson-national-guard_n_5687945.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&ir=Black+Voices"">, the Black highway patrol captain who has taken charge of Ferguson’s security in this matter, but maybe the National Guard can help quiet things down.

Although, I am not personally convinced. {This disturbing image}<hyperlink=""http://s11.photobucket.com/user/nick_dagan/media/newark_plainfield_riot_1967.jpg.html""> is what happened when the National Guard was called in to Newark, NJ after two white Newark policemen, John DeSimone and Vito Pontrelli arrested a Black cabdriver, John Weerd Smith, for improperly passing them. Smith was taken to the 4th Police Precinct, which was across the street from Hayes Homes, a large public housing project. Residents of Hayes Homes saw an incapacitated Smith being dragged into the precinct, and a rumor was started that he had been killed while in police custody. Outraged crowds, similar to those in Ferguson began to destroy public and private property and confronted and attacked the police. In turn there were a few men who were shot dead by police. The National Guard came in and seemingly did more violent hard than they did good.

Do you think Governor Nixon’s move to involve the National Guard was warranted?",NA,NA,NA,NA
HelloBeautiful,hello8,https://hellobeautiful.com/2739327/nelly-t-i-think-ferguson-protestors-jumped-the-gun/,UPDATE: St. Louis Rapper Nelly Visits Ferguson Protesters & T.I. Thinks America ‘Created A Monster’,Sonya Eskridge,08/16/2014,01/09/2017,"UPDATE: After many fans called out Nelly for not visiting Ferguson, an area near his St. Louis hometown, the rapper finally took a visit to speak with protesters. Check out a video clip from his time there.

Nelly did speak to protesters after marching with them, but urged them to not destroy “our neighborhoods and starting choosing better options.” “We gotta understand that we got options and stop choosing the reaction option,” {he said to the crowd}<hyperlink=""http://xonecole.com/2014/08/video-nelly-visits-ferguson-urges-protestors-to-stay-calm/#more-281502"">. “That’s it. At the end of the day we’re gonna pay. Our brothas are the ones that’s gonna be in jail.”

T.I. also expounded on his point about the protests, posting {a message on Instagram that some agree with.}<hyperlink=""https://hellobeautiful.com/2739932/k-michelle-elle-varner-beef/"">

Original 08/16/14

Nelly believes rioters in Ferguson, Missouri, should have waited a little longer before taking the streets in anger over Michael Brown’s shooting.

People have been storming the streets ever since the unarmed teen was gunned down by a police officer while walking with a friend on August 9. In the week that has passed since his shooting death, Ferguson has begun to resemble a war zone. {NBC News}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-brown-killing-police-ferguson-fire-tear-gas-amid-looting-n182196""> reports that police have even fired tear gas as looters ransack local businesses in hurt and extreme aggravation.

The St. Louis native sees the behavior as a poorly thought out reaction to Michael’s death because he doesn’t see how it will effect positive change. “I understand the frustration, but we have to strategize before we overreact,” he told {TMZ.com}<hyperlink=""http://www.tmz.com/2014/08/16/nelly-st-louis-riots-michael-brown-shooting-death-protesters/"">. “We don’t get no do-over on sh*t like this, so we have to do it right the first time.”

In Nelly’s opinion, Michael’s death, although tragic, is not out of the ordinary for how police have treated black people in Missouri for year. The “Hot In Herre” expressed that he thinks the aftermath of this heartbreaking incident was a huge opportunity for the black community to come up with an effective plan to demand more civil treatment from authorities.

“Ain’t nothing happen no different that hasn’t been happening,” said Nelly. “At the end of the day, we should have waited to strategize first and take all the right steps to organize.”

Atlanta rapper T.I. echoed his opinion that people in Ferguson reacted too quickly in a time where they should have waited to see how the police would handle Michael’s killing.”We needed to play chess instead of checkers,” said T.I. “We should have waited to see if justice was going to be served first … We shouldn’t have played our strongest hand first.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

In an exclusive interview for NewsOne by reporter {Brittany Noble}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/account/suspended"">, McSpadden said it wasn’t the police who notified her that her son had been killed but bystanders.

“They didn’t let me identify him or anything,” she said. “It was some girls down there that had recorded the whole thing, took pictures, and she showed my a picture on her phone. She said ‘ain’t this your son’ and I just bawled even harder…just to see my son laying there like this for no apparent reason.”",NA,NA,NA,NA
