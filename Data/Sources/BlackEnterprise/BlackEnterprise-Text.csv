The iconic {Builder Levy}<hyperlink=""http://www.builderlevy.com/bio.html""> photograph captured during the 1968 wildcat sanitation strike in Memphis, Tennessee, the year Martin Luther King Jr. was killed. A few days ago, people found a second photograph far too similar.

Michael Brown, 18, was walking in his grandmother’s neighborhood in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 9 when he was fatally shot by a police officer. A crowd gathered around the site, as did a flock of police cars. The militarized police response to the protests that followed set armored vehicles, tear gas, and rubber bullets against civilians.

For many, the scene in Ferguson looks like something out of the 1960s. Internet users across the country soon began uploading photos of the police response to civil rights protests and photos from Ferguson and comparing them side by side. The similarities are striking, as are the questions they raise.

Brown,08/18/14,07/06/16,"“The LGBT community cannot be silent at this moment.” That is sentiment of 17 LGBT organizations who issued an open letter in support of Michael Brown’s family, decrying the police violence faced by people of color across the country. The letter describes why it is important for LGBT people and organizations to speak out on issues of injustice and to stand by protestors and the family of the unarmed African American teen, who witnesses say had his hands up in the air when he was shot multiple times and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri.

The {Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD)}<hyperlink=""http://www.glaad.org/""> has called on its followers to continue to stand against violence and victimization by those in authority and has identified ways in which they can do so. Among those actions is to sign the {petition by Color of Change}<hyperlink=""http://http//act.colorofchange.org/sign/mike_brown/?source=coc_website""> calling on federal and city officials to rigorously investigate, prosecute, and fire all officers involved in Brown’s shooting and cover up. The signatures will be added to a letter sent to the US Department of Justice and local Ferguson law enforcement officials. GLAAD further urged its followers to speak out in solidarity against racial profiling and brutality.

GLAAD previously had encouraged members to join in the National Moment of Silence Vigils held last week in cities across the country to honor victims of police brutality, including Brown and to tweet with the hashtag #NMOS14 (started by {@FeministaJones}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/FeministaJones"">).

The following is taken from the open letter signed by GLAAD and other LGBT advocates:

When communities experience fear, harassment and brutality simply because of who they are or how they look, we are failing as a nation. In light of the recent events in Missouri, it is clearer than ever that there is something profoundly wrong in our country.

The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community cannot be silent at this moment, because LGBT people come from all races, creeds, faiths and backgrounds, and because all movements of equality are deeply connected. We are all part of the fabric of this nation and the promise of liberty and justice for all is yet to be fulfilled.

The LGBT community stands with the family of Michael Brown, who was gunned down in Ferguson, Missouri. We stand with the mothers and fathers of young Black men and women who fear for the safety of their children each time they leave their homes. We call on the national and local media to be responsible and steadfast in their coverage of this story and others like it–racialized killings that have marred this nation since the beginning of its history. We call on policy makers on all levels of American government not to shrink from action, and we are deeply grateful to Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice for their immediate commitment to a thorough investigation.

At this moment, we are inspired by the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies … but the silence of our friends.”

We need more white cops who are anti-Zog and willing to put Jewish controlled black thugs in their place,” the Klan wrote to the Southern Poverty Law Center in an email. “Most cops are cowards and do nothing while 90% of interracial crime is black (and non-white) on white. We are setting up a reward/fund for the police officer who shot this.”

As Ferguson police released Wilson’s identity, publicly last Friday, they also suggested that Brown was named as a {primary suspect in an alleged robbery}<hyperlink=""http://www.blackenterprise.com/lifestyle/the-10-most-heartbreaking-ifiwasgunneddown-tweets-you-should-see/""> at a local convenience store near where teen was shot a few minutes later. Hours after documents came out labeling the 18-year-old as the “primary suspect” in the store theft, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told reporters the “robbery does not relate to the initial contact between the officer and Michael Brown.”

“Michael Brown was nothing more than a punk,” writes the Ku Klux Klan in a recent blog entry. “The media and others are painting him out to be a ‘good son’ and ‘great kid.’ The blacks of Missouri are showing their love of him by rioting, attacking and shooting people. Nothing new.”

Similar to other national tragedies, celebrities have been chided for their lack of discussion on the issue and for missing the opportunity to use their platform to speak out. But a few celebrities are proving to be an exception to the trend, and they’re using their talent and voice to bring attention to Brown’s tragic death.

Take a look at celebrities who’ve released songs, done interviews, and even traveled to Ferguson in support of bringing justice to the Brown family.

J. Cole

Known to speak out against social issues and racial injustices in his music, rapper J.Cole channeled his raw emotions about Michael Brown and the situation in Ferguson, Missouri in a newly-released song titled, {“Be Free.”}<hyperlink=""https://soundcloud.com/dreamvillerecords/j-cole-be-free"">

Changing the cover art from a picture of Michael Brown’s body,  to a picture of his mother out of respect for the family, Cole attaches a message to the artwork saying, “Rest in peace to Michael Brown and to every young black man murdered in America, whether by the hands of white or black. I pray that one day the world will be filled with peace and rid of injustice. Only then will we all Be Free.”

In the song, Cole delivers a powerful chorus with the lyrics, “All we wanna do is break the chains off/All we wanna do is be free.”

In addition to releasing a song, the rapper also traveled to Ferguson to pay his respects to Brown.

Keke Palmer

In the aftermath of Michael Brown’s death, young television host, entertainer, and entrepreneur Keke Palmer is proving that she’s more than a celebrity who just uses social media to speak out. Stepping from behind her online profile to go out to Ferguson herself and be amongst protesters, Palmer revealed that tear gas was thrown at her, while her mom was shot in the neck with pellets.

Palmer has dedicated several tweets and Instagram videos to speaking about the situation and has received mixed reactions in response to her opinion. Nonetheless, her decision to get out and protest is a testament to backing her talk up with action.

Jesse Williams

Actor Jesse Williams took his thoughts about the Michael Brown case beyond social media and to {CNN,}<hyperlink=""http://newsone.com/3045626/jesse-williams-mike-brown-ferguson/""> where he gave a blunt interview about the media’s assassination of Brown’s character and the racism that we face today in America.

“I think we have to talk about the narrative and make sure we’re starting at the beginning. You will find that people doing the oppressing often want to start the narrative at a convenient point,” Williams said. “This started with a kid getting shot and killed and left in the street for four hours. I’ve never seen a white body left in the heat for four hours in the sweltering heat.”

Williams added, “I know plenty of white kids that steal stuff from convenience stores,” as he addressed the allegations that Brown was a suspect in a robbery earlier that day. “There is this idea that every time a black person does something they automatically become a thug worthy of their own death.”

Elle Varner

Showing her support for Ferguson and the Michael Brown case, singer Elle Varner has released a track titled, {“One Love,”}<hyperlink=""https://soundcloud.com/elleveezy/elle-varner-onelove""> where she delivers a message about bringing peace rather than violence to the world. On the track she sings, “Who’s to say that we can’t change, and give one love, one love to everyone, and who decides it’s not the time to give one love.”

Before releasing the track, Elle took her thoughts to Instagram saying, “Over the past few tumultuous days I have prayed long and hard for Mike Brown’s family, the people of Ferguson, and the families of many others we have lost due to this horrific death pattern. In addition I have been gathering research, speaking with activists, and developing a plan as to how we can stop this from continuing!”

Nelly

As a native of St. Louis, Nelly sympathizes with the residents from his hometown area who are feeling the effects of Mike Brown’s death and as a result, the rapper has pledged to start a scholarship fund in honor of the teen.

“I’ve been in contact with the family of Mike Brown, we started a Mike Brown Scholarship Fund in order to send kids to college because Mike did graduate from high school,” the rapper tells {Billboard.}<hyperlink=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6221770/nelly-talks-ferguson-setting-up-a-scholarship-in-michael-browns-name-we-need"">

Nelly also led a {“hands up, don’t shoot” protest}<hyperlink=""http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2014/08/nelly-chris-brown-trey-songz-wale-protest-michael-brown-shooting/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+xxlmag%2FASzE+%28XXL%29""> over the weekend at a celebrity charity event in honor of the teen.

David Banner

Mississippi-born rapper David Banner is no stranger to speaking out against the injustices of today.

Recently, Banner appeared on {CNN}<hyperlink=""http://hiphopwired.com/2014/08/13/david-banner-discusses-plight-black-children-cnn-video/""> to address the Michael Brown situation and to talk about the plight black youth face in America today.

“White cops do not see value in young black men,” Banner said. “And the reason why a lot of young, black men — not all black men — kill each other is because they don’t see any value either. So many people have bought into this Americanized system, and America historically has always tortured, killed, and enslaved black people. And I have not forgot that.”",0,153,Celebrities speak out in the death of unarmed teen,NA

Protesters from a variety of backgrounds came out to denounce what happened in Ferguson, Missouri, as President Barack Obama appealed for respect for the law and the right to peacefully protests. “It’s nationwide, whether it is Eric Gardner, Mike Brown, and we want it to stop,” says Jasson Perez, Black Youth Project 100, a protest organizer in Chicago.

In the past two weeks, BYP1000 reports that police officers have strangled, shot and killed four, unarmed black men. The activist member-based organization of African Americans 18-35 year olds issued in a statement that, “Regardless of education level, style of dress, romantic partner or circle of friends, black people in the United States are the targets of a system that supports merciless police officers, willing to spill our innards on street corners. They face no consequences in a ‘criminal injustice’ system. There is no recourse because black people, especially poor black people, are all too often seen as sub-human.”

BYP100 is using storytelling as a powerful tool and collective work for liberation. The group has launched the #criminalizedlives video campaign and is asking black people between the ages of 13 and 35 to submit one to three-minute videos describing how you have been profiled, abused or violated by the police. {Click to learn more and submit your video.}<hyperlink=""http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001w3slWkXICYu_5LO4GovpFxgnNBSPfN1rXu4OuZU-e0-fCeOuBo1PEmRQsklGf-hVjUN-YjLwoebsN6hdF4gYbh2HYBMjyeXeRJmbmJUJPt9zZx5eqgkCrnKVvQ2AOu_tSczWnazhUGpHxl_FswMsPkGX22LO4GFRPbIMsFiwznVynlAubTmjXmtEfZW7h47HMRrVLeKj1RdWL90b1UdoNeUVjm3YNuZmLblrkLH0CHY=&c=tj5oM_lji8Trh8KOGpsCodAtf8BhkG2C7VBebU2YroXegx16xQH54g==&ch=JZqSa9ZoOLnXsQNSpbpOthk1LhNJCJZDmGft9HaM4paMYA8FzSeD2g=="">

The mother of 17-year-old {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=""http://www.blackenterprise.com/lifestyle/two-reporters-arrested-and-detained-in-ferguson-mo/""> stood in front of the United Nations in Geneva, as the council reviewed America’s record on fighting racial discrimination.

“We should put our heads together to come up with a solution so our young people can stop dying and so they can have a future,” Fulton said. “I think far more needs to be done,” she said. The shooter in the Martin case, volunteer neighborhood watchman {George Zimmerman,}<hyperlink=""http://www.blackenterprise.com/news/george-zimmermans-celebrity-boxing-match-with-dmx-canceled/""> was controversially acquitted after claiming self-defense under Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law.

With African Americans making up 13% of the total U.S. population, it is startling to note that they total 50% of homicide victims, as pointed out by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. During the council’s two-day review of the United States, Fulton, along with Ron Davis ({father of slain teen, Jordan Davis}<hyperlink=""http://www.blackenterprise.com/news/civil-rights-group-calls-on-florida-to-retry-michael-dunn-and-to-repeal-stand-your-ground/"">) lamented that the proliferation of “Stand Your Ground” self-defense laws, currently in place in around half the states, has the community “feeling under siege.”

Davis said, “The message to minorities is either we’re going to load up and shoot you, or we’re going to incarcerate you.” It is required that all UN member states undergo this UN committee review, which has found America insisting that its country was a “vibrant, multi-racial, multi-ethnic, and multi-cultural democracy” {dedicated to fighting racial discrimination.}<hyperlink=""http://www.blackenterprise.com/lifestyle/the-15-most-influential-blacklifematters-tweets-you-should-see/"">

While Martin’s mother welcomed the dialogue, she has said that she’s “unconvinced” by the measures taken so far. “The bottom line is that more lives are still being taken,” she said. “Until you stop that, this is all just a shadow with no meaning.”
