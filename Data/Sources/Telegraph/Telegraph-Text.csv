The episode is likely to further enflame passions in Ferguson, which has seen nightly rioting, amid accusations that the police are out of control.
Locals said the second victim, believed to be in his 30s, was well-known for having a history of mental health problems.
Sam Dotson, St Louis Police Chief, said in a tweet that officers had responded to a call and found an apparently agitated man, armed with a knife who yelled, “Kill me now” before approaching the patrol.
He added: “Officers gave suspect verbal commands. Officers feared for their safety and both officers fired their weapons. Suspect is deceased.”
Some bystanders questioned whether the man was armed and said he was accused of stealing two bottles of soda.
An angry crowd grew quickly outside the convenience store where the latest victim died.
Some young men said they planned to burn it down and accused the police of being intent on murdering young black men.
“Why didn’t they use a Taser,” said Germaine Leroy. “What are they shooting for? I’ve been shot with a Taser so I know how it incapacitates.”
The case of Michael Brown, who was unarmed when he was shot dead, has polarised the nation. Night after night demonstrators have fought running battles with police who are struggling to maintain control.
The latest death leaves St Louis and its surrounding satellite cities facing another escalation.
Charlene Turner, who lives near the shop, said: “Everyone knew him. We’d see him all the time. Everyone knew he was mentally challenged.
“He went in that store all the time. They should not have shot him.”
Local councillors were rapidly on the scene trying to de-escalate tensions.
Antonio French, a regular site at protests in Ferguson only a few miles away, said he hoped to keep a lid on the growing fury.
“The thing that sparked anger in Ferguson is the lack of representation,” he said. “Here the representatives have arrived in minutes.
“The police chief is here.
“Yes, there’s anger but we are working to make sure it is not like Ferguson.”",NA,647,NA,NA
Telegraph,tele2,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11044348/Michael-Brown-tussled-with-police-seconds-before-fatal-shooting.html,Michael Brown 'tussled with police’ seconds before fatal shooting,Rob Crilly,08/19/14,02/15/16,"Police tussled with Michael Brown shortly before he was shot, according to a witness who videoed the immediate aftermath of a shooting that has set aflame a Missouri suburb and divided America.

The pictures show a body lying in the street as two officers pace back and forth in disbelief.

Piaget Crenshaw supplied her own commentary between sobs as she filmed on a mobile phone: “They killed him,” she said.

The killing of an unarmed black teenager by a white officer in Ferguson, a St Louis suburb, 10 days ago has reopened America’s long standing racial wounds.

Protesters have clashed night after night with police close to site where Brown, 18, died.

Early on Tuesday, protesters shot at police and threw rocks and firebombs. Police responded with tear gas to disperse the crowd, and arrested 31 people. Two people suffered gunshot wounds from bullets that police said must have been fired by protesters.

Barack Obama ordered the attorney-general to go to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet federal officials investigating the case and the national guard have been deployed, the first time they have responded to civil unrest since the 1992 Los Angeles Riots.

Mrs Crenshaw said she waited to release her video until police had identified the officer involved. Her description of what happened in the seconds leading up to Brown death could yet prove explosive.

“From it all initially happening, I knew this was not right,” she told CNN, the channel that released the footage.

“I knew the police shouldn’t have even been chasing this young boy and firing at the same time, and the fact that he got shot in his face, it was something that clicked in me, like, somebody else needs to see this.”

She described a tussle between Brown and an officer later identified as Darren Wilson. When Brown, the bigger man, slipped his grasp the officer gave chase.

The first shot grazed Brown’s arm. When he turned, he was hit repeatedly, she said.

The police account claims that Brown reached for the officer’s gun but Mrs Crenshaw said she could not tell one way or another.

Whatever the exact chain of events, the episode has proved a sobering reminder that, despite electing a black president, racial tensions remain high in American society.

An opinion poll conducted by the Pew Research Centre, shows that attitudes to the case have polarised along race lines. While almost two-thirds of African-Americans believe the police response has been heavy handed, only a third of whites think it has gone too far.
Monday night brought another tense stand-off and bouts of violence.

Police tried a new tactic – their fourth in little more than a week – lifting a curfew and instead mounting a massive show of force with five armoured vehicles and riot squads formed into ranks.

They allowed the bulk of the 2000 protesters to march up and down the pavements of West Florissant Street, the epicentre of the trouble, but arrested anyone who strayed into the street or lingered in one place, including at least four journalists.

The day resembled a carnival as roses were handed out. Nelly, the St Louis-born rapper, visited the site, wearing a T-shirt with the logo #MikeBrown.

As darkness fell, a small number of protesters confronted police. March organisers pleaded with them to turn away but could not prevent three or four water bottles being hurled at the blockade.

Officers responded with snatch squads, racing forward before pinning suspects to the ground at gunpoint. The police retreated in seconds.
Antonio French, a local councillor who has helped ease tension all week, said: “This seems a better approach, to come out and arrest a few individuals rather than targeting the whole crowd.”
Then things turned ugly. Gunshots sounded from the QuikTrip convenience store where a hard core of protesters – some from Chicago – had gathered.
A low-rider car raced up the street carrying a man who had been shot in the arm.
Police responded to the unrest with volleys of tear gas and smoke bombs.
They later said they had come under heavy fire and four officers were wounded but that they head fired no shots themselves.
Capt Ron Johnson, who is in charge of the operation, urged protesters to make their point during daylight, stating: “There is a dangerous dynamic in the night. It allows a small number of violent agitators to hide in the crowd and then attempt to create chaos.”
Police also arrested protesters in nearby St Louis, including a 90-year-old Holocaust survivor.
Hedy Epstein fled Nazi Germany in 1939 on the Kindertransport, when thousands of children were brought to the UK for safety.
“I’ve been doing this since I was a teenager. I didn’t think I would have to do it when I was 90,” she told The Nation as she was escorted to a police van. “We need to stand up today so that people won’t have to do this when they're 90.”
Meanwhile, in New York a prosecutor said on Tuesday he would ask a grand jury to consider charges in the death of a black man placed in an apparent chokehold by a white police officer.
Daniel Donovan, Staten Island district attorney announced an extra grand jury will be asked to hear evidence next month in the July 17 death of Eric Garner.
Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, could be heard on an amateur video shouting “I can’t breathe!” as Daniel Pantaleo, a police officer, placed him in an apparent chokehold. Police said the officers were arresting Garner on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes.",NA,131,NA,NA

Telegraph,tele4,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/11042644/Taylor-Swifts-new-single-Shake-It-Off-shakes-up-pop-music.html,Taylor Swift's new single Shake It Off shakes up pop music,Alice Vincent,08/19/14,02/15/16,"Taylor Swift has officially broken away from her country singer image with the announcement of her ""first documented, official pop album"", 1989, due to be released on 27 October.
The singer spoke about her fifth studio album during an event that was live-streamed worldwide on Monday.
The 24-year-old also premiered the first single, Shake It Off, from the forthcoming album, 1989 - the year of her birth. A catchy, upbeat track, the single carries a message of Swift literally shaking off criticism to embrace her true self.
In sentiment, Shake It Off is not far removed from her other hits, such as Mean or We Are Never Getting Back Together that made her an award-winning, chart-topping star: celebrate your differences and your individuality, ignore the ""haters"".
Shake It Off could also be seen as a natural progression from Swift's previous album, Red, which blend her nu-Country sound with pop, rock and electronic music references. It was nominated for two Grammy awards and her greatest commercial success so far, selling 8 million copies and topping international charts.
However, the song has received criticism overnight both musically and politically. The video for Shake It Off, which includes Swift crawling through a tunnel of women twerking, black breakdancers and hip-hop signifiers {has been labelled ""ill-timed""}<hyperlink=""http://www.hitfix.com/immaculate-noise/taylor-swifts-new-video-shake-it-off-features-twerking-ballet-haters""> and {""cringe-worthy""}<hyperlink=""http://jezebel.com/taylor-swifts-new-video-is-a-cringe-worthy-mess-1623539249""> for being released by Swift in the midst of the riots in Ferguson, Missouri and the resulting discussion of race relations happening in America at the moment.
Musician and rapper Earl Sweatshirt damned Swift on Twitter, saying her video was {""inherently offensive and ultimately harmful""}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/earlxsweat/statuses/501561180691767296""> and {""perpetuat[ed] black stereotypes to the same demographic of white girls who hide their prejudice by proclaiming their love of the culture""}<hyperlink=https://twitter.com/earlxsweat/statuses/501562177698803713"">.
Musically, Swift's move into pop has been called {""non-descript""}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/18/taylor-swift-s-shake-it-off-is-disappointing.html""> , with The Daily Beast's critic Kevin Fallon writing: ""If Swift didn’t announce the single herself, there’d be no indication that it’s her voice on the track, or that she had anything to do with its development"".
Shake It Off is infectiously catchy and has been produced with Swift's previous collaborators Max Martin and Shellback - responsible for I Knew You Were Trouble and We Are Never Getting Back Together, two of her biggest hits.
Swift said on Monday that the song was heavily inspired by late Eighties pop and the ""bright colors, bold chances [and] rebellion"" that accompany it.
Miley Cyrus, whose lyrics Swift references in Shake It Off, and Lily Allen experienced similar race-related criticism for their releases We Can't Stop and Hard Out Here in 2013, notably because of the use of black, provocatively dancing women in their music videos.
Swift's attitude suggests she won't be affected, however. On Monday she said: ""I've had to learn a pretty tough lesson in the last couple of years: People can say what they want about us, at any time ... and we cannot control that.
""I figure we have two options: We can let it change you ... option two is you just shake it off.",NA,770,NA,NA

The wounded were hit by gunfire from demonstrators, said Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol early on Tuesday. Police did not fire a single shot during the unrest. 

The condition of the two people wounded by gunfire was not immediately known. 

Four police officers were injured by thrown objects, with police firing tear gas at demonstrators as a last resort to disperse the crowd, Johnson said. 

Some of the protesters in the crowd of about 200 came from as far away as New York and California, he added. 
The latest night of unrest in the small MIssouri town, which has a largely black population but predominantly white police force, follows the revelation that 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot six times and may have been killed as he tried to surrender to police. 
Brown's head was in a downward position when the fatal shot was fired, according to the autopsy, indicating he may have been trying to surrender at the time. There was no gunshot residue found on Brown's body, suggesting the shots were not fired at close range, although Brown's clothing had not yet been analysed. 

The officer who fired the shots, 28-year-old Darren WIlson, claims that he was engaged in a struggle with Brown after the teenager attemped to take his gun. Wilson is now on paid leave and could face criminal charges. 

The clashes between riot police and protestors on Monday night occurred after hours of largely peaceful demonstrations. On Sunday, police had adopted new tactics in an attempt to control the violent protests, ditching a midnight curfew and instead trying to prevent crowds assembling by ordering people to keep moving at all times. 

The national guard, deployed earlier in the day, stayed off the streets. Instead they guarded a police control centre in a nearby car park which had come under threat a night earlier. 

The evening was largely peaceful but violence flared again after dark, with police responding to gunfire from protestors. 

Eric Holder, the American attorney general is due in Ferguson on Wednesday where he is expected to meet officials conducting a federal investigation into the shooting of Brown on August 9. 

Meanwhile Barack Obama called for a peaceful resolution to the demonstrations.

The condition of the two people wounded by gunfire was not immediately known, Johnson said. 

He added that some of the protesters in the crowd of about 200 came from as far away as New York and California. 

Speaking to press, Johnson said: ""Anyone who has been at these protests understand that there is a dangerous dynamic in the night. 

""It allows a small number of violent agitators to hide in the crowd and cause chaos."" 

Johnson also criticised the role of the media during the protests, accusing them of ""glamourising the acts of criminals."" 

Looking visibly upset, Johnson concluded: ""I'm not going to let the criminals define this neighbourhood and define what we're going to do to make it right.""

Officers adopted new tactics, ditching a midnight curfew and instead tried to prevent crowds assembling by ordering people to keep moving at all times.

The national guard, deployed earlier in the day, stayed off the streets. Instead they guarded a police control centre in a nearby car park which had come under threat a night earlier. 

Unofficial marshals did their best to comply with police instructions but could not prevent a small hard core engaging in a tense stand-off with officers, defused with a barrage of tear gas and a handful of arrests. 

Antonio French, an alderman who has help calm anger all week, said: “This seems a better approach, to come out and arrest a few individuals rather than targeting the whole crowd.” 

The killing of Brown, 18, by a police officer has sent shockwaves around America, polarising the nation and prompting fresh soul searching over race relations. 

The American attorney general is due in Ferguson on Wednesday where he is expected to meet officials conducting a federal investigation into the shooting of Brown on August 9. 
Earlier Barack Obama called for a peaceful resolution. 

“While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos. It undermines rather than advancing justice,” he said after interrupting his summer holiday and returning to the White House. 

In her letter Mrs Fulton wrote: ""I hate that you and your family must join this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence."" 

She added: “Further complicating the pain and loss in this tragedy is the fact that the killer of your son is alive, known, and currently free. In fact, he is on paid administrative leave. Your own feelings will bounce between sorrow and anger. 

“Even when you don’t want to think about it because it is so much to bear, you will be forced to by merely turning on your television or answering your cell phone.”

""You have young men of colour in many communities who are more likely to end up in jail or in the criminal justice system than they are in a good job or in college,"" he said. 

""Given the history of this country, we can make progress in building up more confidence, more trust, making sure that our criminal justice system is acutely aware of the possibilities of disparities in treatment."" 

Earlier today an independent autopsy revealed that Michael Brown, the 18-year-old black man whose death at the hands of a white police officer ignited the unrest in Ferguson, had been shot six times, including twice in the head. It also indicated that Mr Brown's body showed no signs of a struggle. 

Mr Obama's remarks came after a meeting with Attorney General Eric Holder, who will be traveling to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with law enforcement officials and leaders in the community.

Details were released after the worst night of violence so far in Ferguson, Missouri, where protesters threw petrol bombs and forced back police lines prompting the state governor to order in the National Guard – a move of last resort. 

President Barack Obama was due to meet the attorney general, Eric Holder, on Monday afternoon to discuss the crisis, his office said. 

Every day brings an escalation in intensity, re-opening old divisions along racial lines. 
Trouble flared on Sunday hours before a midnight curfew as crowds grew to more than 1000-strong. Three people were wounded and seven or eight arrested, according to police, and dozens of shops were looted. 

As volunteers cleared the debris and boarded up store the next morning, the Brown family lawyers released details of their own private autopsy at a news conference in a nearby church. 

Darryl Parks, an attorney for the family, pointed out the six bullet wounds on a diagram of the victims body. 

Two bullets, he said, travelled in a back-to-front direction through the victim’s head. 

“It supports what the witnesses said about him trying to surrender to the officer,” he said. 

“His head was in a downward position, it had to be. 

“We believe that given those kinds of facts, this officer should have been arrested.” 
The episode has ignited long standing tensions between the two-thirds black community of Ferguson and the almost all-white force responsible for policing them. 

Protesters have clashed with police night after night since Brown was shot dead in the street last Saturday. Civil rights activists have travelled to the low-rent neighbourhood of strip malls to add their support and Barack Obama has intervened to criticise the policing of protests. 

The violence is polarising society, just as in previous cases – such as the shooting of Travyon Martin in 2012. About 150 people mostly white people gathered in St Louis on Sunday to show their backing for the police and the officer involved in the shooting. 

Police have named him as Darren Wilson. He has been placed on administrative leave while investigations continue. 

The police account suggests Brown was engaged in a struggle with the officer before being killed but that is disputed by other witnesses. 

Dr Michael Baden, the forensic pathologist who carried out the family’s private autopsy, said Brown’s body showed no sign of a struggle and that lawyers had asked permission to examine the policeman. 

He said it was still too early to say exactly which witness accounts were backed by the autopsy findings. 
However, Professor Shawn Parcells, who is also working on the case, said a bullet injury to the inside of Brown’s right wrist was consistent with the victim walking away from the officer, or with accounts that he put his arms up. 

“We don’t know,” he said. 

Their evidence will further enflame protesters, demanding justice for Brown and his family. 

On Sunday night they broke through lines of police and headed for a command centre in a superstore car park bringing a hard-hitting response. Multiple gunshots could be heard as canisters of tear gas were fired into the crowds. 

Capt Ron Johnson, the officer in charge of policing the protests, said co-ordinated efforts to cause trouble forced him into a strong response. 

“There were multiple additional reports of Molotov cocktails being thrown, police were shot at, makeshift barricades were set up to block police, bottles and rockets were thrown at police,” he said. “Based on these conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response.” 

The scenes of mayhem prompted the governor to order the National Guard to join the effort. 

Jay Nixon said: “I join the people of Ferguson, and all Missourians, in strongly condemning this criminal activity that included firing upon law enforcement officers, shooting a civilian, throwing Molotov cocktails, looting, and a co-ordinated attempt to block roads and overrun the Unified Command Center,” he said. 

“These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory, and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served, and to feel safe in their own homes.”

While its to deployment to help quell local unrest is not unprecedented, it is typically a measure of last resort - as appears to be the case in Ferguson, the suburb of St Louis, Missouri, that has been torn apart by eight consecutive nights of protests and riots over the police killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old.
Missouri's governor, Jay Nixon, said that he had called in the Guard because of ""deliberate, coordinated, and intensifyingly violent acts"" by the protesters.
The National Guard was sent in during the 1992 Los Angeles riots which were sparked by the beating of a black man, Rodney King, by police officers. Those riots left 53 people dead and National Guard troops remained in Los Angeles for two weeks to maintain order.
Its troops were famously deployed to Arkansas in 1957 by President Dwight Eisenhower, to enable nine black students to enter a previously all-white school in Little Rock - against the opposition of an angry segregationist mob which had gathered to try to prevent them.
One of the darkest moments for the National Guard came during anti-Vietnam War protests on the campus of Kent State University, Ohio, in 1970, when troops fired into the crowd and killed four students.

The company, which is best known for making stun-guns, has seen a sharp increase in orders of its cameras, which record all police officers’ interactions whilst they are on patrol. According to a recent study, officers wearing the devices are 60pc less likely to use force, and 88pc less likely to become the subject of a civilian complaint.
The gadgets have been thrown into the spotlight in recent days, as US authorities look for ways to prevent a repeat of the shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson earlier this month.
Michael Brown, 18, died after police shot him six times – including twice in the head. The incident has sparked violent clashes, now entering their second week.
Some US cities and states already use Taser cameras to record their police officers’ interactions with civilians, but analysts expect the devices to become much more widespread as forces look for new ways to curb unnecessary violence.
Last week, New York federal judge Shira Scheindlin ordered some precincts of the New York Police Department to start using cameras, saying they would reduce potential violations of civilians’ constitutional rights.
Meanwhile, forces in Houston, Texas and Fresno, California, have expanded orders for the camera equipment, and Taser reported an influx of new orders from 14 other police departments in the third quarter.
It is not the only company producing wearable cameras, but it is the best known and dominates the sector alongside Vievu, a privately-owned manufacturer. Competition between the two companies has helped to drive prices down to between $300 and $400 a piece. However, the cost of storing and managing the footage that is collected can become much more expensive.
Taser’s jump helped to propel the Nasdaq stock exchange above the 4500 mark, to its highest level since 2000. It was also buoyed by strong performances from Chinese technology companies, led by Sky-mobi, an app maker, and China Finance Online, a financial news business, which saw shares jump by more than a fifth after it launched a new web-based trading platform.",NA,0,NA,NA

Gov. Jay Nixon signed an executive order deploying troops the US state militia, saying demonstrators had thrown Molotov cocktails and shot at police as well as a civilian, a description of the night's events diverging widely from some eyewitness accounts. 

""Tonight, a day of hope, prayers, and peaceful protests was marred by the violent criminal acts of an organised and growing number of individuals, many from outside the community and state, whose actions are putting the residents and businesses of Ferguson at risk,"" Mr Nixon said in a statement on his website. 
A midnight curfew was imposed for the second night in the tense St Louis suburb hit by racially charged demonstrations, violence and looting since Michael Brown, 18, was shot to death on August 9 by white police officer Darren Wilson. 
At around dusk on Sunday, hundreds of protesters in Ferguson including families with young children fled to safety after police wearing gas masks and body armor fired tear gas and smoke canisters to scatter them hours ahead of the curfew. 

""The smoke bombs were completely unprovoked,"" said Anthony Ellis, 45. ""It (the protest) was led by kids on bikes. Next you know they're saying, 'Go home, Go home!'"" 
The Missouri Highway Patrol said ""aggressors"" were trying to infiltrate a law enforcement command post and that armored vehicles were deployed to ensure public safety. 

""We ordered them back. We ordered them back again. After several attempts, we utilised the smoke to disperse these individuals,"" said Highway Patrol Corporal Justin Wheetley. 
Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol told a late-night news briefing: ""Molotov cocktails were thrown, there were shootings, looting, vandalism and other acts of violence that clearly appear not to have been spontaneous."" 

He was explaining the police tactics against what he said had to that point been a peaceful demonstration. 

""Coordinated acts"" by a few in the crowd were ""premeditated criminal acts designed ... to provoke a response,"" Capt Johnson said. ""I had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response."" 
He noted most of the protesters were peaceful and blamed the trouble on ""a few people bent on violence and destruction."" 

Capt Johnson said the trouble began after police responded to the shooting of a civilian at 8.25 pm, which was followed by gunfire directed towards police and Molotov cocktails being thrown. At least one other person was shot, and several were arrested. No police were injured. 
Officials said Ferguson schools would be closed on Monday. 

A preliminary private autopsy, asked for by Mr Brown's family, showed the teenager was shot at least six times, the New York Times reported on Sunday night. 
Quoting Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the city of New York, the newspaper reported that Mr Brown was shot twice in the head, and that the bullets that hit him did not appear to have been fired from very close range because no gunpowder was detected on his body. 
Mr Brown's family was set to appear with Mr Baden on Monday morning in St. Louis to address the autopsy's findings. 

Earlier on Sunday, the US Attorney General, Eric Holder, ordered a federal autopsy of Mr Brown's body, seeking to assure the family and community there will be a thorough investigation. 

Police say Mr Brown was asked by Wilson to move off the road and onto a sidewalk and that Brown reached into a patrol car and struggled with Darren Wilson for his service gun and was shot. 

A friend of Mr Brown's, Dorian Johnson, 22, and at least one other witness said Officer Wilson reached out through his car window to grab at Brown and the teenager was trying to get away when shot. Brown held up his hands in a sign of surrender but Wilson got out of his patrol car and shot Mr Brown several times, they said. 
Police in Ferguson have come under strong criticism for Mr Brown's death and their handling of the aftermath. 

On Saturday night they also used smoke canisters and tear gas to drive away protesters who refused to leave the area when the midnight-to-5am curfew began. Seven protesters were arrested after failing to disperse. 

As disturbances continued in Missouri, 500 people protested outside police headquarters in Los Angeles on Sunday over the shooting death of an unarmed black man in California a week ago. 

That rally was peaceful, with many holding up signs reading, ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" in reference to witness reports that Mr Brown had his hands up when he was shot in Ferguson.",NA,66,NA,NA

As night fell in Ferguson, another peaceful protest quickly turned sour after marchers pushed toward one end of a street. 

Police pushed them back by repeatedly firing tear gas canisters and the streets were empty well before the curfew took effect at midnight.

Meanwhile a private autopsy report showed that Michael Brown, died after being shot at least six times, according to the New York Times.
Citing Dr Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, the newspaper reported that the victim was shot twice in the head.
Earlier in the day, family members, campaigners, and the general public assembled at a rally at Greater Grace Church.
Al Sharpton, the civil rights activists, told the congregation to prepare for difficult days ahead as autopsy results emerged from three investigations.
""This is a defining moment in this country,"" he told the crowd.
President Barack Obama has received regular briefings on the situation in Ferguson while holidaying in Martha's Vineyard.
The Department of Justice and the St Louis County Police department are investigating the death.
Crucial facts are disputed by police officers and witnesses.
Police say that after Wilson asked Brown to move out of the road on to a sidewalk, Brown reached into the patrol car and struggled with Wilson for the officer's gun. Wilson, who sustained a facial injury, then shot Brown a number of times.
A friend of Brown disputes the claims, and says the 18-year-old died as he tried to give himself up.

They assembled to protest outside a local TV station that broadcast from outside the officer's home and sold $7 (£4) T-shirts with the slogan ""Officer Darren Wilson, I stand by you."" 

After days of violence in the mostly black neighbourhood of Ferguson where Michael Brown, 18, was killed, it is the first sign of backing for the beleaguered police.
""He's been tried and convicted in the court of the media,"" said one woman, who declined to give her name such is the febrile atmosphere.
The officer has been put on administrative leave pending an investigation. 

Police handling of the affair has been widely criticised for a heavy handed approach. 

Violence flared again on Saturday night when police cleared a hot spot outside a barbecue restaurant in Ferguson, after they identified armed men among the crowd. Officers used tear gas and wooden rounds to disperse protesters. 

While those crowds have mostly comprised African-Americans, the protest in nearby downtown St Louis on Sunday was all white, except for a single black figure. 

Many expressed exasperation with media coverage that had focused on images of tear gas and noisy demands for immediate justice. 

A man who would give his name only as Randy said the demonstration was not about picking sides but about showing support for officers doing a difficult job. 

""There are enough law enforcement groups investigating and that will take time,"" he said as passing cars honked their horns. ""The police have a job to do and many people do not understand how hard it is."" All were concerned about the risk to Wilson's family after his house was pictured on a local TV station, KSDK. 

Many were police officers – or married to officers – and some discussed whether it would be appropriate to chant, ""Hands up, Don't loot,"" a play on the Ferguson demonstrations where ""Hands up, Don't shoot"" has become a defining slogan. 

""We're here to show that it's OK to support officer Wilson,"" said another, passing around a giant card that will be delivered to the policeman. 

A two-person counter demonstration appeared across the street, with a sign reading: ""Killer cops: Don't shoot."" Ryan Wordsmith, a bartender, said police had been keen to smear Brown but so far had said nothing about the actual shooting.

Tensions have boiled over nightly in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson ever since Brown was killed on August 9. 

A week on and police used tear gas to clear a crowd of hard-core troublemakers in order to reach a male gun shot victim - apparently wounded by another protester - close to the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that has become the focal point for anger. 

Capt Ron Johnson, the Highway Patrol officer in charge of the operation, said armoured cars were deployed only when it became apparent that protesters had taken to the roof of a building and that some were armed. 
""A police car at that location was shot at,"" he said. 

""The shooting victim has been transferred to hospital in a critical condition."" 

They were met by a barrage of stones and made seven arrests, he added. 

On Sunday, the US attorney general ordered the justice department to conduct an autopsy in addition to one being conducted by state authorities. A spokesman said the decision had been taken because of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the case. 

Eric Holder, the Attorney General, will brief President Barack Obama about the latest developments in Ferguson on Monday, the White House said. 

The police shooting of an unarmed black man in contested circumstances has sparked nationwide protests and a fresh round of soul searching over race relations. 

Last week Barack Obama, community leaders and peaceful protesters condemned a heavy handed police response - involving armoured vehicles and automatic weapons - which they say has provoked further violence. 

On Sunday morning, Jay Nixon, state governor, said local police made a mistake in accusing Brown of a convenience store robbery, releasing surveillance footage on Friday just as violence was easing. 
""I think it had an incendiary effect,"" he told CBS as he did the rounds of Sunday morning talk shows. 

""I mean, when you release a picture and you clearly are attempting to besmirch a victim of a shooting, shot down in his own street, a young man, and at the same time you're releasing information to try to ... tarnish him, then properly, there was a lot of folks that were concerned about that, and I do think it flamed it back up and has caused us to have to deal with some of that."" 

He added: ""It appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw."" 

His words reinforce a picture of infighting between law enforcement agencies floundering in the face of sustained protests. 

Ferguson is a largely black community that has struggled with crime in recent years and where relations with the mostly white local police force have long been strained. 

Protesters gathered again on Saturday night to demand justice for Brown despite Mr Nixon earlier declaring a state of emergency and a midnight curfew. 

Many headed home in good time, urged on by community marshalls - including some from the New Black Panthers - with loud hailers. 

Lyn Young, who travelled from Indianapolis to join the protests, said police had inflamed the situation by calling the curfew. 

""It's like poking a caged dog,"" she said. 

Thirty minutes after midnight, police armoured vehicles formed up in a silent line 150 yards from a hard core of 200 protesters who had braved torrential rain to make their point. 

A police officer issued a final warning. 

""You are in breach of a curfew,"" he said through a public address system. 

""You must disperse immediately,"" Seconds later the order went round officers: ""Gas, gas, gas."" 

Once they had donned gas masks, volley after volley of smoke bombs sent protesters scurrying for cover. Tear gas canisters followed as police inched closer in tight formation. 

Some of remaining protesters ripped up kerb stones to hurl at the police lines as the sound of gun shots echoed through the street. 

One woman, who asked not to be named, said most of the demonstrators wanted nothing other than a peaceful night. 

""The trouble is people who have come from outside,"" she said, as she emerged from the fray. ""They want to turn this into something that it isn't.""

Jay Nixon accused police investigating the death of Michael Brown, 18, at the hands of Officer Darren Wilson of seeking to “besmirch” his name, as a five-hour curfew aimed at curtailing the riots was lifted for the day. 

He was speaking as the Justice Department announced that Eric Holder, the US Attorney General, had ordered a second autopsy on the body of the teenager at the request of his family, to be performed by a federal medical examiner rather than the state’s authorities. 

Mr Holder said he was authorising the autopsy due to the ""exceptional circumstances"" of the case. 

One person is in a critical condition in hospital after being shot and seven arrests were made when a hard-core of demonstrators refused to abide by the midnight to 5am curfew, which Mr Nixon said would continue for the foreseeable future.
Police used tear gas to dispel the crowd in order to gain access to the injured man, who was found beside a restaurant where rioters had climbed on a roof. 

Little information has been made available about him, other than that he is thought to be a protester who was shot either accidentally or deliberately by an unknown fellow demonstrator seen wielding a handgun. 

Another protester is also said to have fired on police during the seventh night of violent confrontations. 

Appearing on the morning round of US political shows, Governor Nixon was highly critical of Ferguson police for their early handling of the demonstrations and investigation into Brown’s death. 

He said it had been inappropriate for the force’s chief to release a security video of the teen in which he appears to push a shop worker as he steals a box of cigars. The footage was made public on Friday, the same day as police finally bowed to pressure name the officer who killed him. 

Officer Wilson, 28, was apparently unaware that Brown was a robbery suspect when he called him over for walking in the middle of traffic, resulting in a confrontation which ended in the latter’s dead. The exact facts of what happen are disputed. 

Police handling of the protests which sprung up following Brown’s death, and the force's investigation into Officer Wilson’s actions, are now coming under increasing criticism. 

Governor Nixon accused Ferguson police of seeking to “besmirch” the teenager’s name. 

He told CBS: ""I think it had an incendiary effect. I mean, when you release a picture and you clearly are attempting to besmirch a victim of a shooting, shot down in his own street, a young man, and at the same time you’re releasing information to try to … tarnish him, then properly, there was a lot of folks that were concerned about that, and I do think it flamed it back up and has caused us to have to deal with some of that. 

“It appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw.” 

The governor told ABC News he was “thunderstruck” when he saw the scale of the police response on the streets of Ferguson, which included the use of rubber bullets, tear gas and Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles – anti-landmine tanks known as “MRAPs”. 

“All of us were thunderstruck by the pictures we saw, I mean, the overmilitarisation, the MRAPs rolling in, the guns pointed at kids in the street,” he said. “All of that I think instead of ratcheting down, brought emotion up.” 

Speaking on CNN, he added: ""Across the nation there are deep wounds and when you scratch them again they hurt. 

""It's important that we get this right, this is a big matter. There's a tremendous amount of angst about the facts in this case. 

""We are trying to use the least amount of force to provide people the ability to speak. 

""Thousands of people spoke last night, thousands of people marched and not a single gunshot was fired by police last night."" 

He went on: ""We're hopeful that we're making progress. I think it's right for people to grieve. I think it's right for people to speak."" 

Congressman Lacy Clay, who represents the First District of Missouri, and who has described Brown’s death as murder, also accused Ferguson police of being: ""way too heavy handed in the way they interacted with peaceful demonstrators."" 

He called for more officers to be recruited from the black community. While the suburb of Ferguson is largely African-American, the overwhelming majority of police on the local force are white. 

Mr Clay told CNN the clashes between the police and protesters, which included the arrest of journalists and the widespread use of tear gas, had been ""totally unacceptable."" 

He went on: ""A bigger problem here in Ferguson and across this region and across America are that police forces ... in African American communities are not diverse enough. 

""They do not have enough diversity within their force, they do not have a healthy relationship with the African American community that they are supposed to police. 

""We have to have a national conversation about how police forces should interact with the African American community.” 

Meanwhile, Officer Wilson posted a message on his Facebook page saying that the account was being deactivated due to threats against his family.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson also said one person was critically wounded after being shot and police are seeking the gunman. 

Johnson defended his department's strong strategic response after the curfew came into force.

They deployed smoke bombs and tear gas and fired wooden rounds to clear the streets of Ferguson after a state of emergency was imposed in a bid to end a week of disturbances over the shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by a police officer. 

Most protesters dispersed quickly leaving what they said was a hard core who had travelled from Chicago to cause trouble. 

Police waited 30 minutes after midnight before inching forward in armoured vehicles. 
Loudspeakers ordered people home: “You are breaching the curfew. You must disperse immediately."" 

Protesters responded by shouting: “We are Michael Brown!"" 

Some threw smoke bombs back at police but heavy rain helped thin the crowd. 

All evening members of the New Black Panthers had tried to police the demonstration, urging people to head home as the curfew approached. 

At least one person in the crowd carried a handgun and police said later that they had moved in after receiving reports that someone apparently unrelated to the protests had been shot, and that armed individuals had broken into a restaurant. 

""We have a shooting victim in critical condition that may lose her life,"" Captain Ron Johnson, the African-American officer put in charge of restoring peace in Ferguson, told reporters in the early hours of Sunday morning. 

""We had a subject standing in the middle of the road with a handgun. We had a police car shot at tonight. And, yes, I think that was a proper response tonight, to maintain officer safety and public safety."" 

Seven people were arrested, he said. 
The organised move came in stark contrast to the chaos of the past week, which has seen the police condemned for a heavy handed response. 

Night after night, anger has spilled into violence. Most protesters have made their point peacefully but accuse the Revolution Club of Chicago of trying to incite riots. 

They are desperate to win justice for Brown and his family, and have criticised county police for doing more to protect the officer who fired the fatal shot than providing answers to how an unarmed man could be gunned down in the street. 

Further fuel was added to the mix at as the lawyer for a key witness said Brown was shot dead in an execution-style killing, according to The Washington Post. 

Jay Nixon, the governor of Missouri, announced the state of emergency on Saturday, after looting broke out a day earlier. 

Mr Nixon said: “This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching. This is a test of whether a community, this community, any community can break the cycle of fear, distrust and violence and replace them with peace, strength and ultimately justice. 

“It will not happen in one night. 

“But that is where it will start.” 
Captain Johnson said the curfew would run from midnight until 5am. 

“We will not enforce this with trucks, we will not enforce this with gas,” said Mr Johnson, who has been credited with easing tensions since being handed responsibility at the end of the week after Barack Obama criticised a heavy handed police operation. 

He added that 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door to gather information about the incident. 

The circumstances that led to the killing remain disputed. Police on Friday revealed video footage that allegedly showed Brown robbing a convenience store with a friend. 
Dorian Johnson, that friend, has now told the FBI the pair were confronted by a police officer because they were walking in the middle of the street. 

The Washington Post quoted Ms Johnson’s attorney, Freeman Bosley, as describing the killing as an execution-style slaying. He said the officer cursed at them, and claimed that when they refused to move he grabbed Brown’s throat from the window of his car and shot him. 

When Brown tried to flee, the officer, named as Darren Wilson, chased him and shot him five to six more times as he raised his hands were raised, according to the account given by Mr Bosley.

Some local businesses were looted during the ensuing protests.
On Saturday, Governor Nixon said that the state would not allow a handful of looters to endanger the community and that there must be calm if justice is to be served.

Dozens of people congregated on Saturday morning in Ferguson, clearing broken glass and boarding up broken shop windows after another round of violence erupted the night before, dashing hopes that a softer police approach may ease tensions.
Emotions had been inflamed even further after an account of the shooting of Michael Brown by Emanuel Freeman, a local rapper. Using his Twitter label of @TheePharoah, he gave a blow by blow account of how the incident unfolded last Saturday.
The fresh outbreak of looting prompted Jay Nixon, governor of Missouri, to sign a state of emergency and announce that a curfew would be put in place to prevent further trouble.
“If there was an easy way to separate those who hurt from those who help, we would,” he said at a press conference. “But it is hard. Sometimes - especially at night - we can’t.""
The Governor added: “This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching. This is a test of whether a community - this community, any community - can break the cycle of fear, distrust and violence and replace them with peace, strength and ultimately justice.
“It will not happen in one night. But that is where it will start.""
Ron Johnson, the State Highway Patrol captain tasked with policing the area, said the curfew would run from midnight until 5am.
Details of the shooting last Saturday remain contested.
Witnesses said Brown was shot despite posing no threat to officers. However, police say Brown had earlier been involved in a robbery and tussled with patrolmen who asked him to step from the street on to the pavement.
On Friday, the officer was named as Darren Wilson, 28. He has been on administrative leave since the shooting.

The events last weekend were apparently “live tweeted” by a rapper living beside the spot where Michael Brown, 18, died.
The mostly black neighbourhood has been rocked by protests ever since, threatening to ignite a race war, as locals demand to know how an unarmed man could be shot dead in broad daylight as he apparently tried to surrender to police.
Officers have been widely condemned for being out of touch and for using excessive force against the demonstrators. They have also come under fire for claiming that Brown was stopped because he was a suspect in a robbery - only to backtrack hours later when it emerged the officer involved did not know of his alleged crime.
Using the street slang of rap culture, Emanuel Freeman, who goes by the Twitter label of {@TheePharaoh}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TheePharoah"">, gave a blow by blow account of what unfolded last Saturday at about midday.

[tweetbegin 498152572062945281 tweetend]

His first tweet said: “I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE OMFG.”
He then posted a photograph of a man lying face down in the street outside his house.
To a friend, he said: “The police just shot someone dead in front of my crib yo.”
An angry crowd soon gathered in the street.
“Its blood all over the street, n----s protesting nshit. There is police tape all over my building. I am stuck in here omg,” he wrote.

TheePharoah then went on to answer questions from other Twitter users, saying that he thought the man was shot seven times - twice from behind, and then five further shots as the victim turned to face police.
More photographs follow, including a police officer with a rifle in his hand.
The killing has sent shockwaves across America, igniting protests in 60 other cities. Civil rights campaigners compare the death with the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager killed by a neighbourhood watch organiser who was later acquitted of murder in a racially charged case.
The local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan has reportedly begun raising money as a “reward” for the officer involved.
But for many, the case highlights the gulf between communities and the officers who police them.
In Ferguson, a down-at-heel neighbourhood of strip malls, a local force of 53 officers has just three black members for an area that is two-thirds African-American.
Five years ago, police there charged a black man with property damage for bleeding on four uniforms as officers allegedly beat him.
And this week’s disturbing scenes of officers with armoured vehicles has raised questions about whether America has allowed its police to morph into a paramilitary force.
Ferguson, for example, is one of the areas that has signed up to a Pentagon programme to receive surplus military supplies, including automatic weapons and armoured vehicles, such as MRaps, or Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles of the sort more usually seen in Afghanistan.
Barack Obama interrupted his summer holiday to condemn the police’s heavy handed approach, arresting journalists and denying peaceful protesters their right to express themselves.

[tweetbegin 498207297441497088 tweetend]

Details of the killing remain contested.
Police say Brown was shot dead after a scuffle with officers that left one policeman with a swollen face.
On Friday, they released video footage showing Brown and a friend apparently stealing a $49 box of cigars from a convenience store. The pictures show Brown pushing a member of staff into a display stand.
In American police jargon it was described as a “strong arm” robbery - one that did not involve a weapon.
That was why, according to the official version of events released on Friday morning, Brown and his friend had been stopped in the street.
However, the revelations added fuel to an already combustible situation.
Locals accused police of trying to shift attention from the killing and of concocting a cover story.
Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Brown family, said it amounted to a character assassination.
A statement released by the Brown family said: “There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.”
Even then the police were forced to change their story later in the day.
Thomas Jackson, the chief of Ferguson police, was forced to admit that the officer responsible for the shooting, named as Darren Wilson, had not known Brown was a suspect in the robbery. Instead, he had asked Brown not to walk in the middle of the street so a police car could pass.
After 24 hours of calm on Thursday, when state police were given responsibility for calming the protests, the result was inevitable.
Protesters gathered outside a looted QuikTrip store - focal point for anger in four of five previous nights.
Al Aitkins, a crane operator, said the accusations would enflame simmering anger.
“It will make things worse,” he said. “They may try to shift the blame but we will carry on demanding justice for Mike.”
The evening started peacefully. Dancers and drummer created a carnival spirit despite steady drizzle.
Witnesses said the atmosphere changed at midnight, when dozens of protesters confronted police, shouting abuse. A hard core threw bottles which were met with a single teargas round, sparking an attack on the Ferguson Market and Liquor store, the scene of Brown’s alleged robbery.
TV pictures showed masked looters emerging with bottles of wine and even the cash register.
Police stayed away, and trouble died down as other protesters formed human barriers in front of shops to keep looters at bay.
It left the black officer drafted in to restore calm at the end of the week exasperated.
Captain Ron Johnson, of Missouri Highway Patrol, who has won praise for his sensitive handling of the protests, told a local television station he had spent all day trying to ease concerns after local police released the video.
“We had concerns that this would happen,” he said.",NA,159,NA,NA
Telegraph,tele28,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11038496/Ferguson-officer-unaware-Michael-Brown-was-a-suspect-in-robbery-before-shooting.html,Ferguson officer unaware Michael Brown was a suspect in robbery before shooting,Rob Crilly ,08/16/14,02/22/16,"Darren Wilson, the Ferguson policeman who shot Michael Brown, was unaware the unarmed black teenager was a suspect in a robbery at a convenience store at the time, police chiefs have admitted.
Instead, he had simply approached Brown to ask him to stop walking in the road.
The revelation came just hours after police released a case report and video footage apparently showing Brown and a friend robbing a convenience store. The report accused Brown of taking a $49 (£30) box of cigars in a ""strong-arm"" robbery shortly before he was shot dead.
The result was a growing suspicion among Ferguson residents that a cover story was being cooked up by a local police force trying to wriggle off the hook.
The reaction was immediate and furious.
Brown's family released a statement through their lawyers accusing police of trying to shift focus away from the circumstances of the killing.
""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender,"" it said.
The revelation came as Captain Ron Johnson, the police captain responsible for restoring calm in the wake of the killing, criticised other officers for their handling of their case, highlighting racial divisions.

Captain Johnson, the black officer brought in to take over the operation at the end of the week, is quickly becoming a folk hero to the civil rights activists, clerics and residents who gather nightly in front of a burnt-out convenience store close to the site of the killing.
In a string of interviews, he has distanced himself from the largely white county force which is blamed for inflaming feelings in the predominantly black community of Ferguson.
""There are some police chiefs who need some diversity training,"" he told CNN on Friday.
His words expose the racial gulf many in America see between law enforcement officers and the areas they police.
In Ferguson, a local force of 53 officers has just three black members for an area that is two-thirds African-American. Addressing that imbalance has become a key demand of the protesters.
Five years ago, police there charged a black man with property damage for bleeding on four uniforms as officers allegedly beat him.
And this week's frightening scenes of officers with armoured vehicles, body armour and dogs, has raised questions about whether America has allowed its police to morph into a paramilitary force.
Ferguson, for example, is one of the areas that has signed up to a Pentagon programme to receive surplus military supplies, including automatic weapons and armoured vehicles, such MRaps, or Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles of the sort more usually seen in Afghanistan.
Capt Johnson, of Missouri State Highway Patrol, has taken a different tack.
""I'm seeing friends that I haven't seen in a long time,"" he said, during a visit to the protest site on Friday, where he posed for photographs and listened to complaints. ""The hope is that we can come together.
""It's not just black faces. I see white faces, Hispanic faces...
""I see a chance to make this nation better.""
But the revelation that Wilson was unaware of the alleged robbery by Brown has threatened to undermine Capt Johnson's bridge building exercise and pitch Ferguson back into the violence that engulfed its main street of strip malls and cheap burger joints for much of the week.
In interview after interview, he said he had not been consulted on releasing the information.
""I don't think the video being released was what we needed or where we need to go,"" he said.
He spent an hour on Friday evening mingling with good-natured protesters, trying to reassure them that their concerns were not being ignored.
One father asked him to shake to shake hands with his daughters so that they would not be frightened of the police.
Many of the people who had run from the tear gas barrage earlier in the week returned to see him in action.
""It's not about him being black, it's about him understanding the people,"" said Terry Jones, a brewery worker. ""He knows not to use force to get the point across.""
The decision to shift responsibility from a local county force – closing ranks around one of its own – to state troopers seems to be working.
On Wednesday, Ferguson appeared to heading for a full-scale race war but since then peace has broken out, allowing the protesters to make their point.
Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter who comes from St Louis, joined the crowd on Friday evening braving the gentle drizzle.
""Feels good to be home. I'll be standing with everyone in Ferguson all weekend {#HandsUpDontShoot,""}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/HandsUpDontShoot?src=hash""> he tweeted.
More demonstrations are planned on Sunday as campaigners such as Al Sharpton add their voice to demands for answers.
Jesse Jackson, the civil rights arrived in Ferguson on Friday.
He walked arm in arm with protesters to the site of the shooting in a quiet residential road, now marked with flowers and balloons.
""Michael Brown did not die in vain,"" he said. ""His death made us come alive. His death was not in vain.
As if reciting a prayer, he listed the names of other young black men killed in violent attacks.
""This madness must stop.""
The circumstances of Brown's death remain shrouded in mystery.

However, he also released documents showing that Brown died after being accused of taking a box of cigars. CCTV photographs showed Brown apparently intimidating a shopworker.
The revelations leave Ferguson, a poor, mostly black neighbourhood of St Louis, on a knife-edge.
Residents said the brief statement failed to answer their questions about how an unarmed man could be shot dead and promised more protests.
“This is not good enough. This is not good enough. We will have to make this place burn,” said a 20-year-old man who asked not to be identified.
Demonstrators began to gather within minutes of the brief police press conference, held in front of a burned-out convenience store, focal point of the violence.
“Hands up, don’t shoot,” they chanted.
Pherrell Moore, 35, an odd job man, said the protesters simply wanted answers.
“They just want to understand why he couldn’t have been taken alive,” he said. “Isn’t that what Tasers are for?”
The police report says Brown entered the convenience store and asked for several boxes of cigars. As the attendant placed them on the counter, the teenager grabbed a box and handed them to his friend, Dorian Johnson.
He was told to pay for them but instead reached across the counter and grabbed more boxes.
Things turned violent when the door was locked and police were called.
“That is when Brown grabbed X by the shirt and forcefully pushed him back into the display rack,” reads the redacted report.
However, the latest details reveal little about what happened when Wilson responded to a call to attend the “strong-arm” robbery at midday last Saturday.
Eyewitnesses say the unarmed teenager had his arms raised when he was shot multiple times.
However, according to police officers there was a struggle and one of the two men attempted to grab an officer’s gun.
The shooting has been compared with the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager killed by a neighbourhood watch organiser who was later acquitted of murder in a racially charged case.
For four nights, frustration boiled over into violence in Ferguson. Protesters threw stones and bottles, while police – in armoured vehicles and armed with rifles - responded with intense volleys of tear gas and fired wooden rounds.
The scenes brought an intervention from Barack Obama on Thursday, condemning the violence while also criticising the police for their heavyhanded response.
The concerns brought a change, with responsibility shifted from the local, county police to state Highway Patrol. A black officer was put in charge of the operation and police kept a low profile on Thursday night.
They also worked with local groups – including the New Black Panthers – to ensure an orderly protest.
The result was a night of chanting and dancing. But for the first time in five nights, Ferguson’s flashpoint remained trouble free.
“It is what we have been asking for,” said Aiesha Hill, a mother of two sons. “As long as they show resistance, we’ll show resistance.”
The fear now is that with police accusing Brown of robbery, the protest will turn violent once again.
However, Jay Nixon, Missouri governor, welcomed the release of the officer’s name.
“For the sake of the family, the citizens of Ferguson, and the entire region, it is vital that the investigations into the shooting death of Michael Brown move forward in a thorough, open and transparent manner to ensure that trust is restored and justice is done,” he said.",NA,26,NA,NA

22.20 Maliki, Iraq's prime minister for the past eight years, says he is relinquishing the post to fellow Dawa Party member Haider al-Abadi. 


Al-Maliki says his decision is based on his desire to ""safeguard the high interests of the country,"" adding that he will not be the cause of any bloodshed. 
""I will stay a combat soldier to defend Iraq and its people,"" he added in the televised address late Thursday, with al-Abadi standing by his side.

18.53 Britain has suspended aid drops to civilians trapped on a mountain in northern Iraq after the situation there eased, officials said on Thursday, but it will continue to provide humanitarian support across the region. 

A surveillance mission by Royal Air Force (RAF) Tornado jets overnight reinforced a US assessment that the number of people under seige on Mount Sinjar by Islamic State (IS) militants was smaller than previously believed, a spokeswoman for Downing Street said. 

Britain dropped another consignment of aid overnight Wednesday, the seventh in four nights, bringing the total water delivered to more than 48,000 litres. But a spokeswoman said there were no immediate plans for any more. 

""We are currently reviewing the need for additional airdrops, given that there appear to be adequate supplies on the mountain, but we will keep the option open if we establish there is further need,"" a spokeswoman said. 

18.23 We have a full report on Mr Obama's speech from Peter Foster. 
President Barack Obama confirmed that the US would not now need to conduct an evacuation of Mount Sinjar and that aid drops would now be suspended, with most of the 130 additional military advisers deployed this week to be withdrawn.  

However he cautioned that the situation in Iraq remained ""dire"" for those people still ""subject to ISIL's terror"" and pledged to continue US humanitarian assistance wherever possible, but without committing combat troops.  

Singling out the UK by name, Mr Obama added that he was also ""very encouraged"" by the willingness of US international partners to contribute to the growing aid effort in Iraq.  

However on the question of whether the US would now help Iraqi forces more broadly in taking the fight to Islamic State elements, Mr Obama remained non-committal, saying only that the US “will continue air strikes to protect our people and facilities in Iraq"". 

On the evolving political situation in Baghdad, Mr Obama again publicly praised Haider al-Abadi, the prime-minister designate, adding that he was now ""modestly hopeful"" that negotiations to form an inclusive Iraqi government were heading in the right direction.  

18.08 More from Obama's speech via Reuters.  

""We helped vulnerable people reach safety and we helped save many innocent lives,"" Obama said at a press briefing.

17.25 The Pentagon sees little if any need to airdrop more food and water to Iraqis atop Sinjar Mountain because most of the stranded have left and the remainder are in less dire need, a spokesman has said, according to AP. 

Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said U.S. officials believe the number on Sinjar is now ""in the neighborhood of 4,000,"" and that between 1,500 and 2,000 of those are local residents who live there and have no plans to leave. 

""We believe based on our assessment of conditions on the mountain that it is much less likely that we'll need to continue to airdrop any more food and water,"" Kirby said. The last airdrop was Wednesday.

16.41 Obama will be making a speech, thereby interrupting his holiday, but the topic is currently unknown. 

16.30 Via AFP, there are quotes from Angela Merkel reported in local media on the issue of possibly arming Kurds and giving humanitarian aid. 

""Stopping the advance of these extremists and helping those in need is a task for the entire international community,"" she was quoted as saying by the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung. 

This requires humanitarian aid and the possible supply of equipment for those who are fighting against the terrorists."" 

Germany, a major arms manufacturer, as a rule does not export weapons into war zones, but Merkel pointed out that German law allows for exceptions in cases that impact national security.  

""When it comes to arms exports, the government always has some political and legal leeway, and if necessary we will exhaust it.  

""Here we will coordinate closely with our partners and, above all, with the United States."" 

""German security interests are a factor in our deliberations, but no decisions have been taken yet."" 

16.25 Barack Obama, US President, is due to give a speech at 5.15pm (12.15 ET). We'll have the updates as soon as possible. 

16.15 German air force planes will deliver humanitarian aid to northern Iraq on Friday, media reported, as Chancellor Angela Merkel said Berlin was also considering sending weapons to help the embattled country, AFP report. 

Four German Transall C-160 military transporters, carrying 36 tonnes of mostly medical and food supplies, will fly via Turkey to the Kurdish city of Arbil, reported national news agency DPA. 

Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said this week that Germany may also send non-lethal military hardware such as armoured vehicles, helmets, security vests and night-vision gear. 

It comes after the UK delivered more aid and David Cameron went to visit a DFID centre to see aid prepared.

Telegraph,tele35,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11035790/Police-step-back-from-confronting-protesters-over-Michael-Brown-shooting.html,Police step back from confronting protesters over Michael Brown shooting,Rob Crilly ,08/15/14,02/22/16,"After four nights of tear gas, gunfire and petrol bombs, peace finally returned to a Missouri suburb on Thursday where hundreds of people sang, chanted and danced in memory of a black teenager shot dead by police. 

Officers were almost invisible, in stark contrast to a night earlier when heavily armed riot police were blamed for provoking a riot. 

As darkness fell, more than 1,000 demonstrators lit candles in memory of Michael Brown who died last Saturday. 

“If the police just stay back then maybe we’ll get justice,” said Michelle Allen, a mother of five, who had come to support the campaign seeking answers to his death. 

Eyewitnesses say the unarmed teenager had his arms raised and posed no threat when he was shot multiple times. 
However, according to police officers there was a struggle and Brown attempted to grab an officer’s gun.
The name of the officer responsible has not yet been released although CNN reported that it was due to be revealed on Friday. 

The killing has already been compared with the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager killed by a neighbourhood watch organiser who was later acquitted of murder in a racially charged case. 

This time around, it has ignited tensions in one of St Louis’s poorer neighbourhoods, boiling over into violence after dark. 

On Thursday the ground was still littered with broken glass from a night earlier. Then police lined up in an intimidating wall, sirens wailing at earsplitting intensity, before firing barrage upon barrage of teargas at the unarmed protesters who had assembled outside the charred remains of a QuikTrip convenience store, torched earlier in the week. 

Their heavy-handed approach and intimidating tactics brought accusations that they were a “militarised force” simply making matters worse. 

During the day Barack Obama had taken time out from his summer holiday, first condemning the violence and then criticising the police. 

“There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protesters or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their first amendment rights,” he said. 

Thursday brought a change in police strategy. Responsibility was shifted from the local, county police – accused by protesters of provoking violence with heavyhanded tactics – to state troopers, headed by an African-American Highway Patrol captain. 

“We are going to have a different approach,” promised Capt Johnson at a press conference during the day. 

He made good on his word. 

Police kept a low profiled and maintained their distance from a good natured, carnival crowd who gathered around an area of low rent strip malls. 

Just as the sun was setting – a flashpoint on previous nights - Capt Johnson arrived at the protest site. He shook hands with protesters and quietly urged organisers to keep the road clear for traffic. 

“Everyone can speak their mind,” he said during his visit. “Everyone can stay as long as they want.” 

And they did. 

Hundreds chanted, “Hands up, Don’t Shoot,” in memory of Brown. Drivers tooted their horns as they passed. 

Instead of the acrid, throat-burning smell of teargas, the air filled with the herbal aroma of marijuana. 

Many in the racially mixed crowd said the absence of police would ensure a peaceful evening. 

“It is what we have been asking for,” said Aiesha Hill, a mother of two sons. “As long as they show resistance, we’ll show resistance.” 

She added that everyone in Ferguson had an example of police injustice in their family or had experience racial profiling. Maybe protests over Brown’s death would make the rest of the world take notice, she said. 

There are still plenty of questions about how Brown died in a Ferguson street. 

At the top of the list is the name of the officer responsible, a key demand of many protesters. They wonder whether he is being protected by a powerful relative. 

As one protester put it: “Will the name bring an end to the demonstrations? Well, it will depend on who he is and who he is connected to, because that may explain why they waited so long.” 

And then there is the thornier question about why an unarmed man was shot dead in the street. 

Benjamin Crump, the Brown family’s attorney, summed it up in an interview with CNN: “There is nothing Michael Brown could have done to justify him being executed in broad daylight, and this is the worst police shooting I have ever seen.” 

For while the police may have defused the threat of rioting by ceding the streets to the protests, they are not in the clear just yet. ",NA,37,NA,NA
Telegraph,tele36,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11035742/US-town-sees-fifth-night-of-protests-after-shooting-of-black-teenager.html,US town sees fifth night of protests after shooting of black teenager,AFP,08/15/14,02/22/16,"Hundreds of people demonstrated peacefully Thursday in a Missouri town rocked by days of protests over the fatal shooting of a black teenager, hours after state police were ordered to replace local forces. 

Police shot and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown on Saturday in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, triggering protests and then a police crackdown in which authorities fired tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested reporters, sparking complaints led by President Barack Obama. 

Brown's death and the subsequent action by a mainly white police force in a majority black town led to allegations of racism and stirred comparisons with the February 2012 fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.
State Governor Jay Nixon said the decision to draft in the Missouri Highway Patrol had been taken after Ferguson was left looking ""like a war zone"" after four days of rioting - and there was an altogether different atmosphere on the streets after the governor's move. 
A local African-American officer, Captain Ron Johnson, took charge and was at the peaceful march, hugging and shaking hands with demonstrators, reporters at the scene said, a signal of the marked change in approach from police. 

""We're all in this together... we're not in this for fear, to intimidate,"" Johnson said, according to a Washington Post reporter in Ferguson. 

Earlier in the day, Obama called for ""peace and calm,"" adding authorities had a responsibility to be ""open and transparent"" 

""Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,"" Obama said. ""Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done."" 
""There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" he added. 

""There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their first amendment rights."" 

The county police response to daily, and nightly, protests since the shooting had been aggressive, with rifle-toting police in military-style fatigues and body armor deployed to crush dissent. 

""Lately it looks like a war zone and that is not acceptable,"" Nixon said. 

Johnson said police would show respect as they try to restore calm. 

""I grew up here, and this is currently my community and my home. It means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence and build trust, and show the utmost respect,"" he said, adding he understands ""the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling."" 

The governor, however, did not cede to one key demand of the protesters. Control of the investigation into the police shooting of Brown will remain in the hands of the St Louis County force. The US Department of Justice has already announced a separate federal investigation. 

Many people in Ferguson are also frustrated at the lack of information provided about the investigation, including withholding the name of the officer who shot Brown and even how many shots were fired. 

As day broke Thursday, the Brown family had also appealed for calm and urged federal authorities to carry out an independent autopsy of their son's body. 
""There is nothing Michael Brown could have done to justify him being executed in broad daylight, and this is the worst police shooting I have ever seen,"" their attorney, Benjamin Crump, told CNN. 

""We have to get answers, and it has to be transparent, and that's why we're calling on the Justice Department and the attorney general to do an independent autopsy."" 

Obama, in his remarks, said he had already tasked the FBI to independently probe Brown's death along with local officials on the ground. 

He added that he had made clear to Attorney General Eric Holder ""that we should do what is necessary to determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done."" 

Obama also hit out at the detention on Wednesday of two reporters. 

""Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who were just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground,"" he said.

Mr Obama broke off from his holiday to address the situation in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson, which has been engulfed by demonstrations and violence since the shooting of Michael Brown on Saturday.
The president said: ""I know emotions are raw right now. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again.
""There is never an excuse for violence against police. There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against protesters. Now is a time for healing. Now is a time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.
""And it's a time for open and transparent process to see justice is done.""
Following the arrests of two journalist, from the Washington Post and Huffington Post, who were reporting the protests, Mr Obama also said police ""should not be arresting journalists who are just doing their job.""
According to police, Mr Brown was shot after he and a friend were stopped in the street and he attacked an officer through the patrol car window.
But Tiffany Mitchell, a witness, said on Thursday there had been a ""tussle through the window"" and Mr Brown seemed to be trying to get away when a shot went off.
She said: ""The kid, he finally gets away and he starts running. As he runs, the police [officer] gets out of his vehicle and he follows behind him shooting.""
She said Mr Brown turned around and put his hands up, but ""the cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks the concrete"".
Miss Mitchell said she heard at least ""five or six"" shots.
Democratic and Republican politicians called for a ""demilitarisation"" of the situation on Thursday as police, armed with surplus equipment from the Pentagon, faced accusations of heavy-handedness.
Officers in camouflage and bullet proof vests have used tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets against crowds throwing Molotov cocktails.
They also manned high-calibre automatic weapons on tripods atop armoured cars, pointing them at protesters who chanted ""Hands up. Don't shoot.""
Protesters likened the police use of dogs for crowd control to methods used during the civil rights protests of half a century ago.
One 18-year-old protester said: ""I've had enough of being pushed around because of the colour of my skin. I'm sick of this police brutality. I'm going to keep coming back here night after night until we get justice.""
The scenes were so bad people in Gaza sent messages on social media advising protesters on how to deal with tear gas.
At least 65 people have been arrested so far including Antonio French, a St Louis councillor, who said: ""Inside that jail is nothing but peacekeepers. They rounded up the wrong people. Reverends, young people organising the peace effort.""
Jon Belmar, the St Louis County police chief, defended the tactics, saying officers had faced rocks, bottles and gunfire. Two dozen of their patrol vehicles had been destroyed, he said.
Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said: ""It's a powder keg and we all recognise that.
""We have to respond to deadly force. If the crowd is getting violent and you don't want to be violent, get out of the crowd.""
Protests were inflamed after police refused to release the name of the officer who shot Mr Brown, saying they did not want to endanger him.
The hacker group Anonymous released a purported name for the officer on Thursday, but police said it was incorrect.
The officer, who is white, has been placed on administrative leave and will be named if charged with a crime, they said.

The latest series of confrontations saw two journalists, one from the Washington Post and another from the Huffington Post arrested.
Demonstrators defied police to gather again to protest at the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in the suburb of St Louis on Saturday.
Police had pleaded with residents to stay at home after days of looting. Already on convenience store has been burned out and other businesses damaged in the violence.
Armed with assault rifles and bolstered with armoured personnel carriers, police staged a show of force in an attempt to keep control of the streets.
But it was to no avail as the anger among protesters showed no sign of abating, especially with the authorities still refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Mr Brown.
Police fired pepper spray and tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd as protesters showed no sign of being willing to move.
The protesters had been told to leave the area completely or face arrest. They told the demonstrators that their peaceful assembly was “no longer peaceful”.
Last night’s angry protests reflected the mounting tension in Ferguson where
67 per cent of Ferguson’s population is black, but all but three of the town’s 53 police officers are white.
Figures released last year by Missouri’s Attorney General last year showed that seven times more black drivers were stopped by police than white.
The two journalists Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post and Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post were arrested in a branch of McDonald’s where they had been working.

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but ... I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" Mr Obama said in a statement on Tuesday.
""The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time,"" the president added.
""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.""
Friends and family of 18-year-old Michael Brown held a peaceful church vigil on Tuesday night, and his father pleaded for an end to the violence. Standing with supporters, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, Michael Brown Sr. said he wanted justice for his son but wanted it ""the right way.""
""I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,"" said Mr Brown Sr., who wore a T-shirt showing his son's baby picture. ""No violence.""
Several hundred protesters appeared to heed the calls for non-violence late on Tuesday evening, chanting ""hands up, don't shoot"" and ""no justice, no peace"" during a tense but ultimately peaceful stand-off with police clad in riot gear and flanked by armoured vehicles near the site of Mr Brown's death.
The protesters, some of whom waved signs as the group was led in chants by megaphone, had dwindled to a handful before midnight.
Rev Sharpton, a New York-based civil rights leader, called for peaceful protest in the wake of looting and more than 50 arrests since the shooting. His National Action Network will pay for Mr Brown's funeral.
""To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant that he was,"" Sharpton said of the 6-foot, 4-inch (198-cm) Brown, who had planned to start college this week.

With tensions high in the city, the disclosure by Dorian Johnson, who was walking home with Michael Brown on Saturday when they were confronted by police, is likely to stoke the fears of residents who are braced for further disturbances.
On Monday night, police used tear gas and fired rubber bullets at protesters who were looting burned out buildings, leaving the business district of Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St Louis, resembling a “war zone,” according to onlookers.
The parents of Mr Brown, 18, gave an interview on what would have been his first day at college calling for the officer responsible for his death to face murder charges.
They had previously called for calm in the city and said that their son would not want riots to take place in his name.
Mr Johnson's disclosure that police had yet to get round to interviewing him about the case, which has been compared to that of the Florida teenager Trayvon Martin who was shot by a neighbourhood watch coordinator as he walked home, follows a move by the FBI to take over the investigation from the local police force.
In an interview with MSNBC, 22-year-old Mr Johnson described the moments leading up to his friend's death.
The pair were walking home along a street when a police car pulled alongside them and an officer ordered them to get out of the road. Mr Johnson said: “His exact words were get the fâ?”k on the sidewalk.” When the two young men protested that they were nearly home, an officer grabbed hold of Mr Brown.
Mr Johnson went on: “They're not wrestling so much as his arm went from his throat to now clenched on his shirt. It's like tug of war. He's trying to pull him in. He's pulling away, that's when I heard, â??I'm gonna shoot you.'” The teenager was said to have called out to his friend to flee, shouting: “Keep running, bro.” Mr Johnson added: “I saw the barrel of the gun pointed at my friend. Then I saw the fire come out of the barrel.”
Looking back, he said he saw Mr Brown with his hands in the air shouting: “I don't have a gun, stop shooting.” The St Louis County Police Department has not provided a detailed account of what it says happened before Mr Brown's death, other than to claim that he assaulted the officer, and it has refused to name the policeman involved. He is known to have been in the force for six years. Freeman Bosley, Mr Johnson’s attorney and a former mayor of St. Louis, told MSNBC that police had refused to hear Mr Johnson’s testimony.
