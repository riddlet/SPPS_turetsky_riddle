But it was not surprising. As even a weekly perusal of newspapers tells us, the murders of black teens and men by private white citizens or police officers are common, ordinary, everyday events. Two days after the shooting of Michael Brown, another young unarmed black man, this time in Los Angeles, was {shot}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/lapd-suggests-mentally-il_0_n_5675782.html""> by a police officer.

Yet, in the initial 24 hours after Michael Brown’s shooting, I saw flashes of the same questions in the comments to news articles and on Twitter: “What did he do?” “Why?” “Wtf?” Certainly, some of these were plaintive questions asked by grieving persons. But others reflected an earnest, though frustrating, innocence — one that found a shooting of a black teen by a policeman to be unusual, accidental, coincidental, extraordinary. Their questions echoed as I flipped through the fleeting images that followed the news of the shooting — rows of police officers with shields and batons and terrifying looking dogs, pumped up and ready to attack — accompanied by articles about “looting and riots,” tear gas, sniper guns and bullets.

Photo 6 in {this New York Times slide show}<hyperlink=""http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/photographing-on-fergusons-streets/?_r=0"">, among others, remains in my mind.

In the first three days after Michael Brown’s shooting, as the black community gathered to protest his death, “{left” media}<hyperlink=""http://www.thenation.com/article/police-overreaction-has-become-constitutional-crisis-ferguson-missouri/""> analyzed this event as if it were just a case of the police accidentally losing control. Elsewhere, mainstream news sites reported on the protests as if commenting on two equally strong baseball teams: The Cops versus Black people, rather than a case of {black protests}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/08/12/in_defense_of_black_rage_michael_brown_police_and_the_american_dream/""> against continual injustice.

Other news sites report “rioting” and “looting,” as if looting is the prime obstacle to safety, rather than protecting blacks against an arrogant, secure police force.

I can hear the objections: But aren’t the police there to protect the general public? If that is the case, then where was the police response to the unconscionable looting of American homes, workers’ pensions and minority homeowners, by American bankers — on the order of {hundreds of billions of dollars}<hyperlink=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/how-much-did-the-financial-crisis-cost/""> — none of which engendered policemen with rifles, dogs, bullets and shields to stop bankers and capitalists from {plundering the meager wealth}<hyperlink=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/04/23/a-rise-in-wealth-for-the-wealthydeclines-for-the-lower-93/""> of poorer and darker persons, especially minorities? Why were there no police stopping banksters then?

Mark O’Mara, George Zimmerman’s defense attorney during his murder trial in the death of another young black man, Trayvon Martin, claimed that the only reason that the officer’s name was being withheld was because of “social media threats,” and to avoid directing the community’s anger onto the police officer. But it doesn’t take a law degree to understand that this is a fiction of legal defense, articulated to cement a long-standing narrative of innocence, to undergird the contrived narrative that the death of a black teen somehow needs to be probed, explored cautiously, as if it were a unique event — before declaring that it was needless. In fact, as we know, Michael Brown’s life, as viewed by the proper bourgeois denizens and police force of Ferguson, was expendable. {According}<hyperlink=""http://www.occupy.com/article/black-man-killed-us-every-28-hours-police""> to journalist Adam Hudson, a black man is killed every 28 hours, justified by state-led policies from anti-loitering to the war on drugs. How else to explain the consistent, multiple, constant deaths of black men, except to understand their lives as expendable by a wealthy elite?

On CNN, African-American journalist LZ Granderson was interviewed about his poignant, mournful {column}<hyperlink=""http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/11/opinion/granderson-missouri-police-shooting/""> on Michael Brown’s death, in which he named the many aspects of this shooting that had made him tired. Many of these statements were critical about the police, about the shooting of yet another young black man, about fearing for his own and his son’s life, whenever they come into close proximity with a police officer.

Yet, the white talking head who interviewed Granderson picked up on his statement about being tired of the looting after a peaceful rally. This — this — was the statement that the white anchor picked up on: the looting (although he briefly acknowledged that the police needed to take a good hard look at themselves). But the CNN talking head did not raise the fact that Ferguson police felt justified in facing a mourning community, mostly composed of black residents and friends of Michael Brown — with batons and shields and tear gas and guns and hostile-looking dogs. Nor the fact that the Ferguson police were shooting “{beanbag rounds}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_bag_round"">” at protesters. Nor Granderson’s statement about the fatigue of being afraid of walking in front of a police officer.

The shooting of Michael Brown is not a sudden, excessive, abusive or random imposition of state power. It is rather a reminder of a certain state of the world that has been in existence for centuries — from slavery, to {Black Codes}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Codes_%28United_States%29""> and Jim Crow, both {designed to maintain the indentured servitude of blacks}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Codes_%2528United_States%25"">, to “stop and frisk” policing.  The above picture pulls back the curtain on the sheer, profound, constant presence of police power, protected by the law, in the service of elites. Philosopher Charles Mills gives it the technical term of “white supremacy,” and points to {the racial contract}<hyperlink=""http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100376800""> — promising equality to all persons while withholding it from all sub-persons — black slaves, their descendants, and other vulnerable minorities — as its evidence.

When we see pictures of officers behind clear shields, spraying tear gas at peaceful protesters, using dogs to hold black men and women and teenagers and children at bay, the message that we are reading is not — as liberal journalists and pundits tried to persuade in the early days after Michael Brown’s death — that “the law” was attempting to “keep peace” and manage “social unrest.” Rather, the message that is being communicated is a reminder of the racial contract: Black Americans should know their place and submit to the orders of those who work on behalf of white wealth — the police force, the bankers, the realtors, the tax collectors, our local and state representatives.

This message can be seen in the history of Ferguson, as told in a New York Times {editorial}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/opinion/racial-history-behind-the-ferguson-protests.html"">. The history of Ferguson is the history of racial covenants, restrictive racial zoning, white flight and white police power.

As black families moved into Ferguson, {the whites fled}<hyperlink=""http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/segregation2010/city.aspx?cityid=2923986"">. In 1980, the town was 85 percent white and 14 percent black; by 2010, it was 29 percent white and 69 percent black. But blacks did not gain political power as their numbers grew. The {mayor and the police chief are white}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.h"">, as are five of the six City Council members. The school board consists of six white members and one Hispanic. As Mr. Gordon explains, many black residents, lacking the wealth to buy property, move from apartment to apartment and have not put down political roots.

The disparity is most evident in the Ferguson Police Department, of which only three of 53 officers are black. The largely white force stops black residents far out of proportion to their population, according to {statistics kept by the state attorney general}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops"">. Blacks account for 86 percent of the traffic stops in the city, and 93 percent of the arrests after those stops. Similar problems exist around St. Louis County, where earlier this year the state chapter of the NAACP {filed a federal civil rights complaint}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/naacp-files-civil-rights-complaint-against-st-louis-county-police/article_5e3ddfee-b883-55a1-bf08-948f74c96e47.html""> alleging widespread racial profiling by police departments. (links in the original)

The history of Ferguson is the history of the racial contract; it is the history of the consolidation of wealth through the legalized economic and social exclusion of African-Americans.  The police are now being carefully tracked by mainstream media, who realize that their initial story has gotten away from them: It will not do to discuss looting at the expense of the anger of black Americans.

Many are pointing to the militarization of police — as evidenced by the presence of SWAT teams, advanced weapons, military gear — as a place to begin to counter their abuse. But the militarization of police is only the latest expression of the racial contract. It is true, as Alex Kane {argues}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/07/04/11_disturbing_facts_about_americas_militarized_police_force_partner/"">, the equipment of the war on terror is being brought home and directed at its black population. But the militarization of police is only the most recent symptom of the Racial Contract: Black Americans, Muslim Americans, and other brown folks — from migrant labor to refugee children — will be controlled and managed through the concerted efforts of an administration and Congress who will work on behalf of the wealthy, who like their streets clear of black Americans, their lawns and children attended by brown people, and their schools reserved for the children of the elite — even if it requires privatizing education. How else to explain the second-term election of a president who has {exculpated}<hyperlink=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/08/01/press-conference-president""> his predecessor’s administration from charges of torture, who has {strong-armed}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO2""> Congress into passing budget bills that extended increasing detention powers to the executive, who has {given}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0""> himself and his Cabinet the power to drone U.S. citizens and foreigners alike based on computer algorithms?

The militarization of police is but the expression of the general political will to militarize and expand police from the federal level down to the municipal level — this is what Homeland Security looks like. Demilitarizing the police will be a soothing symptom, but it will not stop the unaccountable murders or the political and social suppression of black Americans. As long as capital and power rest in the hands of the wealthy elite — as guaranteed by the legal creation of the mortgage and banking crises, and the lawful {failure}<hyperlink=""http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/10/the-great-betrayal-and-the-cynicism-of-calling-it-a-grand-bargain.html%22%20%5Cl%20%22more-3604""> of the current administration to hold any high-level bankster accountable, African-Americans will continue to be at the mercy of white supremacy.

But this story is neither old nor unfamiliar. Rather than asking “why,” let’s focus on the banal laws and policies needed to redirect the distribution of wealth — {stolen}<hyperlink=""http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archiv""> from {black Americans}<hyperlink=""https://newrepublic.com/article/117912/reparations-how-mortgage-market-hurts-african-americans"">, such that whites can no longer summon police, law or politicians on their behalf to erase or suppress black Americans, and other minorities.

Salon,salon2,http://www.salon.com/2014/08/19/they_are_no_longer_police_why_ferguson_reminds_us_that_we_are_not_exceptional/,They are no longer police: Why Ferguson reminds us that America is not exceptional,Josh Appelbaum,08/19/2014,03/16/2016,"Between Israel’s bloody war with Hamas, the brutal crusade by ISIS to reshape the Middle East and Russia’s continued aggression in Ukraine, it’s easy to focus our collective attention on the global chaos happening around us, while at the same time overlook what’s taking place right here in America.

Not anymore.

With the recent shooting of an unarmed African-American teen by police in Ferguson, Missouri, and the subsequent crackdown that has ensued, the domestic news blinders have been lifted. Suddenly, international headlines typically reserved for foreign wars and political conflicts have shifted from Israel, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine to the heartland of middle America.

The spark that lit the flame of unrest occurred on a Saturday afternoon earlier this month when Ferguson police gunned down an innocent college-bound teenager by the name of Michael Brown, littering his body with nearly a dozen bullets in broad daylight.

But what has catapulted the small-town tragedy into a global news event is how the police have responded to civilian protests demanding justice for Brown’s death.

They’ve used rubber bullets and tear gas to suppress peaceful demonstrators. They’ve arrested and assaulted journalists. They’ve illegally told reporters and civilians not to record video with their cellphones.

Aside from the egregious violation of civil liberties, the most worrying development of the crackdown is how the police have appeared and acted like soldiers, not law enforcement, treating the streets of Missouri as if they were the streets of Kabul or Baghdad.

Instead of black shoes, the “police” are wearing boots. Instead of blue uniforms they’re wearing camouflage and SWAT gear. Instead of holding batons in their hands, they’re armed to the teeth with assault rifles. Instead of keeping their sidearms in their holsters, they’re pointing sniper rifles directly at civilians, literally drawing a red dot on their chests as targets. They’re riding in armored trucks and Humvees with machine guns mounted on the roof, ready to fire at will.

Simply put, they are no longer police. They are a menacing, hyper-militarized militia, treating innocent civilians as “enemy combatants,” not American citizens worthy of protection.

A shameful double standard

While the exact circumstances of Michael Brown’s death remain unclear (police claim he reached for an officer’s gun, {an eyewitness says he did not}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlMjhoYPmZ8"">), what cannot be disputed is the horrific, shameful response to the shooting by the Ferguson police.

First off, the police let Brown’s body lie in the street for hours after his death, showing a repulsive lack of respect reminiscent of how pro-Russian separatists disgracefully treated bodies in the aftermath of the Malaysia Airlines crash over eastern Ukraine earlier this summer.

To make matters worse, nearly a week after Brown’s death, the police have still yet to charge the officer who killed Brown with a crime. This is the driving force motivating protesters to demonstrate against police.

Simply put, they are seeking justice.

The elephant in the room, which many cable news outlets have tried to gloss over, is the racial divide that exists at the center of the standoff between protesters and police.

The city of Ferguson is 67 percent African-American. The Ferguson police force is 94 percent white.

Because that statistic alone isn’t evidence of racism, it’s important to compare the Ferguson protests to others that we’ve seen recently in America.

For example, take the Bundy Ranch showdown in Nevada from earlier this year.

When federal authorities threatened to take Cliven Bundy’s cattle because he hadn’t paid grazing fees for over 20 years, a far-right, anti-government militia rushed to Bundy’s defense, pointing sniper rifles at government forces and vowing to “take them down” if they dared to proceed.

And what did the federal agents do when threatened with violence by an all-white militia?

They backed down, of course.

But in Ferguson, unarmed African-Americans protesting the death of a teenager are tear-gassed, assaulted and arrested.

The stark contrast between how authorities are treating the Ferguson protests versus how they handled the Bundy Ranch showdown is painfully obvious.

When confronted with white, heavily armed anti-government militias, the police walked away. When confronted with unarmed, peaceful African-American protesters with their arms in the air shouting “hands up, don’t shoot,” they bombarded them with tear gas, rubber bullets and a military force fit for warfare in Baghdad.

When the war comes home 

After a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the battles fought in the Middle East are returning to American soil.

Leftover military equipment from Kabul and Baghdad has been brought home, funneled to local police to use seemingly however they see fit.

As a result, American police are shifting from law enforcement to a paramilitary force, outfitted with heavy weaponry and machinery intended to fight terrorists, not unarmed civilians.

The problem here, aside from the obvious anti-democratic transition of law enforcement from those who protect and serve to those who intimidate and terrorize, is that it adds hostility and instigates fear and distrust in the hearts and minds of civilians.

The police are no longer here to protect us. They are here to provoke, antagonize and terrify us.

On a broader scale, what’s happening right now in Ferguson reminds us that we Americans are not exceptional. We are not morally superior to so-called third-world countries or immune to the type of police-civilian conflicts normally reserved for places like Egypt or Gaza or Iran.

In fact, in many ways we are no better than Mideast dictators who crack down on peaceful protesters routinely. The fact that suburban Missouri looks like Tahrir Square during the Arab Spring is a testament to that harsh reality.

Most terrifying of all is that this isn’t just taking place in Missouri. It’s happening all over the country. And unless we take a stand against the hyper-militarization of American police, we’re staring at a future where cops are extinct and soldiers take their place. And they won’t just use their superior military equipment to suppress and terrorize peaceful African-American protesters in suburban Missouri.

They’ll use it against all of us. Everywhere.",76,4000,The police are no longer here to protect us. They are a hyper-militarized militia that provokes and antagonizes,NA
Salon,salon3,http://www.salon.com/2014/08/13/bill_o%E2%80%99reillys_ferguson_disgrace_host_spews_sick_lecture_to_michael_browns_family/,Bill O’Reilly’s Ferguson disgrace: Host spews sick lecture to Michael Brown’s family,Joan Walsh,08/13/2014,03/16/2016,"Ever wake up thinking, maybe this is the day that I must criticize “many, many African-Americans”? After all, I didn’t criticize them yesterday. If I don’t criticize them today, I might regret waiting until tomorrow. The whole world might regret that I waited.

No? Well, apparently Bill O’Reilly did yesterday. Tuesday night, he went off on his infamous cable news show that sometimes doubles as an hour of moral instruction for black people, on the family of Ferguson, Missouri, police victim Michael Brown and their supporters who believe the cops must answer for shooting an unarmed teenager as he ran away.

I take long breaks between posts that criticize O’Reilly. I could do it every day. But the creepy paternalism of his comments about Michael Brown’s killing provides a window onto the worldview of aging authoritarian white conservatives, and it’s more than a matter of holding different political opinions from liberals. It was also fascinating to watch what happened when Dr. Ben Carson, Fox’s favorite expert on black culture, veered a tiny bit off script.

On Tuesday night’s “O’Reilly Factor,” the angry host addressed “Unrest in St. Louis.” But he didn’t merely rail against looters and rioters, as might have been expected. Instead, he took on Michael Brown’s parents for claiming their son had been wrongly killed. He showed a snippet of Don Lemon’s interview with Michael Brown Sr. and Leslie McSpadden, in which McSpadden collapses in tears and Brown says solemnly that if there is no justice for his son, there will be no peace.

In conversation with Carson, O’Reilly uncharacteristically expressed “100 percent confidence” that Attorney General Eric Holder – normally a Fox piñata — would make sure justice is done in the Brown case, and Carson agreed. O’Reilly even praised the local NAACP for condemning the looting, but blamed Rev. Al Sharpton for coming in and “agitating”; of course, Sharpton had immediately denounced the violence and asked for peaceful protest, as did Brown’s family and friends.

But it didn’t matter that Michael Brown Sr. had asked that looting and rioting stop. O’Reilly just couldn’t get over that clip of him referencing an old civil rights slogan, “No justice, no peace.” He went off:

Do we as a society — what do we do? Do we weigh in as the boy’s father — and if it were my son, I probably would have said same thing, but he’s obviously talking through an emotional prism. His son is dead. He believes, probably — I know he believes — that it was an injustice, that it was done for nothing, it was a murder. And many, many African-Americans believe that without knowing the facts. Do we criticize them, or do we remain silent?

Remaining silent is never an option for O’Reilly, so you know the answer already.

Now, there was a touch of empathy there. “If it were my son, I probably would have said the same thing.” Stay with that, Bill! Why not leave it there?

But no. Empathy is dangerous. Because Michael Brown’s father doesn’t know all “the facts.” He’s “talking through an emotional prism.” And “many, many African-Americans” agree with him. So O’Reilly and Carson must “criticize them,” or else.

Or else what, you might ask?

Or else “many, many African-Americans” will continue to believe something very different from what O’Reilly does.

But then, weirdly, Ben Carson goes off script. After blandly insisting conservatives must let the Brown family know “we feel their pain” while making clear “police are individuals too, they have feelings also,” Carson tells O’Reilly, “We must hear from this police officer.”

That’s interesting: That’s exactly what the Brown family wants too, but the Ferguson Police Department won’t even release his name, let alone allow him to face public questions. Carson went on: “You know, they are trained to shoot to kill, or shoot to stop. We need to hear why he decided to shoot to kill.”

O’Reilly literally harrumphed and cut him off. “Yes [clears throat] … well … I don’t think that’s going to happen. So you’re going to have the one side that’s suffered a terrible loss, and the other side’s not going to say anything, and that’s what we have to process.” Then he thanks Carson, who has apparently failed to help him “process” the right way, and abruptly ends the segment.

It was fascinating to watch the Fox host assume his innate moral and intellectual superiority to those “many, many African-Americans” who don’t trust authorities to do the right thing in the Michael Brown case. (Let’s remember Eric Holder wouldn’t likely be involved without the local protest.) It’s reminiscent of the good Christian leaders of the slaveholding South. These people O’Reilly is so concerned about must be instructed in the proper way to think, feel and respond to life. They obviously lack “the facts,” and implicitly they lack a lot more than the facts. They operate through an “emotional prism,” not the reason and intellect that explain the natural superiority of white people.

Now, normally Ben Carson is considered by Fox to be one of the few African-Americans with the moral and intellectual capacity to sit at the table with their grown-ups and discuss the failings of his people. I mean, discuss politics. But all of the sudden, like Michael Brown Sr., Carson had the audacity to approach the Ferguson police department with questions O’Reilly hadn’t pre-approved, so he got the hook, too. He’s probably “talking through an emotional prism” as well. I wonder if O’Reilly will have him back to talk about the case any time soon.",453,1000,The Fox host argued the unarmed teenager's supporters should trust the authorities.

Over a week’s worth of unrestrained police crackdowns, curfews and bad-faith machinations by the local law enforcement – all with the blessing or tacit approval of political leaders – will tend to erode whatever trust one has left in the people in charge.

One of the upsides to living in a democracy, though, is that there are regular opportunities to boot out the people in charge. And so, with the situation spiraling out of control in the streets, activists and community leaders have {set up voter registration drives}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/jesse-jackson-talks-voter-registration-at-ferguson-mcdonald-s/article_d789a49e-4957-5ba2-ae16-e03af805f00f.html""> in Ferguson. This act of civic engagement is drawing howls of outrage from conservatives and Republicans.

Before we get into the complaints from the right, let’s just take a moment to appreciate what is actually happening. Every night, the streets of Ferguson are filled with tear gas and less-than-lethal ordinance as cops decked out in military gear respond to protests over the killing of an unarmed black teenager. The situation is extremely tense and the threat of violence hangs over everything. In response to that, activists are saying to the community: “Yes, the system has failed you, so sign these forms and work within that same system to peacefully and proactively ameliorate the situation.”

And as ThinkProgress {points out}<hyperlink=""http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/18/3472278/this-is-the-most-important-reform-ferguson-can-enact-to-prevent-another-standoff/"">, low black voter turnout (combined with an unusual election calendar) has resulted in a local government that looks nothing like the population of Ferguson. The community is majority black, but the mayor is white, and five of the six City Council members are white. For members of the community who feel their interests aren’t being represented, the first step toward changing that is registering to vote.

For conservatives and the local GOP, this is apparently unconscionable. “If that’s not fanning the political flames, I don’t know what is,” the Missouri Republican Party executive director Matt Wills {told Breitbart News}<hyperlink=""http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/18/missouri-gop-michael-brown-voting-registration-booths-disgusting/"">. “I think it’s not only disgusting but completely inappropriate.” Again, this is in response to a voter registration drive in a majority black community.

Wills wasn’t quite through, though:

Wills explained that the shooting death of Michael Brown was a tragedy for everyone.

“This is not just a tragedy for the African American community this is a tragedy for the Missouri community as well as the community of what we call America,” he said. “Injecting race into this conversation and into this tragedy, not only is not helpful, but it doesn’t help a continued conversation of justice and peace.”

I don’t want to question the obvious expertise of a local Republican official, but I’m pretty sure that voter registration drives are not what’s responsible for “injecting race into this conversation and into this tragedy.”

Meanwhile, at the {Daily Caller}<hyperlink=""http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/19/jesse-jackson-liberal-activists-launch-voter-registration-drives-in-ferguson/"">, the push to sign people up to vote is given the full-on LIBERAL CONSPIRACY treatment:

Jesse Jackson and other liberal activists are rolling out voter registration efforts as part of a coordinated left-wing push to sign up voters during the wave of violent protests engulfing Ferguson, Missouri in the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting.

Racial activist and former Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson met with St. Louis clergy Monday to plan a formal Ferguson voter registration drive.

“Five thousand new voters will transform the city from top to bottom” Jackson explained during a stop at a Ferguson McDonald’s, where he discussed voter registration with local denizens.

Liberal activists — including from the George Soros-funded Center for Constitutional Rights — have promoted voter registration booths at multiple locations in Ferguson, including at the roadside memorial marking the spot where Brown was shot.

Jesse Jackson, George Soros, “coordinated left-wing push” – so many scary things!

Much of this whining is couched in terms of “politicizing” the death of Michael Brown, but that’s a hollow, lazy complaint made by people who don’t quite feel comfortable saying that they’re fine with the status quo. And it’s also baffling to see people complain, in the midst of a near total civic breakdown, that there are activists encouraging people to get involved to fix the root causes of the chaos. They’re evangelizing faith in the political system and encouraging people to act within established political norms. I’m not sure how one can view that as “disgusting” and “completely inappropriate.”",177,2000,Local activists in Ferguson are signing people up to vote.

Salon,salon5,http://www.salon.com/2014/08/16/this_has_always_been_america_ferguson_and_our_dangerous_delusions_on_race_and_democracy/,This has always been America: Ferguson and our dangerous delusions on race and democracy,Aaron Hanlon,08/16/2014,03/17/2016,"Politicians both left and right turn to the troubling doctrine of American exceptionalism to justify unilateral military intervention abroad, but what happens when we turn that dangerous delusion of unbounded moral supremacy against our own citizens on our own soil?

This is what’s happening in Ferguson, Missouri, right now, where it’s clear that the police have made an exception to the modus operandi of rights-based democracy by silencing and arresting journalists, seizing and firing on unarmed and peaceful demonstrators and applying military-grade armaments to do so.

And, lest we forget, they have initiated this armed state of exception to cover up for and suffocate dissent against the gravest rights violation of them all: the police shooting and killing of a fleeing, unarmed black boy, who never received due process for daring to step off the sidewalk.

As the nation and the world watch, horrified, at what’s transpiring in Ferguson, we don’t need to ask whether there’s a racial element in play when an overwhelmingly white police force, strapped to the teeth, is exercising extreme state authority to corral and suppress the reactions of a black community mourning the inexcusable loss of one of their children. But how is it possible for this to happen in a nation that proclaims itself the world’s greatest champion of freedom and democracy?  The answer, in part, is the logic of exceptionalism.

American exceptionalism — perhaps the most prominent of exceptionalist doctrines — is the idea that the U.S. is qualitatively different from and morally superior to the rest of the world, such that it should act and be treated according to its own special set of rules. We’ve seen this kind of logic in action for decades now. It might not be wholly moral to suspend or violate the law and threaten violence against anyone who stands in your path; but if you believe you’re saving the world from communism, terrorism, “rogue states,” dictators, Muslim “extremists,” nuclear threats, or “suspicious persons,” it becomes a lot easier to justify abridgements of rights and abnegation of sacredly held legal and moral codes.

The U.S. government that admits it “tortured some folks” doesn’t generally believe that torture is OK; instead, it made a few exceptions.

The U.S. government — and, I should add, the libertarian right — doesn’t generally believe that it’s OK to wiretap citizens without due process, to execute citizens abroad without due process, or to hold the accused indefinitely without due process; but again, with the right justifications and exigencies in play, they’ve made some exceptions.

The U.S. Constitution doesn’t generally suggest it’s OK to stop and frisk, let alone shoot citizens of any race or creed without reasonable suspicion and cause; but under the “right” circumstances, we make exceptions.

The objective is never to violate rights, compromise sacred principles and murder the innocent; the objective is to “save the world,” which the proponent of exceptionalism sees as a den of iniquity, decaying all around us. The logic of exceptionalism works, then, by falling into and rhetorically reinforcing the delusion that your moral superiority puts you above the laws and customs of everyone else.

We witness in Ferguson a microcosm of this logic, where agents of the state have turned the doctrine of exceptionalism on our own people to justify the suspension of basic civil rights. If basic civil rights dictate due process, black Americans are the exception. If basic civil rights dictate freedom of the press, those journalists arrested for doing their jobs are the exception. If basic civil rights dictate free expression and peaceable assembly, the crowds in Ferguson taking rubber-bullet flack and choking on clouds of tear gas are the exception. The problem with so many exceptions, however, is that they risk becoming the rule.

For this reason it’s crucial that we understand how this logic of exceptionalism works, whether in matters foreign or domestic. The logic of exceptionalism means that someone can always make an exception of you, or of the codes in place meant to protect you. The same groups who rallied behind actual criminal Cliven Bundy’s resistance to the federal government are nowhere to be found after Ferguson police shot unarmed Michael Brown and then all but declared martial law in Ferguson.

The people threatening census workers who show up on their property weren’t protesting when black Arizona professor Ersula Ore was cuffed and slammed to the ground for jaywalking around a construction site.

The most skeptical, rights-aware libertarians remain silent when the world tries to justify the physical assault, strangling and shooting of black Americans by saying they shouldn’t have “resisted arrest” or feared the imposing white man with a gun trying to tackle them for no conceivable reason. “Don’t tread on me,” “Second Amendment solutions” and the occasional “refreshing” of the “tree of liberty” “with the blood of patriots and tyrants” only become slogans of the most extreme and at times violent white resistance, against which the actions of questioning black professors and scared black youths are mild and rational by any axis of comparison.

It would be easy enough to account for this disparity of support for the victims of government overreach by calling it hypocrisy; but it’s bigger than that. This systematic, racial partitioning of who is allowed to resist and keep their life and dignity is the logic of exceptionalism in action.

As the St. Louis County police chief says, “we’ve done everything we can to demonstrate a remarkable amount of restraint.” The only way he could plausibly understand the actions of Ferguson police as remarkably restrained is if he considers his purpose morally and circumstantially exceptional, bigger and more important than the Bill of Rights itself.

Cole has released a track to honor Brown’s memory and comment on the racial profiling of young black men in America. 

[tweetbegin 500195498314432513 tweetend]

The two-time Grammy Award nominee doesn’t rap on the raw, stripped-down track, called “Be Free.” Instead, he sings with the accompaniment of a piano and samples of eyewitness reports from Ferguson: “All we wanna do is break the chains off/ All we wanna do is be free.”

“There was a time in my life when I gave a fuck,” Cole wrote on his blog, introducing the song. “Every chance I got I was screaming about it. I was younger. It’s so easy to try to save the world when you’re in college,” he wrote.

But as we grow older and gain responsibilities, “We become distracted. We become numb. I became numb,” he continued. “But not anymore. That coulda been me, easily. It could have been my best friend. I’m tired of being desensitized to the murder of black men. I don’t give a fuck if it’s by police or peers. This shit is not normal.”

“I made a song. This is how we feel.”

On his Soundcloud page, he dedicated the song to “every young black man murdered in America.”",3,115,"The track is dedicated to ""every young black man murdered in America.""",NA

Some right-wingers, like libertarian Justin Raimondo of Antiwar.com {shot back}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/JustinRaimondo/status/499804420477964288""> at me (figuratively) on Twitter, arguing that “The Bundy patriots didn’t take BS from the cops. They stood and fought,” adding that the Ferguson protesters were facing the “same fight” and, had those protesters only brought guns with them, the police would have backed down. Or something.

“Would the cops be murdering blacks in #Ferguson if the people were armed? No,” Raimondo told me, as if he just arrived in the U.S. from some other planet. “Armed resistance tends to discourage aggression,” he insisted, between some silly ad hominem bluster in which he charged me with {“worship[ing]”}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/JustinRaimondo/status/499807589555638275""> the government, and {“lov[ing] the state that murders blacks”}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/JustinRaimondo/status/499809174738317314""> (also of being a {“loser”}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/JustinRaimondo/status/499814300920184832""> with a {“fat ass”}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/JustinRaimondo/status/499803451526635521""> or some such, but that’s even easier to laugh at).

And then something changed on the streets of Ferguson Thursday night, if only momentarily, which made Raimondo’s comments seem even more transparently silly.

After the fully-militarized police were pulled away, ordered by the Missouri Governor to be replaced by grown-ups who marched with the protesters, calm and even jubilance returned to the previously tear gas-filled streets of Ferguson, MO. The contrast on Thursday night from the days prior couldn’t have been more stark, according to virtually everyone on the ground there. It was the police, not the protesters, who had exacerbated roiling racial tensions, {arrested reporters}<hyperlink=""http://www.bradblog.com/?p=10760""> and needlessly filled the streets with panic and tear gas in the days prior, just as assuredly as it was a Ferguson cop, finally {named as Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/ferguson-chief-names-darren-wilson-cop-who-shot-michael-brown-n181326"">, who killed Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teen who was supposedly stopped for nothing more than alleged jay-walking.

It was not armed resistance, but peaceful resistance last week that brought about real, if tenuous, change in Ferguson, and maybe even the rest of the country.

So what had changed from Wednesday’s riots to Thursday’s night calm and jubilation? The militarized police of Ferguson and St. Louis County had been replaced by new leadership from the State Police Highway Patrol and the City of St. Louis.

It was a stunning turnaround. Where I {previously wrote}<hyperlink=""http://www.bradblog.com/?p=10761""> that I was embarrassed for my home town (I grew up in St. Louis County), I am now very proud of those courageous citizens who stood up to do the right thing, and of the elected and law enforcement officials who eventually did the same.

The jubilation was short-lived. The next day and over the weekend, tensions flared up again after initial calm under the command of Captain Ron Johnson. A bit of a behind-the-scenes power struggle seems to continue to roil, with Ferguson’s Police Chief Thomas Jackson asserting that he was {“still in the County-being-in-charge mode”}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/watch/ferguson-police-extend-pattern-of-bungling-318691395821""> on Friday, despite the State and City police having been assigned by the Governor to take over command in Ferguson.

Despite requests {from the Governor}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/jay-nixon-michael-brown_n_5685775.html"">, as well as {from the DoJ}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/feds-urged-police-not-release-michael-brown-robbery-video-n182346""> — Jackson also {released a video}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/08/16/pkg-lavandera-who-is-darren-wilson.cnn""> purporting to show Michael Brown shoplifting some cigars from a convenience store just before his killing. Later, the Ferguson Police Chief {admitted}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html""> the alleged robbery had nothing to do with the killing. Wilson, the cop eventually named as the one who shot Brown, at least six times according to reports of the unreleased autopsy, was said to have been unaware of the alleged robbery at the time he attempted to detain Brown before killing him.

Spotty violence and some looting (much of which was tamped down by local protesters themselves) flared over the weekend after Governor Jay Nixon declared that First Amendment rights would not be available to Ferguson protesters between Midnight and 5am local time during, so far, several nights of curfews. He has now ordered the Missouri National Guard to the area.

Still, it was the stark, almost {cartoonish fire power of the militarized local County and Ferguson police}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2014/08/15/police-militarization-in-america-1033-orig-mg.cnn/video/playlists/police-use-of-force/""> which seems to have horrified the nation as much or more than anything else since the killing of Michael Brown. That outrageously military-like response to generally peaceful, if justifiably angry protests has, to date, left an indelible question mark on just what the hell our nation has become.

There remain many challenges for the community between now and real accountability for the police shooting death of Brown. But, for the moment anyway, something substantive seems to have occurred in Ferguson. The police were nationally shamed for their ridiculous, over-aggressive and unnecessarily hostile tactics.

Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul were led to {condemn}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> their militarization, describing it as a “systemic problem with today’s law enforcement.” The {DoJ stepped in}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/after-holders-complaints-justice-department-expects-less-mil#.al2Jd8LDe0""> to instruct local law enforcement how to scale back the militarized police presence. Georgia’s Democratic Congressman Hank Johnson {unveiled}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/hank-johnson-stop-militarizing-law-enforcement-act""> the {Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act [PDF]}<hyperlink=""http://hankjohnson.house.gov/sites/hankjohnson.house.gov/files/assets/Stop%20Militarizing%20Law%20Enforcement%20Act.pdf""> to “prevent the {transfer}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/ferguson-missouri-militarized-police-1033-program""> of certain military-grade equipment from the Department of Defense to local law enforcement agencies.”

To be sure, similarly over-aggressive, over-militarized, over-“Hollywoodized” police actions occurred against peaceful protesters in cities across the country during the brutal armed crackdowns on Occupy Wall Street demonstrations {in late 2011}<hyperlink=""http://www.bradblog.com/?p=8929""> and {early 2012}<hyperlink=""http://www.bradblog.com/?p=9097"">. We condemned it then, we condemn it now. For whatever reasons, peaceful resistance at the time, unlike this time around, did not lead to calls for change from public officials. Perhaps after Occupy and the sight of the Boston Police turning into a full-fledged army in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, and now this, we’ve reached a tipping point. We’ll see.

In any case, for now, a recognition of the need for substantive change, at least in regard to this kind of over-aggressive policing, at least in this town, at least for this moment, seems to have occurred. And much of it appears to have occurred in response to simple embarrassment of what our police forces have become in the face of largely peaceful protests, none of which, at the time, ever posed any real threat to the lives of police or anybody else…at least until the police themselves exacerbated existing tensions.

Contrast that to what happened following the use of assault rifles pointed at the heads of local, state and federal officials by so-called “patriotic” “Tea Party” protesters during the Bundy Ranch standoff earlier this year. Yes, in that case, law enforcement officials also, ultimately, “backed down.” But they backed down to avoid what was a hair-trigger’s pull away from unspeakable violence. They would ultimately go on to use different means to work towards holding the scofflaw rancher accountable for unpaid debts, and the militarized protesters in this case, would hang out in the area for months, parading their guns about, frightening local residents, and bickering with each other until, eventually, most of them seem to have moved on — back to their survival gardens or storm shelters, or whatever. They certainly didn’t show up to protect freedom and liberty and the blatant trampling of actual Constitutional Rights in Missouri.

Where the Ferguson demonstrations made the police look silly and dangerous, the armed-up protesters in Nevada made themselves look silly. More importantly, they actually provided, ironically, a twisted form of support to the notion that law enforcement needs to arm itself up, if only in self-defense.

In any event, little changed after the dangerous armed stand-off in the Nevada desert. Real change may come about, eventually, thanks to the peaceful — and very brave — resistance of the unarmed protesters in Ferguson.

If Antiwar.com’s Raimondo, or anybody else, still believes the answer to a militarized police state is the militarization of the people, they are certainly welcome to that opinion. Had triggers been pulled at the Bundy standoff, however, as they have been before in similar cases, I suspect the government’s guns and ammo would have lasted much longer than the armed “patriots” of the “Tea Party.” It was a battle to be either lost by those citizens, or drawn to the temporary stalemate we ultimately saw, one most likely to occur again.

In the meantime, the resilient Americans of Ferguson seem to be working to demonstrate, at least for now, that there is a much better, much safer, more courageous, much more peaceful, and ultimately much more substantive way to take on the over-aggressive militarized powers of this country’s post-9/11 police state. But perhaps the real patriots of Ferguson have more experience battling real enemies of freedom.",399,11000,Bundy engaged in armed resistance to avoid paying fees.

But the {Klan}<hyperlink=""https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2010/essay-ku-klux-klan""> –– desperate for publicity and any opportunity to spread hate and terror –– is climbing atop the powder keg that Ferguson has become following {the police killing}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/11/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-of-an-unarmed-black-teenager-in-missouri/""> of an unarmed college-bound black teenager last Saturday.

The South Carolina-based New Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan says its Missouri chapter is raising money for the still unidentified white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, 18, who was scheduled to begin college classes this week.

“We are setting up a reward/fund for the police officer who shot this thug,” the Klan group said in an email. “He is a hero! We need more white cops who are anti-Zog and willing to put Jewish controlled black thugs in their place. Most cops are cowards and do nothing while 90% of interracial crime is black (and non-white) on white.”

In a Tuesday editorial about the case headlined {“The Death of Michael Brown: Racial History Behind the Ferguson Protests,”}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/opinion/racial-history-behind-the-ferguson-protests.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7b%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22%7d&_r=1""> The New York Times expressed hope that the FBI will be able “to answer the many questions surrounding the death” of the teenager” while focusing on St. Louis’ history of racial problems.

“[I]t doesn’t take a federal investigation to understand the history of racial segregation, economic inequality and overbearing law enforcement that produced so much of the tension now evident on the streets,” the editorial said. “St. Louis has long been one of the nation’s most segregated metropolitan areas, and there remains a high wall between black residents – who overwhelmingly have lower incomes – and the white power structure that dominates City Councils and police departments like the ones in Ferguson.”

Brown –– dressed in shorts and flip flops –– was reportedly shot multiple times in broad daylight after he and a friend were confronted by the officer for walking in the middle of the street in Ferguson, a predominately African American suburb of St. Louis. Police officials say Brown assaulted the officer and tried to wrestle away his gun before fleeing and being shot. At least one shot was fired in the police cruiser during the struggle, police say.

Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson, 22, told a radically different version of events. He told reporters that he and Brown were close to their destination when confronted by the officer, who angrily told them to get out of the street. Suddenly, the friend said, the officer grabbed Brown by the neck and tried to pull him into the police car. Brown broke free and both young men began running away when Brown was struck by a bullet. He turned and raised his hands in surrender only to be shot several more times, dying where he fell.

Brown’s body lay in the street for several hours as police gathered evidence and the neighborhood’s shock turned to rage. Three days of protests, some of it violent, followed. A gas station/convenience store was burned. There was some looting. Police in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd of mostly angry African Americans. But there were whites marching in some of the protests as well, holding up their hands in surrender as Brown had reportedly done, chanting, “Don’t shoot.”

The one thing everyone seems to agree on is that Brown was unarmed, a fact that prompted President Obama to call Brown’s death {“heartbreaking”}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3105013/obama-death-of-michael-brown-heartbreaking/""> while urging calm. The Justice Department has begun an investigation into the killing.

The social turmoil that has erupted around Brown’s death has proven too appealing for the Klan, which in recent weeks has been quick to capitalize on a series of racially charged news events. Last week, for example, a Klan chapter in Arizona called for “corpses” in response to a feared influx of children seeking asylum as violence in Latin America forced their families to send them northward. But about St. Louis, their rhetoric has turned vile and predictable.

“We know that Michael Brown was nothing more than a punk. The media and others are painting him out to be a ‘good son’ and ‘great kid.’ The blacks of Missouri are showing their love of him by rioting, attacking and shooting people. Nothing new,” the chapter wrote on its blog.

Email requests to Imperial Wizard Chuck Murray on Wednesday were not answered.

Activists in St. Louis, however, have been focusing on calming tensions. There were two separate rallies for peace and justice held in the area Tuesday night, according to the {St. Louis Post Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/"">. At one, attended by about 400 people, including a large number of local ministers, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told the standing-room only crowd, “Justice must not simply be pursued, but in fact achieved.”

The other rally was held by Rev. Sharpton, who told Hatewatch there were about 1,500 people in attendance at the Greater St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church just east of Ferguson. At one point, Sharpton asked for 100 young men to volunteer and join what he’s calling the Disciples of Justice –– the DJs –– “to do our own unarmed patrols.” At least 170 men signed up.

Sharpton told Hatewatch today that he has found, especially among the young black students in Ferguson, “a lot of outrage, a lot of it could have been me, a lot of, this was an execution.”

Sharpton said he was returning to New York City today to prepare for a march in the borough of Staten Island to protest the death there of Eric Garner, 43, a black father of six, who died after a white police officer applied a banned chokehold even as Garner pleaded 11 times, “I can’t breathe.”

“You cannot have racial profiling as a police strategy and not end up with this as a result in Ferguson and Staten Island,” Sharpton told Hatewatch.",46,3000,"Desperate for publicity and any opportunity to spread hate, the KKK said more white cops should follow suit",NA

Releasing the video only stoked further outrage, as it appeared that the Ferguson police were {trying to disparage the character}<hyperlink=""http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/17/3472208/nixon-video-not-right/""> of the victim (the police chief later acknowledged that the robbery had nothing to do with Brown’s shooting). The Justice Department had {asked the police not to release the video}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/feds-urged-police-not-release-michael-brown-robbery-video-n182346""> out of concern that it would spark unrest.

That’s not a track record anyone can be proud of (save for the St. Louis County police chief, who {described}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-police-shooting-08132014-story.html""> the above actions as the product of “a remarkable amount of restraint”). And yet, segments of the conservative pundit world are doing what they can to defend the Ferguson cops, or least deflect blame for the escalation away from them.

Last Wednesday night, as Ferguson police were lobbing tear gas at peaceful protesters, Fox News’ Martha MacCallum, sitting in for Megyn Kelly, put together a {news segment and a panel discussion}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/martha-maccallum-black-panthers-ferguson?utm_content=buffer1f462&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer""> on the threat posed by the presence of one or two New Black Panther Party members among the protesters. “Let’s start with this, this Black Panther issue,” MacCallum told her guests, “because the FBI is very concerned about this and when I went on the Facebook page today of the leader of this group, Chawn Kweli, it was astonishing to me the things that he is saying on his Facebook page.”

That same evening, Sean Hannity {interviewed}<hyperlink=""http://video.foxnews.com/v/3729366847001/ferguson-police-chief-reacts-to-shooting-of-unarmed-teen/#sp=show-clips""> Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson and teed up some leading questions that helped Jackson cast police actions as a response to violence from protesters. On the issue of concealing the identity of the officer who shot Brown, Hannity prefaced the question by citing the New Black Panthers, Louis Farrakhan, death threats, Al Sharpton, threatening graffiti, and looting:

HANNITY: I understand that the police officer – there’s been a lot of death threats against him, a lot of volatility. You’ve got the New Black Panther Party, Louis Farrakhan has spoken out, the Reverend Al Sharpton is there. You’ve had the chanting – you have a sign up there, the only good cop is a dead cop. There’s been rioting and loot, etc. going on. That has prevented you from releasing the name of the officer. Some have questioned the wisdom of that – the public’s right to know versus the safety of the officer. Are you balancing that?

On Friday night, {glibertarian}<hyperlink=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GLIBERTARIAN""> homunculus Greg Gutfeld gave the Ferguson police every justification for their actions. “You can’t stop anarchy with a stern look,” said the same guy who used the word “fascism” to {describe people who complained}<hyperlink=""http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/the-five/article/2014/07/09/gutfeld-feeling-fascists-strike-again""> about an airline’s promotional video.

Even before the Ferguson police released any info pertaining to Brown’s involvement in the convenience store theft, a sizable portion of the online right was doing everything it could to {paint Brown as a dangerous gang member}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-ugly-smearing-of-michael-brown.html""> (with the all-too-obvious suggestion that his death was deserved).

Reactions like these are noteworthy not just for their implied tolerance of real abuses of authority, but also because there were {plenty of other conservatives}<hyperlink=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/militarization-liberals-and-libertarians-agree.html""> who {harshly came down}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/right-blogs-pundits-react-to-ferguson-110014""> on the Ferguson police.

But the fact that this divide persists even in the face of such flagrant abuses as the ones we saw in Ferguson suggests something else is at play, and I think part of it comes down to how certain conservatives define their worldview. People like Hannity and {Fox News cretins who troll around on Twitter}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/12/this-fox-news-personality-has-the-absolute-dumbest-things-to-say-about-the-michael-brown-tragedy.html""> identify as conservative, but often it seems like a lot of the opinions they espouse are simply “anti-liberal.” It’s ideology by reflex: If liberals support it, I don’t; if liberals hate it, I support it.

And so when protests erupt over a cop killing an unarmed black teenager, it’s crucial – absolutely crucial – that photos of the victim flashing “gang signs” be plastered all over the internet. When Ferguson police use military-grade weaponry against unarmed people protesting what they believe was a racially motivated shooting, it’s necessary to point out that there are some very dangerous New Black Panthers in the area.

Salon,salon10,http://www.salon.com/2014/08/14/nightmare_in_ferguson_cops_become_a_brutal_occupying_force/,Nightmare in Ferguson: Cops become a brutal occupying force,Joan Walsh,08/13/2014,03/22/2016,"The news and images from the conflict between a stunningly militarized police force and peaceful community protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, were horrifying Wednesday night, even before reporters from the Washington Post and Huffington Post were arrested, and MSNBC’s Trymaine Lee was tear-gassed and terrorized.

Let’s be clear: Michael Brown’s killing remains the horror here, but the cops’ continued brutality, against peaceful protesters and reporters, has been appalling. Every news anchor should broadcast from Ferguson on Thursday.

Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of Huffington Post were arrested after police tried to clear out a McDonald’s in which they were working. MSNBC.com’s Trymaine Lee, who has been doing crucial reporting from Ferguson (as he has from so many scenes of violence and police-community conflict this year), was choking on tear gas, and could barely speak, as he tried to narrate the chaos on MSNBC’s “Last Word” Wednesday night. Lee said cops began lobbing tear gas and flash grenades within only 15 seconds of warning the crowd.

“This looks like a textbook case of what not to do,” Sherrilyn Ifill of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund told Lawrence O’Donnell.

On the 49th anniversary of the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles, it’s important to remember that the famous Kerner Commission established to look at 1960s urban upheavals found that virtually every “riot” was triggered by police brutality – and that has continued in our own time, from the so-called Rodney King riots in 1992 through today. On MSNBC Ifill indicted the failures of police training and culture that led not only to the killing of Michael Brown, but also the overreaction to every night of protests.

But Ifill also made the important point that the militarization of the Ferguson police is something entirely new and enormously disturbing. The images Wednesday night should wake all of us up to the alarming militarization of local cops all over the country. How did a local police department get tanks and trucks and body armor that look like it all was designed for the streets of Baghdad and not a little city outside St. Louis?

I know the answer; good journalists have been reporting on this for a while. I apologize for not writing about this sooner. This is a bipartisan disaster that ought to be inspiring a renewal of bipartisan cooperation between civil libertarians of every political stripe. Yet local and national political leaders have been under-involved.

Alderman Antonio French has become a folk hero on Twitter for his on-the-ground reporting. But Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, has been mostly AWOL, and Sen. Claire McCaskill belatedly tweeted that she’s communicating with the Justice Department Wednesday night. (While her tweet seemed belated, I should note that McCaskill had been in touch with the Justice Department before that.) Missouri’s other senator, Republican Roy Blunt, has said nothing. In this obvious libertarian moment, Sen. Rand Paul has been silent, reportedly fundraising in the Hamptons this week. (Update: Paul just wrote {this}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> for Time.)

President Obama lamented the killing of Brown, and Attorney General Eric Holder announced the Justice Department will investigate it, but the administration has said nothing to date about the police department brutality using federally funded weaponry.

Michael Brown’s killing was awful enough, but the Ferguson police department’s crude and brutal crackdown on protest reminds us that the so-called war on terror is now terrorizing innocent people — in this country too.

Salon,salon11,http://www.salon.com/2014/08/12/in_defense_of_black_rage_michael_brown_police_and_the_american_dream/,"In defense of black rage: Michael Brown, police and the American dream",Brittney Cooper,08/12/2014,03/22/2016,"On Saturday a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager on his way to college this week. Brown was shot multiple times, though his hands were in the air. His uncovered body was left in the street for hours, as a crowd from his neighborhood gathered to stand vigil. Then they marched down to the police station. On Sunday evening, some folks in the crowd looted a couple of stores and threw bottles at the police. Monday morning was marked by peaceful protests.

The people of Ferguson are angry. Outraged. The officer’s story is dubious. Any black kid with sense knows it is futile to reach into an officer’s vehicle and take his gun.  That story is only plausible to people who believe that black people are animals, that black men go looking for cops to pick fights with. Absurdity. {Eyewitness accounts like these}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfy5FiqzWHI&sns=em""> make far more sense.

It seems far easier to focus on the few looters who have reacted unproductively to this tragedy than to focus on the killing of Michael Brown. Perhaps looting seems like a thing we can control. I refuse. I refuse to condemn the folks engaged in these acts, because I respect black rage. I respect black people’s right to cry out, shout and be mad as hell that another one of our kids is dead at the hands of the police. Moreover I refuse the lie that the opportunism of a few in any way justifies or excuses the murderous opportunism undertaken by this as yet anonymous officer.

The police mantra is “to serve and to protect.” But with black folks, we know that’s not the mantra. The mantra for many, many officers when dealing with black people is apparently “kill or be killed.”

It is that deep irrational fear of young black men that continues to sit with me.  Here’s the thing: I do not believe that most white people see black people and say, “I hate black people.”  Racism is not that tangible, that explicit. I do not believe most white people hate most black people. I do not believe that most police officers seek to do harm or consciously hate black people. At least I hope they don’t.

I believe that racism exists in the inexplicable sense of fear, unsafety and gnawing anxiety that white people, be they officers with guns or just general folks moving about their lives, have when they encounter black people. I believe racism exists in that sense of mistrust, the {extra precautions white people take}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/08/sketchfactor-app-white-creators_n_5660205.html""> when they encounter black people. I believe all these emotions have emerged from a lifetime of media consumption subtly communicating that black people are criminal, a lifetime of seeing most people in power look just like you, a lifetime of being the majority population. And I believe this subconscious sense of having lost control (of the universe) exists for white people, at a heightened level since the election of Barack Obama and the continued explosion of the non-white population.

The irony is that black people understand this heightened anxiety. We feel it, too. We study white people. We are taught this as a tool of survival. We know when there is unrest in the souls of white folks. We know that unrest, if not assuaged quickly, will lead to black death. Our suspicions, unlike those of white people, are proven right time and time again.

I speak to this deep psychology of race, not because I am trying to engage in pop psychology but because we live in a country that is so deeply emotionally dishonest about both race and racism. When will we be honest enough to acknowledge that the police have more power than the ordinary citizen? They are supposed to. And with more power comes more responsibility.

Why are {police calling the people of Ferguson animals}<hyperlink=""http://www.colorlines.com/articles/police-officer-calls-ferguson-protestors-animals""> and yelling at them to “bring it”? Because those officers in their riot gear, with their tear gas and dogs, want a justification for slaughter. But inexplicably in that moment we turn our attention to the rioters, the people with less power, but justifiable anger, and say, “You are the problem.” No. A cop killing an unarmed teenager who had his hands in the air is the problem. Anger is a perfectly reasonable response. So is rage.

We are talking about justifiable outrage. Outrage over the unjust taking of the lives of people who look like us. How dare people preach and condescend to these people and tell them not to loot, not to riot?  Yes, those are destructive forms of anger, but frankly I would rather these people take their anger out on property and products rather than on other people.

No, I don’t support looting. But I question a society that always sees the product of the provocation and never the provocation itself. I question a society that values property over black life. But I know that our particular system of law was conceived on the founding premise that black lives are white property. “Possession,” the old adage goes, “is nine-tenths of the law.”

But we are the dispossessed. We cannot count on the law to protect us. We cannot count on police not to shoot us down in cold blood. We cannot count on politics to be a productive outlet for our rage. We cannot count on prayer to soothe our raging, ragged souls.

This is what I mean when I say that we live in a society that is deeply emotionally dishonest about racism. We hear a story each and every week now about how some overzealous officer has killed another black man, or {punched}<hyperlink=""http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/marlene-pinnock-los-angeles-woman-punched-by-patrolman-speaks-out-1.9020819""> or {beaten}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/30/justice/arizona-jaywalking-arrest/""> or {choked}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/28/pregnant-woman-chokehold-nypd-rosan-miller_n_5628306.html""> a black woman. This week we heard two stories – Mike Brown in Missouri and {John Crawford in Ohio}<hyperlink=""http://newsone.com/3042992/john-crawford-ohio-police-walmart/"">. These are not isolated incidents. How many cops in how many cities have to murder how many black men — assault how many black women — before we recognize that this shit is not isolated? It is systemic from the top to the bottom.

Every week we are having what my friend Dr. Regina Bradley called #anotherhashtagmemorial. Every week. We are weak. We are tired. Of being punching bags and shooting targets for the police. We are tired of well-meaning white citizens and respectable black ones foreclosing all outlets for rage. We are tired of these people telling us what isn’t the answer.

The answer isn’t looting, no. The answer isn’t rioting, no. But the answer also isn’t preaching to black people about “black-on-black” crime without full acknowledgment that most crime is intraracial. The answer is not having a higher standard for the people than for the police. The answer is not demanding that black people get mad about and solve the problem of crime in Chicago before we get mad about the slaughter of a teen boy just outside St. Louis.

We can be, and have been, and are mad about both. Violence is the effect, not the cause of the concentrated poverty that locks that many poor people up together with no conceivable way out and no productive way to channel their rage at having an existence that is adjacent to the American dream. This kind of social mendacity about the way that racism traumatizes black people individually and collectively is a festering sore, an undiagnosed cancer, a raging infection threatening to overtake every organ in our body politic.

We are tired of these people preaching a one-sided gospel of peace. “Turn the other cheek” now means “here are our collective asses to kiss.” We are tired of forgiving people because they most assuredly do know what they do.

Mike Brown is dead. He is dead for no reason. He is dead because a police officer saw a 6-foot-4, 300-plus-pound black kid, and miscalculated the level of threat. To be black in this country is to be subject to routine forms of miscalculated risk each and every day.  Black people have every right to be angry as hell about being mistaken for predators when really we are prey. The idea that we would show no rage as we accrete body upon body – Eric Garner, John Crawford, Mike Brown (and those are just our summer season casualties) — is the height of delusion. It betrays a stunning lack of empathy, a stunning refusal of people to grant the fact of black humanity, and in granting our humanity, granting us the right to the full range of emotions that come with being human. Rage must be expressed. If not it will tear you up from the inside out or make you tear other people up. Usually the targets are those in closest proximity. The disproportionate amount of heart disease, cancers, hypertension, obesity, violence and other maladies that plague black people is as much a product of internalized, unrecognized, unaddressed rage as it is anything else.

Nothing makes white people more uncomfortable than black anger. But nothing is more threatening to black people on a systemic level than white anger. It won’t show up in mass killings. It will show up in overpolicing, mass incarceration, the gutting of the social safety net, and the occasional dead black kid. Of late, though, these killings have been far more than occasional. We should sit up and pay attention to where this trail of black bodies leads us.  They are a compass pointing us to a raging fire just beneath the surface of our national consciousness. We feel it. We hear it. Our nostrils flare with the smell of it.

James Baldwin called it “the fire next time.” A fire shut up in our bones. A sentient knowledge, a kind of black epistemology, honed for just such a time as this. And with this knowledge, a clarity that says if “we live by the sword, we will die by it.”

Then, black rage emerges prophetic from across the decades in the words of Harlem Renaissance poet Claude McKay who penned these words 95 years ago in response to the {Red Summer of 1919}<hyperlink=""http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_red.html"">.

If we must die, let it not be like hogs

And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!

Although the withholding of the shooter’s identity was what the department was most criticized for, the announcement of simply the name “Darren Wilson” does little to quell public unrest. Surely, an avalanche of questions followed the announcement: “How old is he?” “What does he look like?” “Where is he now?” None of these questions was answered and no further information was offered, leading to more confusion than ever about what really happened.

Here is what Jackson said:

From 11:48 to noon, the officer involved in the shooting was on a sick call on Glenark [Drive], there was an ambulance present. At 11:51 there was a 911 call from a convenience store nearby. At 11:52, dispatch gave a description of a robbery suspect over the radio. A different officer arrived at the store where the strong-arm robbery occurred.

The ambulance that was at the sick case at Glenark was coming by immediately following the shooting and they did respond to assess Michael Brown.

Immediately after, Jackson and his cohorts handed out an information packet about the events of the day. The {19-page}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/WesleyLowery/status/500287584921083904""> packet only contained information from the incident report, in which a suspect (allegedly Michael Brown) stole several packs of Swisher Sweets cigars from a convenience store.

Emanuel Cleaver: Ferguson looks like Iraq,Ian Blair,08/19/2014,03/22/2016,"After nearly two weeks of military fatigued gunmen, heavily armored tanks, clashes between political protesters and the state, smoke bombs, tear gas, sniper rifles, (alleged) Molotov cocktails, skirmishes and (reported) gunfire, Missouri congressman Emanuel Cleaver {expressed his frustration}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/emanuel-cleaver-ferguson-reaction-110139""> about the events transpiring in Ferguson, Missouri. In an interview with MSNBC, the Kansas City-area Democrat likened the situation in Ferguson to Iraq: “Ferguson resembles Fallujah more than it does Ferguson,” Rep. Cleaver said.

The congressman’s words come a day after President Barack Obama {announced}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/running-transcript-obamas-remarks-on-ferguson-mo-and-iraq/2014/08/18/ed29d07a-2713-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html""> that he was sending Attorney General Eric Holder to Ferguson to continue his Department of Justice investigation in-person into the death of Michael Brown, an African-American teenager and aspiring musician, who was killed by a white Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson. Tensions in the community — between protesters, police and members of the press — have swelled.

Yesterday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency, calling in reinforcements to deescalate what has become a nine-day period of marching, protesting and unrest in the wake of Brown’s death.

Over the weekend, Rep. Cleaver visited St. Louis to survey the scene, {concluding}<hyperlink=""http://fox4kc.com/2014/08/16/congressman-emanuel-cleaver-visits-kansas-city-shares-thoughts-on-ferguson/""> that the entire police department in Ferguson seemed “monumentally inept” at dealing with the situation. The congressman also condemned the militarized police force.

“Having military style weaponry moving down the main street of a middle-American town is as un-American as a coup d’état rather than an election,” said Mr. Cleaver. “I think that is obscene. And we’ve got to stop it because the police chief in Ferguson himself said we haven’t had training on this equipment, and yet, the world saw police officers with military helmets sitting in front of machine guns, pointing them at the crowd.”

Some have called for President Obama to travel to Ferguson to pacify some of the angst. But Mr. Cleaver cautioned against that.

“I don’t think the president needs to come to Ferguson,” Mr. Cleaver said. “It adds another distortion. We don’t need that now. We don’t need any more people coming into Ferguson to help the poor people out during this time of trouble. What we need is a sense of calm and anything other than that is going to be dangerous.”

Many concerns have arisen in the aftermath of Brown’s killing regarding police suppression of First Amendment rights guaranteeing freedom of the press. And some journalists have questioned whether the administration stands behind its words.

Speaking to his colleague Maureen Dowd, New York Times reporter James Risen, {who currently faces jail time}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/13/obama-administration-jail-james-risen""> for protecting his sources and refusing to testify against a former CIA agent accused of leaking secrets, recently {called President Barack Obama}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-wheres-the-justice-at-justice.html""> “the greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation.” Last year, the president came under fire for what the Associated Press called a “massive and unprecedented intrusion” when the Justice Department {secretly obtained}<hyperlink=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-obtains-wide-ap-phone-records-probe""> approximately two months of telephone records of reporters and editors from the news collective.

In Ferguson, police clashed with reporters on numerous occasions. Last week, the Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery and the Huffington Post’s Ryan J. Reilly {were both arrested}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/washington-post-huffpo-reporters-arrested-in-ferguson-1621284034"">, handcuffed and assaulted by police clearing out a nearby McDonald’s. {Six more journalists were arrested}<hyperlink=""http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-journalists-arrested/index.html""> by officers last night. Other journalists, like Mustafa Hussein, of KARG Argus Radio, who has been live-streaming the protests all week, {alleged}<hyperlink=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/ferguson-police-media-threat.html""> that an officer threatened him by pointing a gun in his face and yelling, “Get the fuck out of here or I will shoot you with this.”

The conflict between protesters and police escalated last night, as law enforcement used helicopters, armored vehicles, riot gear and tear gas to control what appeared to have been a peaceful protest against the shooting of the unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown. Gov. Nixon tweeted that he would be canceling his scheduled appearances at the Missouri State Fair to travel to St. Louis.

“The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans.

Salon,salon15,http://www.salon.com/2014/08/16/fergusons_weaponized_cops_and_americas_long_ugly_history_of_police_violence/,"Ferguson’s weaponized cops and America’s long, ugly history of police violence",Andrew O'Hehir,08/16/2014,03/22/2016,"What we have witnessed over the past week in Ferguson, Missouri, represents the collision of two sinister forces in American society: the widespread militarization of police forces from coast to coast, and the long and sordid history of police violence against African-Americans in particular, and any and all threats to the dominant social and economic order in general. These things are connected, to be sure. Both can be described as reflecting a paranoid and profoundly racist worldview that has long been endemic within American nationalism, the worldview that connects the Know-Nothings and slavery defenders of the 19th century to J. Edgar Hoover, Joe McCarthy, Strom Thurmond and the Tea Party.

But these two phenomena have separate histories and distinctive points of origin. If one side of the equation is “Red Dawn” paranoia, in which we imagine small-town cops prepared to do battle with heavily armed alien invaders at any moment, the other side is “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” paranoia, in which the enemy is right here at home, cleverly concealed as our neighbors and fellow citizens. As {Glenn Greenwald,}<hyperlink=""https://theintercept.com/2014/08/14/militarization-u-s-police-dragged-light-horrors-ferguson/""> {Heather Digby Parton}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/08/15/warrior_cops_on_steroids_how_post_911_hysteria_created_a_policing_monster/""> and other commentators have explained this week (their pieces in particular are must-reads), the provision of military-style gear to local and state police at outlandish taxpayer expense began in earnest with the Reagan administration’s “war on drugs,” a disastrous policy failure whose consequences are just as far-reaching as the equally inept “war on terror” or the doomed invasion of Iraq.

But I’m sorry, liberals – you don’t get to blame the Republicans exclusively, or even primarily, for this one. It’s been a truly bipartisan effort. Militarizing the cops goes along with the larger package of “security” issues that Democrats in Congress have largely embraced for fear of appearing soft on crime and terrorism, from NSA surveillance to the drone wars to the prison-building boom. There are some noteworthy exceptions, including Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., who have spoken out forcefully on this complex of issues. But the loudest objections to the national-security state, and to the specific combination of ingredients we saw on the streets of Ferguson, have come from Rand Paul, which is exactly why Hillary Clinton fears him so much. She represents the Democratic Party’s fundamental confusion about the nature and limits of state power, along with its innate tendency to abandon principle in search of perceived political advantage, which have led it to drink deeply from the cup of evil.

Reagan and his neocon brain trust – including a two-time secretary of defense and future Sith Lord named Dick Cheney – began the process that turned every small-town, donut-engorged police department and Podunk County band of sheriff’s deputies into a heavily armed but poorly trained military unit. But succeeding administrations of both parties, Obama’s very much included, have enthusiastically continued the buildup. From the beginning, there were powerful elements of xenophobia and racism at work. If the imagined threat that required the distribution of high-tech military gear to every cop in the nation was an invasion by Colombian drug lords or Mexican gangs, its actual effect was the imprisonment of African-American men, by the hundreds of thousands, for nonviolent drug offenses.

But for my money the strongest driving force was, well, money. This buildup began during the great privatization drive of the neoliberal economic order, and it created a new market and a massive new industry — which then was injected with Incredible Hulk juice in the fall of 2001. I don’t actually believe that Cheney was the secret mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, but I sure hope he sent Osama bin Laden flowers the next morning, because those two guys were made for each other. There’s no need to list here all the ways that 9/11 was like an answered prayer for “the most consequential vice president in American history” (in Cheney’s words) and his band of Leo Strauss disciples, who seized on the threat of terrorism as an all-purpose excuse for transforming America’s global posture and the nature of executive power.

Our topic today is the Department of Homeland Security, which became an unstoppable money-sucking juggernaut that no right-thinking legislator was allowed to question, still less oppose. (I still sometimes can’t hear that name, apparently pilfered from a bad ’70s science-fiction film, without snickering. But the joke has faded.) As Kim Murphy of the Los Angeles Times {reported in 2011}<hyperlink=""http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/28/nation/la-na-911-homeland-money-20110828"">, federal and state governments spend around $75 billion a year on domestic security, and much of that money gets funneled to local jurisdictions in the form of high-tech military hardware they don’t need and are not trained to use. One can only hope that Barack Obama and Eric Holder, who both appear genuinely anguished about what has happened in St. Louis County, have experienced some private anguish about the blowback of all that stupid, wasteful and destructive spending.

If many ordinary TV viewers and news consumers were startled by the heavily armed paramilitary force they saw on the streets of suburban St. Louis, they really shouldn’t have been. As Greenwald notes, the ACLU published a critical report on the {“excessive militarization of American policing”}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf""> just a few weeks ago, and a handful of mainstream reporters, including Murphy and the New York Times’ Matt Apuzzo, have been paying attention all along. Apuzzo’s crucial {investigative report}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html"">, published on June 8, painstakingly documents the military gear acquired by local police since 2006: at least 860 armored vehicles, more than 500 aircraft and close to 94,000 automatic weapons. Some of the anecdotes he uncovers would be humorous, if we weren’t facing the less amusing consequences up close right now: an armored combat vehicle acquired by the police department in Neenah, Wisconsin, a city that has not had a murder for five years; a sheriff in rural western Maine requesting a mine-resistant vehicle to fend off the “previously unimaginable threat from terrorist activities.” It’s true: More than anything else, al-Qaida covets those Down East taters.

Greenwald has argued on several occasions that the ostensible focus on terrorism is a smokescreen, and that the primary purpose of this newly militarized policing is the suppression of internal dissent. That’s a charge worth taking seriously, although I suspect the true historical picture is more complicated, and less driven by a clear-cut agenda. In considering the myriad sins of those who hold power over others, one should never discount the forces of inertia, greed and sheer stupidity. There is no question that big-city police departments have developed new resources and ever more sophisticated strategies aimed at managing and restricting public protest. But a lot of this stuff is just military waste product being handed out at random: There’s not much internal dissent to be quelled in Neenah or Oxford County, Maine. If cops in those places ever try to use their high-tech military equipment the results are likely to be embarrassing, as with the notorious SWAT-team raids on {unlicensed Orlando barbershops}<hyperlink=""http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-08-27/news/os-barbershop-raids-lawsuits-sheriff-20130826_1_strictly-skillz-regional-program-administrator-state-licensing-agency""> in 2010.

But Greenwald is absolutely right to observe that people who were shocked by what they saw in Ferguson evidently didn’t notice or didn’t care about the military-style police response to Occupy Wall Street in 2011, or to the {protests he covered}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2008/09/01/protests_3/""> (for Salon) at the 2008 Republican convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. Indeed, you can keep on pushing backward well before that, to the {2004 Republican convention}<hyperlink=""http://www.nyclu.org/RNCdocs""> in New York, the 2003 FTAA protests in Miami (a {landmark event}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_model""> in law-enforcement theory and practice), the 1999 {“Battle in Seattle”}<hyperlink=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-globalization-why-seattles-1999-protesters-were-right/282831/""> and so on. Those, of course, were all confrontations between the appointed defenders of law and order and largely white groups of radical or anarchist protesters who to some extent had marginalized themselves from mainstream society, or who could be spun as having done so. There was no evident dynamic of racism in play, and it was easy for onlookers to surrender to a narrative of false equivalency: Someone, somewhere broke a Starbucks window, so the tear gas and rubber bullets and pepper spray and mass arrests used against those who dared to express public dissent were understandable.

Events like Ferguson access a much older and uglier narrative within American society. I feel confident that a lot of white people, and not just the talking heads on Fox News, felt uncomfortable to hear Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a genuine hero of the Civil Rights movement, say that the images from Ferguson {brought him back}<hyperlink=""http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/08/14/hank-johnson-pushes-to-limit-military-surplus-for-local-cops-as-ferguson-unrest-continues/""> to Deep South clashes between white cops and black protesters in the ’40s, ’50s and ’60s. Surely that’s an unfair comparison, one could argue: Look how far we have come! A black man sits in the Oval Office, and another one heads the Department of Justice. Racial discrimination is illegal in all public and commercial contexts, and even casual racist language, uttered in private, can render a comedian, an NBA team owner or a celebrity chef into an instant pariah.

One testimonial to the progress that has been made, I suppose, is that we have a number of prominent African-American voices in the media, from Pulitzer-winning reporter {Trymaine Lee}<hyperlink=""http://trymaineleemsnbc.people.msnbc.com/""> to {Ta-Nehisi Coates}<hyperlink=""http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ta-nehisi-coates/""> of the Atlantic to Salon columnist {Brittney Cooper}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/writer/brittney_cooper/"">, who can illustrate the contradictory character of black life in the 21st century in ways no white observer ever could. While the larger social and political climate has changed immensely since the days when {Bull Connor}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Connor""> set his attack dogs and fire hoses on the protesters in Birmingham – and African-Americans unquestionably have legal rights and career opportunities their grandparents could only dream about – relations between white-dominated police forces and black communities remain {poisoned by that legacy}<hyperlink=""http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/08/why_ferguson_missouri_police_c.html""> in many ways and many places.

It’s almost misleading to bring up a cartoon villain and arch-segregationist like Connor, who was entirely forthright about what he stood for. It’s not as if the history of police violence against citizens of color was limited to the Deep South in the Jim Crow era. Discrimination and segregation were always questions of entrenched custom rather than law in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, for example – and the nation’s three largest cities all have long and painful records of egregious police misconduct and racial animosity. Have conditions in those cities improved since the {police murder of Fred Hampton}<hyperlink=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-pantherraid-story-story.html""> in 1969, the {beating of Rodney King}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OauOPTwbqk""> in 1991 and the more recent killings of {Amadou Diallo}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/26/nyregion/diallo-verdict-overview-4-officers-diallo-shooting-are-acquitted-all-charges.html"">, {Ousmane Zongo}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/nyregion/21zongo.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh=4C522E711D257B6EC3C4E0A1D975EE0F&gwt=pay"">, {Timothy Stansbury}<hyperlink=""http://blackandbrownnews.com/bbn-special-reports/inner-city-blues-timothy-stansbury-1984-to-2004/""> and {Sean Bell}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/27/usa.julianborger"">, all of them unarmed black men shot dead by police as a result of “misunderstandings”? Maybe so, but I’m really not the right person to ask.

Social circumstances and social rhetoric may have shifted, but there’s a deeply entrenched psychic script driving the relationship between police and communities of color that seems to play out over and over again. We saw that in Ferguson, and we’ll see it somewhere else later this year and next year and the year after that. Bill de Blasio, a white liberal with a black wife and black kids, won a surprise victory in New York’s mayoral election specifically by promising to help heal this divide, and to end the stop-and-frisk practice that was almost exclusively directed at black and brown teenagers. His young administration now faces its first major crisis after the {death of Eric Garner}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/01/justice/new-york-choke-hold-death/"">, an unarmed black man arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes, who was apparently placed in a chokehold by a white officer, in defiance of NYPD rules.

I’m inclined to think we focus too much on the misdeeds of individual police officers in these cases, in exactly the same way we focused on individual soldiers who tortured detainees at Abu Ghraib or murdered civilians in Afghanistan. It can be a way of ducking the question of who or what is really responsible. Cops who commit crimes should face the consequences, of course. I’m not suggesting you should feel any particular compassion for Darren Wilson, the Ferguson officer who apparently shot Michael Brown, or Daniel Pantaleo, the NYPD cop who put the chokehold on Eric Garner, or the many other cops who have wound up as flashpoints and celebrity defendants in these cases. But the sheer prevalence of these episodes suggests that it’s not a “bad apple” problem but something larger and more systemic.

Police officers in many cities and towns are indoctrinated in a longstanding institutional culture of racial animosity and stereotyping (at the very least) and then are asked to enter stressful and potentially life-threatening situations. Fairly or not, they often view the African-American community as a uniquely dangerous environment where they are hated and feared. As police departments in major cities have become more diverse and sought out minority candidates, this dynamic has no doubt faded somewhat. But sociologists have identified police culture as a powerful force that shapes ideology, and of course it’s possible for an individual to buy into negative stereotypes about his or her own community. In any case, Ferguson represents a different but very common phenomenon: A majority-minority community with an overwhelmingly white police force whose members mostly do not live there.

There are many ways to slice the connections between race, poverty and crime in America, but I think we can say this: Poor people are more likely to commit the most visible kinds of petty street crime (almost always against other poor people) than rich people are, and black neighborhoods are more likely to be poor than white ones. So the apprehension felt by many white cops may be constricted or bigoted, but it’s not entirely irrational — and the part about being hated and feared has a tendency to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Darren Wilson may have believed, based on his subjective experience, that he was in danger when he shot Michael Brown. It is the formation of that subjective experience that’s the problem, and that goes well beyond the question of whether one officer followed established procedure or not.

For generations, cops were instructed (either explicitly or implicitly) to keep blacks and Latinos in their place, to crush Commies and dissidents whenever and wherever they appeared, and to defend the property and interests of the wealthy and powerful. That agenda was clear enough, and we know where it led: to the violent “police riot” of Chicago in 1968, the cold-blooded killing of Hampton and other black activists, to the police corruption scandals of the 1970s, the {1985 MOVE bombing}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2013/10/05/white_america_says_let_the_fire_burn/""> in Philadelphia, the arrest and conviction of five innocent teenagers in the {“Central Park jogger” case}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2012/11/30/the_central_park_five_new_yorks_darkest_hour/""> and much more. While the public has demanded reforms in recent decades, the record in most cities is mixed at best. Ingrained attitudes within police culture are partly to blame — almost everywhere in the country, cops remain an overwhelmingly Republican and Tea Party-friendly demographic. But cops have good reason to feel confused. They find themselves pinioned between politicians and the public, and have become the vessels or instruments for all sorts of competing and contradictory agendas.

Sometimes we – if “we” are good urban liberals, that is — want the police to serve as community outreach officials who abjure the racism of the past, like an updated, multicultural version of the kindly Irish cop in an old movie. But that’s just ideology, and the money points in a different direction, toward police as the shock troops of the prison-industrial complex, enforcers of a “new Jim Crow” regime that professes race-neutrality but has led in practice to the mass incarceration of African-American men. And the most fundamental function of the police in any society remains the same as ever: the defense of power and property — the protection of the 1 percent — through a legal monopoly on lethal violence. Now we have elevated the power of police violence to new heights, providing cops with all kinds of fabulously expensive high-tech hardware to wage war against an enemy who does not exist or isn’t coming. (It really is “we,” since you and I are paying handsomely for it.)

In his eyes, the opinions of the grand jury, set to convene tomorrow, have already been set in stone.

“I’ll tell you what will happen,” Rivera said. “They’ll have a trial. The white jurors will see it one way, and the black jurors another. The white jurors will look at that convenience store surveillance tape. They will see Michael Brown menacing that clerk. The white jurors will put themselves in the shoes of that clerk. They’ll say, ‘Of course the officer responded the way he did. He was menaced by a 6’4″, 300 pound kid, 10 minutes fresh from a strong-armed robbery. The officer was defending himself.’ The white jurors will put themselves in the white officer’s place. The black jurors will see Michael Brown despite his flaws as the surrogate for every black youngster ever shot by a cop.”

Even if this wasn’t a dangerously reductive statement (which it is), it also implies that Rivera has already determined that Officer Wilson is innocent in the eyes of the law and that only whites will be able to see the truth of the situation — blacks will conflate the case of Michael Brown with every death of every black boy in the country because they think that all black people are the same! Actually, that sounds more like Rivera.

It was also reported that seven people were arrested, and that several canisters of tear gas were deployed against protesters.

The protests are in response to the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by Darren Wilson, a white police officer on Saturday, Aug. 9. Details of the shooting have yet to be released, including how many times Brown was shot.

The shape of the protests has changed each night: variations of peaceful protesting, looting, heavy militarized police response, violence and calm. After Friday night’s looting, Gov. Jay Nixon imposed an emergency curfew from midnight to 5:00 a.m.

There were reports of gunfire, and according to Capt. Ronald Johnson, a Ferguson native and member of the state’s highway patrol put in charge of the police efforts by Gov. Nixon, a police car was shot at.

“I can tell you that I was disappointed in the actions of tonight,” Johnson told reporters on the scene. However, he said they were successful in protecting previously looted businesses.

“It was effective,” he stated. “We sustained the health of those businesses, and we also sustained the safety of the protesters that were out [and] around tonight.”

Eric Garner, a dad six times over, was breaking up a fight in his neighborhood when police in Staten Island, New York, put him in the illegal chokehold that would ultimately kill him. Marissa Alexander’s infant daughter was still in the NICU when Alexander was thrown to the ground and choked by her abusive husband, leading her to fire the warning shot that Florida State Attorney {Angela Corey believes should put her in prison for 60 years}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/07/22/marissa_alexander_denied_new_stand_your_ground_hearing_still_faces_up_to_60_years_in_prison/"">. The systemic racism that lets cops get away with murdering black teenagers or permits prosecutors to disregard black women’s right to self-defense is blind to their statuses as sons, brothers, daughters, mothers, wives, partners. Our outrage over these injustices should be blind to these things, too — their lives have value regardless of who knows or loves them.

But pointing out that Brown was someone’s son, that Garner someone’s father and Alexander someone’s mother is one way to recognize that police violence and the racism of the criminal justice system are reproductive justice issues. The mainstream political discourse often fails to acknowledge this, but women of color within feminism and the reproductive justice movement have long been making these connections. Imani Gandy, senior legal analyst at RH Reality Check, noted in the wake of Brown’s death, “I saw so many people on Twitter saying ‘I don’t want to have/raise black children in this country.’ That is a reproductive justice issue.”

And Hannah Giorgis wrote of the {dangers and anxieties faced by black families}<hyperlink=""http://www.thefrisky.com/2014-08-13/the-soapbox-why-we-cannot-have-reproductive-justice-without-fighting-police-brutality/""> in a piece this week for the Frisky:

I do not hear this aspect of Black parenting — this wholly rational fear that babies will be snatched from our arms and this world before their own limbs are fully grown — addressed by white advocates in gender equality and reproductive justice. Is it not an assault on Black people’s reproductive rights to brutally and systematically deny us the opportunity to raise children who will grow to adulthood, who can experience the world with childlike wonder? Is it not an assault on Black people’s reproductive rights to tell us we give birth to {future criminals}<hyperlink=""http://www.colorlines.com/articles/criminals-victims-and-black-men-left-behind""> and not innocent children, to murder one of us every 28 hours and leave a family in mourning?

The realities faced by parents, children and families of color in the United States are so often left out of how the reproductive rights movement and mainstream media covers reproductive issues. We saw this again earlier this month when a New York Times piece on the move away from the language of “choice” {failed to include the expansive, intersectional work of the reproductive justice movement}<hyperlink=""http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/08/05/reproductive-justice-choice-open-letter-planned-parenthood/"">, and the women of color who shaped and continue to drive it forward. When it comes to bodily autonomy and ensuring that all people can meaningfully control their own lives, pro-choice is not — has never been — enough.

In addition to the essential issues of access to affordable contraception and abortion care, reproductive justice is just as much about the issues of birth, parenting and family separation, among others. Raising a child, no matter who is doing it, is a lifelong endeavor. Every possible issue — poverty, access to education, the availability of affordable healthcare, housing — touches it, and the intersections of these issues make parenting possible or impossible. This was the impetus for the reproductive justice movement, and this is all too often what gets lost in mainstream, mostly white, discourse that centers abortion rights and contraception as the full scope of women’s issues.

“It seems to me reproductive rights is really singularly focused on abortion rights and contraceptive rights,” Gandy told Salon. “But those sort of rights aren’t the full spectrum of concerns that women of color, particularly black women, have. Especially considering the {statistic}<hyperlink=""http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/1-black-man-killed-every-28-hours-police-or-vigilantes-america-perpetually-war-its""> that every 28 hours a black man is gunned down by the police [or security guards and so-called vigilantes]. That means that every 28 hours a mother somewhere is losing her son.

“And as reproductive justice becomes more mainstream, the people promoting it start to erase its origins,” she continued. “Reproductive justice was developed by black and Latina women, but women of color are being erased from a movement that they created.”

“How do we honor how this work happens?” Giorgis asked, addressing this issue of erasure. “The ways in which I have really learned have been through the work of other women of color. Whenever I think of what I want [to see more of in the mainstream reproductive rights movement], it’s honoring that existing work and how it’s tied into a very long legacy,” she told Salon.

In addition to the advocacy and organizing of collectives like {SisterSong}<hyperlink="""">, national organizations like the {National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health}<hyperlink=""http://latinainstitute.org/en""> and local groups like {SisterReach}<hyperlink=""https://sisterreach.org/""> and the {Prison Birth Project}<hyperlink=""http://theprisonbirthproject.org/"">, there are millions of regular people out there doing the work. The movement against the criminalization of black parents and black children, to defend the dignity and safety of young people of color, is one led by parents, families and the communities that can act as extensions of both.

Brown’s parents made these connections explicit in their demands for justice for their son. So did Sabrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin. So did Lucia McBath and Ron Davis, the parents of Jordan Davis. These parents have made it clear that the deaths of their children were not isolated incidents, but inevitabilities when police and other men with guns can act with impunity.

The realities of police violence “make it really difficult for black women to feel comfortable raising children in this environment, when any given day their kid could be gunned down in the street,” Gandy said. “What you have to think about when you have a child, especially if you have a boy, you have to begin teaching them how to go about interacting with the police. And every time your child leaves the home, wondering if they are going to come back in one piece.”

So when we talk about family values in the United States, the question is, “Which families have value?”

A law in Tennessee that {criminalizes pregnancy outcomes}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/07/11/first_woman_arrested_under_tennessee_law_that_criminalizes_pregnancy_outcomes/""> will disproportionately impact low-income women and women of color whose communities are heavily policed in a way that many white neighborhoods are not. Does treating substance dependence as a criminal rather than a health issue — in a state that has rejected the Medicaid expansion that would allow more people to access care — value families? Does the arbitrary arrest, detention and deportation of undocumented Latina mothers in Arizona value families? Does a police force that shoots first and asks questions later value families?

As I was writing this, I saw on Twitter that {the Nation’s Dani McLain had also addressed these intersections}<hyperlink=""http://www.thenation.com/article/murder-black-youth-reproductive-justice-issue/""> and asked, “What would it take for the organizations and commentators who beat the drum for policies related to reproductive health and rights to use their platforms to advocate for black parents who lose their children to violent attacks on those young people’s lives?” A feminist movement with the stated purpose of ensuring that women and pregnant people are empowered to control their lives, reproduction and — if and when they want them — children and families, has to contend with these questions.

And there are always more questions to be asked. “Are children of color brought into the same life that white children live?” Giorgis remarked during our conversation. “How do we think about the climate that children are born into as part of a reproductive justice framework?”",3,624,Lost in so much of the commentary is the effect of all this on parenting -- and reproductive justice.

Now, police have finally released the identity of the police officer responsible for Brown’s death.

The officer that was involved was Darren Wilson who has been with the force for six years.

The name of the officer had previously been concealed because of the potential security risk. As the officer is not yet in custody, he remains vulnerable to harm. The police department noted that they had received threats against the unknown individual.

On The Daily Rundown with Chuck Todd this morning on MSNCB, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver spoke of the police’s decision to withhold the name for so long, and the suspicions that decision stoked. “When you withhold the name of a person police officer, it feeds into the theory that this is going to be a white wash,” he said. “We knew the name of Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who killed the president of the United States at the time of his arrest. I think that many of the people here in Missouri just said, ‘Oh, we’re not getting the name–they’re trying to figure out how to get around prosecution.”

‘Hacktivist’ collective Anonymous had previously claimed to know the identity of the shooter and threatened to release the officer’s name if the Ferguson Police refused to do so.

The study finds that reactions are sharply divided between blacks and whites, with black people twice as likely to say that the shooting “raises important issues about race that need to be discussed.”

44 percent of those polled believe that the case raises important issues about race, while 40 percent think race is getting more attention than it deserves. Among these respondents, 80 percent of African Americans say that issues of race are worth discussing, while 47 percent of whites think it is getting too much attention.

While two-thirds of African Americans polled believe that the police response has been excessive, only a third of white respondents agree, with 32 percent saying the response is about right and 35 percent declining to respond to the question.

Respondents were also divided along age and party lines. According to the {Pew Research Center}<hyperlink=""http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/"">:

Among Republicans, opinion is almost the reverse —  61 percent say the issue of race has gotten too much attention while 22 percent say the case has raised important racial issues that need to be discussed.

By a wide margin (55 percent to 34 percent), adults under 30 think the shooting of the unarmed teen raises important issues about race. Among those 65 and older, opinion is divided: 40 percent think the incident raises important racial issues while about as many (44 percent) think the issue of race is getting more attention than it deserves.

Salon,salon22,http://www.salon.com/2014/08/19/5_reasons_this_clip_of_a_fox_news_reporter_getting_cussed_out_on_air_is_magnificent/,5 reasons this clip of a Fox News reporter getting cussed out on air is magnificent,Ian Blair,08/19/2014,03/24/2016,"Last night, this gem of a video surfaced amidst the sea of news coverage of the protests in Ferguson, Missouri. Nine days ago, Michael Brown, a young, black teenager was gunned down by a white Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson, a tragedy that has garnered national media attention and attracted hundreds of media outlets — on the left, right, and “center” — to the small St. Louis County suburb. Of the numerous outlets documenting the night’s happenings, Fox News sent reporter Steve Harrigan to “investigate” what was fueling the reoccurring confrontations between police and demonstrators. Harrigan, true to Fox standards, seized the moment, chastising and condescending the community of Ferguson for engaging in undignified “child’s play.” His account was overheard by a few of the young protestors, who then confronted Harrigan, barking impassioned obscenities and defending their community’s reputation. It is an amazing clip. Really. Here are 5 reasons why:

1. What’s happening in Ferguson, Missouri, isn’t child’s play. It’s not. Really. This needs no explanation. A black teenager was killed. And you’re making jokes about people who are upset about it.

2. You’re awkward, bro. You should feel awkward when you put yourself in awkward predicaments. Once the protester confronts Harrigan, he seems completely baffled by the man’s anger. He retreats like a child whom a parent has shamed for leaving his playpen. Harrigan’s posture withers into a slump. He lowers his microphone away from his mouth, clutching it near his waist as if he can’t quite comprehend where the protester is coming from or what language he is speaking. It’s English, a bit staccato and lively, infused with adrenaline and trill bravado. Harrigan doesn’t recognize the words. So he stands, stagnant, mouth open, the sleeves of his faded, striped blue collar shirt rolled up, adjacent a man pleading with him to simply understand where he is coming from. And he has nothing to say. And it is glorious.

3. Real recognize real. This is a universal law. Science or no science. It is. If you don’t believe me, you aren’t real. I can’t make this up. Look at the protester’s face when he confronts Harrigan. His teeth are clenched, his weight is shifted into a fighter’s stance, acknowledging Harrigan’s timid presence. Simultaneously, his head is cocked to the side, with an inquisitive look on his face (like, “I know this dude didn’t just say what I think he said!”). For Harrigan, the moment is a reckoning with his poorly conceived, judgmental self: when you chastise and condescend your subjects rather than tell their story, they can tell. This protestor can. Harrigan tries to reconcile and his sound fades. Meanwhile, his host, Shep, manages to, on cue, attempt in real time to deftly make sense of the situation, effortlessly improvising: “This is what happens when our bright lights shine sometimes.” Absolutely. This is exactly what happens. In fact, hopefully it will keep happening. Over. And over again.

4. When you don’t live this, don’t act like you do. What makes this particular part of the tape funny is the failed attempt at empathizing with the plight of the protester. “We’re out here. We’re out here trying to show what’s going on,” says Harrigan. Of course you are. You’re on live television standing on the side of the road just off the main strip where ground zero of the protesting has been taking place. But you just got there and haven’t been there for much more than a week. The residents of Ferguson deal with this every day. This is real life, bro. You got the nerve to call it punchlines?

5. The resolve in Ferguson is stronger than you think. Toward the end of the video, a second protester follows Harrigan as he walks away, slowly attempting to regain control of his interview. In the studio, Shep attempts to appear interested in getting to the bottom of what is going on. Harrigan obliges his colleague. Walking away from the first protester, Harrigan sums up what he feels is occurring: “Let me ask you something: Is what you’re angry about being told to stand on the sidewalk and being told to walk around. What’s your source of anger?” Harrigan asks. The protester’s body language answers the question. He stands with his wiry frame, wearing a white tank top, cocking his head triumphantly to the sky, while still looking at the camera. He puts one hand on his hip, Meteor Man-esque, and replies: “My source of anger is seeing my people — black or white, blue or brown …”

But let me cut him off. It doesn’t matter what follows. He pounds his chest with each syllable uttered. Not syllable clapping, syllable chest-pounding, which is more resolute. Harrigan can’t read his body language, however. So he asks, “What are you prepared to do? How are you going to fix this? What are you going to do?” The protester takes a step backward, cuffing arm behind his back like Morpheus instructing Neo during training exercises, wading through a sea of street traffic. Suddenly, his back straightens up and delivers a response that stifles Harrigan: “What I’m going to do is stand here with my people every night — all night — no pillow, no covers, with my twin or my brothers.”",278,0,"Amidst a heated night of protests, Fox's Steve Harrigan learned some important lessons",NA

I can’t anymore,” I told her (in an online chat conversation, ironically enough). She consoled me: “I’m sending you the biggest digital hug,” she said. For that I am grateful.

My spirits have been dwindling since last Saturday when Brown, a quiet, 18-year-old black kid — who had recently graduated high school and was scheduled to begin college this week — was executed by a police officer. {Witnesses say}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> Brown had his hands in the air and was pleading for his life to be spared when the cop, whom officials refuse to identify, finished him off with “{more than a few}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/police-chief-gives-first-details-fatal-ferguson-police-shooting"">” shots including, allegedly, at least one bullet to the face. Since then, I’ve watched countless clips from protests held around the Ferguson community by outraged residents demanding answers. I’ve listened to Brown’s mother {attempt}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/michael-brown-s-family-speaks-out-317288003633""> to put her loss into words. I’ve seen the {Vine clips}<hyperlink=""https://vine.co/AntonioFrench""> and followed moment-by-moment tweets, status updates, blog posts and Instagram photos, ad nauseam. I’ve also read stories of unarmed black men being gunned down by cops — the first was killed at a local Wal-Mart in Ohio for {picking up toys}<hyperlink=""http://www.rawstory.com/2014/08/cops-gun-down-ohio-man-holding-toy-rifle-in-walmart-like-he-was-not-even-human/"">; the second in Los Angeles for {lying down and complying}<hyperlink=""http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/""> with an officer’s order during an “{investigative stop}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/lapd-suggests-mentally-il_0_n_5675782.html"">.” The annihilation of black and brown bodies can be taxing. So I decided powering down my devices to preserve my sanity seemed worthwhile.

As it turns out, I couldn’t stay off the grid long. I reneged; I reconnected, only to find a friend of mine — a reporter — under siege. He had been sent to St. Louis to cover the aftermath of Brown’s killing, including the demonstrations, and police were forcefully telling him he couldn’t do his job. Cops lobbed tear gas canisters his way and shot rubber bullets. Essentially, his life was in jeopardy. When he managed to call in to give a live account of what was happening, the tremble in his voice offered me little comfort. On the call, his speech patterns were noticeably different — he stuttered and coughed, choking as if a fire was lit in his lungs. “Honestly in these circumstances, I’m not sure what a safe location would be,” he managed to spit out. I’ve been unable to answer that same question for quite some time now.

Not far away, the Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery and the Huffington Post’s Ryan J. Reilly were {arrested}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/washington-post-huffpo-reporters-arrested-in-ferguson-1621284034""> and assaulted by police officers wearing military fatigues and full tactical gear.

None of this is new. None of this is extraordinary. What is happening right now in Ferguson, Missouri, happens every day in black America.

And it is exhausting. As Salon contributor Mychal Denzel Smith {wrote}<hyperlink=""http://www.thenation.com/blog/180943/death-michael-brown-and-search-justice-black-america""> this week at the Nation, “Counting the bodies is draining. With every black life we lose, we end up saying the same things. We plead for our humanity to be recognized. We pray for the lives of our young people. We remind everyone of our history. And then another black person dies.” Each instance serves as a reminder that your life is under attack. You want to escape. But you can’t. So you try to tune out. But you fail, and you grow wearier with each attempt to circumvent your reality.

Those who aren’t forced to endure this type of world every day don’t have to deal with the fatigue. It is a benefit that, admittedly, I envy at times. For some, the accounts that brave reporters like Lowery, Reilly, my friend and others bring them are the closest they will ever get to experience the life of Michael Brown or those who have taken to the streets in his memory.

For the rest of us, what transpired between the authorities and the people of Ferguson (and the press) last night serves as a reminder of a life we cannot separate ourselves from. We remain inextricably linked to the world that terrorizes us. We are unable to extricate ourselves from those who nefariously plunder our neighborhoods and seek to dismantle our livelihoods.

Yet, acknowledging this much also requires admitting to a painful truth: that society is bound by an unbreakable compact between oppressed and oppressor. We were born into the same world, the same cage. Our realities have been molded by one another, crafted in each other’s image. The late James Baldwin explained this much in his seminal essay “{Everybody’s Protest Novel}<hyperlink=""http://www.uhu.es/antonia.dominguez/semnorteamericana/protest.pdf"">,” published in 1949. He noted: “It must be remembered that the oppressed and the oppressor are bound together within the same society; they accept the same criteria, they share the same beliefs; they both alike depend on the same reality.” For black America, its relationship to its oppressor, America, shaped its identity. Hence, imagining a black America void of oppression is to create a separate black America altogether, one that is not recognizable and void of ourselves. At the same time, America void of oppression wouldn’t be America either.

This is our burden. Our humanity depends only on the acceptance of who we are. And it’s something I’m learning not to run from, which is brutal and taxing, to say the least. But I’m not sure there exists a safer location inside the cage.",41,992,Powerful images coming from Missouri are just a small dose of the life we know and endure. It's time to embrace it,NA

The Ferguson Police Department is part of a federal program 1033 that distributes hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus military gear to police forces across the country and touts the motto “From Warfighter to Crimefighter.” According to the program’s {website}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/default.aspx"">, the 1033 program has redistributed more than $4.3 billion worth of property since it began in 1997, and $449,309,003.71 worth of property just last year, the most money ever given as part of this program.

According to Michelle McCaskill, media relations chief at the Defense Logistics Agency, the last transfer made to Ferguson was in November, consisting of two vehicles, a trailer and a generator.

USA Today {reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-michael-brown-militarization-column/14006383/"">:

A state public safety official told USA TODAY that the Pentagon does not allow detailed information on “tactical” equipment to be released at a police force level, only at a county level. According to a document provided by the official, police forces in the same county as Ferguson received advanced rifle sights and night vision equipment between 2012 and 2014.

There is no evidence that any such equipment has yet been used in the Brown case and its aftermath. But such “police militarization” is just one element of an often toxic relationship between minority communities and local police.

Law enforcement agencies in St. Louis County received 12 5.56 millimeter rifles and six .45 caliber pistols from the Department of Defense between Aug. 2, 2010, and Feb. 13 2013.

The problem is that Ferguson police, and police departments across the country, have far more equipment than they could ever use.

But when it comes to celebrity conduits to radical consciousness, I’m much more interested in what Jesse Williams and John Legend are doing right now.

I know who Jesse Williams is because he plays handsome doctor Jackson Avery on “Grey’s Anatomy,” and I watch and love “Grey’s Anatomy” so fuck you. He has close to a million followers on {Twitter}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/iJesseWilliams"">, many of whom I’m going to guess follow him because he is a famous actor whose character on “Grey’s” is smart and moody and romantic and complicated. But these people are now receiving regular updates from Williams on the killing of Michael Brown, the crisis of racist police violence in Ferguson and the rest of the the United States and his utter fatigue with white apathy as black lives are stolen and demeaned on a daily basis.

Like, some white mom in Florida who is feeling pretty excited to learn what Jackson and April are going to name their baby (spoiler, sorry) just read this:

We have every right & reason to be suspicious of police conduct in {#Ferguson}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ferguson?src=hash""> & generally.

And teenagers who are about to head back to school and sit in their social studies classes may have watched him talk about the same things on CNN, because he tweeted the link. “You’ll find that the people doing the oppressing always want to start the narrative at a convenient part, or always want to start the story in the middle,” he said during the segment. “This started with a kid getting shot and killed and left in the street for four hours.”

Williams brings an emotional force to his advocacy that we rarely see in celebrities, and he’s been doing it since before Brown was shot and killed by Darren Wilson. He is going long and deep on a subject that a lot of his peers may think of as “too loaded” to weigh in on. He’s doing this while circulating the writing of people like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Jelani Cobb. If you’re reading them, then maybe you’re finding your way to Brittney Cooper and Dave Zirin, too. Williams is pushing his followers to do some work. And when he’s pushing them from piece to piece of reporting out of Ferguson and commentary connecting the death of Michael Brown to the systemic racism of the criminal justice system, this kind of immersion can be an amazing teacher. 

And John Legend — also a proud feminist — has been {using his platform to keep eyes on Ferguson}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/johnlegend"">, and make sure people understand the connections between what’s happening in that small Missouri suburb and the sidewalks of Staten Island. Between shout-outs to his fans about a great show in Phoenix, he’s talking about militarized policing and pushing back against the racism that characterizes law enforcement responses to black outrage.

Activists in the community are coming out every single day to do the same, and to broaden our cultural understanding of white supremacy and the political and cultural systems that let police shoot first and ask questions later. The journalists in Ferguson are ensuring the news gets out, exposing the police for the violence that they commit with impunity.

During the past week, the police shot and killed an unarmed black man, subsequently used excessive force against protesters and journalists during the days that followed, and then imposed a curfew on the community who spoke out against the multiple injustices.

Oliver called out the Ferguson police department’s racism, our country’s irrational militarization of police forces, and the governor’s selectively applied logic when punishing the maligned community, concluding that “this is a top down problem.”

“You took a community tired of being treated like criminals, and imprisoned them all in their own houses for a night,” Oliver said, criticizing Gov. Nixon.

He continued, delivering a scathing indictment: “If even the governor can’t distinguish between the good and the bad elements of the community, and decides to punish everyone equally, then that should go both ways. I know the police love their ridiculous unnecessary military equipment, so here’s another patronizing test: let’s take it all away from them, and if they can make it through a whole month without killing a single unarmed black man, then — and only then– can they get their fucking toys back.”",47,6000,"The comedian issues a scathing indictment against the police and government in Ferguson, Missouri ",NA

Rush Limbaugh’s toxicity reaches new heights with Robin Williams comments.

There were many contenders for biggest a**hole in response to the news of Robin Williams’ suicide this week. Fox’s Shep Smith called the beloved entertainer a “coward,” and a pro-life group absurdly opined that a long-ago abortion led to Williams’ depression. But old reliable Rush Limbaugh came out on top of the soulless heap, and remains the undisputed king of the toxic right-wing spew-i-verse. Depression and suicide are not even remotely political issues, yet Rush decided to try to score some points off the actor and his family’s tragedy. It was Williams’ left-wing politics that killed him, Rush asserted. We suspect even he knows this is utter poppycock.

“What is the left’s worldview in general?” Limbaugh said on his radio show, a day after Williams’ death was announced. “If you had to attach, not a philosophy, but an attitude to a leftist world view, it’s one of pessimism and darkness and sadness. They’re never happy, are they?”

One can hardly blame progressives for being a bit demoralized these days, and listening to Rush is enough to drive any reasonable person around the bend, but this has nothing to do with depression, which strikes people everywhere on the political spectrum. Rush knows that. It hardly matters that he tried lamely to walk back those comments the next day. Well, not really, he just tried to blame—who else—the leftist media for misconstruing his words. Not so. We heard you Rush. Loud and despicably clear. Again.

2. Elisabeth Hasselbeck: Atheists persecute Christians kind of like ISIS persecutes Christians.

During the summer, when the war on Christmas is not being waged, atheists must content themselves with waging war on Christians, cruelly depriving them of the Bible in all sorts of public spaces. This is the view put forward by Fox & Friends’ Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who said this week: “It looks like two groups might not get the Bible…. Bibles are booted from Navy base guest rooms, and an atheist group is telling a Georgia high school football team to punt the prayers.” (First of all, who writes this stuff? Punt the prayers? Good one!)

You know who those mean old atheists persecuting Christians and making them bring their own Bibles to Navy base guest rooms remind Hasselbeck of? ISIS, that’s who. Islamic terrorists. She reads the papers. She knows what’s going on in the world. Christians are being persecuted in Iraq by extremist Sunni militants. It’s all part of the worldwide plot to eliminate Christianity, and those atheist/terrorists right here at home are in on it, by insisting that Bibles have no place in public institutions.

Oy gevalt.

Hasselbeck calls what atheists are doing “eliminating religious freedom,” when in fact both freedom of religion and freedom from religion are enshrined in the good ol’ constitution. A small detail.

3. Fox News ‘Doc’ Ablow insults First Lady’s fitness, figuring it’s fair because she hates America.

Keith Ablow, that sterling member of Fox’s “Medical A-Team” is rapidly becoming one of the most gag-inducing figures on the network. He went there this week, all the way to the depths of douchebaggery, criticizing Michelle Obama’s figure, not once, but twice, the second time in defense of the first time. “I’m not taking food advice from an American who dislikes America, who in many photographs during her tenure as First Lady is obviously not fit,” he told Politico, just doubling down on being a full-on cretinous troll.

The head case, whoops, we mean “head doctor,” had already gone there on the subject of Michelle Obama’s body on the air, commenting that she needs to “drop a few.” Not even his right-wing female colleagues at Fox could stomach that. Not that it is at all pertinent, but the First Lady’s fitness is rather legendary, her arms the envy of many. Ablow’s comments are transparently misogynist, and it is probably only a matter of time before he and his twisted colleagues decide the Obama daughters are fair game, since their father has the audacity to be president while black, and their mother has the gall to try to educate Americans about food, nutrition, health and exercise while black. She obviously hates America if she is trying to do that.

4. Steve King: Racial profiling in Ferguson? What racial profiling? They are all from the same continent.

Pretty much every time the Iowa Rep opens his mouth something cringe-worthy emerges, and this week was no exception. Iowa is kind of the new Missouri, so J.D. Hayworth of Newsmax decided it would be a good idea to get the extremist Tea Partying congressman most known for his blatantly racist views about immigrants to comment on the disturbing events in Ferguson.

The question for Steve King (and who would question his credentials on this topic?) was whether the call for an investigation into racial profiling on the part of Ferguson’s trigger-happy, riot gear-wielding police force was legit. King’s statements were predictably and headscratchingly offensive.

“I’ve seen the video,” he said. “And it looks to me like you don’t need to bother with that particular factor because they all appear to be of a single origin. I should say continental origin might be the way to phrase that.”

Okay, so huh? Are we talking about the continent of Africa? Because, yes, that appears to be what King is saying. You can’t have racial profiling when everyone is black.

There you have it. A prime example of the logic of the insane.

5. Laura Ingraham: Arrested journalists in Ferguson deliberately provoked the police. This is obviously true because Obama criticized the police and whatever side he takes is wrong.

Fox’s Laura Ingraham maintained her status in the pantheon of the hateful this week by going after journalists doing their job in Ferguson, and getting arrested for it. Really, Laura? That’s the position you’re going to take? That WaPo reporter Les Lowry was “looking for a confrontation” with the police inside a McDonalds, and deserved not only to be arrested, but to have his head slammed into a soda machine. President Obama spoke out against the police overreaction, and Ingraham is contractually bound never to agree with anything the President says, so what else could she do?

In an interview with the hardly radical Howie Kurtz, who defended the reporters, Ingraham insisted on repeatedly expressing sympanthy for the “young cops” who were dealing with a difficult situation, and who, after all, were being provoked by the reporters trying to record them by “holding iPhones up in their faces.” The more she talked, the more she made it clear she believed that the mere presence of journalists, with their cameras, satellite dishes, computers, and other tools of the trade were deliberate provocations to the police, who quite understandably sprayed tear gas at an entire Al Jazeera television crew.

Fox News host Steve Doocy pointed out that an autopsy had found that Brown had been shot six times: four times in the right arm, and twice in the head. But he said that people were more concerned with the “violence and the looting.”

While two of the guests, former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik and retired Nutley Police Commander Steven Rogers, agreed that Ferguson police had been too aggressive initially, all three men supported military equipment for police.

All three also agreed that Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, the newly-appointed leader of the policing effort in Ferguson, had gone too far by sharing his experiences as a black father, and for apologizing for Brown’s death to an African-American church on Sunday.

“Apologize for what?” Kerik asked. “The grand jury hasn’t concluded its investigation yet. You have to wait for the evidence. And Ron Johnson, any prosecutor, any cop knows that.”

Dietl continued with his uninformed opining: “To do something like this before all information has been finalized is wrong. Just maybe, the cop was right. Maybe he was getting beat up.

At a press conference held this morning in Ferguson, Police Chief Thomas Jackson addressed members of the press, visibly flustered, to answer questions about police conduct during the protests the evening before.

“What’s happening now is {not what any of us want}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/ferguson-police-chief-we-need-everyone-to-calm-down-1621637500"">,” he said. “We need to get everyone to calm down, bring some peace to this.”

The press is supposed to calm down when two reporters were arrested for not leaving a McDonald’s quickly enough?

Or, possibly, did Jackson mean that the police need to calm down?

“There is gunfire, there is firebombs being thrown at the police,” he said. “I understand that what it looks like — is not good. The whole situation is not good at this point. That’s why there’s several meetings going on right now to evaluate tactics, how we approach this.”

Why has there not been more transparency in the investigation? Why is the Ferguson Police Department embarking on what seems to be a smear campaign against Brown’s character? And most of all, why has Officer Wilson not been arrested yet?

Salon spoke with Peter A. Joy, Henry Hitchcock Professor of Law and director of the Criminal Justice Clinic at Washington University Law in St. Louis, about why Wilson was allowed to leave Ferguson with his family days ago after slaying an unarmed teenager.

Can you speak from a legal perspective about what needs to happen now for Officer Wilson to be arrested? 

One thing is, it seems like both the federal investigators through the FBI as well as the members of the county police department are still in the process of interviewing people that may have seen something, or at least they’re asking for other people who may have seen something to come forward. So it’s unclear to me if they feel that they’re at the point where they have talked to every possible person that may have seen something that day.

The next thing is, it’s also unclear what tests may have been done and if all of the results are back. For example, if blood work was done both on Officer Wilson and Mr. Brown and if they’ve gotten back the results of that. Some of the toxicology reports when you do blood work take longer than regular blood work that you or I might get when we go to our doctor that measures our blood sugar and so forth. So that’s unclear.

In terms of the shooting reconstruction, I assume that that is all complete. Whether or not there is testing that was done, and given, at least, the accounts that we have, there should have been testing done inside the police cruiser to see if it’s possible to reconstruct what may have occurred there. There’s a conflicting report about whether or not the gun had gone off inside the cruiser or not. So that all has to be done.

And then once that’s all done, the next thing that occurs is for the prosecutor to make a decision: Is he going to press charges or not? And the prosecutor has two avenues: One is to immediately press charges, issue a warrant for the officer’s arrest and arrest Officer Wilson. The other option is not to press charges immediately but to present the case to a grand jury and see if the grand jury will find probable cause to indict the officer. Even if the prosecutor immediately presses charges while we’re on the phone, that case would still be presented to the grand jury — the difference being that the officer would be placed under arrest before the grand jury considers the matter. That’s what would occur, I think, in a situation where it’s clear the person should be arrested.

I guess the closest analogy we might have to where the shooting takes place — somebody unarmed is killed and the person isn’t arrested immediately — could be a situation where somebody breaks into a person’s house and the homeowner shoots the person and they don’t immediately arrest the homeowner even though the person who broke into the house was unarmed, until they complete an investigation and see if there’s sufficient justification for the homeowner to have shot the person. That is something that commonly occurs when you have those types of shootings. Out on a street shooting like this, the only reason for the delay I think is a determination at this point, trying to decide if there was sufficient reason for officer Wilson to believe he was under imminent risk or that there was a risk of public safety. From what we know, Mr. Brown was unarmed. So I guess the risk to Officer Wilson, the question mark there, is how far away from Officer Wilson was Mr. Brown? Did he have anything that he could have used as a weapon? Something in his hand. Or something that could’ve been a reasonable threat to the officer. Once that information comes out, it’ll be much clearer to make a judgment about definitely Officer Wilson should be arrested. I mean, based on some of the witnesses’ accounts, it clearly seems like he should be. But then based on some of the other conflicting information, there’s this question mark about trying to get to the bottom of exactly what occurred in the final few minutes of Mr. Brown’s life.

Regarding these conflicting pieces of information, do you have anything specific in mind?

For example, the former coroner from New York who did the autopsy at the request of the family said the gunshot wound to the head was either an indication that Mr. Brown was likely on his knees or could’ve been charging toward the police officer. So that’s something — and that comes from the words of the person that was doing the autopsy for the family. Even his own statement seems to raise some question about what exactly occurred.

Are we waiting for something specific?

I think we’re waiting for two things. The first thing is for the investigation to come to a conclusion and that means when both the state police — I should say the county police — are satisfied that they’ve exhausted all their witness interviews and there isn’t anybody else out there and that all the tests have been done. And also that the federal investigators, primarily through the FBI, have concluded that they have completed their investigation. I mean one of the things the federal investigators haven’t done yet is the third autopsy, the ones the feds want to do.

Once all of the investigation is totally closed, then the next step is the decision by the prosecutor to either file charges or to bring it to a grand jury. I’m expecting that unless there is information that either clearly points that there isn’t any possible justification for the shooting, if there’s that kind of information then I would expect the prosecutor to file charges. But if there is still some conflict and some uncertainty, I would anticipate that the prosecutor is likely to bring it to a grand jury and have the grand jury make a decision whether or not they believe there’s probable cause and then indict Mr. Wilson for whatever the appropriate charge is based upon the evidence they have.",365,957,A prominent law professor addresses some of the most pressing questions surrounding the investigation in Ferguson.,NA

Johnson criticized the Pentagon’s ‘1033’ program, which offers surplus military equipment to state and local law enforcement, including M16 rifles and mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles (MRAP).

He noted in the last several months those vehicles have been given to cities in Texas, Idaho, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arizona, Illinois and Alabama.

“This trend is not only sweeping America’s small cities, it’s hitting American college campuses as well. Ohio State University recently acquired an MRAP,” he said. “Apparently, college kids are getting too rowdy.”

Johnson said his bill would limit the type of equipment that could be transferred and would make sure states track all equipment received.

What’s most interesting about Johnson’s proposal, at the moment, is the odd left-right political coalition of outside groups that is organizing around it. The ACLU supports it, as does Gun Owners of America. Wait a second? Did we just say “Gun Owners of America,” a crazy group to the right of the NRA, supports it? {Apparently so:}<hyperlink=""http://thehill.com/regulation/defense/215207-left-right-unify-behind-push-to-demilitarize-the-police"">

According to the Defense Logistics Agency, more than $4 billion in discounted military equipment has been sold to local police departments since the 1990s.

“Why are those guns available to the police?” asked Erich Pratt, spokesman for the conservative Gun Owners of America. “We don’t technically have the military operating within our borders, but they’re being given the gear to basically operate in that capacity.”

Gun Owners of America and the ACLU are both backing a forthcoming bill from Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) that would curtail the sale of DOD weapons to local police departments.

The support of a group like GOA could provide cover to Republicans and conservative Democrats looking to support a police demilitarization bill.

Still: Congress. We’re going to guess that Johnson’s bill won’t go anywhere any time soon in this Congress. The story of police response in Ferguson, sadly, will probably disappear from national media focus by the time Congress reconvenes in September. Congress doesn’t pass any high-profile legislation in the first place, and it certainly won’t in the couple weeks in which it will be in session before heading off to campaign through November. It would be especially hard for most Republicans and a good number of centrist/conservative Democrats to go directly against the wishes of the Fraternal Order of Police in the months ahead of an election, too.

But while the situation in Ferguson has been horrible, it’s appropriately drawn a new level of scrutiny from right- and left-wingers alike to one of the more ludicrous government programs out there. And it fits into what is, hopefully, one of the few decent paradigm shifts happening on the national political level today: unwinding the ridiculous criminal justice complex that politicians have spent decades amassing. When it comes to police demilitarization and sentencing reform for nonviolent offenders, the certain elements of the right feel more comfortable now entertaining proposals to loosen things, and the left feels less pressure to act self-parodically “tough on crime” to attract white suburban people. We may not be “there” yet, in terms of passing meaningful legislation, but hopefully the situation will be viable enough for the next president — Democratic or Republican — to act forcefully.\",41,242,Insane police response to Ferguson has opened door to action on police demilitarization -- with an unusual alliance,NA
Salon,salon36,http://www.salon.com/2014/08/18/more_fergusons_are_coming_why_para_military_hysteria_is_dooming_america/,More Fergusons are coming: Why paramilitary hysteria is dooming America,Robert Hennelly,08/18/2014,03/31/2016,"Over the weekend, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency in Ferguson and imposed a curfew. Once again tear gas filled the night air. Now the National Guard has been called out.

We will never know how differently things would have played out if the official reaction from the start of the unrest had been the more community-engaged response led by Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol (Plan B) and not the authoritarian doubling down of the locals. All too often an initial oppressive response by authority to long-simmering resentments and alienation sets in motion a cycle of violence that develops its own momentum. (See {Newark, June 1967}<hyperlink=""http://blog.nj.com/ledgernewark/PoliceRiotSummary1.pdf"">.) At that point you’re on your way to alienated narratives that are much harder to reconcile.

Local officials were just oblivious to the level of mistrust present in Ferguson when their first response was paramilitary, as depicted in the front page New York Times photo of police looking more like U.S. Marines protecting the Green Zone in Baghdad, than a civilian police force.

What is still hard to reconcile is the strong disdain expressed by high-ranking federal officials for the military response by the local authorities to quell protests over the police shooting of  yet another unarmed black man. President Barack Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder and Sens. Rand Paul and Claire McCaskill expressed alarm over how the Ferguson police, in full battle regalia, made the city appear like a war zone, implying genuine surprise over the degree to which America’s local policing had become militarized.

What is truly disassociative about their response is that the federal government has been driving this trend for decades.

Long before the Sept. 11 attack, the federal government was funneling hundreds of millions of dollars into local and state law enforcement for them to outfit themselves with military hardware and battlefield gear. These days there is no more vivid display of this troubling trend than when the host cities to the Democratic and Republican conventions race out to spend the $50 million they all get from Uncle Sam so they can get the latest in crowd suppression gear, even their own armored personnel carriers.

The concept of the local police SWAT teams (special weapons and tactics) with their military-style uniforms and equipment can be traced back to law enforcement’s response to the civil unrest of the late 1960s and the emergence of armed fringe groups like the Symbionese Liberation Army in the 1970s.

With the federal declaration of the so-called war on drugs that followed, local SWAT teams proliferated. In 1997 in the first national survey of the trend professors Peter Kraska and Victor Kappeler from Eastern Kentucky University looked at close to 700 local police departments for towns with at least 50,000 residents. In the 1980s they found that just 60 percent of these communities had the paramilitary SWAT units. By the 1990s it was closer to 90 percent. It’s probably a lot closer to 100 percent now.

Over time, the use of these units went from the rare hostage or mass shooter events to their regular deployment to execute “no knock” warrants on suspected drug dealers, with flash grenades and battering rams. Washington’s  “war on drugs” rhetoric provided a ready rationale for a growing army of these specially trained boots on the ground who were now regularly training with combat weapons and honing their military  tactics. For places where this happens regularly, the neighborhoods take on the vibe of an occupied territory.

“The ideological filter  encased within the war metaphor is “militarism” defined as a set of beliefs and values that stress the use of force and domination as appropriate means to solve problems and gain political power, while glorifying the tools to accomplish this — military power hardware and technology,” {wrote}<hyperlink=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3096870?uid=3739808&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21104598585273""> Kraska and Kappeler.

As documented in a recently released research report by the American Civil Liberties Union, this increased militarism of the local police departments across our nation has had {tragic consequences for innocent civilians}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing""> killed and wounded in the wake of “no knock” raids that go bad.

Throughout the ACLU’s “War Comes Home — The Excessive Militarization of American Policing” are accounts of SWAT team fiascoes like the death of 68-year-old Eurie Stamps. Back in January of 2011, Stamps, a grandfather of 12, was sitting at home one night in his pajamas watching a ballgame. When a Framingham, Massachusetts, SWAT team burst into his home he complied with police instructions and dropped to the floor facedown when an officer’s gun accidentally discharged, killing Stamp on the spot.

Local police had been looking for Stamps’ 20-year-old step son, who did not live at the address of the raid. The ACLU reports his stepson had actually been apprehended minutes before the raid.

The ACLU survey looks at the SWAT team activities in 260 law enforcement agencies located in 26 states and the District of Columbia.  What the civil liberties group found was that 61 percent of the people caught up in these paramilitary raids were people of color. Seventy-nine percent of the SWAT team deployments were not for the mass shooter or hostage event type of scenario they were originally created to deal with but for executing search warrants related to the war on drugs. In the majority of deployments they surveyed “the police did not face genuine threats to their safety and security,” the ACLU concluded.

“There is no need for police officers to be in combat gear because it puts them in a combat state of mind,” says Nick Casale, former NYPD gold shield detective and former director of counterterrorism for New York City’s Metropolitan Transit Agency. “The police department’s mission is to police their fellow citizens. The public should never be considered enemy combatants and when police put on military uniforms they begin to see them that way.”

Casale says the wearing of camouflage and other military-issue-style dress by local police, as well as the municipal deployment of military-style armored rolling stock,  should be prohibited. “If you are going to have a vehicle with those all terrain capabilities it must be painted the same color as the rest of the marked municipal first responder fleet.”

Casale traces the origins of the SWAT team paramilitary concept to the FBI SWAT teams, which he says were emulated by state, county and local police agencies. “Mr. Holder has it all wrong. The originators of this quasi-combat style for civilian law enforcement missions started with the FBI,” Casale says. “Little brother always follows what big brother does.”

This militarization of the police and domestic security function is not just evident on the mean streets where the war on drugs is waged every day. The public is subjected to the same  military force projection at so-called National Special Security Events like the inauguration of our president and the nominating conventions held by the Democratic and the Republican Parties.

Back in May of 1998, then-President Bill Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 62 – Protection Against Unconventional Threats to the Homeland and Americans Overseas. According to a historical analysis done by the Congressional Research Service, PDD 62 established that it would be up to the president to decide which events should be declared as National Special Security Events. Such a declaration would ensure that the U.S. Secret Service {would see to it that}<hyperlink=""http://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS22754.pdf""> event planners “addressed terrorist apprehension, prosecution, increased transportation security, enhanced emergency response and enhanced cyber security.”

As a reporter covering the conventions since, I have watched the paramilitary presence grow exponentially even as the volume of protests and protesters has dropped off. The convention security perimeters are gauntlets that make it impossible to move freely between the protest activity and the main official events. Reporters have to make a decision at the start of each day’s proceedings which location they want to report from.

At the 2004 Republican convention in New York City, hundreds of thousands of antiwar protesters staged one of the largest demonstrations in American history. But during the convention week, hundreds were subjected to mass arrest, fingerprinting and prolonged detention. Subsequently, a federal judge found that the NYPD’s tactics were unconstitutional. Earlier this year the City of New York paid $18 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union for the 2004 arrest, detention and fingerprinting of hundreds of protesters, journalists and bystanders.

Just as we have seen law-abiding Americans caught up in no-knock drug raids, we have seen people who were merely exercising their First Amendment rights at our political conventions viewed by police as potential terrorism suspects. “We saw the city in court try to justify  these mass arrests with a terrorist threat,” recalls Chris Dunn, senior counsel with the NYCLU.  “Equating protest with terrorism feeds into talking about a justification that has nothing to do with protest. That’s wrong and dangerous. As soon as you invoke terrorism the rules change.”

By the 2012 Republican convention in Tampa, Florida, the ratio of law enforcement paramilitary forces to actual protesters, whose numbers had dropped off to dozens in the wake of Hurricane Isaac, was 10 or 20 to 1, with ever-present police helicopters hovering overhead.

And also on Thursday evening, David Simon released {an open letter}<hyperlink=""http://davidsimon.com/the-end-game-for-american-civic-responsibility-pt-iii/""> to Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson chief of police, about how the case has been handled thus far.

In his letter Simon expressed “a high regard for good police work” and a sympathy for “the complex truths of practical policing.” He even refused to criticize “your department’s militarized performance with regard to the resulting civil disturbances in your municipality.” But he resolutely chided the department for withholding the name of the officer who shot Brown on Saturday and with it, the implication that “it is plausible for a sworn and armed officer to kill a citizen and do so in anonymity.” {The officer was finally named}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/08/15/darren_wilson_identified_as_ferguson_police_officer_who_killed_michael_brown""> in a press conference on Friday morning.

There is no way that Darren Wilson, the six-year veteran of the Ferguson force, is now not a target for retribution. There is no way his family is not also. Earlier this week, Anonymous targeted Jon Belmar, the chief of the St. Louis County police by not just releasing his address and phone number, but photos of his wife and two children. Early reports say that “As the officer is not yet in custody, he remains vulnerable to harm. {The police department noted that they had received threats against the unknown individual.”}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/08/15/darren_wilson_identified_as_ferguson_police_officer_who_killed_michael_brown/""> The trolls are real and very scary and overzealous in their own potentially highly destructive way.

But as Simon points out, there is a deeper imperative in place here than the protection of a police officer — or his family — from revenge. Simon says, “Your officers are the ones with legal authority. They are all armed. And they can maintain a presence anywhere in your jurisdiction.” And in the meantime, “the damage to accountability and transparency is actual and of the moment.” And he recalled that during his lengthy time as a reporter in Baltimore, he saw the aftermath of many police shootings, and that in all of them, regardless of circumstances, “a police department that remained fully accountable to its citizenry never failed to do one basic thing when a life had been taken: It stood by the body. All of those officers who took a life owned both their authority and their responsibility.”

That’s insufficient. Right now, law enforcement in Ferguson is the biggest threat to law and order, and there can be no reasonable hope of “keeping the peace” while the residents of the city feel they are under siege from the people charged with protecting them.

Multiple officers grabbed me. I tried to turn my back to them to assist them in arresting me. I dropped the things from my hands.

“My hands are behind my back,” I said. “I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting.” At which point one officer said: “You’re resisting. Stop resisting.”

Reilly, too, was arrested for {vaguely resisting/annoying the cops:}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/huffington-post-reporter-arrested-ferguson_n_5676829.html"">

“The officer in question, who I repeatedly later asked for his name, grabbed my things and shoved them into my bag,” said Reilly, who appeared on MSNBC’s “All In with Chris Hayes” shortly after his release to recount the arrest. “He used his finger to put a pressure point on my neck.”

“They essentially acted as a military force. It was incredible,” Reilly said. “The worst part was he slammed my head against the glass purposefully on the way out of McDonald’s and then sarcastically apologized for it.”

What happened was another case of militarized police officers going way out of bounds to prevent the media from covering the war zone that is Ferguson. (See, also: {firing tear gas at journalists}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/videos/news/local/2014/08/14/14042891/""> from Al Jazeera America.)

They have a right to ask for police identification and to shoot video of police acting, well, unscrupulously.

At least that’s one opinion. Another is that of MSNBC “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough! He thinks that reporters should do everything the police say even when police are in the wrong. Joe has been there. Whenever the police ask Joe Scarborough to do something, even if it’s something that they’re outside their bounds asking, he says, “yes sir” or “yes ma’am,” because Joe Scarborough is a great American and a great American is Joe Scarborough:

“I’ve been in places where police officers said, ‘all right you know what, this is cordoned off, you guys need to move along.’ You know what I do? I go, ‘yes, sir, or yes, ma’am.’ I don’t sit there and have a debate and film the police officer unless I want to get on TV and have people talk about me the next day,” Scarborough said on “Morning Joe.” “I am sure I am just the worst person in the world for saying this. I can only judge how I would treat my son who is a reporter who, if he were in this position, okay, well, you know what? Next time a police officer tells you that you’ve got to move along because you’ve got riots outside, well, you probably should move along.”

Lowery, who is not Joe Scarborough’s son, {was asked about this lecture on CNN this morning and agreed}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/wesley-lowery-slams-joe-scarborough-193926.html""> — at least with the part about how Joe Scarborough is the worst person in the world for saying that:

Well I would invite Joe Scarborough to come down to Ferguson and get out of 30 Rock where he’s sitting sipping his Starbucks smugly. I invite him to come down here and talk to residents of Ferguson where I have been Monday afternoon having tear gas shot at me, rubber bullets shot at me, having mothers, daughter, a 19-year-old boy, crying, running to pull his 21-year-old sister out from a cloud of tear gas thinking she would die,” Lowery said on CNN’s “New Day.” “I would invite Joe Scarborough down here to do some reporting on the ground, and then maybe we can have an educated conversation about what’s happening down here.” […]

“I have little patience for talking heads. This is too important. This is a community in the United States of America, where we’re seeing it on fire, they are on fire, this community is on edge, there is so much happening here and instead of getting more reporters on the ground we have people like Joe Scarborough who are running their mouths and have no idea what they’re talking about,” Lowery said.

By the way, I don’t know how you are when you get pulled over by a cop. I know how I am all the times I did. […] When a cop pulls me over, I put my hands outside of the car. If I’m carrying a weapon, which I’m licensed to carry in New York, the first thing I tell the police officer is, ‘Officer, I want you to know I have a legal firearm in the car.’ First thing I say to the officer. He’ll ask, ‘Where is it?’ I’ll say, ‘It’s in my holster.’ And he says, ‘Alright, just keep your hands outside.’ That’s usually the protocol. And then ‘Can I have your license and registration, please? Move slowly.’ And I often would even step out of the car, lift my shirt up so he can see where the gun is. ‘Yes, sir,’ ‘No, sir,’ writes me a ticket.’ Thank you, sir,’ and that’s it.

There has been the initial police briefing of the incident, two eye witness accounts, an account from Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson, claiming that Brown was being pursued in conjunction with a robbery, followed by another announcement just hours later that the officer didn’t know about the robbery or that Brown was a suspect at all. Here are the major events in chronological order:

Saturday, Aug. 9

18-year-old Michael Brown was {shot}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/09/police-shooting-ferguson/13832083/""> at 12 p.m. at the Canfield Green apartment complex in Ferguson, Mo., after a heated encounter with a Ferguson police officer. There are three reports as of now: The account of the police, provided incrementally over the past week by St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar; an eyewitness account from Brown’s friend {Dorian Johnson}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/13/ferguson-missouri-teen-shooting-witness/13992387/"">, who was with Brown at the time of the shooting; and another account from {Tiffany Mitchell}<hyperlink=""http://www.mediaite.com/tv/new-witness-to-michael-brown-shooting-speaks-to-don-lemon-about-what-she-saw/""> who saw the shooting when she pulled up in her car on the same street.

It is worth noting that the police account of events have come out extremely slowly. On Friday,

Here are the three accounts compared:

The encounter

Chief Belmar: “Yesterday at about noon in the 2900 block of Canfield, a Ferguson police officer had an encounter with two individuals on the street. In fact one of those individuals at the time as the officer was exiting his police car, allegedly pushed the police officer back into the car where he physically assaulted the police officer it is our understanding at this point in the investigation that within the police car there was a struggle over the officer’s weapon. there was at least one shot fired within the car,” he said in a press conference last Sunday, Aug. 10.

Johnson: “It was around 1:40 or 2 o’clock. We were walking down an empty street minding our own business. We’re both heading home and the officer approaches us. As he pulls up beside us, he didn’t say freeze halt or nothing like we were committing a crime. He said, “Get the F on the sidewalk.” I told the officer we were not but a minute away from the destination. He’s at an angle where were so close to the door and him, when he tires to thrust the door open aggressively, it doesn’t come an inch out before it strikes both of us. His arm extended out the window and grabbed my friend around the neck. [The cop] didn’t say step back or anything like that. He started to pull my friend into the window– so the officer’s trying to pull him in and he’s pulling away from the officer. [Brown] never once attempted to grab for this officer’s weapon. He’s still holding my friend with one arm and now with the other hand he’s pointing his weapon. The second time he says “I’ll shoot,” it wasn’t even a second later before the gun just went off and the officer let go,” he said in an account to local television station KSDK-TV on Wednesday, Aug. 13.

Mitchell: “I arrived at the scene whenever they were tussling through the window. It looked as if the kid was pulling away and the officer was pulling him in. As I came up, I saw the officer pulling him in and i saw him trying to pull away. I pulled out my phone to try to get a video because it just didn’t look right. I didn’t know exactly what was going on but I know it didn’t look right for someone to be wrestling with the police through the police window. I didn’t get the video because a shot was fired through the window so I tried to get out of the way,” she told Don Lemon on CNN on Wednesday, Aug. 13.

The pursuit

Chief Belmar (cont’d): “After that the officer came back out of the car. He exited his vehicle and there was a shooting that occurred where the officer in fact shot the subject and they were fatal injuries. The entire scene from approximately the car door to the shooting is about 35 feet. There were shell casings recovered, the shell casings are all matched to one weapon thats the officer’s weapon, there were more than a few shell casings recovered. I cannot say at this time how many times the subject was struck by gunfire, it’s hard to know. It was more than just a couple but I don’t think it was many more than that…”

Johnson (cont’d): “That’s how we were able to run at the same time. The first car I see I duck behind for cover because I fear for my life. I’m scared, I don’t know whats going on. I don’t understand why this officer is shooting his weapon at us. And I’m watching the officer; he’s pursuing my friend now. Then he fired another shot. He struck my friend in the back, then my friend stopped running. His hands immediately went in the air and he turned around towards the officer face-to-face. He started to tell the officer that he was unarmed and ‘you should stop shooting me.’ Before he can get his second sentence out, the officer fires several more shots into his head and chest area. And he fell dramatically into the fetal position. I did not hear once he yelled freeze, stop or halt.”

Mitchell (cont’d): “As I went to the side, the kid– he finally gets away and he starts running. As he runs the police gets out of his vehicle and he follows behind him shooting and the kid body-jerked as if he was hit from behind. And he turns around and puts his hands up like this and the cop continued to fire until he dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks the concrete.”

“Get the fuck on the sidewalk!” is what the officer who killed Brown said to him 20 minutes before he died, according to Dorian Johnson, an eyewitness who says he was with Brown when the incident occurred. At the time, Brown and Johnson were walking on the side of the road, heading home, Johnson says.

According to Johnson, Brown responded by refusing to step to the sidewalk, telling the cop that it was unnecessary because they were almost home. Brown and Johnson continued on their way, but the officer reportedly slammed his brakes and backed up his car in order to confront them.

The officer then said something along the lines of “What’d you say?” Johnson claims, before he slammed his car door into the adjacent Brown and then grabbed him by the neck. “I could see the muscles in his forearm,” Johnson said. “Mike was trying to get away from being choked.”

Johnson says what happened next differs from the story the Ferguson police department has told, in which Brown was shot while trying to wrestle the officer’s gun away from him. “They’re not wrestling so much as his arm went from his throat to now clenched on his shirt,” Johnson said. “It’s like tug of war. He’s trying to pull him in. He’s pulling away, that’s when I heard, ‘I’m gonna shoot you.’”

The next thing he knew, Johnson says, the cop had unholstered his weapon, pointed it at Brown, and pulled the trigger. Johnson claims the officer was still holding Brown “until the gun went off.”

The two boys then fled for safety, Johnson says. Johnson hid behind some nearby cars, while Brown kept running. Johnson says Brown had passed about three cars before he was shot again, this time in the back.

After being shot in the back, Johnson says, Brown turned around to face the policeman with his hands up. “I don’t have a gun! Stop shooting!” he exclaimed. The cop responded by firing several more bullets into Brown, after which he collapsed to the ground in a fetal position.

“After seeing my friend get gunned down, my body just ran,” Johnson says. He eventually made it to his apartment, where he collected himself and confirmed that he had not been shot. When he left his apartment five minutes later, he claims, he saw Brown, dead, lying in the middle of the street.

Johnson has offered his testimony to the Ferguson police, his attorney and former St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley says, but was rejected.

“They didn’t even want to talk to him,” said Bosley. “They don’t want the facts. What they want is to justify what happened … what they are trying to do now is justify what happened instead of trying to point out the wrong.”",62,2000,"One of the last things Brown said, according to a witness: ""I don’t have a gun!

“The reason why I used profane language is because he has allowed us to get tear-gassed for three days,” Sen.

And yes, anyone who’s going to get tear-gassed deserves to say a few F-bombs here and there.”

Gov. Nixon has come under serious scrutiny for his handling of the situation in Ferguson, from his alleged lack of engagement with the community protesters to imposing a curfew to bringing in the National Guard.

Specifically, Chappelle-Nadal said the governor had failed to reach out to Ferguson’s black community, a demographic that makes up approximately two-thirds of the St. Louis suburb’s population.

“He has not spoken to the people who are the victims of this crisis that we’re dealing with now, and that is why I have called him a coward,” Chappelle-Nadal told Fox. “He has been absent from the minority community his entire career and only comes before us when it is politically expedient for him or when he’s running for office.”

On Aug. 9 at around 2:00 in the afternoon, Michael Brown, an 18-year-old resident of Ferguson, a suburb outside of St. Louis, was shot by a police officer. Witnesses described a scene in which Brown was allegedly running with arms up, when he was shot multiple times.

The incident incited riots and looting, along with meaningful protest, powerful images and an important discussion about race and the militarization of the police.

The suspect, who has yet to be identified, reportedly brandished a knife at the officers, and was pacing “erratically,” according to several witnesses and Chief Sam Dotson of the  St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. Officers, who were responding to a call for a disturbance in the area of Riverview Boulevard and McLaran Avenue, say they arrived on the scene and found the suspect walked toward them clutching his waistband.

Mr. Dotson said the suspect, after yelling at his officers to “shoot me now, kill me now,” pulled out a knife, prompting officers to draw their weapons. Then, according to Mr. Dotson, the suspect approached the officer still sitting in the patrol car, ignoring calls to drop the knife. Once the man closed to three and four feet from the vehicle, both officers fire their weapons, striking him.

Authorities pronounced the suspect dead on the scene.

At a press conference, Mr. Dotson said the unidentified suspect entered a nearby convenience store and walked out carrying two energy drinks. He was confronted by the store owner who asked him to stop, but allowed him walk out the door. Minutes later, the suspect returned to the store, grabbed a package of pastries, walked back outside. According to Chief Dotson, the store owner asked the suspect to pay for the items but he refused, allegedly tossing the pastries into the street, prompting the store owner to dial the police.

According to {MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/st-louis-shooting""> and a local news affiliate, {KSDK}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/19/goodfellow-west-florissant-officer-shooting/14293199/"">, a large group gathered in the surrounding residential neighborhood where the officer-involved shooting occurred within an hour, chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot,” a mantra that has echoed throughout the St. Louis area as of late.

On August 9th, an unarmed black teenager—and recent high school graduate—Michael Brown, was gunned down by a white Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson. A recent autopsy concluded that Wilson shot Brown at least six times, including twice in the head. Numerous witnesses said Brown had surrendered with his hands up when Officer Wilson approached Brown, gun-drawn, and killed the young, aspiring musician.

Since Brown’s death, many residents in Ferguson and in the surrounding area have taken to the streets demanding justice. Across the country, Brown’s death has galvanized supporters who have showed up to protest in his name.

In Ferguson, police, dressed in camouflage and gas masks, armed with sniper rifles, military-grade tanks, and tear gas have repeatedly clashed with crowds, arresting dozens, including 11 reporters, raising questions about police overreach and militarization as well as First Amendment concerns of assembly and of the press.

Many have also questioned the Ferguson police department’s handling of investigation into Brown’s death. Officer Wilson’s name wasn’t released until nearly a week after Brown’s death and local authorities still haven’t released the official autopsy, both of which have heightened tensions and fueled distrust among those seeking answers.

Obama announced that he had met with Attorney General Eric Holder, who would travel to Ferguson to meet with FBI officials who are conducting a federal investigation into the circumstances surrounding Brown’s death.

Obama stressed that violent protests did nothing to contribute to the fight for justice in Ferguson. “While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown,” he said, “giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police, only serves to raise tensions and sir chaos. It undermines, rather than advances justice.” Although he acknowledged that the “vast majority” of protesters had remained peaceful, the small contingent of violent protesters were hurting their cause. He advised that {it was time}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/obama-back-washington-rare-vacation-break-25017934""> for the American people to “listen and not just shout.”

“That’s how we’re going to move forward together, by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another,” he said. “We’re going to have to hold tight to those values.”

Obama continued to speak about the mistrust between locals and law enforcement: “In too many communities, too many men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,” he said. “Part of that process is looking at our criminal justice system and making sure that it is upholding the concept that everybody is equal before the law.”

He cited that black men and boys are at a disadvantage when it comes to the law: They interact with the criminal justice system frequently from an early age and sentencing “may” be different. “Given the history of this country, where we can make progress … is making sure our criminal justice system is acutely aware of the possibility of disparities,” he said.

More than I can count on one hand. That is how many times preliminary autopsy reports indicate that Michael Brown was shot. Nothing about the youthful infraction of strolling down the middle of a residential street in one’s own neighborhood justifies having your life ripped away from you by an irate officer firing six bullets as you face him, hands up in surrender.

I cannot even fathom what Mike, “Big Mike” as his friends call him, felt as each of those bullets entered his flesh. I do know a little of the rage, despair, helplessness and hopelessness that black communities have been left to feel in the aftermath of his death. I know he stayed conscious long enough to put his hands up, to try and surrender, as if to say, “I want to live. Please don’t kill me.”

Ferguson residents and protesters now find themselves arms outstretched, palms up, yelling “don’t shoot,” as police officers in guns, gas masks and tanks occupy the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, dropping canisters of tear gas on our American dreams. Those of us not yet there in Ferguson watch helplessly as the images of at least one child being tear-gassed come through our Twitter feeds, as journalists find themselves facing down the barrel of a hastily drawn police weapon or thrown in jail, as police drop stun grenades on crowds that refuse to comply with the unreasonable demand that they relinquish their right to peaceful assembly.

While the world watches aghast, America’s penchant for exporting guns, tanks and destruction to other places in the name of law and order has shown up on our own doorsteps, in our backyards, with people pinned into parking lots and onto their porches. They are told they must stay where they are or risk being shot with rubber bullets or have their faces and lungs sting with the inhalation of tear gas.

Public space in Ferguson is awash in black tears, but it is the sirens that we hear wailing. The people would weep, but they are too busy running, ducking and taking cover from the angry sounds of a system that does not love them, does not care about their meager “rights.”

Meanwhile, the government attempts to placate the people with optical sleights of hand. Capt. Ron Johnson, by all accounts a sincere and affable leader and head of the highway patrol, replaced the police chief late last week, with promises that he would not employ military tactics to police the citizens of Ferguson. On Thursday I breathed a bit easier as we watched him giving hugs to protesters, marching with the people, allowing black women of faith to lay hands on him and pray.

That peace was short-lived after the Ferguson police inflamed crowds by releasing irrelevant footage of a conflict that Michael Brown had at a local convenience store when he and his friend Dorian went to buy Cigarellos. Late that evening the crowds returned, only to be met by more tanks, more tear gas, more guns.

Beyond shock, I continue to be appalled at the extensive lengths to which the police have gone to protect Officer Darren Wilson and his family from any public reproach or reprisal in Mike’s death. They delayed the release of his name in order to provide him enough time to leave town. They then released his name to coincide with video of the Cigarello incident, which they later admitted he knew nothing about when he stopped Mike. It is clear that the police are closing ranks, showing that they value the lives of their own more than the lives of citizens.

We are told repeatedly that police are worthy of our respect because they risk their lives each day to protect us.  That is not the case for black people. When we encounter police, our lives are at risk while they protect themselves. I started to temper my statement by saying “some police,” but that gives the impression that I am speaking of the actions of a few rogue officers. The problem with this logic is that we now know that Ferguson law enforcement has a range of problems – disproportionate stops of black residents, disproportionately low numbers of black police (three out of over 50), and a history of antagonistic exchanges with the people of St. Louis County.

We have a problem of overzealous policing in this country. That problem is exacerbated by issues of race and gender, so that black men are perceived to be far more threatening than they actually are. And when black women encounter police, we are not given the protections generally afforded to white femininity. Our womanhood does not mitigate the threat of police force. This, then, is not about the actions of a rogue officer, but rather about the ideology of overpolicing that deputizes extrajudicial behavior as completely justified, as long as the life being taken or haphazardly handled is a black or brown life. Though the killing of Brown by Wilson seemingly fits a long historical script of the harassment of black people at the hands of white police officers, the reality is that overpolicing is an ideology that many police officers subscribe to regardless of color.

That ideology is rooted in a kind of anti-blackness that sees black bodies as a perpetual and mortal threat. Anti-black rhetoric has shown up not only from the Ferguson police but also ironically in the reporting and advocacy of everyone from CNN reporter Don Lemon to rapper Nelly, in their continued focus on issues like “black-on-black crime” and the necessity of keeping law and order. “Don’t use your last option, first,” Nelly told folks on St. Louis radio.  There is little recognition that it is Darren Wilson who used his last option – lethal force — first. Moreover, the whole point of using tear gas and military vehicles in this small community is to force the residents into a realization that they have run out of options. Sadly, anti-black ideology can emerge even from people who are black or who otherwise love black people.

I know Americans like to see themselves as a law and order people, but the few folks who have rioted and looted over the last few days, many of whom are reportedly not Ferguson residents, were stopped in their tracks by peaceful protesters. Even still their presence exposes an inconvenient truth. The killing of unarmed teenagers by police officers is lawlessness. It shows a lack of respect for the sanctity of life and the rule of law. The supreme irony is seeing folks defend the officer’s lawlessness while calling for people destroying property to respect the law.

As I keep saying, destruction of property is not particularly productive. But I refuse to direct my ire toward anyone but the officer who unjustly took Michael Brown’s life and the police establishment that is now complicit in this crime.

I am tired. Emotionally exhausted, actually. I am tired of going to sleep each night seeing a community of people who look like me under military siege. I’m tired of seeing crying black mothers – Sybrina Fulton, Lucia McBath and Leslie McSpadden —distraught over the loss of their teenage sons Trayvon, Jordan and Michael. I’m tired of hearing report after report of people under attack from tear gas. I’m tired of journalists being bullied for trying to tell the truth. I’m tired of explaining to white people why our anger is justified, why looting, which is a property crime, should not even be part of a conversation about the killing of a teenager, why the alleged shoplifting of cigarettes is not a capital offense, why the police officer who killed Mike for the crime of walking in the street is the real thug.

White racism and white privilege continue a bad cop-good cop routine with black America that is utterly exhausting. Just when we think we are making headway, a well-meaning white person asks “but can’t we condemn the looting too?” The question is: Have you condemned the killing? Or have you tried to explain it away? To justify it?

I will not engage in a condemnation quid pro quo with trolls, well-meaning white citizens or respectable black ones, “Brand New Negroes” I call them, in the tradition of the famous text from Harlem Renaissance philosopher Alain Locke. I will not concede that destruction of property is equal to the taking of life. I will not answer calls to be reasonable in the face of unreasonable, unjustifiable black death. I will not believe the lie that black propriety and respectability – pulling our pants up, speaking corporate English, never, ever doing anything wrong – will save us.

Ferguson exposes the extent to which American necropolitics shapes the terms and conditions of black life in what professor Sundiata Cha-Jua calls {a new racial nadir}<hyperlink=""\http://works.bepress.com/sundiata_chajua/2/"">. The first racial nadir happened from about 1890 to about 1930, when black people experienced the unprecedented loss of political gains hard won in the aftermath of the Civil War and the astronomical rise of lynching. We have indeed reached a new nadir in America’s racial life, one hard to fathom as a black president sits in the White House, abdicating his responsibility to speak forcefully and forthrightly to the problem of racism and military-style policing both for fear of being seen as too “black” and for fear of political reprisal from the right.

Meanwhile, our voting rights have been stripped away, our kids are being killed in the streets, their killers rarely convicted, and our communities are placed under siege. And our black president reminds us that {“there are young black men who commit crime,”}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/running-transcript-obamas-remarks-on-ferguson-mo-and-iraq/2014/08/18/ed29d07a-2713-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html""> though he feels no responsibility to say this about any other race of people. It’s a shaming tactic that suggests that black people do not have the right to be angry when our communities are beset with so many problems. It is the kind of anti-black thinking that suggests “acting respectably” will save us.

McCulloch is the only one who has the power to actually charge Darren Wilson with murder, if he sees fit, but some object to McCulloch being the prosecuting attorney in the case given its extremely high profile and his potential bias.

Rep. William Lacy Clay, (D-St. Louis) has been outspoken in his {disapproval}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/st-louis-prosecutor-has-faced-controversy-for-decades/article_cdd4c104-6086-506e-9ee8-aa957a31fee5.html""> of the prosecutor: “We don’t have any confidence in the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney’s office… I have no faith in him, but I do trust the FBI and the justice department.”

The prosecutor has received criticism for his disapproval of Gov. Jay Nixon’s decision to put the Highway Patrol in control of keeping the peace in Ferguson, with some arguing that he disapproved of the decision to put Capt. Ron Johnson in charge. “It appears like the county police and the Ferguson police were upset because they put a black man in charge,” said {Judy Jones}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/report-grand-jury-hear-evidence-michael-brown-case"">, a St. Louis resident. “And in this country, white people don’t like black people telling them anything. That’s why they have problems with Obama.”

The prosecutor has also been criticized for his role in a 2000 case in which two black men were fatally shot by two white undercover drug officers in the parking lot of a Jack in the Box chain restaurant. According to the {St. Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/st-louis-prosecutor-has-faced-controversy-for-decades/article_cdd4c104-6086-506e-9ee8-aa957a31fee5.html"">, McCulloch agreed with a grand jury’s decision not to press charges because of evidence that the two men had attempted to escape and drove toward the officers. A federal investigation later showed that the men were unarmed and that their car had not moved when the officers fired 21 shots, although because the officers feared for their safety, the shootings were legal.

McCulloch later said of the two slain men, “These guys were bums.”

Other critics point to the fact that McCulloch has deep ties to the police: his brother, nephew and cousin have also served as police officers in St. Louis, and his father, also a police officer, was killed in the line of duty by a kidnapper who also happened to be black.

Civil rights activist Martin Luther King III has said, “He has displayed so much bias that he needs to remove himself from the case. That would be a victory for this community.”

McCulloch’s political relationships make it even more difficult to determine where his allegiances lie. St. Louis Public Radio {reports}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/mcculloch-plans-start-grand-jury-proceedings-brown-case-quickly"">:

“The governor and I have known each other since he was a state senator,” McCulloch recalled. As for their relationship, he added drily, “We’ve had our ups and downs.”

The two, both Democrats, tangled occasionally during Nixon’s 16 years as Missouri’s attorney general. But McCulloch said Saturday that he wasn’t going to replay any of those old disputes.

McCulloch appears to have a more amiable relationship with current Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, who the prosecutor called a friend. McCulloch said they’ve been talking regularly since the unrest in Ferguson began…

McCulloch contends that [St. Louis County Executive Charlie] Dooley’s call for a special prosecutor may be related to McCulloch’s active campaigning on behalf of County Councilman Steve Stenger, who handily defeated Dooley in the Aug. 5 primary.

Regardless of public opinion, McCulloch will not be replaced unless he steps down because he is an elected official.",22,691,Some say that county prosecutor Bob McCulloch has an unsettling history of siding with the police,NA

“I wish that all of the pain that I have endured could possibly ease some of yours but it won’t,” Fulton wrote in the letter that was published in Time yesterday evening. “I hate that you and your family must join this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.”

Fulton’s words come in the wake of yet another night of clashing between a militarized Ferguson police force and protesters demanding justice for Brown. An autopsy {released}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html""> late Sunday night, first reported by the New York Times, appeared to confirm numerous eyewitness accounts of the events leading up to Brown’s death — that Brown was shot at least six times, two of which hit the teen in the head.

“One of the bullets shattered Mr. Brown’s right eye, traveled through his face, exited his jaw and re-entered his collarbone,” the Times reported. “The last two shots in the head would have stopped him in his tracks and were likely the last fired.”

Many residents in the Ferguson community and onlookers from around the country have questioned the handling of Brown’s death by Ferguson authorities.

“People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day 1,” said Dr. Baden following the autopsy.

Fulton experienced similar circumstances following the tragic death of her son, Trayvon, who was shot and killed by community watch guard George Zimmerman. Weeks went by before prosecutors charged Zimmerman with Martin’s killing. He was later acquitted.

“Further complicating the pain and loss in this tragedy is the fact that the killer of your son is alive, known, and currently free. In fact, he is on paid administrative leave,” Fulton wrote, referring to the fact that Officer Wilson has yet to be arrested or charged with Brown’s killing. Wilson’s name was made public after nearly a week of protests and national press coverage.

Tuesday morning a spokesman for the St. Louis County Prosecutor’s office, Bob McCulloch, {said}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/report-grand-jury-hear-evidence-michael-brown-case""> that a grand jury could start hearing evidence Wednesday, according to the Associated Press.

“We’re going to start presenting everything to the grand jury as quickly as we can,’’ McCulloch {told}<hyperlink=""http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/mcculloch-plans-start-grand-jury-proceedings-brown-case-quickly""> the St. Louis Post Dispatch Saturday. “We’re not going to wait until we have everything and then do it.”

Fulton urged Brown’s family to remain strong given the circumstances: “Facts, myths, and flat out lies are already out there in Michael’s case,” she wrote. “My advice is to surround yourselves with proven and trusted support. Through it all, I never let go of my faith, my family, or my friends. Long after the overwhelming media attention is gone, you will need those three entities to find your ‘new normal.’ Honor your son and his life, not the circumstances of his alleged transgressions. I have always said that Trayvon was not perfect. But no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed.”

Save me the bullshit Black On Black Crime speech and look at these two Noble creatures called humans and look at what govt-sanctioned murder has done. It has robbed them of their humanity and replaced it with pain and shame, suffering and hurt.

Almost one year to the day later, police gunned down Michael Brown — an 18-year-old, unarmed black man — during a street stop in Missouri. Don’t miss the connection, or the cycle of government violence against black Americans might never end.

Michael Brown’s death at the hands of police comes at a time when black people in Missouri have faced increased targeting by the police.

I was a senior attorney on Floyd v. the City of New York, the class action that proved the NYPD purposefully targeted its stop-and-frisk practice at blacks and Latinos based on their race. And these numbers sound awfully familiar to me.

Between January 2004 and June 2012, the NYPD conducted more than 4.4 million stops. Only 12 percent of the 4.4 million stops resulted in arrest or summons. In 88 percent of 4.4 million stops, no law enforcement action was taken at all. In 52 percent of all stops – more than half the time – a frisk was also conducted. A weapon was found in only 1.5 percent of those frisks. That is, in millions of frisks that officers conducted – when they were supposed to be looking for weapons and they were supposed to have good reason to be looking for weapons – there was no weapon. The vast majority of the time the NYPD stopped or frisked someone, that person was not doing anything unlawful and had no weapon.

And the NYPD was not stopping and frisking everyone. Over 80 percent of the people the NYPD stopped were black or Latino. Only 10 percent were white. Black and Latino people were more likely to be stopped even after controlling for all other factors, including crime and poverty rates. Let me simplify that: Higher crime rates in mostly minority neighborhoods did not explain the racial disparity in the stops the NYPD was conducting.

The NYPD also dispensed force differently depending on race. Between 2004 and 2009, blacks and Latinos were, respectively, 14 percent and 9 percent more likely than whites to be subjected to force by police during a stop.

The Floyd trial went on for nine weeks in the spring of 2013. More than 100 witnesses testified. Among them were many black men who spoke of encounters that are disturbingly similar to the encounter that ended Michael Brown’s life.

Men like {Devin Almonor}<hyperlink=""http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/officer_told_13-year-old_he_was_cry.php"">, the first witness to testify at the Floyd trial. He was only 16 years old when he testified. He was only 13 years old when he was stopped, frisked and arrested by the NYPD for no reason other than the black color of his skin and the fact that he was outside, walking near his home.

It was a Saturday evening, and Devin was walking to meet his older brother at a bodega within blocks of his Harlem apartment, when suddenly a police vehicle pulled up in front of him. Two officers jumped out and yelled at him to stop. One grabbed Devin’s arm and threw him face first onto the car’s hood. The officers pinned Devin there, holding his arms behind his back, handcuffing him, and rubbing their hands up each of his legs, over his body, and down each arm.

Devin was terrified, and helplessly asked, “What is going on? What did I do? I am just a kid.” The officers did not respond. They demanded to know his age. He told them: 13. They accused him of lying. See, they didn’t believe him, because Devin was a tall kid. Just like Michael.

The officers threw Devin in the back of the police cruiser and took him to the police station. On the way, he started to cry. The officer sitting beside him ridiculed him. “Stop crying like a little girl,” he said. And what had Devin done to deserve this treatment? The officers testified they suspected Devin had a gun. But why? What had he done to seem like someone with a gun? He jaywalked, the officers testified.

Now, if you have ever been to New York City, you know that jaywalking is pretty common. What else? There had been, 20 minutes earlier, a report of an unruly group of 40 teenagers, the officers testified. OK, but Devin was alone. Jaywalking alone while black.

And, like almost all of the 2.3 million other (mostly black) people frisked by the NYPD, Devin in fact had no weapon.

Just like Michael Brown.

Do not take the bait, {now being peddled}<hyperlink=""http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-say-michael-brown-fit-description-strong-arm-robbery-suspect/""> by the Missouri police to cover their tracks, that Brown was approached because he matched a suspect description. In New York, the NYPD instructed officers to stop the “right people,” even if they did nothing to appear suspicious. And who were those “right people”? According to Joseph Esposito, the NYPD chief who retired only days before testifying at the Floyd trial: “young men of color in their late teens, early twenties.” Or, as Raymond Kelly, the former NYPD commissioner, put it: The police targeted black and Latino men “{to instill a fear in them}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/nyregion/kelly-intended-frisks-to-instill-fear-senator-testifies.html?_r=0"">, every time they leave their home, they could be stopped by the police.”

It should go without saying that not all young black men are criminal suspects simply because some black men commit crimes. It should go without saying that innocent young black men should not be treated like criminals, that they have the same rights as the rest of us. And when police pull out a vague description of a black criminal suspect as an excuse for murdering a young black man, we should all be suspicious of the police.

It has now been a year since the federal court in Manhattan found that New York’s stop-and-frisk practice violated the constitutional rights of thousands of blacks and Latinos. It has been a year since that court ordered the NYPD to change its racially targeted practice.

Yet those thousands of people have received no relief from the NYPD’s unconstitutional practice because the reforms were put on hold last fall, at the request of Michael Bloomberg, the outgoing New York City mayor. In November, the citizens of New York voted by a landslide majority to elect Bill de Blasio, who promised to withdraw the appeal and start the change as the new mayor. The Floyd plaintiffs and the city, under Mayor de Blasio’s leadership, recently—finally—asked to withdraw the appeal and move forward with reforms. But on August 8, 2014, the NYPD unions submitted their own motion, opposing withdrawal of the appeal.

So, at the same time that police in Missouri were fatally shooting Michael Brown for being black and jaywalking, the NYPD unions were asking a federal appellate court to keep the hold on stop and frisk reforms in place. They are asking the appellate court to let them continue the appeal — to allow this racially targeted police practice to continue.

Now, a year after the city of New York was found to have violated the Constitution, no change has come to the stop-and-frisk program. It has been eight months since the mayor was elected on a promise to remedy the stop-and-frisk practice, and the change has not come. In the meantime: Michael Brown, shot and killed by Ferguson police while walking on the streets in his own neighborhood; {Ezell Ford}<hyperlink=""http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/"">, shot and killed by Los Angeles police while lying on the ground and complying with orders; {Eric Garner}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide"">, strangled to death by New York City police over some loose cigarettes.

Police departments across the country are watching the stop-and-frisk case to see their own limits. The delay of change in New York sends a message to other departments that it’s OK to treat young black men like criminals. Perhaps because the change in New York has been delayed, the police in Missouri felt emboldened to ignore the most fundamental rights of an innocent black man.

But this does not have to continue. The federal appellate court in New York can let its city get on with ending the NYPD’s racially targeted stop-and-frisk practice and set a better trend in other police departments. It could deny the police unions’ request and let the reforms begin.

Michael Brown lay dead in the street for hours. The police treated his body like common street refuse.While the police ended the lives of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, it was white racism that actually killed them.

American society is organized around the maintenance and protection of white privilege.Racism is not an opinion. Racism is a fact.

The reality of the color line, how whiteness is a type of material and psychological privilege, and that people of color are disadvantaged in American society, are among the most repeated findings in all of the Social Sciences.Critics of white supremacy and white racism work from the reasonable and informed belief—given the mountains of empirical data in support of the claim—that racism is one of the most powerful social forces in the United States. White racism deniers, and those others who have perverted the notion of “colorblindness” in order to advance and protect white supremacy as one of the United States’ dominant ideologies, proceed from the opposite assumption.

Gravity is a fact. It does not need an extraordinary proof. Likewise, the fact of how racism continues to structure life chances in the post civil rights era should be a given for any fair-minded and intelligent person.

Colorblind racism and the white racial frame invert and distort reality: reasonable and sensible claims are rejected in favor of extraordinary proofs for the well documented social reality that is white racism. As such, for white racism deniers and their allies, the standards of evidence are made so absurdly high as to be virtually impossible to satisfy or meet with any degree of confidence or certitude.

Events such as the police killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown are a nexus where white racial resentment and white supremacy are made to confront black pain, reasonable hurt and righteous anger.

From the American lynching tree of the 19th and early 20th centuries, to the police harassment and racial profiling of the present, white racial logic deems black humanity to be a type of perpetual threat and poison in the white body politic. The black body must be controlled and terrorized in order to create a sense of safety (and community) for the white public.

Consequently, white racial paranoia twists the murder of two unarmed black people by the police into “justifiable” acts, where the victims of gross and unjust violence are somehow made responsible for their own deaths.

Colorblind racism, white racism denying, and police brutality do the work of white supremacy. They are also micro-aggressions, the goal of which is to exhaust and confuse black and brown people by invalidating their life experiences and assaulting (quite literally in the case of police violence) their personhood.

Colorblind racism, and the related claims that racism does not influence how police and the broader criminal justice system interact with black and brown people, are also assaults on empirical reality and the truth.Justice for Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and the many hundreds and thousands of innocent black and brown people who have been killed by the police requires a clear and direct engagement with the twin facts of American racism and white supremacy.

Eric Garner and Michael Brown were killed by white racism.

What is my evidence for this claim?

1. The United States, from its founding to the present, {is structured around maintaining the dominant power position of those people who are categorized as “white”}<hyperlink=""http://www.chaunceydevega.com/2014/05/10-things-everyone-needs-to-know-about.html"">.America, as a society structured around racial inequality and hierarchy, will reflect that dynamic in its politics, culture, and social institutions. Thus, the legal system and the police will reflect America’s dominant ideologies. America is a racist society; it logically follows that its social and political institutions will channel those values.2. In his essential book, Discipline and Punish, preeminent social theorist and philosopher Michel Foucault detailed how a society’s legal system and approach to punishment and incarceration reflect the values and norms of its elites and dominant group.

The law is a social construction. It is not a “natural” arrangement. Elites make the law in order to serve their own interests. For example, the distinction between “white collar” and other crimes are but one way that those individuals who make the law can insulate themselves from its full consequences.

The class and racial disparities in American law and punishment are not accidents or a coincident: they are how the dominant and in-group protect their own interests to the disadvantage of the Other.

3. {Police in America can trace their origins to the slave patrollers and “paddy rollers”}<hyperlink=""http://www.lsd-journal.net/archives/Volume6/WhiteSupremacists.pdf""> of the antebellum South. Their goal was to support and protect the Southern Slaveocracy by terrorizing black people. The violence, terror, and harassment of black and brown communities, and the violation of the civil liberties of black and brown people, are not aberrations or outliers. They are part of a long cultural habit and tradition of racist behavior by American police departments and other law enforcement agencies.

4. As {Michelle Alexander}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/New-Jim-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness/dp/1595581030/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=1-1&qid=1407913657""> and others have extensively documented, there is racial bias against black people at every level of the criminal justice system. The cumulative effect of institutional and interpersonal racism by police and other law enforcement agencies is that black people are disproportionately incarcerated, receive longer sentences for the same crimes as white people, and are subjected to supervision and harassment by the legal system throughout their lives. The United States is a two-tier racially ordered society where the color line extends to the criminal justice system.

5. {A new report from the Vera Institute of Justice}<hyperlink=""http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/race-and-prosecution-manhattan-research-summary-v2.pdf""> details how police and other elements of the criminal justice system have a remarkable amount of discretion in how they choose to punish or otherwise interact with citizens. Those agents use their discretionary powers to disproportionately and unfairly harass, arrest, and punish blacks and Latinos as compared to white people.

6. Police mirror the broader racial biases of white Americans towards African-Americans. The association between black people and criminality has been reinforced by a racially biased media, educational system, entertainment industry, and other agents of political socialization for centuries in the United States, specifically, and the West, more generally. In fact,   that white people have been so deeply taught to associate black people with crime that they continue to support racially biased sentencing even when shown that it is unfair.

7. {While white people were found to be more likely to have drugs or weapons on their persons}<hyperlink=""http://rt.com/usa/stop-frisk-whites-drugs-weapons-667/"">, African-Americans and Latinos are disproportionately targeted for “stop and frisk” police searches in major cities such as New York. “Quality of life crimes” and {“broken windows” police tactics are disproportionately used in black and brown communities}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/summons-broken-windows-racial-disparity-garner-article-1.1890567"">. The systematic harassment of innocent black and brown people by the police creates a space for negative encounters which may end in incarceration or even police violence.

8. Communities of color, both because of race and class inequalities, suffer under aggressive and hostile police tactics. {The militarization of the United States’ police departments}<hyperlink=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323848804578608040780519904""> is a national problem. This dynamic is amplified in black and brown communities, where for decades, American police departments have viewed them as territories to be “conquered” and its citizens as “enemy insurgents” or “combatants”. Because police see black and brown communities—and their residents—as threats, they are much more likely to use violence and draconian tactics against them.

9. Recent work by the  {Malcolm X Grassroots Movement}<hyperlink=""http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/1-black-man-killed-every-28-hours-police-or-vigilantes-america-perpetually-war-its"">, a think tank and social justice research and advocacy organization, reveals how police, street vigilantes, or security guards have killed one black person every 28 hours.

A common scenario involves the police shooting and killing unarmed black people who are holding harmless objects in their hands—with the former claiming that they thought that a wallet, house keys, or even a telephone were “guns” or other “dangerous” objects.

Psychologists have conducted research which suggests that {implicit racial bias influences}<hyperlink=""http://www.ncsc.org/~/media/Files/PDF/Topics/Gender%20and%20Racial%20Fairness/Implicit%20Bias%20FAQs%20rev.ashx""> how white people (and others) may actually “see” non-whites in a negative manner. Thus, the subconscious thinking processes of white people may actually be transforming black people into threats where none actually exist.

Other research complements this disturbing finding: researchers at the University of Chicago and elsewhere have reported that white police officers (and others) are   {influenced by racial bias in their decision-making processes}<hyperlink=""http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&article_id=1798&issue_id=5200""> regarding when and if to shoot (unarmed) black people. The {research on implicit bias and racial attitudes indicates}<hyperlink=""http://fairandimpartialpolicing.com/bias/""> that white racial animus and subconscious racism influences how police interact with black people—often with deadly results.

10. As Assistant Professor Vesla Weaver of Yale University {deftly argued}<hyperlink=""http://bostonreview.net/us/vesla-m-weaver-citizenship-custodial-state-incarceration""> in an excellent piece for the Boston Review, black and brown Americans who live in low income and working class communities are denied the full rights of citizenship by an expansive, punitive, and intrusive state bureaucracy and legal system. Consequently, police are much more likely to come in contact with innocent black people than they are whites who are involved in criminal behavior.

As a result, white criminals are more likely to be ignored by police; innocent black people are harassed and often arrested by the police.

Blackness is judged by the White Gaze as de facto criminality. Whiteness is judged by the White Gaze as innocent and harmless.

This racist logic creates a type of path dependency that justifies the disproportionate incarceration, harassment, and killing of black people by the police. In a perverse twist, the over-policing of innocent black people also offers protection for the white criminals who prey on the white community.The police reportedly have a saying that, “I’d rather be judged by 12, than carried by 6”. The governing logic is simple: if in doubt, shoot and kill someone because you would rather be alive and put on trial, than be dead and in the ground. That logic is increasingly applied in an unrestrained manner by police who see the black body as a primordial and imminent threat, and consequently do not hesitate to use lethal, and very often, unjustified force against it.

The police channeled this racism to kill Eric Garner and Michael Brown.

The killing of unarmed black people by American police is a human rights issue. It should also be a concern for all people, on all sides of the color line, who care about civil liberties, rights, and freedom. Why? The terrorizing of black and brown communities is a preview of what a militarized and fully unleashed police department, enlisted in the service of the surveillance society and a culture of cruelty, can (and will) do to white Americans in the future.",16,798,"The police may have ended their lives, but it was white supremacy that sealed their fates",NA

O’Reilly’s stance, of course, is that despite knowing that police shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, and despite the fact that unarmed young black men are disproportionately targeted in America, all the protesters should just calm down because, hey, the police who started this all are now handling it! The shooting “is now being investigated by state and local authorities, but that hasn’t stopped rioting and looting in the area,” O’Reilly said. “We have to wait and see how the justice system handles this situation,” he concluded, opening up the floor to his guest, Dr. Ben Carson.

Curiously, O’Reilly and Carson expressed more compassion for the police — those who killed an unarmed teen and then threw tear gas at mourning, agitated crowds and blocked out the press — than any of the civilians or victims. Of Brown’s father, O’Reilly said, “He’s believes that it was an injustice, that it was done for nothing, that it was a murder. And many many African-Americans believe that without knowing the facts.”

“What fact can emerge?” asked Brand. “There’s no fact that can emerge that makes it alright that this keeps happening.”

“I think it’s worth pointing out at this juncture that if an unarmed policeman was shot by a black teenager, I can’t imagine Fox News giving voice to someone to say, ‘You’ve got to remember, black teenagers are people too.’ They’d be all, ‘This is unacceptable! This is an indication of a society in decline!’” he continued.

“You can’t apply that compassion in exclusivity. Either you apply that compassion entirely to a situation — like, for example, why the people rioting, which they tried to extract compassion from, which [Fox] tried to do a moment ago, or you apply it with ubiquity,” he said.

Then Brand issued a spot-on assessment of Fox: “The ironic thing is that the values that Fox News purports, like unity, like America, ‘this is a great country’ — they’re constantly at odds with that, because they really believe in oppression and exploitation, and the minimization of the suffering of the people who need the most support.”",28,2000,The British comedian mocks the Fox News commentator for defending the St. Louis PD in the Ferguson riots ,NA

And when news broke Saturday afternoon that the unarmed teen was gunned down by police on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, I was engulfed with a sense impotent rage before I even knew his name.

There were no tears this time as there were for Sean Bell, Oscar Grant, Rekia Boyd, Trayvon Martin, Tarika Wilson, Jonathan Ferrell, Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Wendell Allen, Eric Garner, and too many other innocent Black lives that were snatched away by people who swore oaths to keep them safe.

The chilling numbness that enveloped me when I read the news of John Crawford, who was gunned down by Ohio police in Walmart mere days before Brown, did not come.

The anger—hot, hard, fast—intensified until the words “Fuck the police” burst free. That guttural call-to-arms, which has seared the Hip-Hop generation’s consciousness since N.W.A. put our collective frustration into words, found a home amid the cacophony of rage building on social media and the streets of Ferguson where a community unchained refused to be silenced, even as police tanks and dogs tried their best to intimidate them.

Brown, affectionately known as “Mike Mike” to his friends, was killed within days of Theodore Wafer being found guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of {Renisha McBride}<hyperlink=""http://www.damemagazine.com/2014/07/28/renisha-mcbride-was-also-unarmed-black-teenager"">. That momentary reprieve from the relentless assault against Black humanity was swiftly shattered, these brutal deaths serving as a stark reminder that freedom for Black people in this country, the ability to navigate the world as autonomous human beings, is merely an illusion.

For those who would call that statement hyperbolic: When was the last time that an unarmed White person was gunned down by the police? When was the last time a White teen was left to rot like strange fruit, face down in the middle of the street for four hours, his blood pooled beneath him?

I’ll wait.

“The relationship between Black folks and many White cops in this country is so far out of hand, and at some point we Black folks have to start taking some of that blame. We let police brutality run rampant through our community. There are thousands of Black police officers across this country. When have you ever read in the paper that a Black cop handcuffed a White person and shot them in the back of the head? … They don’t mess with White folks because they know that White folks won’t tolerate it, plain and simple. When we Black folks decide that we are not going to tolerate police brutality, then it will stop. There’s something wrong with a people who have more fear for their enemy than they have love for their children. We have to understand and say to America and the police that enough is enough.”

Despite former News 12 reporter Sean Bergin’s {ridiculously racist assertion}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/16/sean-bergin-news-12-reporter_n_5591272.html""> that the absence of Black fathers breeds anti-cop sentiment, Black Americans know that it is our hot blood, fertilizing the pavements of hoods and subway platforms and gated communities around the country, causing bitter disgust to bloom all year ’round.

So I hold them tighter and attempt to quell the paralyzing fear that comes with knowing that they will be viewed as potential threats to be neutralized before they are viewed as human beings to be respected. I trace their faces and wish that I can always hold their hands when they cross the street and that they can stay forever within the cocoon of my embrace.

But I cannot. They cannot.

If you don’t want to get hurt, don’t challenge me.” Surely, the headline is a quote from someone the writer spoke with, or, maybe, the whole thing is satire?

In fact, the article was written in earnest by Sunil Dutta, an adjunct instructor at Colorado Technical University and police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department. Dutta was inspired by the killing of Michael Brown to write in defense of cops. “Cops are not murderers,” he insists in his third sentence.

The fact is that some cops, just like some people, actually are. Because cops are people.

“Here is the bottom line,” he writes, “if you don’t want to get shot, tased, pepper-sprayed, struck with a baton or thrown to the ground, just do what I tell you. Don’t argue with me, don’t call me names, don’t tell me that I can’t stop you, don’t say I’m a racist pig, don’t threaten that you’ll sue me and take away my badge. Don’t scream at me that you pay my salary, and don’t even think of aggressively walking towards me. Most field stops are complete in minutes. How difficult is it to cooperate for that long?”

Could that be a real paragraph published in the Post?

How about when officers held Eric Garner in a {chokehold}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/01/justice/new-york-choke-hold-death/""> when he objected to their questioning? Was he wrong to scream, “I can’t breathe!” in an attempt to alert the cops he was asthmatic? Is it his fault that he died?

Or what about when {five teenagers}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/nyregion/5-exonerated-in-central-park-jogger-case-are-to-settle-suit-for-40-million.html""> were coerced into accompanying the NYPD to the precinct where they were, again, coerced into giving false confessions for beating and raping a female jogger in Central Park? Did they spend 13 years in prison for a crime they didn’t commit because they didn’t cooperate with the interrogating officer?

Of course not.

Dutta admits that he knows some police activities are illegal. “You don’t have to submit to an illegal stop or search,” he says. “You can refuse consent to search your car or home if there’s no warrant (though a pat-down is still allowed if there is cause for suspicion) … Unless the officer has a legal basis to stop and search you, he or she must let you go. Finally, cops are legally prohibited from using excessive force: The moment a suspect submits and stops resisting, the officers must cease use of force.”

I feel a “but” coming …

“But if you believe (or know) that the cop stopping you is violating your rights or is acting like a bully, I guarantee that the situation will not become easier if you show your anger or resentment … Save your anger for later, and channel it appropriately. Do what the officer tells you to and it will end safely for both of you.”

The thing that is so outrageous about this article is that it implies that Michael Brown and other victims of police brutality must have wronged the offending officers in some way. They must have, because cops are so impeccably trained and would never stray from protocol.

Yes, if you are arrested, the ACLU {recommends}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/drug-law-reform-immigrants-rights-racial-justice/know-your-rights-what-do-if-you""> that you cooperate with the police officer and submit to the arrest. The thing is, though, that cops aren’t always right or doofily misguided (i.e., “Whoops, we were wrong. You can go now”). Sometimes, cops, just like other people, make bad decisions. Sometimes cops decide to take unrelated anger out on civilians. Sometimes cops get carried away with the power of their position. Sometimes cops commit crimes.

The problem with institutionalized positions of authority is exactly what Dutta accidentally demonstrated — individuals in dominant social positions think that they are absolved of any criminal or otherwise malevolent impulse just because of their title.

[E]yebrows were raised in January when the first surveillance cameras went up on Main Street. Each camera is a shiny white metallic box with two lenses like eyes. The camera’s shape and design resemble a robot’s head. Workers on motorized lifts installed seven cameras in a 360-degree cluster on top of City Hall. They put up groups of six atop two light poles at the loading dock, and more at the fire hall and boat harbor. By mid-February, more than 60 cameras watched over the town, and the Dillingham Police Department plans to install 20 more — all purchased through a $202,000 Homeland Security grant meant primarily to defend against a terrorist attack.

Dillingham has a population of 2,500 people. It is only reachable by boat or plane.

As Radley Balko thoroughly documented in his book “Warrior Cop” the military industrial complex has created a new industry: the police industrial complex. And it’s been quietly militarizing our police agencies for quite a long time. Indeed, he traces this trend back to the early 1980s under the freedom- and liberty-loving Ronald Reagan. The Gipper deemed the drug war to be a real war and easily passed the Military Cooperation With Civilian Law Enforcement Act, “which allowed and encouraged the military to give local, state, and federal police access to military bases, research, and equipment.” The police got training from the armed forces to use their new war-making equipment and the military became involved with intelligence and operations in the drug war. Every president since then, including the current one, has reauthorized the program, putting more and more money on the table. Balko wrote, “Then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney declared in 1989, ‘The detection and countering of the production, trafficking and use of illegal drugs is a high priority national security mission of the Department of Defense.'”

So this really isn’t a new thing. But it’s been on steroids since 9/11 with the creation of the new Department of Homeland Security. {Needless to say, that was just the tip of the iceberg}<hyperlink=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/bradlockwood/2011/11/30/the-militarizing-of-local-police/"">. Since 9/11 the United States has been spending vast sums of money through DHS to outfit the state and local authorities with surveillance and military gear ostensibly to fight the terrorist threat at home.

What we have been seeing in Ferguson, Missouri, these past few days is largely a result of that program — and an entire industry has grown up around it. Attorney General Eric Holder is reportedly concerned about this deployment of military gear. Where in the world has Eric Holder and every other officeholder who’s expressed dismay these last couple of days been? This equipment didn’t just materialize on its own. As we’ve seen, it’s mostly been paid for by the federal government. Indeed, in less than a month a group of militarized police equipment vendors across the nation will be gathering for an annual confab called “Urban Shield” (“Critical training for critical time”) in Oakland, California. It features dozens of sponsors, from the Department of Homeland Security and police agencies all over the country to such vendors as Armored Mobility Inc., which bills itself as “the Worldwide Leader in Dynamic Mobile Armor and Shields: Today’s threat is rifle rounds and they are coming in bunches, through doors, walls and ceilings! Our Dynamic Armor and Mobile Armored Shields will save lives!!!!” {Here’s one of its “highlight” videos:}<hyperlink=""http://youtu.be/sz34mYStJ1o"">

The Department of Homeland Security disburses somewhere in the vicinity of $3 billion a year for this sort of thing. Add in the loot that’s legally appropriated by police agencies in the war on drugs and you have a massive incentive to turn the streets of Ferguson, Missouri (or Zuccotti Park) into a scene that looks more like the siege of Fallujah. After all, that’s explicitly what that video is telling these “troops” they need the Robo-Cop equipment for. And that’s the problem. If you build a police state, the police are going to want to use it. It’s human nature. In fact, according to Balko, they’re commonly using SWAT teams to deliver all search warrants in some jurisdictions now — no matter what the crime. What else are they going to do? There simply aren’t enough “sieges” going on in any given town on any given day to justify all this gear.

All this week people were shocked to see police officers dressed up in what one wag called “commando-chic” pointing guns directly at unarmed civilians. They were taken aback at the idea that heavily armed officers wearing desert battle fatigues would enter a McDonald’s where children were present to roust the customers and arrest reporters who were sitting quietly charging their laptops. They saw the unmotivated discharge of tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters. They wondered why there were tanks and automatic weapons in our streets. Well, it’s a long overdue wake-up call. We’ve been spending billions of taxpayer dollars for decades to turn the streets of urban America into a war zone at the merest hint of dissent. And now it’s here.

One cannot help noticing, however, how differently members of the right react to protests over a police officer gunning down unarmed young men in the streets and their reflexive support of Cliven Bundy’s armed resistance last April when the government seized some cattle to pay for a delinquent tax bill. In fact, some of the most common right-wing images from the stand-off were the pictures of six cows “murdered” by jackbooted thugs accompanied by {screaming headlines}<hyperlink=""http://www.infowars.com/bundy-family-uncovers-suspected-blm-cattle-grave/""> about “mass graves.” (The government admitted that six cattle were euthanized. Unfortunately, they never made it to market where they could be served as steaks alongside others from their herd at the Bundy Bar-b-que.) The killing of Michael Brown and the subsequent protest have brought headlines like {“Five Race Riots in Obama’s Post Racial America.”}<hyperlink=""http://http//littlegreenfootballs.com/article/43714_Yes_Its_Yet_Another_Deluge_of_Open_Racism_at_Breitbart_News""> But then, the Bundy protests were about property, something much more sacred than the life of a young black man ever is.

You need only check in with appalling hate talk show host Laura Ingraham to understand where they are coming from. As {Media Matters}<hyperlink=""http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/08/14/lynch-mob-or-freedom-riders-laura-ingrahams-tak/200440""> noted with astonishment, last April Ingraham called the Bundy protesters the new “Freedom Riders.” Yesterday, unbelievably, she characterized the Ferguson protesters as a “lynch mob.”(Yes, she really said that.) So I wouldn’t expect much solidarity from the Bundy bunch.

Rand Paul, at least, {has stepped up}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/"">. He’s wrong on many things and a hypocrite about many others. But when he’s right, he’s right:

When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands. Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.

{Glenn Greenwald said it even more pointedly:}<hyperlink=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/14/militarization-u-s-police-dragged-light-horrors-ferguson/"">

It is not hard to predict the results of importing this battlefield mentality onto American soil, aimed at American citizens: “From Warfighter to Crimefighter.” The results have been clear for those who have looked – or those who have been subject to this – for years. The events in Ferguson are, finally, forcing all Americans to watch the outcome of this process.

There’s a reason the Pentagon made reporters “embed” with them during the Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns rather than allow them to report on their own. They learned their lesson from Vietnam: control the images of the fight lest the American people see the horror in their living rooms. It’s the same reason why police are often confiscating video shot by citizens. It’s why they arrested those reporters in Ferguson on Wednesday night. Once you let the American people see the war with all its domineering violence they will question its necessity. The police in Ferguson have been unable to keep the press from showing those pictures of tanks running through the streets of an American town to quell unarmed protests over a police shooting of an unarmed teenager. And the American people are questioning it. Finally. Maybe, at the very least, we can agree that enabling our police to adopt the ethos that the people are their enemy might just be a little bit un-American.",194,1000,Since 9/11 we've spent huge sums to outfit local authorities with military gear.

The tape shows a young man, allegedly Michael Brown, involved in a “strong-arm” robbery, where a pack of cigars was taken.

The “Fox and Friends” hosts, rather than discuss this young man’s death, or racism, or any of the other important issues surrounding the death of this 18-year-old, questioned the federal government’s involvement in the investigation. They took issue with the 40 FBI agents canvassing the streets, and the recent news that the Department of Justice did not want the tape released, fearing that it might incite more violence.

“Why would the Justice Department pressure them not to?” Tucker Carlson demanded. “Obviously it’s not to keep the situation under control … [The FBI] refused to intervene when people were looting stores. So if you had an interest in keeping the situation under control, you would control the situation by preventing people from stealing wigs.”

“But the thing is that the crowd immediately went out there when they found out that this man was shot — a young black man was shot by a white cop,” Juliet Huddy explained. “They went out there; they were furious about it.”

“Had that tape been out there, had the crowd realized that this man might have been robbing a store,” she continued, “there might have been something else criminal going on there, you know, to lend credence to the fact that maybe in some way — we don’t know this — but maybe this officer was justified, maybe this was a bad guy, maybe he wasn’t the ‘gentle giant.’ I’m not saying that’s what it was.”

On Saturday Gov. Nixon declared a controversial emergency curfew for Ferguson, following the looting that occurred on Friday night.

Mitchell asked Gov. Nixon why the tape of a young man, allegedly Michael Brown, involved in a strong-arm robbery was released before any information about the officer responsible for Brown’s death. She also suggested that this video was what led to an escalation of violence.

“We and our security team and the highway patrol did not know that was going to be released, and quite frankly I don’t think the attorney general knew,” Nixon stated. “And quite frankly we disagree deeply, I think for two reasons. Number one, to, I think in essence, to disparage the character of this victim in the middle of a process like this is not right. Secondarily, it did put the community, and quite frankly the community and the nation, on alert again.”

Saturday night, rolling into Sunday morning, was the first night of the state-imposed curfew. Protesters were told to clear the streets from midnight until 5:00 a.m., with reporters corralled to a press location.

Yet another pair of parents now mourns the shooting death of their unarmed son in a “stand your ground” state. Ferguson, Missouri, the St. Louis suburb where 18-year-old Michael Brown was gunned down Saturday, is 67 percent black and 29 percent white, according to {the most recent data}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/12/5994181/ferguson-is-67-percent-black-and-its-police-force-is-94-percent-white"">. Ninety-four percent of the community’s police force is reportedly white.

As important, the state’s strong gun lobby helps sanctify its shoot-first values. Pain sears any reasonable conscience learning that another unarmed black youth, apparently in surrender, has been killed.  Anger singes any reasonable mind wondering why and how the young man died.

Michael Brown was not Trayvon Martin. Each boy lived his own individuality, enjoyed his own humanity.  And unlike Trayvon’s, the exact circumstances of Michael’s shooting remain to be investigated.

In this process, here’s a start: Authorities should release the name of the Ferguson police officer who, at present, is shielded in police secrecy. This situation is not a 12-step program, Debtors or Alcoholics Anonymous. Why is the Ferguson police officer being granted the benefit of anonymity even as a youth is dead?  Not only does Michael Brown have no anonymity, his family should brace itself: Police apologists and right-wing news media are chomping at the bit to excavate the deceased boy’s past – school records, potential recreational drug use, friendships, etc. — publicly to smear his name as a means to justify his death.

Smart lessons should have prevailed after Trayvon’s shooting — and many others.  As brown and black mothers fear for their sons, seek understanding and justice, I wonder: What did America, Ferguson and its police force learn from Sabrina Fulton’s pain?  What did politicians change, if anything, after Trayvon’s shooting?

Hopefully, the law will distribute justice, however necessary, in Michael’s case.  But then there’s us, our communities, and the value of our lives. This time around, a grass-roots and political response to a young man’s death must actively confront all the problems at play: race, racial profiling, a powerful, profit-obsessed firearms lobby, “stand your ground,” youth, young people’s perceived poverty and criminality, and gun capitalism in America.

After publishing an Op-Ed in the New York Times about Trayvon’s death, I received over a hundred positive and pro-youth emails.  But I received as many negative messages, such as:

This has to do with crime and danger. We’ve all been shown an adorable picture of Trayvon that turns out to be five years old at least. We find now that he was tattooed, had gold teeth, possessed marijuana, used gang signs on his twitter account, assaulted a bus driver, possessed tools in his backpack, and womens’ jewelry not belonging to him. He was suspended from school for ten days. Also, he was a strapping guy who was over six feet tall.

This email — representative of dozens of others that I received — maintains that Trayvon had it coming to him, as though tattoos, a school suspension and so on warrant an unarmed innocent minor being gunned down. I had to point out to such readers the obvious: Even if Trayvon had been a convicted felon, he deserved his humanity and proper due process treatment from legitimate law authorities.

Every time such a tragedy erupts, certain people in the U.S. — use your imagination — get forced to revisit our own brushes with profiling. The drumbeat of such shootings should horrify. I revisit thoughts that I first shared on this site.

Weeks before George Zimmerman’s acquittal, I returned to New York City from Fire Island on a Sunday evening, and decided to stop by my office.

After I let myself into the office, I noticed some white folks mingling around. I paid them no mind, since our office often has off-hours visitors who rent the common space.

“Can I help you?” said a middle-aged man, testily.

“No,” I shot back.  “But I can I help you?”

“What do you mean?”

“I work here,” I said. “This is my office.”

“Oh,” he said, stepping back slightly.  “I saw you and just wanted to make sure things are OK.”

“Thank you, George Zimmerman,” I said.

Weeks later, when Zimmerman was acquitted, my sarcastic one-off felt more warranted than I could ever have imagined.

Here, this typical “Can I help you?” doubles as a passive-aggressive demand for me to justify my presence even where I belong. Thankfully, I have never encountered an armed white person on the other end of that presumption.

Some youth pay for that common presumption with their life.

The Zimmerman acquittal, as I warned then in Salon, would have devastating consequences.  The verdict served a green light for every paranoid vigilante to go on victimizing black youth.

Since our juridical establishment often turns its head – or even winks – at the prevalence of racial profiling and police brutality against black and brown people, we are faced with yet another horrific case. Implicitly and explicitly, the law condones this racial paranoia. The so-called rationales used to design and peddle the “stand your ground” credo, “stop and frisk” laws, and anti-immigrant hysteria fuel the very vigilante mentality putting many young people at dire risk.

Picture a U.S. congressional hopeful, and sitting state representative, jeering at a {bus full of YMCA summer camp kids}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/do-you-know-was-bus-ymca-kids"">.

Why did leaders ignore George Zimmerman’s acquittal, such a brutal cautionary tale on racial profiling and vigilante justice? Why do they embrace the paranoid logic of gun capitalism?  Zimmerman claimed he didn’t feel safe. Did Trayvon feel safe?  After all, the youth was shot by an assailant with a troubling history with law enforcement.

Michael Brown apparently didn’t feel safe either.

It’s a mordant case of déjà vu, this willful ignorance on our leaders’ parts. Why hasn’t the 2012 Aurora shooting and the 2012 Newtown massacre forced us all to confront the illusory sense of safety in our communities?

With “Regeneration Through Violence,” “The Fatal Environment,” “Gunfighter Nation,” Richard Slotkin delivered a masterful historical trilogy on this country’s long-standing love affair with vigilantism, cruelty and gun violence.  Read carefully and Slotkin’s masterwork offers trenchant insight into these shootings, alongside the racist vitriol documented by George Zimmerman and certain cops.  The penetrating trilogy uniquely exposes the ugly, barbed issues at work, from the colonial era on.

Today, the questions remain: How will law enforcement maintain “justice” in a country getting browner by the day? And in a nation that feels the need to “regenerate” itself through violence? What will this country do to keep young people safe?

Our violent frontier myth dominates our politics and culture, from the Pentagon to the trenches of local policing. We remain a gunfighter nation. From Trayvon to the kids in Newtown to Michael Brown, young people are vulnerable to mentally ill or paranoid or racist adults wielding guns. Sadly, Michael’s parents’ pain serves as a blunt reminder of who writes our laws, who enforces our laws, and the very presumptions guiding our laws.

“This is my neighborhood,” Johnson continued. “You are my family, you are my friends and I am you. And I will stand and protect you, and your right to protest.”

Johnson was appointed by Governor Jay Nixon to monitor the protests, after days of heavily militarized policing sparked controversy and unrest. The Missouri State Highway Patrol captain is a Ferguson native, and he spoke to the community about his own family — including his daughter and his own son.

“When this is over, I’m gonna go in my son’s room,” Johnson said. “My black son, who wears his pants saggy, wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms.

That’s not the whole truth. I bought two pairs of Jordans last month, which brought the total to five for the year. I’m going to buy (at least) one more pair this month, and a few more before 2014 ends. In other words, I have and will continue to spend entirely too much money on some fucking sneakers.

I’m not a collector. I’m more interested in my own vanity than impressing sneakerheads with a closet full of shoes. But I’m not out there buying just any shoes. I’m drawn to Jordans in a way that almost makes other shoes invisible to me. They are legend.

Take my most recent pair, the Wolf Grey Jordan 3’s. The colorway is new, but the Jordan 3 debuted in 1988, the year Michael Jordan’s legend was cemented. In his fourth year in the NBA, he led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 points per game, as well as steals, won Most Valuable Player and Defensive Player of the Year, on top of winning the slam dunk competition. The design of the shoe is almost secondary; it’s cool to feel a connection to such greatness.

That’s what I’m really buying when I get a new pair of Jordans: cool. It’s not something I come by naturally. Ask all the people I went to high school with who didn’t even bother to invite me to our 10-year anniversary that took place a couple of months ago. Ask the kid from the after-school program I used to volunteer at whose first words to me were “you corny.” Ask anybody, really. The Mychal Denzel Smith brand is not synonymous with cool.

Not the case for Michael Jordan. During his playing career, Jordan epitomized cool. In particular, he became the standard bearer of black masculine cool. He gave us the shaved head, the wagging tongue, the baggy basketball shorts, the effortless fadeaway and, of course, the sneakers. Growing up, I, like millions of others, wanted to be like Mike, and found whatever way I could to emulate his swagger. I’m naturally awkward and I never quite got it right, but purchasing those kicks at least made me feel like I had a chance. You have the ability to possess the cool they exude and maybe isn’t innate to your own character. They’re a status symbol more than anything.

I shouldn’t be as concerned with “cool” at this point in my life, but we all have our flaws. And the type of cool associated with Jordans represents something complicated for me. There’s a connection to a certain variety of black masculinity, one inseparable from America’s troubled relationship with black men. It’s not that different from the obsession with hip-hop. Putting on a pair of Jordans is like being able to wear Jay Z lyrics. It’s the kind of cool that has kids who have never seen Jordan play standing in line for hours just to feel it.

Personally, I like the feeling of invincibility that provides. But then I remember that that cool has never protected us. As much as America steals from our culture, as much as they copy and commodify black male cool, we’re still expendable. I remember Michael Brown and my Jordans don’t feel all that cool anymore. They feel like an expensive placebo of progress.

Still, I’m going to buy another pair.

I’ve also thought about buying some LeBrons, but I haven’t made that commitment just yet.

It’s not really fair to keep comparing LeBron James to Michael Jordan. He should be allowed to chart his own path absent any questions of “What Would Jordan Do?” And that’s exactly what he’s done. And that’s also why his sneakers aren’t as cool.

Don’t get me wrong, those LeBron 11’s are pretty hot. But it’s not the $200 (or $275 for the LeBron 11 Elite) that’s stopped me from buying them. LeBron, his brand, and his shoes just don’t have that “it” factor. Most popular athlete on the planet notwithstanding, something is missing. He hasn’t given us a wagging tongue. The King James crown doesn’t have the iconic feel of Jordan’s Jumpman. His post-game interview fashion show has been usurped by guys not much younger than him. His hairline is the thing of vicious (and hilarious) jokes, not emulation, and he can’t lay claim to headbands or arms full of tattoos (thanks, Allen Iverson). “Witness” my stick around, but it’ll never top “Air Jordan” or “I Wanna Be Like Mike” or “Is it the shoes?!” By traditional metrics, LeBron has no cool. He’s no Jordan.

Which is great. I’m glad LeBron isn’t Jordan. We don’t need another one. We need LeBron.

Jordan owns cool, but LeBron’s legacy will be much more important. It started with the infamous “Decision” in 2010. Putting aside the grandiose hour-long TV special and the hurt feelings of Cleveland Cavaliers fans, “The Decision” marked an understanding for a new generation of athletes of their power. It showed that LeBron doesn’t see himself as an employee beholden to the whims of ownership and management — he controlled his own future. He could decide where to play, whom to play with, and (within the structure of the NBA’s collective bargaining agreement) how much to play for. He assessed his own worth and only agreed to play on terms that honored that.

In the aftermath, when he caught backlash for it, {he didn’t shy away from talking about the role race}<hyperlink=""http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/LeBron-James-says-race-was-a-factor-in-backlash-?urn=nba-273678""> played in the reception of “The Decision.” He took heat for daring to be a 25-year-old black man who would not demur in the face of white male ownership, and he didn’t back down from saying so.

In 2012, {in the wake of the killing of Trayvon Martin, he organized the entire Miami Heat team for a photo}<hyperlink=""http://espn.go.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/7728618/miami-heat-don-hoodies-response-death-teen-trayvon-martin""> that still gives me chills. They collectively donned their hoodies, bowed their heads, and LeBron captioned the photo on Twitter with “#WeAreTrayvonMartin” and “#WeWantJustice.” Who ever heard of Jordan doing something like that?

Earlier this year, who was the first NBA player to speak up in the wake of the Donald Sterling tapes and call for his ouster from the league? {None other than LeBron James.}<hyperlink=""http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/04/26/lebron-james-there-is-no-room-for-donald-sterling-in-our-league/""> Rumors circulated that he would lead a player boycott for the 2014-15 season if Sterling wasn’t removed as an owner, and while they were just rumors, it wasn’t hard to believe LeBron might actually do it.

And most recently, with “The Decision Part II,” he decided to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Why? Why would he go back to play for Cavs owner Dan Gilbert after the paternalistic and insulting letter he wrote in response to LeBron leaving in 2010? In LeBron’s own words, {published by Sports Illustrated}<hyperlink=""http://www.si.com/nba/2014/07/11/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers"">:

I feel my calling here goes above basketball. I have a responsibility to lead, in more ways than one, and I take that very seriously….I want kids in Northeast Ohio, like the hundreds of Akron third-graders I sponsor through my foundation, to realize that there’s no better place to grow up. Maybe some of them will come home after college and start a family or open a business. That would make me smile. Our community, which has struggled so much, needs all the talent it can get.

It echoed his {Finals MVP speech from 2013}<hyperlink=""http://www.sbnation.com/2013/6/21/4450800/lebron-james-mvp-speech-nba-finals-2013""> when he said, “I’m LeBron James, from Akron, Ohio. From the inner city. I’m not even supposed to be here.” He thinks beyond basketball. He thinks beyond Gilbert. He takes his fame and the responsibility that comes with it seriously. He’s a black boy who got a chance and he wants to ensure that others like him get a few chances, too.

That’s not MJ cool. Jordan just wanted to play ball and sell sneakers. He couldn’t be bothered with caring about the world around him. LeBron wants to play ball and sell sneakers, as well, but he’s also an engaged citizen with a sense of purpose that extends beyond his stat line. As a result, he doesn’t represent the kind of black male cool that we’re used to.

This isn’t a screed meant to denigrate that kind of cool. I’m in an endless pursuit of it, hence the exorbitant amount of money spent on Jordans. It’s also not a coronation of LeBron James as the next great athlete-activist. He isn’t Jim Brown, or Muhammad Ali, or John Carlos, or Tommie Smith, or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He’s LeBron. He wants to be the first billionaire athlete. But that doesn’t mean he’s turning his back on the world.

Twenty years from now, I’ll probably still be buying new Jordans. They’re classic. I doubt LeBron will have any classic sneakers. I’ll gladly eat my words if that’s not the case. But 20 years from now, we’ll also be asking, “Who is the next LeBron?” and it’ll mean more than what this person can do on the court or his status as a global icon. He’ll have to produce a legacy that touches people’s real lives. That’s pretty cool.",2,158,"From Jordan's kicks to LeBron's sense of purpose, I'm in search of cool.

Salon,salon65,http://www.salon.com/2014/08/17/the_terror_behind_our_grief_what_we_talk_about_when_we_talk_about_robin_williams/,The terror behind our grief: What we talk about when we talk about Robin Williams,Peter Finocchiaro,08/17/2014,04/07/2016,"If you want to see how the world really works, watch a tragedy unfold on Facebook.

What critics say about the social network is oftentimes accurate: It can be nasty and brutish, chaotic and dim, full of terrible information and the rankest expressions of ignorance. This is especially true in the case of tragedies as their full dimensions are just starting to come into focus: Ferguson. Gaza. Sanford. Isla Vista. People share without thinking, then stake untenable positions with the appearance of adamantine resolve, showing little or no compunction about inflaming their friends, family members, co-workers, neighbors, acquaintances and even the completest of strangers. The combustible mixture of social media, ego, politics and pride can turn even minor disputes into epic conflagrations. Basically it’s civilization, but in miniature.

There is, however, a flip side to this equation — another way in which tragedy finds new-media expression — and it’s actually just as revealing.

The news last week of Robin Williams’ death occasioned a massive outpouring of public grief. Within moments of hearing the terrible news, millions flocked to social media to post their own personal remembrances of the beloved actor. In place of the normal vicissitudes of Facebook and Twitter, a rare consensus was established of the type we rarely ever see — except when someone famous dies uncontroversially.

It would have been easy to take this all at face value and leave the psychology of these displays unexplored; thankfully, that wasn’t the case. For every action on the Internet, there is bound to be a reaction (especially in the media world, where the well-time rebuttal is its own form of cultural capital). And the reaction to the glut of Robin Williams tributes, just like similar reactions after tragedies past, says an awful lot about where our heads are at, collectively — both by being right, and also by being incredibly wrong.

As tends to happen these days when a famous person passes away, once the rush of memorials reached a certain critical mass last week, a minority consensus began to emerge — that many, if not most, of those individuals professing heartbreak were not doing so in full earnestness. There was, this argument goes, an element of vulgar performance.

Some critics contended that the displays of mourning were actually lazy and inadequate — “homogenized grief,” as {this widely shared Clickhole article}<hyperlink=""http://www.clickhole.com/article/7-robin-williams-gifs-imperfectly-sum-his-life-and-742""> put it. Others, like Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson, suggested darker ulterior motives:

[tweetbegin 499401194528575488 tweetend]

Politico’s Dylan Byers, meanwhile, explained his own frustrations {thusly}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/on-social-media-and-collective-mourning-193800.html"">:

At times, it can seem like people are trying to out-sad one another. Allow me to let you know how devastated I am about this person I never met. Allow me to tell you what my favorite films were. Allow me to share my favorite quote. — You have to imagine that the people who are truly grieving over said individual’s death do not, in those first minutes, think to take to their Twitter accounts. The stream of personal remembrances reminds you of social media’s true raison d’être, and throws it into sharp relief: Every post, every tweet, every click is ultimately about you.

On the one hand, there are plenty of obvious reasons why Williams’ death hits hard. He was a special performer. More than that, the circumstances of his death understandably {strike a chord}<hyperlink=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/08/12/calling_all_sad_clowns.html""> for people who have experienced in one way or another the struggles of clinical depression. But I will admit that on some level, there’s an appeal to Byers’ contentions nonetheless: There is something of the rote and derivative in much of the mourning we’ve seen.

Honest question: How much could “Dead Poet’s Society” really have {changed your life,}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/search?q=dead%20poet%27s%20society%20changed%20my%20life&src=typd""> Internet? As much as plain-old empathy could explain the outpouring of grief over Williams last week, it doesn’t totally explain why people have been trying to stake ownership of his work in the process.

So for what it’s worth, I think Byers is partly right: It is about us, and it always has been, every time we take to social media to grieve a beloved figure. But his hypothesis is also incomplete. Left unmentioned is the biggest question of all:

Why, exactly, are we making it about us?

An earlier attempt at answering this question was made in a {2011 Washington Post article}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/lifestyle/style/social-mourning-tweets-are-less-about-dead-celebrities-than-they-are-about-us/2012/05/24/gJQABtFFoU_story.html""> by Monica Hesse. At the time of its writing, several prominent figures — Donna Summer, Maurice Sendak, Beastie Boy Adam Yauch, among others — had all just died in quick succession, resulting in an unusually intense period of Internet shiva-sitting.

Hesse interviewed experimental psychologist Spee Kosloff, who identified the resulting memorials as the manifestation of a phenomenon called “{Basking in Reflected Glory}<hyperlink=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basking_in_reflected_glory"">,” or BIRG:

 “Celebrities are symbols,” Kos­loff says. Symbols of fame, wealth, uniqueness, good hair. “By our association with them, we can BIRG and gain a feeling of cosmic specialness.” When they die, the specialness disappears, so we cling however we can — reminding everyone that we identified with them, understood their writing, listened to the B-side more than all the other Twidiots out there. “It’s inflating your own personal tie to the thing that makes you exceptional.”

There is a certain amount of logic here. And it explains all the trying to take credit for appreciating Williams’ work. But Byers’ and Hesse’s arguments smack a little too strongly of condescension, and their mutual insinuation — that the memorials are just acts of emotional opportunism — is a claim that rings especially false.

Dr. Charles Figley is an associate dean at Tulane University, and an expert in disaster mental health affiliated with the American Psychological Association. When I asked Figley about the charges of selfishness, he acknowledged the influence of our egos in the grieving process, but was unconvinced that the calculation was as cynical as Hesse and Byers suggest.

What we’re really trying to do by staking ownership in the departed isn’t just bolster our esteem. We’re trying to solve a problem. In one sense, it’s the same problem we’re trying to solve when we’re coaxed into those aforementioned conflagrations with people who disagree with us on matters of ideology or politics or art, contradicting the things we feel to our cores.

That problem — which may seem obvious, but always seems to go unexamined in periods of mourning — is our overwhelming and underexplored anxiety. “That’s the whole thing about grief,” Figley explained. “It’s really a masking of our own fear of reality.”

The simple answer: “It’s about our fear of death.”

In his Washington Post interview, Spee Kosloff identified the symbolic power of celebrities, and the dissonance that arises when they die, as a central factor in such grief. But once we arrive at the conclusion that it’s our fear of death that motivates the creation of those symbols, it’s hard not to talk about one guy in particular: cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker.

In 1973, Becker published his most famous work, “The Denial of Death.” The book was heralded upon its release as a landmark text, and won Becker the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction. While it still commands respect even today — comedian {Marc Maron}<hyperlink=""http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_484_-_josh_radnor""> is a notable proponent — the book actually made its most explicit cultural footprint a few years after its original publication, when a nebbishy Woody Allen lookalike, foisting “The Denial of Death” on his reluctant new girlfriend, Annie, {expounded his Becker-informed and death-obsessed philosophy}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udoh1DZ7JKw"">:

“Life,” he said, “is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.”

That philosophy is actually a major focus of “The Denial of Death,” which contains as its primary insight this searing idea: that the refusal to accept our mortality — a fundamental but nearly invisible pathology, baked right into the human condition — is the literal cause of all evil in the world.

While you can pick bones with Becker’s unapologetically bleak worldview (or also with my massively simplified version of such), it’s hard to deny him the basics. A cursory look at the world around us gives the very strong impression of a civilization in the thrall of death-panic. And anyone who’s ever attempted to intuit the (essentially unintuitable) depths of mortality can probably find merit in this key Becker passage:

This is the terror: to have emerged from nothing, to have a name, consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, an excruciating inner yearning for life and self-­expression—and with all this yet to die.

Our first line of defense against the specter of mortality is to straight-up pretend it doesn’t exist. And when that doesn’t work — because how could it? — we go to more elaborate lengths to ease our trembling psyches. In particular, Becker contends, we fashion “hero systems” for ourselves, and fill them with heroic avatars — famous people for one, but also ideas, like religion or nationalism — which you might recognize as those “symbols” that Kosloff was talking about earlier.

Because of the exceptional qualities we’ve invested in these heroes and ideologies, they seem to defy the very idea of death. But this impulse to invest heroic, nearly deific properties in our leaders and social structures is a double-edged sword, Becker argues. While they might salve our creeping sense of existential dread, they can also lead to all sorts of calamitous problems: inequality, prejudice, violence — even war. (See: nationalism.)

The degree to which this is true is beside the point for our purposes. Look around and you’ll see plenty of anecdotal data to support the idea that our worldviews are informed by a yearning to outstrip our material circumstances. Viewed in that context, it’s not hard to see that what inspires our attraction to celebrities — like the singular comedic talent of someone like Robin Williams, or the credulity-straining acrobatics of professional athletes — actually comes from the same place as our attraction to something like ideology. Both promise, Becker argues, a sense of reality that transcends the limits of death.

What we saw then last week in the mourning of Williams isn’t a phenomenon unique to social media at all. It actually spans all of history. While you might be able to explain away the pyramids as a dynastic vanity project, it’s harder to account for those portions of the historical record that document widespread grief at the passing of a king or a president. These emotions have been a linchpin of state power from the time of Caesar — if much expedited in the Westphalian era by the introduction of mass communication.

This grief is as old as civilization, buried in the dense coils of our recursive minds.

No, Robin Williams wasn’t a king. But he did command respect, and adoration, and even love from his fans. More important, he’s always been there, if not center-stage then milling around the periphery of our cultural consciousness for the better part of four decades. At his heights he was one of our most celebrated cultural heroes. For millennials, as my colleague Dan D’Addario {pointed out last week}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/08/12/for_the_kids_of_the_90s_robin_williams_was_the_ultimate_movie_star/"">, he occupied a place in the pop cultural pantheon. His once-automatic presence in our lives makes his absence now incongruous with our sense of the world.

That dissonance is felt any time a person dies. When it’s someone we knew personally, it’s easy to ignore the dread. There is, after all, a perfectly rational explanation for our sorrow, and one that isn’t so difficult to broach. But when we didn’t know the person — when it’s Robin Williams, for example — we’re left grasping for a palatable explanation for the sickness we feel: It’s because we loved his movies. It’s because they touched us deeply. It’s because he meant so much to us. He changed our lives.

Never mind if that’s actually the case.

Public grief has always been a clumsy thing — hackneyed and sentimental maybe, or unartfully expressed, sometimes even giving the impression of selfishness. But ultimately, it’s visceral and sincere , if not often entirely honest.

We’re all terrified of death, but no one wants or knows how to talk about it. That terror bubbles to the surface at moments like these, after a national tragedy, or the death of a celebrity; but it’s almost always sublimated into a form — what some might call “homogenized grief” — that’s more manageable, less queasy-making, easier than the truth to articulate and explain away. We try to rationalize our feelings through the safety of boilerplate lamentations, because the alternative — to accept that we’re scared shitless by the fact of our contingent nature, that we too will someday expire  — is too to hard to internalize, much less accept.

“Try this experiment,” Dr. Figley suggests. “As you talk to someone, shift the subject to death and watch the loss of eye contact. Like any subject that is rarely discussed in depth, it is highly variable depending on the level of trust when discussed.” So, for once, let’s be honest and trust each other.

I’ll begin:

Something I don’t like to admit about myself, except in the company of very close and trusted relations, is that over the past few years I have become increasingly obsessed with the prospect of death, and regularly consumed by the terror of it.

As the influence of my parents’ Catholicism has ebbed over time and drifted into the resignation of a mostly unspoken atheism, the gravity of that change has slowly come into focus: Someday I will be dead, and my subjective self lost forever. That same fact holds true for all of us, and eventually for the prospect for any life, anywhere. Over time, the universe will eventually rend itself apart, piece by piece, one final prolonged act of atomic torsion borne out over the course of eons. When all is said and done, we won’t just be gone; any trace of us will as well.

But we’re still here now. We still need to live with one another. And we’re leaving our greatest anxieties unacknowledged, only revealing them under duress, or in the anodyne remembrances of people we never knew, but whose absence we nonetheless feel silently shattered by.

Honesty about our death-obsessed station in life means more than just understanding on an intellectual level why it might be. It means giving words to it, letting it breathe, relinquishing the control we think we have over the idea when it’s sequestered in the back of our brains.

“It is the disguise of panic that makes us live in ugliness,” Ernest Becker wrote in his book, “and not the natural animal wallowing.”

One night last fall, he discovered via Facebook that a friend of a friend was planning with some co-conspirators to break in to his home. They were intent on stealing Wescott’s handgun and a couple of TV sets. According to the Facebook message, the suspect was planning on “burning” Westcott, who promptly called the Tampa Bay police and reported the plot.

According to the {Tampa Bay Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/informer-not-neighbor-complaints-led-up-to-fatal-tampa-pot-raid/2187316"">, the investigating officers responding to Westcott’s call had a simple message for him: “If anyone breaks into this house, grab your gun and shoot to kill.”

Around 7:30 pm on May 27th, the intruders arrived. Westcott followed the officers’ advice, grabbed his gun to defend his home, and died pointing it at the intruders.  They used a semiautomatic shotgun and handgun to shoot down the 29-year-old motorcycle mechanic.  He was hit three times, once in the arm and twice in his side, and pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital.

The intruders, however, weren’t small-time crooks looking to make a small score. Rather they were members of the Tampa Bay Police Department’s SWAT team, which was executing a search warrant on suspicion that Westcott and his partner were marijuana dealers. They had been tipped off by a confidential informant, whom they drove to Westcott’s home four times between February and May to purchase small amounts of marijuana, at $20-$60 a pop. The informer notified police that he saw two handguns in the home, which was why the Tampa Bay police deployed a SWAT team to execute the search warrant.

In the end, the same police department that told Westcott to protect his home with defensive force killed him when he did. After searching his small rental, the cops indeed found weed, two dollars’ worth, and one legal handgun — the one he was clutching when the bullets ripped into him.

Welcome to a new era of American policing, where cops increasingly see themselves as soldiers occupying enemy territory, often with the help of Uncle Sam’s armory, and where even nonviolent crimes are met with overwhelming force and brutality.

The War on Your Doorstep

The cancer of militarized policing has long been metastasizing in the body politic.  It has been growing ever stronger since the first Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams were born in the 1960s in response to that decade’s turbulent mix of riots, disturbances, and senseless violence like Charles Whitman’s infamous clock-tower {rampage}<hyperlink=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman""> in Austin, Texas.

While SWAT isn’t the only indicator that the militarization of American policing is increasing, it is the most recognizable. The proliferation of SWAT teams across the country and their paramilitary tactics have spread a violent form of policing designed for the extraordinary but in these years made ordinary. When the concept of SWAT arose out of the {Philadelphia}<hyperlink=""http://blog.phillypolice.com/2012/05/phillypolice-unit-profile-special-weapons-and-tactics-swat/""> and {Los Angeles Police Departments}<hyperlink=""http://books.google.com/books?id=vTkTTIF1IpUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rise+of+the+Warrior+Cop&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_KbGU6OKC-rnsAT60ID4CQ&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=D-Platoon&f=false"">, it was quickly picked up by big city police officials nationwide.  Initially, however, it was an elite force reserved for uniquely dangerous incidents, such as active shooters, hostage situations, or large-scale disturbances.

Nearly a half-century later, that’s no longer true.

In 1984, according to Radley Balko’s {Rise of the Warrior Cop}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1610394577/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"">, about 26% of towns with populations between 25,000 and 50,000 had SWAT teams. By 2005, that number had soared to 80% and it’s still rising, though SWAT statistics are notoriously hard to come by.

As the number of SWAT teams has grown nationwide, so have the raids. Every year now, there are approximately {50,000 SWAT raids}<hyperlink=""http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21599349-americas-police-have-become-too-militarised-cops-or-soldiers""> in the United States, according to Professor Pete Kraska of Eastern Kentucky University’s School of Justice Studies. In other words, roughly 137 times a day a SWAT team assaults a home and plunges its inhabitants and the surrounding community into terror.

Upping the Racial Profiling Ante

In a recently released report, “{War Comes Home}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing"">,” the American Civil Liberties Union (my employer) discovered that nearly 80% of all SWAT raids it reviewed between 2011 and 2012 were deployed to execute a search warrant.

Pause here a moment and consider that these violent home invasions are routinely used against people who are only suspected of a crime. Up-armored paramilitary teams now regularly bash down doors in search of evidence of a possible crime. In other words, police departments increasingly choose a tactic that often results in injury and property damage as its first option, not the one of last resort. In more than 60% of the raids the ACLU investigated, SWAT members rammed down doors in search of possible drugs, not to save a hostage, respond to a barricade situation, or neutralize an active shooter.

On the other side of that broken-down door, more often than not, are blacks and Latinos. When the ACLU could identify the race of the person or people whose home was being broken into, 68% of the SWAT raids against minorities were for the purpose of executing a warrant in search of drugs. When it came to whites, that figure dropped to 38%, despite the well-known fact that blacks, whites, and Latinos all use drugs at {roughly the same rates}<hyperlink=""http://www.samhsa.gov/data/nsduh/2012summnatfinddettables/nationalfindings/nsduhresults2012.htm#ch2.7"">. SWAT teams, it seems, have a disturbing record of disproportionately applying their specialized skill set within communities of color.

Think of this as racial profiling on steroids in which the humiliation of stop and frisk is raised to a terrifying new level.

Everyday Militarization

Don’t think, however, that the military mentality and equipment associated with SWAT operations are confined to those elite units. Increasingly, they’re permeating all forms of policing.

As Karl Bickel, a senior policy analyst with the Justice Department’s Community Policing Services office, {observes}<hyperlink=""http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/06-2013/preparing_officers_for_a_community_oriented_department.asp"">, police across America are being trained in a way that emphasizes force and aggression. He {notes}<hyperlink=""http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/06-2013/preparing_officers_for_a_community_oriented_department.asp""> that recruit training favors a stress-based regimen that’s modeled on military boot camp rather than on the more relaxed academic setting a minority of police departments still employ. The result, he suggests, is young officers who believe policing is about kicking ass rather than working with the community to make neighborhoods safer. Or as comedian Bill Maher {reminded}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVywCqvmC0E""> officers recently: “The words on your car, ‘protect and serve,’ refer to us, not you.”

This authoritarian streak runs counter to the core philosophy that supposedly dominates twenty-first-century American thinking:{community policing}<hyperlink=""http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/12-2013/will_the_growing_militarization_of_our_police_doom_community_policing.asp"">.  Its emphasis is on a mission of “keeping the peace” by creating and maintaining partnerships of trust with and in the communities served. Under the {community model}<hyperlink=""https://ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/114213.pdf"">, which happens to be the {official policing philosophy}<hyperlink=""http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/may_2008/policing_Ds.htm""> of the U.S. government, officers are protectors but also problem solvers who are supposed to care, first and foremost, about how their communities see them. They don’t command respect, the theory goes: they earn it. Fear isn’t supposed to be their currency. Trust is.

Nevertheless, police recruiting videos, as in those from California’s {Newport Beach Police Department}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_rKA6ROAVk""> and New Mexico’s {Hobbs Police Department}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im66lCgZrbc"">, actively play up not the community angle but militarization as a way of attracting young men with the promise of Army-style adventure and high-tech toys. Policing, according to recruiting videos like these, isn’t about calmly solving problems; it’s about you and your boys breaking down doors in the middle of the night.

SWAT’s influence reaches well beyond that.  Take the {increasing adoption}<hyperlink=""http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/11-2012/bdus-community-policing.asp""> of battle-dress uniforms (BDUs) for patrol officers. These militaristic, often black, jumpsuits, Bickel fears, make them less approachable and possibly also more aggressive in their interactions with the citizens they’re supposed to protect.

A small project at Johns Hopkins University seemed to bear this out. People were shown pictures of police officers in their traditional uniforms and in BDUs. Respondents, the survey indicated, would much rather have a police officer show up in traditional dress blues. Summarizing its findings, Bickel {writes}<hyperlink=""http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/11-2012/bdus-community-policing.asp"">, “The more militaristic look of the BDUs, much like what is seen in news stories of our military in war zones, gives rise to the notion of our police being an occupying force in some inner city neighborhoods, instead of trusted community protectors.”

Where Do They Get Those Wonderful Toys?

“I wonder if I can get in trouble for doing this,” the young man says to his buddy in the passenger seat as they film the Saginaw County Sheriff Office’s new toy: a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle. As they film the MRAP from behind, their {amateur video}<hyperlink=""http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=8d5_1394417559""> has a {Red Dawn}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_I4WgBfETc"">-esque feel, as if an occupying military were now patrolling this Michigan county’s streets. “This is getting ready for f**king crazy times, dude,” one young man comments. “Why,” his friend replies, “has our city gotten that f**king bad?”

In fact, nothing happening in Saginaw County warranted the deployment of an armored vehicle capable of withstanding bullets and the sort of improvised explosive devices that insurgent forces have regularly planted along roads in America’s recent war zones.  Sheriff William Federspiel, however, fears the worst. “As sheriff of the county, I have to put ourselves in the best position to protect our citizens and protect our property,” he {told}<hyperlink=""http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2014/04/prepared_for_disaster_mine-res.html""> a reporter. “I have to prepare for something disastrous.”

Lucky for Federspiel, his exercise in paranoid disaster preparedness didn’t cost his office a penny. That {$425,000 MRAP}<hyperlink=""http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2014/04/prepared_for_disaster_mine-res.html""> came as a gift, courtesy of Uncle Sam, from one of our far-flung counterinsurgency wars. The nasty little secret of policing’s militarization is that taxpayers are subsidizing it through programs overseen by the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Justice Department.

Take the 1033 program. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) may be an obscure agency within the Department of Defense, but through the 1033 program, which it oversees, it’s one of the core enablers of American policing’s excessive militarization. Beginning in 1990, Congress {authorized}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/1033ProgramFAQs.aspx""> the Pentagon to transfer its surplus property free of charge to federal, state, and local police departments to wage the war on drugs. In 1997, Congress {expanded the purpose}<hyperlink=""http://www.nps.gov/legal/laws/104th/104-201.pdf""> of the program to include counterterrorism in section 1033 of the defense authorization bill. In one single page of a 450-page law, Congress helped sow the seeds of today’s warrior cops.

The amount of military hardware transferred through the program has grown astronomically over the years. In 1990, the Pentagon gave $1 million worth of equipment to U.S. law enforcement. That number had jumped to nearly $450 million in 2013. Overall, the program has shipped off more than $4.3 billion worth of materiel to state and local cops, {according to the DLA}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/default.aspx"">.

In its recent report, the ACLU found a disturbing range of military gear being transferred to civilian police departments nationwide. Police in North Little Rock, Arkansas, for instance, received 34 automatic and semi-automatic rifles, two robots that can be armed, military helmets, and a Mamba tactical vehicle. Police in Gwinnet County, Georgia, received 57 semi-automatic rifles, mostly M-16s and M-14s. The Utah Highway Patrol, according to a Salt Lake City Tribune {investigation}<hyperlink=""http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/57358599-78/police-program-utah-1033.html.csp"">, got an MRAP from the 1033 program, and Utah police received 1,230 rifles and four grenade launchers. After South Carolina’s Columbia Police Department received its very own MRAP worth $658,000, its SWAT Commander Captain E.M. Marsh {noted}<hyperlink=""http://www.wltx.com/news/article/255485/2/Columbia-Police-Debut-New-Armored-Vehicle""> that 500 similar vehicles had been distributed to law enforcement organizations across the country.

Astoundingly, one-third of all war materiel parceled out to state, local, and tribal police agencies is brand new. This raises further disconcerting questions: Is the Pentagon simply wasteful when it purchases military weapons and equipment with taxpayer dollars? Or could this be another downstream, subsidized market for defense contractors? Whatever the answer, the Pentagon is actively distributing weaponry and equipment made for U.S. counterinsurgency campaigns abroad to police who patrol American streets and this is considered sound policy in Washington. The message seems striking enough: what might be necessary for Kabul might also be necessary for DeKalb County.

In other words, the twenty-first-century war on terror has melded thoroughly with the twentieth-century war on drugs, and the result couldn’t be anymore disturbing: police forces that increasingly look and act like occupying armies.

How the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice Are Up-Armoring the Police

When police departments look to muscle up their arms and tactics, the Pentagon isn’t the only game in town. Civilian agencies are in on it, too.

During a {2011 investigation}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/12/20/local-cops-ready-for-war-with-homeland-security-funded-military-weapons.html"">, reporters Andrew Becker and G.W. Schulz discovered that, since 9/11, police departments watching over some of the safest places in America have used $34 billion in grant funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to militarize in the name of counterterrorism.

In Fargo, North Dakota, for example, the city and its surrounding county went on an $8 million spending spree with federal money, according to Becker and Schulz. Although the area averaged less than two murders a year since 2005, every squad car is now armed with an assault rifle. Police also have access to Kevlar helmets that can stop heavy firepower as well as an armored truck worth approximately $250,000. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1,500 beat cops have been trained to use AR-15 assault rifles with homeland security grant funding.

As with the 1033 program, neither DHS nor state and local governments account for how the equipment, including body armor and drones, is used. While the rationale behind stocking up on these military-grade supplies is invariably the possibility of a terrorist attack, school shooting, or some other horrific event, the gear is normally used to conduct paramilitary drug raids, as Balko notes.

Still, the most startling source of police militarization is the Department of Justice, the very agency officially dedicated to spreading the community policing model through its Community Oriented Policing Services office.

In 1988, Congress {authorized}<hyperlink=""http://www.ncpc.org/cms-upload/ncpc/File/Byrne%20JAG%20history.pdf""> the Byrne grant programs in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which gave state and local police federal funds to enlist in the government’s drug war. That grant program, according to Balko, led to the creation of regional and multi-jurisdictional narcotics task forces, which gorged themselves on federal money and, with little federal, state, or local oversight, spent it beefing up their weapons and tactics. In 2011, 585 of these task forces {operated}<hyperlink=""http://www.ncja.org/sites/default/files/documents/Taskforce-Performance-Measures.pdf""> off of Byrne grant funding.

The grants, Balko reports, also incentivized the type of policing that has made the war on drugs such a destructive force in American society. The Justice Department doled out Byrne grants based on how many arrests officers made, how much property they seized, and how many warrants they served. The very things these narcotics task forces did very well. “As a result,” Balko writes, “we have roving squads of drug cops, loaded with SWAT gear, who get money if they conduct more raids, make more arrests, and seize more property, and they are virtually immune to accountability if they get out of line.”

Regardless of whether this militarization has occurred due to federal incentives or executive decision-making in police departments or both, police across the nation are up-armoring with little or no public debate. In fact, when the ACLU requested SWAT records from 255 law enforcement agencies as part of its investigation, 114 denied them. The justifications for such denials varied, but included arguments that the documents contained “trade secrets” or that the cost of complying with the request would be prohibitive. Communities have a right to know how the police do their jobs, but more often than not, police departments think otherwise.

Being the Police Means Never Having to Say You’re Sorry

Report by report, evidence is mounting that America’s militarized police are a threat to public safety. But in a country where the cops increasingly look upon themselves as soldiers doing battle day in, day out, there’s no need for public accountability or even an apology when things go grievously wrong.

If community policing rests on mutual trust between the police and the people, militarized policing operates on the assumption of “officer safety” at all costs and contempt for anyone who sees things differently. The result is an “us versus them” mentality.

Just ask the parents of Bou Bou Phonesavanh. Around 3:00 a.m. on May 28th, the Habersham County Special Response Team conducted a no-knock raid at a relative’s home near Cornelia, Georgia, where the family was staying. The officers were looking for the homeowner’s son, whom they suspected of selling $50 worth of drugs to a confidential informant.  As it happened, he no longer lived there.

Despite evidence that children were present — a minivan in the driveway, children’s toys littering the yard, and a Pack ‘n Play next to the door — a SWAT officer tossed a {“flashbang” grenade}<hyperlink=""http://www.salon.com/2014/06/24/a_swat_team_blew_a_hole_in_my_2_year_old_son/""> into the home. It landed in 19-month-old Bou Bou’s crib and exploded, critically wounding the toddler. When his distraught mother tried to reach him, officers screamed at her to sit down and shut up, telling her that her child was fine and had just lost a tooth. In fact, his nose was hanging off his face, his body had been severely burned, and he had a hole in his chest. Rushed to the hospital, Bou Bou had to be put into a medically induced coma.

The police claimed that it was all a mistake and that there had been no evidence children were present. “There was no malicious act performed,” Habersham County Sheriff Joey Terrell {told}<hyperlink=""http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/toddler-critically-injured-by-flash-bang-during-po/nf9XM/""> the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “It was a terrible accident that was never supposed to happen.” The Phonesavanhs have yet to receive an apology from the sheriff’s office. “Nothing. Nothing for our son. No card. No balloon. Not a phone call. Not anything,” Bou Bou’s mother, Alecia Phonesavanh, {told}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiijlS6th50""> CNN.

Similarly, Tampa Bay Police Chief Jane Castor continues to insist that Jay Westcott’s death in the militarized raid on his house was his own fault.  “Mr. Westcott lost his life because he aimed a loaded firearm at police officers. You can take the entire marijuana issue out of the picture,” Castor {said}<hyperlink=""http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/informer-not-neighbor-complaints-led-up-to-fatal-tampa-pot-raid/2187316"">. “If there’s an indication that there is armed trafficking going on — someone selling narcotics while they are armed or have the ability to use a firearm — then the tactical response team will do the initial entry.”

In her defense of the SWAT raid, Castor simply dismissed any responsibility for Westcott’s death. “They did everything they could to serve this warrant in a safe manner,” she {wrote}<hyperlink=""http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/tampa-police-chief-times-article-left-out-key-facts/2189054""> the Tampa Bay Times — “everything,” that is, but find an alternative to storming the home of a man they knew feared for his life.

Almost half of all American households report having a gun, as the ACLU {notes}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf""> in its report. That means the police always have a ready-made excuse for using SWAT teams to execute warrants when less confrontational and less violent alternatives exist.

In other words, if police believe you’re selling drugs, beware. Suspicion is all they need to turn your world upside down. And if they’re wrong, don’t worry; the intent couldn’t have been better.

Voices in the Wilderness

The militarization of the police shouldn’t be surprising. As Hubert Williams, a former police director of Newark, New Jersey, and Patrick V. Murphy, former commissioner of the New York City Police Department, {put it}<hyperlink=""https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/121019.pdf""> nearly 25 years ago, police are “barometers of the society in which they operate.” In post-9/11 America, that means police forces imbued with the “hooah” mentality of soldiers and acting as if they are fighting an insurgency in their own backyard.

While the pace of police militarization has quickened, there has at least been some pushback from current and former police officials who see the trend for what it is: the destruction of community policing. In Spokane, Washington, Councilman Mike Fagan, a former police detective, is {pushing back}<hyperlink=""http://www.kxly.com/news/Spokane-Councilman-thinks-new-uniforms-may-help-Police-PR-crisis/9224338""> against police officers wearing BDUs, calling the get-up “intimidating” to citizens. In Utah, the legislature {passed}<hyperlink=""http://le.utah.gov/~2014/bills/static/hb0070.html""> a bill requiring probable cause before police could execute a no-knock raid. Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank has been a vocal critic of militarization, {telling}<hyperlink=""http://perspectivesonthenews.blogs.deseretnews.com/2013/07/10/militarization-of-local-police-nationwide-worries-salt-lake-city-chief-chris-burbank/""> the local paper, “We’re not the military. Nor should we look like an invading force coming in.” Just recently, Chief Charlie Beck of the Los Angeles Police Department {agreed}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/opinion/readersreact/la-le-the-police-chiefs-thoughts-on-swat-20140715-story.html""> with the ACLU and the Los Angeles Times editorial board that “the lines between municipal law enforcement and the U.S. military cannot be blurred.”

Retired Seattle police chief Norm Stamper has also become an outspoken critic of militarizing police forces, noting “most of what police are called upon to do, day in and day out, requires patience, diplomacy, and interpersonal skills.” In other words, community policing. Stamper is the chief who green-lighted a militarized response to World Trade Organization protests in his city in 1999 (“{The Battle in Seattle}<hyperlink=""http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175168/tomgram:__rebecca_solnit,_writing_history_in_the_streets/"">”). It’s a decision he would like to take back. “My support for a militaristic solution caused all hell to break loose,” he {wrote}<hyperlink=""http://www.thenation.com/article/164501/paramilitary-policing-seattle-occupy-wall-street""> in theNation. “Rocks, bottles and newspaper racks went flying. Windows were smashed, stores were looted, fires lighted; and more gas filled the streets, with some cops clearly overreacting, escalating and prolonging the conflict.”

These former policemen and law enforcement officials understand that police officers shouldn’t be breaking down any citizen’s door at 3 a.m. armed with AR-15s and flashbang grenades in search of a small amount of drugs, while an MRAP idles in the driveway. The anti-militarists, however, are in the minority right now. And until that changes, violent paramilitary police raids will continue to break down the doors of nearly 1,000 American households a week.

Early photos of Brown showed the deceased young man in a high school cap and gown, but despite the fact that many other images of him with family and friends were available through his Facebook, many media organizations — especially those with a avowed conservative bent — began using instead a picture of Brown flashing a peace sign, which some baselessly claimed was gang-related.

Reminiscent as it was of the way the media began {promoting pictures of Trayvon Martin in a hoodie, wearing a gold grill and using marijuana}<hyperlink=""http://www.thenation.com/blog/167076/conservative-media-smears-trayvon-martin"">, the shift among some media members toward depicting Brown in a manner more in keeping with stereotypes of young African-American men was too much for many people of color on Twitter.

A hashtag, #IfTheyGunnedMeDown, soon went viral, accompanying tweets that featured two pictures of a person of color — one that could be perceived as playing to stereotype, the other not — and posing the rhetorical question of which one, if they were in the news for being shot, the media would likely choose.

(AP) — The National Guard arrived in Ferguson but kept its distance from the streets where protesters clashed again with police, as clouds of tear gas and smoke hung over the St. Louis suburb where Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer.

Protesters filled the streets after nightfall Monday, and officers trying to enforce tighter restrictions at times used bullhorns to order them to disperse. Police deployed noisemakers and armored vehicles to push demonstrators back. Officers fired tear gas and flash grenades.

Demonstrators no longer faced the neighborhood’s midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew, but police told protesters that they could not assemble in a single spot and had to keep moving. After the streets had been mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave as well, citing the risk from gunfire that had been reported.

A photographer for the Getty photo agency was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released. Two German reporters were arrested and detained for three hours. Conservative German daily Die Welt said correspondent Ansgar Graw and reporter Frank Herrmann, who writes for German regional papers, were arrested after allegedly failing to follow police instructions to vacate an empty street. They said they followed police orders.

There were no reports of serious injuries. Two men were arrested for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse, police said.

The latest clashes came after a day in which a pathologist hired by the Brown family said the unarmed 18-year-old suffered a bullet wound to his right arm that may indicate his hands were up or his back was turned. But the pathologist said the team that examined Brown cannot be sure yet exactly how the wounds were inflicted until they have more information.

Witnesses have said Brown’s hands were above his head when he was repeatedly shot by an officer Aug. 9.

The independent autopsy determined that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, the family’s lawyers and hired pathologists said.

The St. Louis County medical examiner’s autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday. But she declined to comment further, saying the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.

A grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown’s death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County’s prosecuting attorney.

A third and final autopsy was performed Monday for the Justice Department by one of the military’s most experienced medical examiners, Attorney General Eric Holder said.

Holder was scheduled to travel to Ferguson later this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown’s death.

The Justice Department has mounted an unusually swift and aggressive response to Brown’s death, from the independent autopsy to dozens of FBI agents combing Ferguson for witnesses to the shooting.

In Washington, President Barack Obama said the vast majority of protesters in Ferguson were peaceful, but warned that a small minority was undermining justice. Obama said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to “listen and not just shout.”

Obama said he also spoke to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon about his deployment of the National Guard in Ferguson and urged the governor to ensure the Guard was used in a limited way.

Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump said Brown’s parents wanted the additional autopsy because they feared results of the county’s examination could be biased. Crump declined to release copies of the report.

“They could not trust what was going to be put in the reports about the tragic execution of their child,” he said during Monday’s news conference with Parcells and Baden, who has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

The second autopsy, Crump said, “verifies that the witness accounts were true: that he was shot multiple times.”

Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells, who assisted former New York City chief medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden during the private autopsy, said a bullet grazed Brown’s right arm. He said the wound indicates Brown may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position across his chest or face.

“We don’t know,” Parcells said. “We still have to look at the other (elements) of this investigation before we start piecing things together.”

Baden said one of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when he suffered that fatal injury. The hired pathologists said Brown, who also was shot four times in the right arm, could have survived the other bullet wounds.

Baden also said there was no gunpowder residue on Brown’s body, indicating he was not shot at close range. However, Baden said he did not have access to Brown’s clothing, and that it was possible the residue could be on the clothing.

Crump also noted that Brown had abrasions on his face from where he fell to the ground, but there was “otherwise no evidence of a struggle.”",0,0,NA,NA

(AP) — Missouri’s governor on Monday ordered the National Guard to a St. Louis suburb convulsed by protests over the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen, after a night in which police used tear gas to clear protesters off the streets well ahead of a curfew.

Gov. Jay Nixon said the National Guard would help “in restoring peace and order” to Ferguson, where protests over the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer entered their second week. Police said they acted in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails.

“These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served and to feel safe in their own homes,” Nixon said in a statement.

The latest confrontations came on the same day that Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on Brown, and as a preliminary private autopsy reported by The New York Times found that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

As night fell in Ferguson Sunday, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated and the streets were empty well before the midnight curfew.

“Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of response,” said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is command in Ferguson. At least two people were wounded in shootings, he said.

The “extraordinary circumstances” surrounding Brown’s death and a request by his family prompted the Justice Department’s decision to conduct a third autopsy, agency spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement. The examination was to take place as soon as possible, Fallon said.

The results of a state-performed autopsy would be taken into account along with the federal examination in the Justice Department investigation, Fallon said.

Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, told The New York Times that one of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when he suffered a fatal injury.

Brown was also shot four times in the right arm, and all the bullets were fired into his front, Baden said.

The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation into the shooting. A day earlier, officials said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson neighborhood where Brown was shot to death Aug. 9.

A federally conducted autopsy “more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises” might help that investigation, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami’s U.S. attorney’s office.

Federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case, Weinstein said.

Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.

Sunday’s clashes in Ferguson erupted three hours before the curfew imposed by Nixon. Officers in riot gear ordered all the protesters to disperse, and many did, but about 100 stood about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley of tear gas.

Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the street in an apparent attempt to block police vehicles, which easily plowed through. Someone set a trash bin on fire, and the crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away.

Within two hours, most people had been cleared off West Florissant Avenue, one of the community’s main thoroughfares. The streets remained quiet as the curfew began. It was to remain in effect until 5 a.m.

Earlier in the day, Johnson said he had met members of Brown’s family and the experience “brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart.”

“When this is over,” he told the crowd, “I’m going to go in my son’s room. My black son, who wears his pants sagging, who wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, but that’s my baby.”

Johnson added: “We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael’s going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.”

The protests have been going on since Brown’s death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Nixon to put the state highway patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before he was killed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a robbery suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

The officer who shot Brown has been identified as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting, and the department has refused to comment on his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.",0,0,NA,NA

(AP) — U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on the body of a black Missouri teenager whose fatal shooting by a white police officer has spurred a week of rancorous and sometimes violent protests in suburban St. Louis.

Department of Justice spokesman Brian Fallon cited a request by family members and the “extraordinary circumstances” surrounding the case of 18-year-old Michael Brown in explaining decision.

“This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,” Fallon said in a statement. “Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.”

The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation of the shooting. Officials said a day earlier that 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson, Missouri, neighborhood where an unarmed Brown was shot to death in the middle of the street on Aug. 9.

David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami’s U.S. Attorney’s office, said a federally conducted autopsy “more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises” might help that investigation, and that the move is “not that unusual.”

He also said federal authorities want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case.

Holder’s latest announcement followed the first night of a state-imposed curfew in Ferguson, which ended with tear gas and seven arrests after police dressed in riot gear used armored vehicles to disperse defiant protesters.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said protesters weren’t the reason for the escalated police reaction early Sunday morning after the midnight curfew took effect, but a report of people who had broken into a barbecue restaurant and taken to the roof, and a man who flashed a handgun in the street as armored vehicles approached the crowd of protesters.

Also overnight, a man was shot and critically wounded in the same area, but not by police; authorities were searching for the shooter. Someone also shot at a police car, officials said.

The protests have been going on since Brown’s death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Missouri’s governor to put the Highway Patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson Police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store before he was killed, though Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Gov. Jay Nixon, who imposed the curfew after declaring a state of emergency as protests turned violent to start the weekend, said Sunday morning on ABC’s “This Week” that he was not aware the police were going to release surveillance video from the store where Brown is alleged to have stolen a $49 box of cigars.

“It’s appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,” Nixon said.

In announcing the curfew, Nixon said many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully but the state would not allow looters to endanger the community. Johnson, the Highway Patrol captain, had said police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas and would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave. Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.

As the curfew deadline arrived early Sunday, most protesters left the streets, but those who remained protesters refused to leave the area as officers spoke through a loudspeaker: “You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately.”

As officers put on gas masks, a chant from the distant crowd emerged: “We have the right to assemble peacefully.”

A moment later, police began firing canisters into the crowd. Highway Patrol Spokesman Lt. John Hotz initially said police only used smoke, but later told The Associated Press they also used tear gas canisters.

Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, has identified the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting and the department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts.

In 2005, working for the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Lee chronicled some of the horrors, the heartache and the systemic institutional failures during Hurricane Katrina. His coverage of Katrina garnered him numerous awards, including the {2006 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting}<hyperlink=""http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2006-Breaking-News-Reporting"">. And his ongoing coverage of the nightmare in Ferguson, Missouri, has stood out as exemplary.

Last week, MSNBC published Lee’s latest bit of brilliant storytelling, titled “{Trauma in the Trenches of Gun-Weary Chicago}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/chicago-trauma-trenches-gun-weary"">,” an in-depth look at the struggles of families living in the middle of whizzing bullets and ubiquitous violence on Chicago’s impoverished South Side. Lee’s eloquent and nuanced account details some of the psychological and emotional tolls that come with living in, for all intents and purposes, a war zone. Amid the numerous questions Lee raises about the trauma of urban violence, perhaps the most poignant is: What happens after the storm of gunfire?

Salon caught up with Lee to talk about his piece and the path forward. This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.

Could you describe how the piece came about? What sparked your interest in that issue in that area?

For the last two years I’ve been going back between New York and Chicago. I’ve reported on the “Great Migration” from the South to the North and the return migration from Chicago back down to the South. I’ve reported on the mass school closings and a lot of the issues going on with the schools in Chicago. But also, on a darker note, I’ve been covering some of the impacts of gun violence. So about a year and a half ago I wrote about the physical toll that goes beyond the tally of those murders.

So I talked to a bunch of people who were paralyzed. We forget about those people who are paralyzed or who are maimed, who lose an arm, lose a limb. That’s a really big idea because people are not thinking about what’s left after the bullets fall, right? After the dead bodies. We’re talking about people who have to live with these wounds. So in that same vain after July 4th weekend when you had at least 82 people shot and 16 people get killed, which is completely insane, I thought to myself, could you imagine how many people witness these shootings? How many people had to see the people get killed? Again, with that same idea that beyond just those who are killed, the community is left to pick up the pieces and move on with their lives. So that was kind of the impetus. Let’s talk about the other wounds that are opened up time and time again. So that was kind of the heart of the initial idea behind the story.

You have some really interesting characters. How did you find the family?

First of all, it’s always a privilege to me — I don’t take it for granted at all — that people open up and talk to you because they are opening up their truest selves to you, especially when they’re at their darkest time. Fortunately, I do a pretty good job of sourcing. So for all my stories I keep a file. I have all names and numbers separated by neighborhoods and age and all that good stuff. So there is a guy who is in the story, Eric Wilkins, who was paralyzed in a shooting in the late ’90s and he lives in Roseland (Chicago, Illinois).

Every once in a while I would call him and check on him, see what’s going on in the neighborhood, and so I was down there talking to him, rolling through the neighborhood. He’s in his wheelchair; I’m on a bike. Seriously, we were riding through the hood, he’s showing me around. We had to borrow one of his friend’s bikes. [After] the first friend let us borrow the bike, there was a leak in the back tire. So we were riding around five minutes in and it’s flat. We have to walk all the way back to his homeboy’s crib. Then we went to a barbershop not too far from where he [Wilkins] was actually shot. The barber is his old friend and he was like, “I got a bike.”

So he walks around to his house, got the bike and then we just rolled around the neighborhood. He [Wilkins] said, “I want to introduce you to this sister. She really has a story to tell and few people have really heard it.” And so we went over to her house, sat on the steps and she kind of told this story about how the cloud of violence and death had consumed her family. This is a woman named Keauna Wise. She’s in the lede of the story. She worries. And the worry is real that one of her kids will get killed. They are already out there in the life shooting, getting shot at. But the whole family had to witness their 8-year-old niece being killed right in front of them — shot in the head. Not far from where she lives is the grandmother’s house — the matriarch’s house — and there are five generations in that house at different points. People are moving in and moving out. It was a hot summer night and everyone was out there and two dudes rolled up on bikes and just open-fired on the whole group.

You know, little girl was up there jumping rope, one with the little cheerleader routines and they witnessed this. And so her story really just reinforces just how tragic and how terrible experiencing life in some of these communities can really be that we forget. Because no one wants to go into these communities to offer help, to really see what’s going on. It’s almost like it’s been normalized to the point of that’s where it’s supposed to happen. So, because we view it as that’s where it’s supposed to happen we’re not in a rush to remedy it at all, especially those emotional and psychological wounds.

Yeah. For Keauna Wise’s daughter, toward the end of the piece, it seemed almost as if the violence had become such a normal thing, a bit of numbness had settled in to a degree. She said she didn’t worry at all. But at the same time she felt gravely concerned with the fate of her brothers …

It’s a defense mechanism. On one hand, we’ve seen some of this wild behavior. It’s normalized. It happens so often where, and I said this the other day, if you had to stop every time something tragic happened, you’d spend most of your time in a very dark place because it happens so often how else do you get up and move on. So, yes, this young lady, Minnie, who was Keauna’s daughter, who has all these brothers, she’s out there with them when they are getting shot at. She resigns herself to the fact that this is the kind of life that they live and this is the kind of environment they live in and if one of her family members — her brothers — go she wants to be there with them because once they’re gone there’s no coming back from that. And it’s so poignant. And so heavy. And so sad.

On the other hand, she’s kind of embracing life in a way that is fearless, but sometimes that fearlessness we know masks some deep pain. And that’s kind of at the heart of the story: because it’s normalized behavior and because it happens so often, we’re masking a lot of hurt that’s [for] one, not being treated. But it’s also not diagnosed or even identified. So that’s kind of like masking all of it. You have whole neighborhoods who are under this collective cloud of trauma that are not being treated at all.

You mentioned trauma. This is essentially, as you called it for all intents and purposes, a war zone — these are soldiers out here — but nothing is happening …

First of all, it’s a very complicated, very dynamic issue, right? So the first response, as [Attorney General] Eric Holder told me a couple weeks ago, has to be a law enforcement response. How do you actually just handle the flow of illegal activity — the flow of weapons? People are shooting at each other with illegal weapons! How do you just stop the bleeding initially. But then the second wave is politically, policy-wise. Are we crafting policy that addresses the deep disparities of who is impacted? Again, are law enforcement agencies empowered enough to address the flow of weapons from the South? Only 60 percent of the weapons that end up at crimes in Chicago are from the state. Forty percent are coming from elsewhere. They’re coming in from the South. They’re coming in from Mississippi. They’re coming in from neighboring communities. But then that third wave is where I think we’re seeing all the residue from this, the psychological wounds we’re talking about. In talking to counselors who are dealing with folks in the hardest hit communities, they say not much is being done. That we’re just now starting to talk about how to best handle people suffering in the way that they’re suffering. The City [of Chicago] says that they’re offering counseling though the schools. People aren’t seeing that.

What do you mean people aren’t seeing it?

I’ve talked to dozens of people who have all been impacted and [they] personally say, “No one has ever come up and offered us counseling.” I’ve talked to mothers and families of people who have been killed by gun violence and they say there’s always the talk from nonprofit groups and the city groups saying, “We’re here for you. There’s some emergency counseling.” But after the cameras go then everything else goes with them. So then all there is after that is talk. People feel like they’re in a helpless situation. Not only are they dealing with the burden of all the pain — the emotional pain, the physical pain — it’s the feeling that no one cares. They don’t see any flow of resources. They don’t see centers in the community that are built just to address the needs of the people emotionally.

And it’s happening so much. Last year, in Chicago more than 2,000 people were shot, hundreds killed. That’s a lot of bloodshed. That’s a lot of witnesses. That’s a lot of victims. So for people to feel that their stories aren’t being validated in any way, that the politicians and the policymakers aren’t putting all their resources behind it. I talked to a number of people who find it a slap in the face when they’re talking about billions down to the border to deal with the crisis of undocumented children. Which needs to be handled, clearly. I don’t think anyone would disagree that there’s a weight on all the institutions and systems down on the border. But there is also a crisis happening in Chicago and in Philadelphia and in Oakland [California] and in Camden [New Jersey] and in Gary, Indiana, and in Miami and in every inner city across this country there’s a crisis, not the least of which is the bloodshed; but then it’s also, as we talked about a minute ago, it’s the cloud. What happens after that?

Yeah. There was that big New York Times {story}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/education/in-chicago-campaign-to-provide-safe-passage-on-way-to-school.html""> about Rahm Emanuel and him closing down schools while spending millions of dollars on helicopter police escorts to get kids whose schools had been shut down to their new schools sometimes miles away…

And millions and millions of dollars more … This {came out}<hyperlink=""http://www.ibtimes.com/chicago-mayor-rahm-emanuel-cuts-schools-pensions-while-preserving-fund-corporate-subsidies-1648754""> two days ago [in the International Business Times] about millions and millions of dollars that he’s diverted from what they call these TIF funds — these discretionary funds — they’ve been diverting toward some corporate tax credit fund while they’re closing schools down. And young people in Chicago, we have to remember, as I mentioned in the piece, years ago a lot of people were almost buffered from the violence because certain gangs controlled wide swaths of the neighborhood, right?

So all the violence was occurring between the gang members. But there was no way a rival was penetrating that deep into the neighborhood to be shooting your grandmother on her front steps. Now, prosecutors, with the mandatory minimums, have done a great job of kind of breaking these gangs down, but what’s left are cliques that control two blocks here, three blocks here. In Roseland, for example, you’ll go two blocks over and it’s one crew. Three blocks over another way, it’s another crew. And they’re all led by these teenagers and very young men who just aren’t as “principled,” we’ll say — and I’m kind of editorializing here — aren’t as “principled” in the ways the gangs were in the past. That’s not to give any credit to the former gang members. There were a lot of more violent criminals who inflicted a lot of pain and bloodshed on the community. But the fact of the matter is you have a whole bunch of young guys now leading crews reaping terrible results.

There is a lot of pain and a lot of hurt you tell in the story, stuff you don’t normally hear about in the media often …

Because people don’t want to hear it. (laughs)

Yeah, it’s kind of like {Nas’ “Illmatic”}<hyperlink=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illmatic""> where he {talks about}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhPigi-5ZPA""> trying to bring people what the streets taste like, what it smells like, what it feels like. How, as a storyteller, do you try to make that happen and is that something you think is severely lacking in the general coverage about this?

I think it’s hard because what we’re really talking about when we’re talking about rich storytelling and getting real voices and letting people smell and taste what life is like, we’re talking about narrative journalism. Unfortunately, the way the media landscape has kind of shifted, newspapers are getting smaller. They’re not throwing around money, you know? These stories take some time because you have to develop sources. You have to go down into the communities and tell these stories. But I think that’s exactly what it takes. Not just from a resource standpoint, you have to go to the community and talk to people. Talk to the people who are impacted.

And for a number of reasons I don’t think many journalists feel comfortable going into these communities and opening themselves up enough to be open-minded about it because it’s so easy to fall into the garden-variety killing mind state. I’ve worked in a bunch of newsrooms in Philadelphia and New Orleans and New York and what happens is, when you’re sitting there listening to the police scanner, you’re not always surprised when somebody gets shot in a certain neighborhood. But we don’t take that next step to try to figure out, “Who was this person?”

Because, as I always say, people have to live with drug dealers and killers. People have to live ducking the bullets. It’s not like everyone’s out there on the firing line like the Civil War lined up and blasting. No. It’s not like that. So for me, the most important part, the critical part, of this kind of storytelling is really going down and coming with my hat in my hand to the doorstep, to the block, to the families and opening myself up and saying, “Can I tell your story?” Then, of course, we know you have to bolster it and hinge it on systemic issues. You have to hinge it on something broader. You know, the micro-macro. Come in small, narrow, and widen out. No pun intended, but a colleague of mine once told me that sometimes you want to use the rifle, sometimes you want to use the shotgun. The rifle is very narrow. A shotgun is wide. A buckshot is wide.

So sometimes you have to narrow in. And that, to me is the most powerful because when you’re on that step with Keauna Wise and she’s listening to her daughter talk about how she don’t care, she’s going to be out there with her brothers whether they’re shooting or not because once they go, there ain’t no coming back from that. That is powerful. Watching her [Keauna] turn her head and the teardrops coming down from her eyes, man? You only get that by going and sitting on that step. You only get that by coming respectful. I’m not coming to disrespect anybody. I’m coming to tell your story and I think that some journalists do it better than not. For me, that’s the most powerful way to tell a story — to bring you to that step, to bring you to that corner, to bring you into that moment.

This is kind of why you got your Pulitzer, for this on-the-ground, firsthand reporting on the people of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Do you see any parallels between the trauma people are going through in Chicago, now, and what the poor black people of New Orleans went through, then?

Well, I think the similarities between Chicago and any of these other inner cities who are dealing with the fallout from all the violence is that the people of New Orleans, especially in the poorer communities that were hit hardest by the storm, had already been weathering all this other stuff we’ve been talking about. So before this big storm — before the hurricane — there were a bunch of little tornadoes. Right? We’re talking about the Lower Ninth Ward. We’re talking about that kind of violence in the South. That’s kind of a different brand. Culturally, it’s a part of the gun culture.

But the violence we see down there is something completely different. Something special. But when we’re talking about trauma I think human beings can only react. There’s a box. Sometimes the box is this big. Sometimes the box is that big. But you only have a box of reaction. This is only flesh and blood. I think that’s the thing we forget: This is all soft. Our emotions, our psychological state, our physicality, it’s all soft, man. So for some reason it’s normal for people to have to witness multiple people getting shot. Imagine seeing somebody getting their brains blown out in front of you or someone you love getting shot. Or imagine if you weren’t there to witness the killing, but they’re here one day and the next time you see them they’re in a box being lowered into the ground. Let’s really think about that. Most of our lives aren’t set up in that way.

Seriously. You know, it sounds like this story has a very personal element to it …

Yeah. Before I was born my grandfather was murdered in 1976. Do you want me to tell you the story?

For sure …

My grandparents lived outside of Camden, New Jersey, but they owned an apartment building in Camden and they were going to rent it out. And so some guy came by to put a deposit down and disappeared for months. He came back months later looking for his deposit and my family told him, “Sorry, you forfeited your deposit.” So my grandfather worked at a lumber warehouse and he worked the late shift. He came home for dinner late, around 11:30 at night. There was a knock on the door. As soon as he stood up the guy fired multiple shots through the door and struck and killed him. That was before I was born but it was always a cloud over my family. We didn’t even talk about it much.

I just now had a conversation with my mother maybe two months ago about what happened and her feelings. When we were kids we couldn’t have toy guns. She hated the sound of balloons popping because of the impact. He was the patriarch of the family — handsome, and everybody loved him. He played this big role, though, in the community. Years and years later, in 1995, my stepbrother was murdered. A girl was braiding his hair and put a bullet in the back of his head in Camden. Dragged his body down, they put him in the back of trunk. She had her brother and one of his friends take his Timbs (Timberland boots) off, take his jewelry and everything to make it look like it was robbery. It was a wild circumstance. My stepbrother was involved in some things. We weren’t very close but we were cool, though. So going to the funeral and seeing him in that casket reminded me of my blood brother who was about the same age.

Just the idea that this could happen to my brother, we’re making decisions and choices about what we’re doing in life and that sometimes involves violence. So the violence has played a role in my life and my family’s pathway to the present. It does inform how I approach people because I can feel it. I know what it’s like to lose a family member. Imagine if you multiply my experience times 500. Then you have people who have not only lost a lot of people that are close to them, but they’ve seen other people get shot. They’ve witnessed strangers getting shot. Your neighbor. The guy you went to school with. The girl who was the cheerleader. A week after marching in President Obama’s second inaugural parade you get shot by some gang members? Even if you’re doing the right things you’re not safe. Even when you’re doing everything you’re supposed to do. And parents are trying to put you in a position to do everything they think you should be doing and you still get taken. So, again, it’s personal. But it’s also the collective “we.” It’s not just me, but it’s you and it’s your brother and it’s people I don’t even know.

And you wonder about these kind of areas, it’s tough because a lot of people look at these areas and don’t see much life there …

Let me stop you for a moment. Sometimes in these conversations, it’s almost unfair and I wonder sometimes if the way we frame our conversations if we’re doing more harm than good. Because on the one hand we could say there is no life there. If you go through Roseland and you see boarded-up homes and you see corner stores and you don’t see any fresh food and it’s hard to find an apple and we say, “There’s no life here.” But then there is culture there, right?  And there is resilience and buoyancy there and there is love and in between some very terrible things there are a number of very high points. So how do you balance that to get so people are so monolithic in the experience so we won’t paint that kind of very narrow picture of what life is like, because it is broad. Like in New Orleans, for example, one of the most violent cities in the country. Louisiana has the highest gun death rate in the country, or at least the top three. But then it’s punctuated by life being lived. You know what I’m saying? These communities are struggling but you look around and the institutions clearly are dead. Then you talk about there are no jobs, or a supermarket — a supermarket!

Yeah. And they have to live through this. They actually have to make a life in this kind of place. Getting back to the PTSD. How do you grapple with something like that? In other cities they have mental health services and shrinks. Were there any services that you saw when you were in Chicago?

There was a woman named Nosheen Hydari and she works at a community council center in Chicago. They are one of the groups that came across that is actually trying to get out there and penetrate communities that haven’t been penetrated with these kinds of resources. And there are a number of nonprofit groups, some that are just heroic in what they do without any resources, without any money. You’ve got guys who’ve got records as long as your arm who have turned their lives around and they’re just out in the streets every day trying to get these young brothers to put the guns down and tell them it’s not worth it. So you have a lot of groups out there who are offering an ear and a shoulder. In talking to young people they feel that they don’t have anyone to talk to and, as we know, as a defense mechanism you’ve got to wear your mask. It looks soft. It’s a shame that soft is you’re hurt that you had to watch somebody get killed or one of your homeboys was murdered.

That’s kind of sad that we’ve created this where you can’t even be open about that but they can’t. And so while there seems to be a lack of resources there are some people trying. But then there is also, going back to the stigma, socially, which across the board people experience this, but — in some of these communities do you feel comfortable opening up about your true feelings? And does that open the crack to being soft? And you have all these very hard realities. So I think it’s a mixture of there need to be resources put behind these efforts to get people treated. Get someone to talk to. Identify when it’s a real diagnosis there to be able to really identify what’s going on. Is it PTSD? Is it a symptom of PTSD? Is it depression? Is it isolation? Anxiety? How can you treat that? Then there are also some cultural things where it’s like, I don’t know how it happens but, people need to feel like they’re in a safe enough social space to talk about how they’re really feeling. And that’s anywhere. But when I sat in circles of different groups of young people, and fortunately they had that platform because different nonprofit organizations set up these situations where they can talk as different people, it’s amazing the insight that these kids have. They are so self-aware that they are aware of the media and how they are portrayed. They are aware that there aren’t any jobs there. They’re aware of the impact. They’re aware that they bury their feelings. But they just don’t know what else to do. You’re 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 years old, 20 years old, 22. They don’t know what else to do.

What’s sad is that the outside doesn’t really see any of that. Does the outside need to come in more or does the inside need to be exposed to the outside world?

That’s a great question. But either way the outside is being impacted by a lot of behaviors that are manifestations of all these pent-up emotions that we’re dealing with. One young guy said — not in this story, but in this audio project that we did also that we put on Instagram — he said, “You see a young boy get killed. That make you want to go out there and kill somebody.” You know what I’m saying? To say that? And the same young man said that after school he has to duck through alleyways and gang waves because he wants to avoid the block and they have to go through two blocks here — that’s one zone — and you can’t cross into the other zone because they’re going to shoot at you or chasing you, trying to literally kill you.

So if we don’t address that inside, if we don’t give them a platform to speak, do you know what’s going to happen? We’re going to give them another kind of platform. Because there are guns everywhere. Do we want to wait until that point? These kids aren’t monsters. I mean, there are monsters. I think it’s safe to say there are a couple monsters. But for the most part, these shooters, especially, they aren’t monsters; they’re misled. A lot of them have been neglected in one way or the other from the very beginning. A lot of them are literally hungry. Food insecurity is real. Some of them are generations deep and some of these communities have been deprived of everything, every piece of sustenance — emotional sustenance, physical sustenance. Right? So if we don’t get smart and really pay attention to what’s happening it will continue.

I think the fear is that everyone already kind of understands this but it kind of doesn’t matter because it’s only happening in certain communities. That’s poor, black and brown communities who aren’t a big tax base because they’re poor. They don’t vote …Well, Americans don’t vote much at all if we looked at voting rates. But in some of these communities voter turnout isn’t huge and when they do it’s to a particular party so there is no urgency. So we’re going to be left with the status quo and that’s exactly where we are now.

Yeah. That’s kind of along the lines of what you said on “{The Last Word With Lawrence O’Donnell}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word-with-lawrence-odonnell/watch/chicagos-violence--so-heavy-on-your-head-315480131560?cid=sm_m_lastword_4_20140807_29258286"">.” Something like: “Once the cameras are off, once the politicians stop talking, what happens to these people then?” Do you you think that’s the worst-case scenario, if people just stop zooming in on this kind of issue? And is that a role you consider yourself trying to fulfill?

Here’s the thing. To address the latter point, I don’t consider myself an activist at all so I’m not trying to galvanize necessarily. But I am trying to highlight how we are living and dying and how America and its institutions fail particular groups of people, especially in this country. So [that’s] what I would hope would come from the reporting and the journalism that I’m doing, but also there are a bunch of great journalists across the country in newspapers and magazines and online and everywhere that are doing a great job of trying to unearth these stories. The problem is we live in a very segregated country, not just racially, not just economically, but across the board. So we don’t know how the other side and the other sides live.

So if you say, “Wow! This is what’s happening in certain schools? This is what’s happening in certain neighborhoods?” And we can actually craft policy that makes common sense? Gun reform? Common sense education policy? So I would hope that in chiming into this broader conversation that I would hope everyone joins in. Not just about gun violence, but about education. Food insecurity is real. Environmental issues. Again, I tend to concentrate on these kind of vulnerable neighborhoods and communities because they are the most vulnerable. They are the least of us in the sense of the quality of life. All those issues overlap. Food deserts. School deserts. In Chicago, they tore down trauma centers. So right now if I get shot in one neighborhood, I’m not going to make it across town. Look at the brown fields and the soil is contaminated. The same communities. And we’ve never cared about these communities. Ever.

Yeah. There’s so many more stories like this. Were there other stories that you felt were equally bad that you found when you were in the field? What was your lasting impression?

On a human level I walk away feeling sad. A little bit, right? “Hopeless” isn’t the right word. But I see the hopes of so many people having been diminished. On the same token, I see young people who are pushing through it and I can only imagine — could you imagine — if some of these young people witnessed some of these terrors and made it into the white-collar world? What could stop you? This to me is all silly. We’re sitting in 30 Rock (NBC Studios). This is all beautiful. The cafeteria is beautiful. “Saturday Night Live” is downstairs. It’s beautiful. This world is soft. Even when it’s complicated this world is easy. This world is, you get up every morning and I’m thankful I have a job. My daughter is going to eat. I’m going to make it home God willing.

Because this is New York City (laughs). Right? This story was a hard story to tell in that we’re dealing with emotion and psychological wounds and it’s so widespread so you don’t have to get shot to feel that. Everyone I spoke to. I mean, a number of people broke down crying. And I’m an emotional person. I didn’t cry like in Katrina. I remember the first story as a part of the Pulitzer package I cried with her. She was crying. I’m crying. Tears were falling through my notepad. But that’s how I am. I’m telling their stories. So I’m here with you as a person. Sometimes you have to be sober enough to ask the right questions and get to the point. And this one was difficult for that. But then again I’ve been reporting for the better part of a decade on these kinds of issues. I started off as a police reporter and in those early days as a police reporter at the Trentonian in Trenton, New Jersey, or in Philadelphia at a number of papers or in New Orleans I’m sitting right under the police scanner. So as soon as you hear the crackle and you see the code of X number of people shot. You run to the scene.

I’ve been to scenes before the cops get there because with the ambulance you hear the first initial calls. And there’s someone lying there bleeding with their head wide open and their families screaming there and you see all that immediate, immediate pain. A lot of people I talked to it’s fresh, but it’s lingering. The sting is still there, a wound that never quite heals. But when you’re at the point of inflict — when that wound just happens — that’s something to see. And it’s tragic. I’ve dealt with that a lot. Now I can digest it in a different way and hopefully I’m able to pull it together in a way that hopefully people can understand and also feel. But the hardest part is that this is real life. But people think that it’s happening in some far off land. When you’re in Chicago, I’m downtown having lunch when I first get there and there’s a Lamborghini pulled up on the corner. Beautiful. Red. The prettiest thing you ever saw.

Then you go to the South Side. You go to Roseland — what they call the “wild hundreds.” You go to Englewood and you’re like, “My goodness. It was a 10-minute ride!” Completely different worlds. And guess what? Those worlds don’t overlap. Because if you’re on the South Side of Chicago you’re not downtown. If you’re downtown you’re not going there. And people tell you don’t go. People are afraid of it. There’s a barrier, a barbed wire, Great Wall surrounding it. Resources aren’t coming in. Money is being sucked out because there are businesses in some of these communities. But guess what, some of the money is being sucked out. So separate. It’s heartbreaking that people don’t understand how the other sides are living. That’s how we crafted our policy and that’s why it doesn’t matter when you see 50 schools being closed, even though a lot of them are underutilized. That’s more complicated. We see the situations in schools where even the proficiency rates [are] 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 percent proficient in speaking the English language. Look at the dropout rates. C’mon. Shameful.

And we’re all sitting back and watching because it’s supposed to happen there. Because it’s normalized in those communities. It’s normalized in the media. It’s normalized in all of us who don’t live that way because you think it’s normal, this happens. I’ve been, as a reporter, sitting back and hearing, “Oh two people got shot like, ehh…” At the New York Times I spent some times on the late night rewrite desk and there had to be like three people [shot] for us to write something! Again, that’s a major newspaper so you can’t write about every single one. But that’s prevalent in many newsrooms: “Ehhh, it’s only two? Ehhh, one? It gets a blurb.” We don’t know anything about this kid. Was he a drug dealer? Was he the star football player? Was he taking his last AP course before graduation? In Chicago, there’s so many of those stories of innocent bystanders. One kid, I guess three weeks ago now, I want to say he started his orientation the next day for college and there were other kids who get shot at a graduation party.

There was another young lady the weekend I was there, she was having a sleepover with some girls and they were making s’mores inside the house, a bullet comes through and strikes her in the head and she’s killed. Could you imagine? C’mon, man, it’s not just gangbangers. That’s the part we’re wrestling with. These lives don’t matter? It’s one thing when you play some role — and most murders, we should be clear, most people who are killed had some association with the killer and played some role — but what happens when you’re talking about little girls jumping rope? Or little girls making s’mores or grandmothers on the porch? It’s shameful and it’s terrible and it’s just ridiculous.

It’s hard. You almost tear up thinking about it.

I feel like I’m getting a little … (eyes welling up). I feel it. But again, that’s what motivates me, though. Because I do feel it.

But it gets worse than that piece. After Thought Catalog broadcast the aforementioned bit of bigotry, it promoted an overtly racist article likening the riots in Ferguson {to a rap video}<hyperlink=""http://imgur.com/9KN6LNo"">.

For a while, Thought Catalog’s mantra of “all thinking is relevant” seemed revolutionary to me; its articles were intimate and diary-esque in a way that I found irresistible. But this creed has become a justification for publishing any and all content, regardless of quality. And that’s why I refuse to have my writing on the site anymore.

In July, Thought Catalog co-publisher Alex Magnin {told the New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/fashion/Websites-Thought-Catalog-Upworthy-Aim-to-Uplift.html?_r=0""> his website was predicated on “certain identities or badges that people want to share with their friends to self-represent.” He also said Thought Catalog was “absolutely, a page-view driven site” though he added they didn’t necessarily want to be.

I started reading Thought Catalog in 2012. I hadn’t heard of it until a BuzzFeed content regurgitator I followed on Twitter at the time tweeted “Thought Catalog is the WORST” or something along those lines. I looked up the site and enjoyed it. I thought the BuzzFeed person was just upset Thought Catalog could make lists go viral without spending time ripping pictures from Reddit.

Thought Catalog had some amazing writers on staff when I first discovered it: Gabby Dunn,  Steph Georgopulos, Chelsea Fagan (who still works there but not as a writer) and others. I liked Thought Catalog so much I started writing for it.

In 2013, I wrote the following:

The reason why Thought Catalog gets hate and the reason why it’s successful are one in the same: It is not encumbered by orotundity and ideological baggage. It’s not a liberal website. It’s not a conservative website. It’s not a traditional journalism site. It’s not a list-heavy clickbait site. It does not cater specifically to plebeians or specifically to elites. It does not fit into a mold.

Those things aren’t true anymore. Thought Catalog still presents itself as an avant garde marketplace for ideas. However, in reality, I’ve come to think of it as an amalgam of the irredeemable parts of BuzzFeed, Upworthy, Reddit and the rest of the viral Web.

I know the rise of Facebook sharing has forced many websites to resort to crappy viral content in order to make money. But the gleeful posting of blatant hate-speech is something else entirely.

And so this morning I asked the site to take down all my 100+ articles. At the time of writing, they have yet to answer and my articles are still there.

Please note I’m not trying to slander all the writers there. This is a disappointing outcome for me. Thought Catalog was the first website to publish my non-sports writing. At the risk of sounding lame, I felt like a real writer the first time I got published on Thought Catalog. And the site still has some incredible writers now, both on staff and contributing as freelancers. I follow quite a few on Twitter. But even more unforgivable than making good writers write bad things (why would you make good writers copypasta from Reddit?) is intentionally letting bad writers write bad things.

I don’t want to bring page views to the site that lets bigots post demeaning, awful things. Most important, don’t share things you hate. My hope is that if we ignore Thought Catalog’s current incarnation, it’ll change rather than go away. It’ll go back to being the site Tao Lin wrote for. It’ll go back to being the site I read on lonely Friday nights. It’ll go back to being the site I loved.

Thanks for publishing me, Thought Catalog. It meant so much to me back then. And thanks to the writers and editors at Thought Catalog who continue to try to right the ship.",14,122,"When I started writing for the site, I loved its confessional intimacy. But now I don't recognize what it's become",NA
Salon,salon73,http://www.salon.com/2014/08/18/7_things_cops_can_be_fired_for/,7 things cops can be fired for,Joanna Rothkopf,08/18/2014,04/13/2016,"Darren Wilson, the officer responsible for fatally shooting unarmed teenager Michael Brown, has been permitted to {leave town}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/report-ferguson-officer-darren-wilson-skipped-town""> on {paid administrative leave}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-releasing-name-of-officer-who-shot-michael-brown/"">. Residents of Ferguson and concerned citizens across the country have been imploring authorities to arrest Wilson, or at the very least revoke his pay. Here are seven lesser offenses that have gotten officers fired in other parts of the country:

1. Shooting a dog

An officer in a Chicago suburb was recently {fired}<hyperlink=""http://abc7chicago.com/225283/""> for shooting and killing a 14-month old German shepherd-pit bull mix after the dog bared his teeth at the officer. “He just said it had to be done. He walked up to me, told me that and walked away,” said the dog’s owner, Nicole Echlin. After a brief investigation, the 15-year veteran lost his job. “This has been really an emotional roller coaster for the community, naturally for the victim’s family, my heart goes out to them, and it’s been an emotional roller coaster for my police department,” said Chief Charles Forsyth of the Hometown Police Department.

2. Refusing to give tickets

Former Auburn, Alabama officer Justin Hanners was {taken aback}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/reasontv/2013/07/24/how-quotas-pervert-police-priorities-fir""> when a new police chief mandated a ticketing quota which required officers to make 100 “contacts” each month, including tickets, arrests, field interviews and warnings — or, 72,000 contacts a year in a 50,000 person town. When Hanners refused to keep quiet about his disapproval of the new system, he was let go. “I got into law enforcement to serve and protect,” Hanners said in an {interview}<hyperlink=""http://reason.com/reasontv/2013/07/24/how-quotas-pervert-police-priorities-fir""> with Reason, “not be a bully.”

3. Cutting off someone’s hair

22-year-old Charda Gregory was {arrested}<hyperlink=""http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/odd-news/police-officer-hacks-off-woman%E2%80%99s-hair--gets-fired--with-video--211931635.html""> after being found barely conscious in a trashed motel room in Warren, Michigan. After being taken to the local jail, she was strapped into a chair while Officer Bernadette Najor began to hack at Gregory’s hair with a pair of scissors. While officers will occasionally remove hair extensions because the clips can be used as weapons, Gregory’s extensions were sewn in, and couldn’t be easily removed. Warren Police Commissioner Jere Green fired Najor as soon as he learned of the incident: “I don’t buy that’s the proper way to treat a human being,” said Green in an interview. “I don’t think it’s decent; I don’t think there was any reason to do it… There is a policy about removing wigs, but that doesn’t cover scalping a person.”

4. Driving poorly

Tallahassee officer Chris Ormerod was fired in July of this year after getting in {seven preventable car crashes}<hyperlink=""http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/West-Enters-Plea-Agreement-240899991.html""> in less than six years. The officer had previously served a 40 hour suspension, had undergone mandatory counseling, taken a remedial driving course and an eye exam. Ormerod was also accused of brutalizing a woman during a drunk driving arrest, although that, surprisingly, was not the main impetus of his firing.

5. Shooting at a squirrel (but missing)

Former Mountain City, Tennessee officer Jody Putnam lost his job after using {excessive force}<hyperlink=""http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2013/10/22/Police-Officer-Fired-After-Shooting-and-Pepper-Spraying-Squirrel""> when trying to rid a Dollar General Store of a squirrel. When shooting at the tiny creature yielded no results, he attempted to pepper spray it. A city law states that officers are required to alert their supervisors and provide a written statement after discharging their weapon. Putnam refused to file the report and was subsequently fired. The squirrel is no longer living.

6. Agreeing to sell a machine gun, but not actually selling it

Woodrow Mann, a former officer from Doraville, Georgia was fired after {allegedly}<hyperlink=""http://www.cbs46.com/story/24779437/doraville-pd-officer-fired-after-agreeing-to-sell-machine-gun""> trying to sell a machine gun. The department received a tip that Mann had received money for the weapon, but ultimately determined that no laws were broken because the gun was not actually delivered.

7. Shooting a suspect who had both hands in the air

Dallas Senior Corporal Amy Wilburn was fired after {shooting}<hyperlink=""http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2013/12/dallas-police-officer-violated-the-departments-deadly-force-policy-internal-investigation-finds.html/""> a 19-year-old carjacking suspect, even though he had both hands in the air and did not appear to have a weapon. According to a statement from the Dallas Police Department, she violated protocol when approaching a vehicle containing suspects, and fired her weapon “upon an unarmed person without fear or justification.” The victim of the shooting survived.",6,193,None of these is as bad as murder... mostly because nothing is as bad as murder,NA

Or is his killer on trial?”: Trayvon Martin’s father discusses death of Michael Brown,Sarah Grey,08/17/2014,04/13/2016,"On Sunday, {MSNBC’s Alex Witt}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/weekends-with-alex-witt/watch/tracy-martin-to-brown-family--hold-on-318940739827""> spoke to Tracy Martin, the father of Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman in 2012. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder in the summer of 2013.

In a heartbreaking conversation Martin pointed the similarities between his son’s death and the killing of Michael Brown — especially attempts to smear the character of these deceased teens.

Martin explained that sometimes he would wonder: “Is my son on trial? Or is his killer on trial?”

He also had a wise and important response to Witt’s questions of how to end the “alienation that many young black men feel” and the antagonization they face at the hands of the police.

“First, you have to understand that we as an African American community — we have to break the stigma,” Martin told Witt. “We have to come together as human beings and say that African American lives matter just as much as any other ethnicity group life matters.”

“In America we have a real issue with discussing race,” Martin continued. “No one wants to discuss those issues. We understand that racism is alive and well, and we just have to be able to sit down at the dinner table at the end of the day and discuss these issues.”
