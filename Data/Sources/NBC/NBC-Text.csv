St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said Michael Brown, of Ferguson, Missouri, was struck ""more than just a couple"" times by gunshots fired by a Ferguson Police Department officer after a ""physical confrontation"" that began in a police vehicle and then spilled on to the street. The officer is now on paid administrative leave, Belmar said. The Ferguson Police Department reached out to Belmar immediately following the incident requesting that the St. Louis County Police Department launch an independent investigation, he said.

The shooting has sparked an outcry in the predominantly-black town of about 21,000 — a suburb of the city of St. Louis — and the local chapter of the NAACP has launched their own investigation into the case, appealing to the FBI for help. ""We are hurt to hear that yet another teenaged boy has been slaughtered by law enforcement,"" St. Louis County NAACP President Esther Haywood said in a statement.

Hundreds of Brown's supporters swarmed the Ferguson Police Department for a second day on Sunday, expressing their disgust over the incident — which on Saturday included calls to ""{kill the police.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fatal-police-shooting-michael-brown-sparks-protests-missouri-n177081"">""

A St. Louis County chapter of the NAACP called for the FBI to look into the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb north of downtown St. Louis.

Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, said she saw him running in her neighborhood Saturday afternoon when she passed him in her car. Just minutes later, after she returned home, she heard a commotion and went outside to check on it - and found Brown's body. A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting at the request of the local department, confirmed a Ferguson police officer shot the man but didn't give the reason for the shooting. St. Louis County police said a large crowd confronted officers following the shooting, yelling such things as ""kill the police.""",NA,NA,NA,The Associated Press was “author”

“He wouldn’t have wanted none of that. We’re going to do it the right way. But we need justice for our son,” Michael Brown’s father, Michael Brown Sr., told reporters. Michael Brown, 18, was shot by police at noon Saturday in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb of St. Louis.

The Department of Justice and the FBI have launched an investigation into Brown’s death. Police Chief Jon Belmar said Brown was shot several times after a “physical confrontation” that involved the officer being pushed into his patrol car, followed by a struggle for his weapon. Witnesses told NBC affiliate KSDK that Brown had his hands in the air when he was shot. Attorney Benjamin Crump, representing the family, rejected the police's version of events and said Brown “was executed in broad daylight.”

Monday afternoon members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called for a fair and transparent investigation, and slammed the actions of looters. ""To sneak around under the cover of darkness, to loot, to steal, to burn down your neighborhood, this does not require courage,"" the group's president, Cornell Brooks, told an overflow crowd at a church in St. Louis. ""When you struggle for justice, that requires courage.""

Afterward, a convenience store was looted. Several other stores along a main road near the shooting scene were broken into, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People also took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer, and carted rims away from a tire store. The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

Overnight, St. Louis County Police said, 32 people were arrested in connection with looting at 12 stores — including one which was nearly burned to the ground.

Brown’s killing immediately drew comparisons to the death of Florida teen Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot in 2012 by a local neighborhood watch member and whose case sparked a fiery debate about race relations.

Ahead of a planned statement from the family on Monday, the Brown family hired the same civil-rights attorney, Benjamin Crump, who represented Martin’s family.

KSDK reported that looting broke out following a vigil for Brown on Sunday night.

Police deployed tear gas in one incident, according to KSDK, while one of the its correspondents reported hearing gunfire. TV footage showed crowds kicking police cars and looters breaking into businesses ranging from convenience stores to cellphone shops, liquor stores to sportswear retailers.

St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation. County Executive Charlie Dooley has said he'll request an FBI investigation. The officer who shot Brown has been placed on paid administrative leave.

“The FBI notified me that they will be opening up a investigation that will run parallel to this investigation,” St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference.

Belmar said he had spoke to St. Louis Division Special Agent in Charge William Woods who ""said he had a tremendous amount of confidence in the St. Louis county police department, but at this point he felt the need to open up an investigation.”

The local NCAAP and other community leaders had asked federal officials to get involved in racial charged shooting.

Belmar said the FBI's investigation would run “concurrent” to his — which came at the request of the Ferguson Police Department.

""The Bureau will take a lot of the information that we have developed already, they’ll take that information, they may do their own interviews, they may look at the evidence themselves — it’s a parallel or a concurrent investigation,"" said Belmar.

Special Agent Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI's St. Louis office, said they have been keeping an eye on the case since since the beginning.

""We've been reviewing the matter (since Saturday), today we officially opened an investigation into a potential civil rights violation,"" she said, noting that the decision was not motivated by community outrage. ""Regardless of the media attention or the public’s attention to this matter, this is something that we would routinely do.""

The off-limits airspace, which extends to 3,000 feet over the town north of St. Louis, was requested by the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the killing of Michael Brown, 18, by a Ferguson Police Department officer.

""On Sunday night our police helicopter came under fire on 3 or 4 occasions, so we requested that the FAA put up a no-fly zone for the safety of pilots who would be in the area,"" St. Louis County Police Department Officer Brian Schellman told NBC News. The ban on flights is scheduled to last until Monday, Aug. 18.

No aircraft have been hit, but police chopper pilots did see shots fired from various locations during looting and riots that took place on Sunday night from about 10 p.m. to midnight, Schellman said. ""We don’t know if it was a long gun or a handgun or what,"" he said.

He said police had clearance to fly if they had to, and medical evacuation helicopters could also be launched if necessary. He denied that the move was to keep news helicopters from covering the scene.

""We understand that that’s the perception that’s out there, but it truly is for the safety of pilots. It’s scary stuff to them, so that’s the reason the commanders made the call,"" said Schellman. ""I understand that it’s nice for media helicopters to get up there, but we have not restricted any media access on the ground.""

FAA spokesman Tony Molinaro noted that ""commercial airlines flying in and out of St. Louis Lambert Airport are not affected by the temporary flight restriction.""

""The law says within 72 hours they are supposed to release the name of the shooting officer, but now they say for safety concerns, even though they haven’t released evidence of any direct threats against this officer,"" said attorney Benjamin Crump, who is based in Tallahassee and now represents Brown's parents.

Crump previously represented the parents of Trayvon Martin, the black teen who was killed by George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012.

""We want to know why they felt the need to execute Michael and Leslie (McSpadden)’s child,"" said Crump, referring to Brown's parents.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson had originally said he planned to release the officer's name on Tuesday but backtracked after threats were called into the police department and City Hall and posted on social media.

""If we come out and say, 'it was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,"" Jackson said. ""We're taking the threats seriously.""

The officer was placed on administrative leave Saturday after fatally shooting 18-year-old Brown.

Civil rights advocate and MSNBC host Reverend Al Sharpton also stood with Brown's parents on Tuesday, and called for cooler heads in the community after riots and looting broke out late Sunday night and unrest continued to simmer on Monday night.

""To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant that he was,"" said Sharpton, whose National Action Network will be paying for Brown's funeral. ""Don’t be so angry as to distort the image of who his mother and father tell us who he was.""

""Some of us are making the story how mad we were, rather than how promising he was. Don’t be a traitor to Michael Brown in the name of 'you're mad.'""

Michael Brown Sr. also made a plea for peace in the streets saying, ""I just want justice for my son, I really do ... I need everybody to come together so we can do this right, so we can get something done about this. No violence.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

“We’re just asking that the protests be peaceful,” Chief Thomas Jackson told reporters. “We understand the anger, we understand that people want answers, and we understand that we’ve got a problem. But we’re just asking people to be peaceful.”

Jackson, speaking about Saturday's shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, said that the officer involved had suffered injuries to the face and was taken to a hospital. He said that police planned to release audio recordings from the day of the shooting “shortly,” but he did not give a date. He also said that the department planned to meet with Brown’s mother on Thursday. Police asked, but did not require, that protests on Wednesday take place before dark. Jackson said that police would not interfere with protests after dark unless they turned violent or blocked traffic. A prayer march was planned for Wednesday afternoon, organized by a local church.

At a separate news conference, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch pledged a ""full, fair, complete and impartial investigation"" and said all information would be released to the public after it is presented to a grand jury — whether or not charges are filed.

NBC,nbc18,http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/killing-unarmed-teen-what-we-know-about-browns-death-n178696,The Killing of an Unarmed Teen: What We Know About Brown's Death,Elizabeth Chuck,08/13/2014,10/28/2015,"Days after an unarmed teen was shot to death in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, few questions have been answered, raising tensions in the small, predominantly black city and prompting outrage from activists nationwide. Here is what we know about the killing of Michael Brown, 18.

What happened?
Brown was walking down the street with a friend when he was shot to death by a Ferguson police officer on Saturday afternoon, all parties acknowledge, but the facts surrounding his killing are hazy.

The friend, Dorian Johnson, 22, {told msnbc the officer drove up to them}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/i-dont-have-gun-witness-says-michael-brown-yelled-n178486""> and told them to ""get the f--k on the sidewalk"" and then braked in front of Brown. Johnson said the officer threatened, ""I'm gonna shoot you."" He fired multiple shots, Johnson said, as Brown ran for his life, stopping at one point with his hands up in surrender and yelling, ""I don't have a gun, stop shooting!"" But the bullets hit Brown, who collapsed onto the ground. Other witnesses corroborate Johnson's story, saying that Brown had his hands raised as the officer repeatedly fired at him.

Police paint a less peaceful account of the moments leading up to the shooting. They say a fight broke out after the officer asked the two to move to the side, and say the officer's gun went off inside the patrol car. They have not said why the officer approached the men in the first place. Police say there isn't any security camera footage from nearby buildings or police dashcam video of the incident.

Who was the officer involved?
Police have not identified the name or race of the officer in the shooting, despite protesters' calls for his identity to be made public. On Tuesday, a police spokesman cited safety reasons for not disclosing the information, saying threats had been made on social media to the officer. Witnesses have said it was a white policeman; Brown was black. The officer has been placed on administrative leave while the nearby, and bigger, St. Louis County police department investigates the incident. The FBI has opened a parallel investigation.

Who was Michael Brown?
Brown, nicknamed ""Big Mike"" by friends, was two days away from his first day at a technical college. His father, Michael Brown Sr., told the Associated Press his son was ""funny, silly, he would make you laugh."" The teen had just graduated from high school on Aug. 1, using the summer to finish the last credits he needed. Neighbors and friends say he liked throwing around a football with friends, enjoyed rapping as a hobby, and planned to become a heating and air conditioning engineer.

""He was never a person who liked confrontation,"" Markese Mull, a neighbor, told the AP. ""His smile was going to make you smile.""

What has the reaction been?
The case immediately drew parallels to the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black Florida teen shot to death by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. In Ferguson, tensions boiled over: On Sunday night, the city was overrun by {riots and looting}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/shooting-michael-brown-sparks-riots-ferguson-missouri-n177481"">. About three dozen people were arrested, and one convenience store was burned almost to the ground. Protesters chanted ""Kill the police!"" and ""No justice, no peace."" On Monday, a second night of unrest rocked the town, with police firing tear gas and rubber bullets to quell the crowd. The FAA approved a {no-fly zone over Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/michael-brown-death-no-fly-zone-enacted-over-missouri-town-n179011""> on Tuesday and police in riot gear faced off with protesters for {a third night}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/michael-brown-protesters-cops-face-ferguson-missouri-n179346"">. County police said a woman was shot in the head in an apparent drive-by-shooting. A police officer was also involved in the shooting of an allegedly armed man near where civil-rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton spoke, NBC station KSDK reported. It was not immediately clear if either incident was related to the unrest.

But anger over the shooting is not just local: On Monday night, the local NAACP hosted a forum attended by hundreds in a Ferguson church, and national NAACP President Cornell William Brooks asked residents to ""turn your anger into action.""

Sharpton, president of the National Action Network and an msnbc host, traveled to Ferguson on Tuesday to meet with Brown's family and led a rally at the evening protest. Meanwhile, on Twitter, the hashtag ""{#TheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TheyGunnedMeDown&src=tyah"">"" emerged in response to media portrayals of the incident, and a {“national moment of silence”}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/NMOS2014""> is being planned through a Facebook campaign for Thursday.

What's next?
The St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, and the FBI is doing a separate investigation to look into potential civil rights violations. No timeline for the investigation has been declared.

The Ferguson police chief has said it will not release the name of the officer involved in the shooting unless charges are filed or a judge orders the disclosure.

Brown's family has retained Benjamin Crump, the same attorney who represented Trayvon Martin's family, but has not filed a lawsuit at this point.

""I don't want to sugarcoat it,"" Crump said. ""(Brown) was executed in broad daylight.""

In a press conference Tuesday, Crump and Sharpton urged peaceful protests, saying Brown's family had called for calm.

""To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant that he was,"" Sharpton said. ""Don't be so angry that you distort the image of who his mother and father told us he was.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Police said that her skull was not pierced and that she was alert and talking.

It was not immediately clear whether either of those two shootings was related to protests that took place nearby on Tuesday night in an ongoing outcry over the killing of the unarmed teen, Michael Brown, in the suburb of Ferguson, Missouri.

Crowds chanting “No justice, no peace” poured out of a {rally led by the Rev. Al Sharpton}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/nbc-news/al-sharpton-says-no-violence-in-michael-browns-name-317498435858"">, squaring off against police and refusing orders to disperse or face arrest, KSDK reported. Tear gas filled the air for a third night.

KSDK described the protests as tense but mostly peaceful.

Details of what happened to Brown, 18, are hazy, but police have said that he was shot “more than just a couple of times.”

Brown’s family has pleaded for calm and demanded that police release the name of the officer who shot and killed the teen. The police chief had planned to release the name but backtracked on Tuesday, citing threats issued on social media sites.

Even though Brown ""never once attempted to grab for the officer's weapon,"" the cop reached for his gun with his other hand, Johnson said. ""He says, 'I'll shoot.' It wasn't even a second later before the gun just went off."" Brown ran, putting his hands up in surrender, but the officer kept firing, Johnson said. ""It was just horrible to watch,"" Johnson said, breaking down. ""It was definitely like being shot like an animal.""

NBC,nbc24,http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/should-obama-do-more-ferguson-other-racial-issues-n180921,Should Obama Do More on Ferguson and Other Racial Issues?,Perry Bacon Jr.,08/14/2014,11/09/2015,"Criticisms of President Barack Obama’s approach to race relations are unlikely to fade in the wake of his comments about the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by police in Ferguson, Missouri.

Some black activists say Obama’s response to this and similar situations show that he is too reluctant to address directly issues of race.

As he did in the wake of the Trayvon Martin killing and George Zimmerman’s subsequent acquittal, Obama played the role of unifier in his speech at Martha’s Vineyard, condemning the police actions in Ferguson but also urging blacks not to respond with violence. He called for “healing.”

But there is a concern, particularly among African-American activists, that soothing words from the president are not enough. They want to see the president, in his speeches, directly connect the deaths of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York, both black men, to police brutality and persistent racism. Obama has generally avoided both subjects.

And they wonder if the first black president is doing enough to address issues like police shootings and the jobless rate among blacks, which is double that of whites.

“What have you done? What have you done President Obama? We still have ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws everywhere. There are all sorts of things that people wanted policy-wise, after the president expressed something personally (after the Martin incident) that we haven’t seen manifested,” said Jason Johnson, a politics editor at The Source magazine and a political science professor, in an interview on MSNBC Wednesday.

The president spoke on Thursday amid growing pressure from the media and on Twitter, including from African-Americans, to interrupt his vacation on Martha’s Vineyard (which has included him playing golf and attending a birthday party) and broadly address the killing of the 18-year-old Brown and an escalating situation in Ferguson that has led to riots, the use of tear gas and the arrests of journalists. Obama almost always succumbs to such public pressure to speak, as critics said the written statement he issued on Tuesday calling Brown’s death “heartbreaking” was not enough.

The president struck a careful tone, as he did in the wake of Martin’s death. And it is likely Obama will say more as details of Brown’s death emerge.

But the situation in Ferguson has angered African-Americans, and some have been disappointed by Obama’s reaction. They say it fits into a larger pattern: the first black president is often afraid to call out behavior that directly harms blacks.

“This is actually worse than Trayvon Martin, you have standoffs in the streets. He has met it with his dispassionate speaking. That is not useful,” said Anthea Butler, associate professor of religious studies and Africana studies at The University of Pennsylvania. “We have a big racial problem, and he has tiptoed around it.”

Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said that she would like to see the federal government push local police departments to better train officers to avoid these kinds of incidents But having Obama speak more about race is not itself a solution, she argued.

“I think we have to be careful we don’t become addicted to the habit of saying, ‘what will President Obama say,” Ifill said.

The debate about how Obama should react to the Ferguson situation continues a long-running discussion about how the first black president should speak and act on issues of race. Obama has at times spoken in deeply personal terms about issues that affect blacks, as he did in a long speech last year in the wake of Zimmerman’s acquittal. He has pushed for changes to America’s criminal justice system in a direct attempt to reduce the huge number of black men serving long prison sentences for drug crimes.

Obama appointed the first ever black attorney general, Eric Holder and has empowered him broadly to enact policy on a number of issues that involve race. In a statement about the situation, Holder said he was “deeply concerned” about the use of power being used to control protests, saying, “the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.”

At the same time, black critics say Obama, particularly during his first term, was too reluctant to target and address elevated home foreclosure and unemployment rates in the black community and presided over a huge decline in black wealth in the midst of the recession. And in his speeches, his critics say, Obama is too eager to suggest blacks don’t work hard enough to better themselves instead of highlighting racial discrimination that might hold them back.

“My Brother’s Keeper doesn’t deal with the issues men like Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and other unarmed black men who were killed,” said Mark Anthony Neal, a Duke University professor of African & African American Studies. He was referring to a program Obama started earlier year that seeks to address challenges black and Latino boys face.

Obama’s caution on what happened in Ferguson is not surprising. It’s not just a racial issue, but one of policing and local control. Early in this tenure, Obama, at a press conference, had said Massachusetts police “acted stupidly” in arresting Harvard professor and Obama friend Henry Louis Gates, Jr. in front of his home. The police action was probably unwise, but the president was criticized for weighing into a local law enforcement matter.

Aides said he has taken a lesson from that incident, which turned into a days-long controversy, and wants to knows all the facts before taking on such fraught issues in the future. 

“Some of the criticisms, though well-intentioned, you have to very cautious of,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, an Obama ally. “What we don’t need is defendants and defense attorneys saying the president forced a prosecution” through his comments. ",NA,NA,NA,NA

1. Missouri governor to visit Ferguson after chaotic night
For a fourth straight night, the streets of suburban St. Louis were rocked by protests between police and those outraged by the killing of unarmed teen Michael Brown. A Washington Post reporter and another journalist were arrested by police earlier in the day by officers who ordered everyone out of a McDonald’s — an arrest the newspaper’s executive editor called illegal and unjustified. St. Louis Alderman Antonio French was also arrested and charged with unlawful assembly. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon called the situation “deeply troubling,” and planned to visit the area Thursday instead of going to the state fair. A moment of silence for Brown, who was shot by an officer on Saturday, is also planned in various cities at 7 p.m. ET. {Read more in NEWS}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-brown-death-tear-gas-more-arrests-ferguson-missouri-n180166"">.

2. Evacuation mission of trapped refugees in Iraq less likely
Yazidi refugees holed up in Iraq’s Sinjar Mountains appear to be in better condition in part because of humanitarian aid drops, according to U.S. military officials. After initially floating the idea of an evacuation mission of the Yazidis, officials appear to be stepping back following an assessment. But the Pentagon said the U.S. will continue to provide humanitarian assistance and will protect U.S. personnel and facilities in the region. {Read more in NEWS}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/iraq-turmoil/u-s-forces-iraq-see-less-need-mount-sinjar-evacuation-n180016"">.

3. Pathway to peace? Israel, Hamas extend cease-fire
After a month of unrest in the Gaza Strip, the longest truce between Israel and Hamas has been holding. Violence briefly spiked as the extension of a previous, 72-hour truce was announced shortly before midnight on Wednesday. This extension is expected to last until midnight Monday. While Israel and Hamas remain at odds over completely ending the fighting, humanitarian groups are hoping the truce can lead to a more permanent end to the violence. {Read more in NEWS}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/middle-east-unrest/gaza-truce-holds-after-rocky-start-fans-hope-deal-israel-n180301"">.

Money rumors persisted after Williams previously said his divorces were expensive and his 640-acre estate in California’s Napa Valley had been listed for sale for $29.9 million since April. {Read more in POP CULTURE}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/robin-williams-death/robin-williams-didnt-have-financial-trouble-publicist-n180116"">.

Ohio high school sports officials say their hands are tied after Steubenville High School has allowed a convicted student rapist to return to the football field. “We are bound by the bylaws just like the schools are,” an official told NBC News. Ma’Lik Richmond, 18, is back playing despite being convicted last year of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old West Virginia girl at an alcohol-fueled party. Another football teammate, Trent Mays, was also convicted. An attorney for the girl’s family said they are ambivalent about his return to sports, but that they want to move on with their lives. {Read more in NEWS}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/should-steubenville-rapist-be-allowed-football-team-n179976"">.

The situation in Ferguson, Mo., escalated overnight as officers in riot gear reportedly used tear gas on crowds and arrested sixteen people, including two reporters. And the political world is increasingly weighing in on the conflict. In a statement, Gov. Jay Nixon called the situation “deeply troubling” and announced that he will visit the area. “While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern,” Nixon said. The White House said last night that President Obama has been briefed on the escalating situation, which erupted after 18 year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a Ferguson police officer whose name has so far been withheld.

Do we hear from Obama on this today?

The president hasn’t shied away in the past from using the bully pulpit in situations involving law enforcement and race. Remember Henry Louis Gates? And last July, Obama gave a surprise press conference to address the death of Trayvon Martin - a case many observers have compared to Michael Brown's. ""I think it’s important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn’t go away,"" he said then. Race is obviously a major factor in the clashes between police and residents in Ferguson. Just consider this statistic: of the police department’s 53 commissioned officers, 48 are white, {according to the Los Angeles Times}<hyperlink=“http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-shooting-20140811-story.html”>. This police force just doesn’t look like the community it represents here. In a written statement on Tuesday, Obama urged residents of the community to remember Brown ""through reflection and understanding,"" but stopped short of discussing the racial tensions fueling the clashes. If the situation in Ferguson isn’t deescalated today, is the president obligated to use the bully pulpit to address it?

August optics

After speculation about their foreign policy disagreements dominated the political news cycle this week, Obama and Hillary Clinton both did their best to project that they had a grand time paling around last night. At a soiree for Vernon Jordan’s wife, the Obamas “danced nearly every song” and “were happy to have the chance to spend time with Secretary Clinton and former President Clinton,” a spokesman said. The awkward personal dance between Obama and Clinton this week had already come across as strained. But the optics of the White House laying out the “surf and turf and pasta” menu at a tony Martha’s Vineyard party -- at the same moment that news organizations live streamed the violence in Ferguson -- made it seem even sillier.

Hug or no hug, the Clinton story’s not going away

No one is enjoying the clunky “hug summit” performance as much as Republicans, who get to paint Hillary Clinton as trying to have her foreign policy cake and eat it too. Karl Rove said she’s trying to position herself as “the Goldilocks of foreign policy” and accused her of “covering her political posterior.” The problem for Clinton: When she distances herself from Obama, to a degree she distances herself from, well, herself. With the book rollout, she’s been suggesting that her “hard choices” at the State Department are a key qualifier for her 2016 bid, so how much can she really pull away from the person who gave her the job?

Now, as Egyptian officials shuttle between representatives of Israel and Hamas seeking a long-term deal to end the fighting, U.S. officials are bystanders instead of in their historic role as mediators.

The governor moved after police came under intense criticism for their handling of the protests, including firing tear gas into crowds Wednesday night and arresting two reporters.

Nixon said that Ferguson in recent days looked ""a little more like a war zone, and that's unacceptable.""

Johnson told reporters: ""I understand the anger and fear the residents of Ferguson are feeling, and our police officers will respect both of them.""

Police had said healing racial tension in Ferguson was a priority. The Ferguson Police Department is mostly white, while the city is mostly black. Johnson, who is black, grew up in the community.

""It means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence,"" he said.

Nixon said local police would still be involved in patrols, but he said the Highway Patrol would be in charge. He said he hoped the change would ""provide a breathing space"" to address bigger problems.

""These are deep and existing problems, not only in Missouri, but in America, and this has clearly touched a nerve,"" he said.

""All of a sudden, this horse just rode down the middle of the street. The man riding it stopped and got off the horse to spend a moment, where Mike was shot and killed,"" Jessica Lussenhop, managing editor of the Riverfront Times, who was covering it and spoke to Django, the rider.

""Whenever teenagers lose their lives I do a ride,"" he told Lussenhop, explaining that he started the sad ritual after losing a teenager in his family in a car accident. On his rides, he wears a T-shirt with the name of the deceased teen airbrushed on it. ""He said he just pays his respects and goes home,"" Lussenhop said.

Asked about the mood in Ferguson after Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson took over securing the streets, Lussenhop said: ""The sun hasn’t set, that seems to be the Litmus test. But, so far, yeah it does feel different. It feels almost jubilant. Police are not stopping people doing what they want to do and that makes people feel happy, I guess.""

Alex Johnson,08/14/2014,11/16/2015,"Thousands of people gathered in more than 100 U.S. communities Thursday in remembrance of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager whom police shot to death last weekend in Ferguson, Missouri.

The centerpiece of the observations — being held at such historic places as New York's Union Square, Boston Common and St. Louis' Gateway Arch — was a simultaneous national moment of silence at 7:20 p.m. ET.

""I have two grandchildren, and I want them to be able to walk the streets safely without the police shooting them,"" said Debbie Ray, who attended the rally in St. Louis, of which Ferguson is a suburb.

""There doesn't seem any reason in the U.S. for rifles to be aimed at people in the streets,"" Ray told NBC News. ""Will they have firehoses and dogs in the street next?""

""We want to stand in an effort of love and support and organize community support for how we can mobilize our anger and our upset and our disappointment,"" said Renee Chapman, an organizer of the vigil at Marshall Park in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In many cities, local organizers broadened the scope of the rallies to remember other victims of what they called ""police brutality."" People in Kansas City, Missouri, for example, were encouraged to bring posters bearing the names of other people killed by police over the past two decades — a focus that concerned Mayor Sly James, who said: ""To start talking about police brutality in a general raw way is simply to incite more problems. It's not a problem solver.""

National organizers, who rallied communities from coast to coast under the Twitter hashtag {#NMOS14}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nmos14"">, were adamant that the gatherings weren't protests or boycotts after four days of unrest and confrontation in Ferguson.

""We are not protesting. We are not going to be chanting or anything of that nature,"" Chantelle Batiste, an organizer of the vigil at New Orleans' 225-year-old Lafayette Square, {told NBC station WDSU}<hyperlink=""http://www.wdsu.com/news/local-news/new-orleans/local-to-hold-moment-of-silence-for-police-brutality-victims/27486028"">.

Wesley Lowery said he was slammed into a soda machine and arrested after recording officers. Also arrested was Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly.

“That behavior was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news,” Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said in a statement. “After being placed in a holding cell, he was released with no charges and no explanation. He was denied information about the names and badge numbers of those who arrested him. We are relieved that Wesley is going to be OK. We are appalled by the conduct of police officers involved.""

St. Louis Alderman {Antonio French}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench""> was also arrested and charged with unlawful assembly, KSDK reported.

The suburb of 21,000 people has been wracked by protests in the days since Michael Brown, 18, was shot and killed by a Ferguson police officer Saturday afternoon. On Wednesday, police ordered crowds to disperse, threatened arrests and deployed tear gas canisters at 9 p.m. local time (10 p.m. ET), after unsuccessful attempts to keep people from gathering in the street near a burned-out convenience store that had been torched in rioting days before, {KSDK reported.}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/13/ferguson-protests-fourth-night-tear-gas/14037883/"">

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon Wednesday night called the situation in Ferguson ""deeply troubling.""

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said earlier Wednesday his officers had shown “tremendous amount of restraint” responding to protests over Brown’s death, and said that in some cases officers and police vehicles have been pelted by rocks.

Police on Monday and Tuesday responded with tear gas and in some cases fired “bean-bag rounds” to disperse groups. After mostly peaceful protests Tuesday, a 19-year-old man was shot and wounded by police near the demonstrations after allegedly pointing a handgun at an officer. Belmar said that shooting has not been tied to the protests, but he said officers have been shot at several times since the civil unrest began.

Police say Brown was killed after he and another person got into a “physical confrontation” with a Ferguson police officer at around noon Saturday. At one point, police said, the officer was shoved back into his patrol vehicle, followed by a struggle for the weapon and one shot being fired inside the car. The officer then exited the vehicle and shot Brown several times, police said.

But the friend who said he was with Brown that day, Dorian Johnson, told {KDSK}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/13/dorian-johnson-michael-brown-eyewitness/13986845/""> that the officer grabbed Brown around the neck, that there was no struggle for the weapon, and that the officer shot Brown as the 18-year-old ran away with his hands in the air to surrender.

NBC,nbc37,http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/police-are-big-recipients-pentagons-surplus-gear-weapons-n181091,Police Are Big Recipients of Pentagon's Surplus Gear and Weapons,Robert Windrem,08/14/2014,11/18/2015,"The scenes from Ferguson, Missouri, Wednesday night appeared to be right out of Iraq or Afghanistan, with heavily armed men on military vehicles and armored personnel carriers peering through night-vision goggles into a smoke-filled landscape. At least one officer knelt behind a tripod-mounted rifle, apparently at the ready to open fire if ordered to do so.

The resemblance between the near and the far was no accident, as some of the military gear and weaponry in the hands of Ferguson police likely came from the Pentagon, as did much of the materiel being used in those faraway military conflicts.

Local law enforcement agencies around the U.S. are eligible to receive surplus military equipment through the Defense Department's 1033 program, whose motto is ""from warfighter to crimefighter."" They also can purchase similar equipment through grants from the Department of Homeland Security.

The 1033 program has transferred more than $4.3 billion worth of military equipment to law enforcement since its inception in 1997 - including more than $449 million in 2013 alone, according to the Defense Logistics Agency's {Law Enforcement Support Office}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/default.aspx"">, which administers the program.

Foreign militaries also receive surplus gear and weaponry from the Pentagon, but a review of the {Defense Security Assistance Agency's}<hyperlink=""http://www.dsca.mil/sites/default/files/EDA_053014.xlsx""> databases show that only Israel, which requested $328 million in excess defense articles this year, comes close to receiving as much. Morocco, with $90 million of surplus military equipment, is next on the list.

The excess materiel requested by U.S. allies is very often similar to that requested by local police, including equipment like HumVees, armored personnel carriers, rifles and machine guns. (Separately, Afghanistan's national police force, which is fighting the Taliban, received {$241 million in new U.S. weaponry and transportation equipment}<hyperlink=""http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2015/FY2015_ASFF_Justification_Book-Final.pdf"">.)

Even compared to the Foreign Military Financing program, which sends U.S. military aid overseas, including big weapons systems, Pentagon aid to law enforcement would rank fourth overall, according to Bill Hartung of the Center for International Policy. For fiscal 2014, it would trail only Israel ($3.1 billion), Egypt ($1.3 billion) and Iraq ($850 million), and rank ahead of such U.S. allies as Jordan ($300 million), Lebanon ($75 million) and Colombia ($40 million), he noted.

It's not clear how much - if any -- of the military equipment seen in Ferguson on Wednesday during protests over the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by an unidentified police officer came through the 1033 program.

Police have not released the name of the officer who shot and killed the teenager, Michael Brown, on Saturday. The police response to protests on Wednesday included officers in military gear training guns on crowds.

Nixon said in a statement that the worsening situation in Ferguson was “deeply troubling.” He canceled a planned visit to the state fair and planned to meet with local clergy Thursday morning. “While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern,” he said.

“There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,” he said. “There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protesters, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.”

He also said that police should not be “bullying” or arresting journalists who are trying to do their jobs.

“Now is the time for healing,” Obama said from Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, where he is on vacation. “Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.”

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said that Obama had spoken to him and appealed for peace. Obama called for an “open and transparent” investigation into the police killing and said that he had ordered the FBI and Justice Department to investigate.

“Of course, it’s important to remember how this started,” he said. “We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old, and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

A {police report made public Friday}<hyperlink=""http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/Ferguson.pdf""> also revealed that the teen, Michael Brown, was suspected of stealing a box of cigars from a convenience store and assaulting a clerk minutes before the officer shot him to death.

{Read the police report}<hyperlink=""http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/Ferguson.pdf"">

Thomas Jackson, the police chief of Ferguson, Missouri, said later that the officer {did not know Brown was a suspect}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/cop-who-shot-michael-brown-did-not-know-he-was-n181786""> in the robbery when he stopped Brown. Asked why Brown and a friend were stopped, the chief said: “Because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.” Jackson later said that ""at some point"" during the encounter, the officer saw the cigars in Brown's hands and thought he might be a suspect.

The chief described Wilson, 28, as a distinguished policeman and a “gentle, quiet man” who was devastated by what happened. Wilson has been a policeman for six years, including on the Ferguson force. The chief declined to say where Wilson was or what security precautions had been taken for him.

Jackson described what at the convenience store before the shooting as a “strongarm robbery.” The police report said that Brown was there with his friend, Dorian Johnson. Police also released pictures taken from surveillance video that appeared to show a confrontation.

A 911 call about the robbery came in at 11:51 a.m., according to the police chief. A minute later, dispatchers gave a description of the suspect. The officer encountered Brown at 12:01 p.m. Three minutes later, the shooting was over, and a second officer was on the scene, he said.

The chief said earlier in the week that the officer had been taken to a hospital with injuries to his face. He has been on administrative leave since the shooting. Jackson had declined for days to release the name of the officer, citing threats issued on social media.

Sharply different accounts of the shooting have been given previously by police and by Johnson.

Police have said that an officer encountered Brown and another man on the street. They have said that one of the men pushed the officer into his patrol car and that there was a struggle over the officer’s gun. They have said that Brown ran and the officer fired multiple times.

Johnson, however, {told MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> that the officer ordered him and Brown off the sidewalk. He said that the officer tried to thrust his car door open but the door slammed into Brown and bounced closed. He said the officer then grabbed Brown by the neck, pointed the gun at him and said, “I’ll shoot.”

Johnson also said that the officer fired shots after Brown turned with his hands up and said, “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!”

Another witness emerged Thursday and, in an interview with MSNBC, {corroborated major details}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/st-louis-official-reporters-arrested-ferguson-michael-brown""> of Johnson’s account.

Johnson’s lawyer confirmed to MSNBC on Friday that Brown had taken the cigars from the store.

The unrest in Ferguson escalated and peaked on Wednesday night, when police fired tear gas into crowds of protesters and arrested 16 people, including two reporters. Police were criticized for a military-style presence that included officers atop armored trucks aiming rifles at crowds.

Relative calm was restored Thursday night after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon put the state Highway Patrol in command.

Nixon, in a statement on Friday, said he was pleased that the officer’s name had been released.

“For the sake of the family, the citizens of Ferguson, and the entire region, it is vital that the investigations into the shooting death of Michael Brown move forward in a thorough, open and transparent manner to ensure that trust is restored and justice is done,” the statement said.

There was a brief flare-up when a group marched up the street and surrounded those two state police cars, demanding to know the identity of the officer who shot Brown on Saturday. ""What's his name?"" they chanted — but they dispersed peacefully when the police drove away.

""People feel less intimidated, less threatened,"" Vernon Jackson of Ferguson told NBC News. ""It's generated a different result, more positivity, unity.""

But he can relate.

On May 20, Salinas officers shot to death a man who allegedly lunged at them with garden shears, the third fatal police shooting in two months. The next day, protesters in the largely Latino city took to the streets, saying they were victims of a brutal and racist police department. Some threw bottles at the cops, one of whom was knocked out while giving CPR to the victim of a drive-by shooting. The victim died, and the mob overran the crime scene.

“I understand how passions run high after an officer-involved shooting,” McMillin said this week.

But while authorities investigate whether the shootings were justified, McMillin sees the aftermath as an opportunity to improve relations with a community that doesn’t trust the police — something that should have happened a long time ago. It’s part of a larger attempt to change the culture of his department so his officers understand how some tactics can actually undermine public safety.

The reform model encourages police to be more empathetic and less judgmental in their everyday encounters with the public.

This new way of thinking represents a slow but remarkable shift underway in American policing. It reflects a growing recognition that the data-driven strategies that gave rise to aggressive “hot spot” enforcement techniques like stop-and-frisk may have driven violence to historic lows, but at a steep price.

The targets of this flood-the-zone approach have been, for the most part, young minority men in poor, high-crime neighborhoods with a deep history of resentment toward a criminal justice system they view as discriminatory. This has sown deep feelings of distrust, making law abiding people less likely to see police as their protectors and more likely to resist them. Many experts believe that sentiment is what drives the “stop snitching” epidemic that prevents police from catching violent criminals. It also breeds the discontentment that fuels uprisings following police-related deaths.

“These individual incidents are understood in a context of, ‘the criminal justice system is not helping us, it’s hurting us,’” said Vaughn Crandall, a senior strategist at the California Partnership for Safe Communities who has helped departments implement the new strategy.

McMillin saw this decay firsthand, as a gang officer in Salinas, a city of 154,000 in a part of central California where the agriculture-heavy economy depends on the work of Latino migrant farmworkers. Latinos make up 77 percent of the population, and 32 percent of the police force.

Gang violence was the city’s most pressing crime problem, and McMillin was on the front lines of an approach that he described as “throw police officers at it and lock them up.” A growing segment of the Latino community felt under siege.

Studying for his master’s degree in public policy, McMillin researched the problem, and realized that the predominant strategy in Salinas’ high-crime neighborhoods didn’t take into account the myriad social problems that boiled beneath the surface. Then he happened upon Tracey Meares, a Yale Law School professor and a leading voice in an emerging field of crime research that advocates a shift from a deterrence-based model {to one that emphasizes fairness}<hyperlink=""http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4878&context=mulr"">. In theory, the approach would lead to a heightened sense of “police legitimacy” in which people were more likely to accept police actions, and help them. “A light went off,” McMillin recalled. “I said, ‘This is it.’”

Two major cities were on the vanguard of this new approach: Los Angeles and Cincinnati, both of which drastically overhauled their police departments following riots triggered by displays of brutal force against minorities. Chicago, reeling from a police-abuse scandal and a rise in homicides, {adopted a community-policing curriculum}<hyperlink=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-26/news/ct-met-chicago-police-distrust-20130426_1_police-corruption-foot-patrols-rogue-cops""> in 2012 with encouragement from Meares and other academics.

Dennis Rosenbaum, a Chicago criminologist and executive director of the National Police Research Forum, said he thinks of the new approach as {“putting good will in the bank”}<hyperlink=""http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-rosenbaum2/Pages/presenter-rosenbaum2-transcript.aspx""> for use at times of crisis — such as a fatal shooting by police. “It’s about building this long term relationship of, ‘we’re both in this together, and, therefore, we’re going to look at this as an anomaly,’” said Rosenbaum, who is researching the effects of procedural justice reforms across the country. “That’s what legitimacy is.”

Last year, McMillin sent some of his officers to Chicago to learn the new curriculum, which stressed the importance of explaining police actions, listening to complaints and treating people with respect. It also called for eschewing “hot spot” policing in favor of {identifying and targeting “hot people”}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/small-world-murder-homicides-drop-chicago-police-focus-social-networks-f2D11758025""> — the relatively small number of troublemakers who commit a disproportionate amount of crime. Oakland and Stockton, California, police have also received training.

McMillin’s officers returned to Salinas and trained the rest of the 136-officer department. For many, it was a hard sell. McMillin told them it would make them better police officers. “It’s a matter of taking a step back and saying it is really important to explain to people why you’re doing what you’re doing. And you’ll build a network around you of people who will support you and your work.”

Not long after the training, officers responded to a poor part of town to confront a man with a gun. They took the man down by force, while onlookers yelled at them. One of the officers, remembering the chief’s words, went back and knocked on an antagonist’s door. He explained what they’d done. A long conversation followed, and the officer ended up taking the man, a seasonal worker with a drinking problem, under his wing. A few weeks later, after the first officer-involved shooting in March, the man called the officer and told him he’d seen it all, and became a key witness.

McMillin tells that story to show how the new approach can work. But the challenges remain steep. In July, there was a fourth officer-involved shooting, another round of demonstrations, allegations of racial profiling, and {calls}<hyperlink=""http://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/local/2014/07/29/burris-asks-feds-investigate-salinas-police/13337285/""> for federal authorities to investigate the Salinas Police Department. Officers still reportedly {encounter hostile crowds}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksbw.com/news/central-california/salinas/east-salinas-residents-are-scared-of-talking-to-police-community-leader-says/27079544#!bDsh4I""> and uncooperative witnesses.

McMillin says his agency is not singling out Latinos, but has asked the FBI and Department of Justice to review the two most recent shootings. He has {resisted demands}<hyperlink=""http://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/local/2014/07/28/legal-experts-weigh-threats-salinas-police/13298355/""> to release the names of the officers involved, pointing out that the public outrage included threats of violent retaliation against police. “We’re just at the beginning. We still have a lot of work to do,” the chief said. That includes scheduling training with members of the Latino community on the new approach.

He can’t help but wonder how things would have gone if Salinas had started the reform effort years ago. He thinks there would have been “less likelihood” of unrest. “The four tragic shootings we had, regardless of what the outcome is, justified or not, have been a big setback,” McMillin said. “But this is, ultimately, a slow and deliberate process of trust building.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

The family released a statement after {police revealed}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/ferguson-chief-names-darren-wilson-cop-who-shot-michael-brown-n181326""> that Brown, 18, was the primary suspect in the robbery of a convenience store minutes before he was shot to death by a Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson.

The statement reads in full:

Michael Brown's family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piece mil information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.
There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.
The prolonged release of the officer's name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.
It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.
The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael's death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.",NA,NA,NA,NA
NBC,nbc46,http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/anger-flares-again-ferguson-after-revelations-michael-brown-shooting-n181861,Anger Flares Again in Ferguson After Revelations in Michael Brown Shooting,NA,08/15/2014,11/30/2015,"Public anger flared again in the St. Louis suburbs on Friday after police sought to clarify what happened in the moments before an officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager last weekend. But that anger, sparked by claims the killed 18-year-old was a suspect in a robbery, did not spill over into violence as night fell over Ferguson Friday.

After days of refusing to release the name of the officer, the police chief identified him as Darren Wilson, a four-year veteran of the force in Ferguson, Missouri, and said that he was devastated.

The police also revealed that the teenager, Michael Brown, was suspected of stealing a box of cigars from a convenience store and assaulting a clerk minutes before he was shot to death.

But Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said later in the day that Wilson {did not know Brown was a suspect}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/ferguson-chief-names-darren-wilson-cop-who-shot-michael-brown-n181326""> when he stopped Brown and a friend. Asked why they were stopped, the chief said: ""Because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.""

The release of a surveillance tape appearing to show Brown engaging in an altercation with the store clerk infuriated Brown's family, which said that the police were {trying to smear the teenager's name}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/beyond-outraged-michael-browns-family-accuses-ferguson-police-smear-n181696""> and justify a ""brutal assassination"" in broad daylight.

A lawyer for the family, Anthony Gray, accused the police chief of inciting the community. If there is further violence, he said, ""it won't be on anybody on this side.""

""Don't take that bait and begin to riot,"" he said.

The family said in a statement: ""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.""

A day earlier, Ferguson had its first relatively calm night in almost a week. The Highway Patrol had taken command of policing, and officers marched down the streets with protesters. There were demonstrations Friday night but no reports of arrests that had marred protests earlier in the week.

People in Ferguson Friday questioned why police had waited so long to disclose the robbery, and they said there was still no explanation for why the officer shot and killed the teenager.

""It was no reason that he had to die like that,"" said Champayne Sims, who lives in St. Louis and came to Ferguson on Friday to protest. ""Not at all. You can't justify executing an unarmed person.""

She went on: ""These police officers are supposed to protect and serve, and they're not. They're killing people just because they got a gun and a badge.""

Another woman in Ferguson, Lalita Paine, told NBC News that public fury would not subside ""until they prosecute the police officer that actually murdered Mike Brown. And it probably won't go away then.""

Jackson, the police chief, described Wilson as ""a gentle, quiet man"" and a distinguished officer with six years' experience in policing and no prior disciplinary record. He called Wilson ""an excellent officer.""

""It's devastating, absolutely devastating,"" the police chief said. ""He never intended for any of this to happen.""

The chief was {peppered at an afternoon press conference}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/chief-defends-release-robbery-surveillance-video-n181786""> with questions about why police decided to release the tape of the robbery when the officer who shot had no idea that Brown was a suspect.

""What I did was release the videotape to you because I had to,"" he said. ""I've been sitting on it, but too many people put in an FOI request for that, and I had to release it."" He was referring to requests under the Freedom of Information Act.

Sharply different accounts of the shooting have been given previously by police and by Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson.

Police have said that one of the men pushed the officer into his patrol car and that there was a struggle over the officer's gun. They have said that Brown ran and the officer fired multiple times.

Johnson, however, told MSNBC that the officer ordered him and Brown off the sidewalk. He said that the officer grabbed Brown by the neck, pointed the gun at him and said, ""I'll shoot."" He also said that the officer fired shots after Brown turned with his hands up and said, ""I don't have a gun, stop shooting!""

Earlier in the week, as anger grew about Brown's killing, looters smashed windows and stole goods from stores in Ferguson, and a different convenience store was torched. Protesters chanted, ""Hands up! Don't shoot!""

On Wednesday, the police response included officers in military-style gear sitting atop armored vehicles and training guns on protesters. Police threw tear gas into crowds of demonstrators and arrested two reporters.

By Thursday, President Barack Obama weighed in, encouraging calm among both the protesters and the police, and Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the Highway Patrol to take over security.

The man in charge for the Highway Patrol, Capt. Ron Johnson, spoke glowingly on Friday of how things had calmed down because of simple communication between law enforcement and the public.

At his own press conference, members of the public asked Johnson how they could trust the police again. One identified himself as a black father who wondered what he could tell his son after Brown's killing.

Another woman demanded: ""If we cannot trust our police officers, who can we trust? Who can we trust?""

Johnson, who is black and grew up in the area, pledged to keep listening and try to improve policing. He cautioned against further violence.

""In our anger, we have to make sure that we don't burn down our own house,"" he said. ""What I don't want is us to go down there, burn our own neighborhood. That does not prove a point. That does not solve an issue. That hurts this community."" ",NA,NA,NA,NA

The big question is whether he will remain alone or others in his party will join him.

Politicians of all stripes have decried Ferguson, Missouri police for a military-style response to protesters that evokes a war zone in the wake of the shooting of an unarmed black man. Paul did something much more controversial and courageous. In an essay published Thursday on {TIME Magazine’s website}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/"">, the Kentucky senator and Tea Party favorite wrote “given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.”

He added, “Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention.”

His direct connection of the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown to race didn’t just differentiate Paul from most white politicians and fellow Republicans, but also President Obama. Paul took a risk, in that much remains unclear about Brown’s death, and the senator’s blunt race talk could be held against him later.

Paul has acknowledged that part of his motivation to address racial issues is political, as Republicans won fewer than 10 percent of black voters in both 2008 and 2012. He is trying to reinvent how Republicans appeal to black voters to improve those numbers.

Paul is not the first Republican to try this. Since African-Americans started overwhelming backing Democrats a generation ago, numerous Republicans have tried to win back the black vote. But as National Journal’s Ron Brownstein {wrote}<hyperlink=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/s/72892/rand-pauls-audacious-outreach""> in a recent piece, many of those Republicans, like George W. Bush, have sought black voters by emphasizing that African-Americans have common values with Republicans, like attending church often and opposing abortion. Those Republicans have largely refused to move toward positions held by black voters, instead trying to convince African-Americans that their views are in fact more conservative than liberal.

[tweetbegin 499958503948439552 tweetend]

Not Paul. On a number of issues, he is adopting positions held by black civil rights leaders but usually not Republican politicians.

He has called for an end to Reagan-era “war on drugs” policies that result in long prison sentences for non-violent drug crime offenders, many of whom are black. He is pushing legislation that would make it harder for employers to learn about a person’s criminal history if he or she has not committed a violent crime, as many blacks have trouble getting jobs because of some offense on their record. Paul has attacked laws that prevent people from voting if they have a criminal background.

“It’s extremely significant and I think quite encouraging for Senator Paul to not just raise these issues, but also to be such a passionate advocate,” said Jotaka Eaddy, a senior director at the NAACP, said in an interview with {theGrio.com}<hyperlink=""http://thegrio.com/""> earlier this year.

Paul is likely to be a presidential candidate in 2016. If he were to win the GOP nomination, the Kentucky senator could use that opportunity to directly change how the Republican Party talks about race. He could potentially implement these changes if he were elected president.

But in the immediate term, Paul is simply a senator. And his words will only have impact if other Republicans adopt similar views, and he will have difficulty winning his party’s nomination if others in the GOP do not agree with him.

So far, there is little evidence Paul is having much influence within his own party on racial issues. Some other Republicans, most notably Texas Gov. Rick Perry, have emphasized the need to stop sending drug criminals to prison.

But a provision to restore felon voting rights in Kentucky failed due to opposition from some GOP legislators there, even as Paul testified in its favor. Republicans have continued to advocate voter ID laws, even as Paul said earlier this year, “it’s wrong for Republicans to go too crazy on this issue because it's offending people.” Few Republicans are making a great effort to attend events like the National Urban League’s annual conference, which Paul attended last month.

In the wake of the Ferguson shooting, few prominent Republicans have framed it in racial terms or suggested it speaks to broader challenges blacks face because of racial discrimination. At least four minorities, doctor Ben Carson, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, are considering running for the Republican presidential nomination, and none of them are joining Paul’s causes either.

Paul has suggested that Republicans can’t win a presidential election without changing both their policies and rhetoric toward African-Americans. His fellow Republicans sound like they are ready to test that proposition.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The violence broke the brief period of calm that had settled over Ferguson, Missouri, after outrage over the shooting of Michael Brown spilled over.

Protests had started off peacefully in Ferguson on Friday night. Rev. Jesse Jackson linked arms with protesters, leading them in prayer and urging them to ""turn pain into power"" while fighting back non-violently, NBC Affiliate KSDK reported. Shortly after midnight, crowds got rowdier and looting began to break out, according to KSDK.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson confirmed that there was looting overnight at a convenience store where police said Brown was suspected of stealing cigars.

""There were 300 protesters last night, but the protesters went home and the looters came out,"" Johnson said.

Tear gas was deployed and riot police moved in, with some locals forming lines to protect local businesses from looters. Three officers were injured overnight, with Johnson telling The Associated Press that rocks and other objects were thrown at police.

The violent scenes came as public anger flared again on Friday after police sought to clarify what happened in the moments before an officer shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown.

For days, police had refused to release the name of the officer who shot Brown but on Friday he was identified as Darren Wilson, a four-year veteran of the force in Ferguson, Missouri.

Anger also mounted after police also revealed that Brown was suspected of stealing a box of cigars from a convenience store and assaulting a clerk minutes before he was shot to death.

But Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said later in the day Friday that Wilson {did not know Brown was a suspect}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/ferguson-chief-names-darren-wilson-cop-who-shot-michael-brown-n181326""> when he stopped Brown and a friend. Asked why they were stopped, the chief said: ""Because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.""

The release of a surveillance tape appearing to show Brown engaging in an altercation with the store clerk infuriated Brown's family, which said that the police were {trying to smear the teenager's name}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/beyond-outraged-michael-browns-family-accuses-ferguson-police-smear-n181696""> and justify a ""brutal assassination"" in broad daylight.

A lawyer for the family, Anthony Gray, accused the police chief of inciting the community. If there is further violence, he said, ""it won't be on anybody on this side.""

""Don't take that bait and begin to riot,"" he said.

The family said in a statement: ""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.""

A day earlier, Ferguson had experienced its first relatively calm night in almost a week. The Highway Patrol had taken command of policing, and officers marched down the streets with protesters. There were demonstrations Friday night but no reports of arrests that had marred protests earlier in the week.

People in Ferguson Friday questioned why police had waited so long to disclose the robbery, and they said there was still no explanation for why the officer shot and killed the teenager.

Scenes earlier this week of officers in military-style gear atop armored vehicles and training guns on protesters sparked a national outrage.

By Thursday, President Barack Obama weighed in, encouraging calm among both the protesters and the police, and Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the Highway Patrol to take over security.

The man in charge for the Highway Patrol, Capt. Ron Johnson, spoke glowingly on Friday of how things had calmed down because of simple communication between law enforcement and the public.

Rev. Jesse Jackson addressed the crowd before they marched peacefully for blocks chanting: “Keep hope alive! Don't shoot! Hands up, don't shoot.""

The ordered assembly was a stark contrast to the turmoil that enveloped Ferguson overnight.

Looting during the early hours of Saturday left many Ferguson businesses in shambles. Sam's Meat Market and More was looted for the second time in one week, but the store’s resilient owner said he's refusing to shutter the doors.

""I never give up,"" owner Mike Jacobs told NBC News on Saturday, even though he admitted the shop hadn’t recovered from the first wave of looting days earlier.

Several other Ferguson businesses were also ransacked Saturday, following Friday's orderly protests over the shooting death of Brown. But just as the peaceful atmosphere in Ferguson dissolved into {chaos after nightfall}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/anger-flares-again-ferguson-after-revelations-michael-brown-shooting-n181861"">, daybreak on Saturday brought calm and the community's support for businesses that were looted overnight.

Tanya Littleton, the manager of Feel Beauty Supply, looked at her battered store and wondered whether it would have to close for good after the nearly week long of unrest.

""It's not worth it,"" Littleton told NBC affiliate {KSDK}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/16/looters-force-beauty-supply-store-to-close/14156089/"">. ""Right now our safety is more important than anything.""

""We are really fearful for our lives,"" added Seretha Alford, an assistant manager at Feel Beauty.

While owners and managers were reeling from the destruction from protesters who were taking out their rage on businesses with no explanation, other community members said those who were acting out did not represent the character of the city of 21,000.

""This is not Ferguson. This is not St. Louis,"" resident Kerrie McKenna said outside of Sam's Meat Market and More.

""I came out to clean because we all need to band together,"" said another community member, Anitra Williams.

Residents also reached out to Ferguson Food Market and Liquor Store, which was looted after police released {video of Brown allegedly stealing cigars from the convenience store}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/chief-defends-release-robbery-surveillance-video-n181786"">. Those who showed up to pick up the pieces said they didn't understand the logic behind attacking the market.

""I think it's crazy,"" Regina Eason said amid the devastation and debris. ""What is damaging a store going to do?""

Another supporter, Derrick Spencer, said the looting was ""senseless."" ""It's not helping the situation,"" he said.

The violence had {quelled}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/so-far-so-good-few-police-visible-tension-lowers-ferguson-n181201""> Thursday after policing was transferred to state troopers from local police, but the decision by Ferguson police to release a video that allegedly showed Brown, 18, stealing seemed to spark the new wave of outrage.

Brown's family said the choice to release the video was ""{character assassination}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-browns-family-accuses-police-character-assassination-n181841"">,"" and Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson later acknowledged that the officer who shot the teen didn't know he was a suspect in the robbery.

Saturday afternoon marked a week since Brown had been killed by the officer, who was identified as Darren Wilson, a four-year veteran of the force in Ferguson.

About forty people gathered in the rain at noon (1 p.m. ET) Saturday outside of the Ferguson Police Department to pay tribute to Brown with a moment of silence at the exact time he was killed a week earlier.

""It's a peaceful, silent protest to honor his death, pray silently for peace and stop the looting so no one gets injured on either side,"" said attendee Mandy Lanham.

""I hope we continue to unite as a community and embrace each other rather than fear each other,"" Lanham said. But only time would tell if the tranquility would last, or if the following hours would mimic the unrest of the night before.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The unprecedented militarization of police agencies — including a {$4.3 billion Pentagon buildup}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/police-are-big-recipients-pentagons-surplus-gear-weapons-n181091""> dubbed “from warfighter to crimefighter"" — has painted a new layer of ugly on the historical tension between the “blue line” of cops and the roiling emotions of demonstrators, according to some law experts.

In fact, when riot shields are raised, the seemingly simple fact that civilians can't see the cops' faces flips a psychological switch for some citizens in the crowd — and that image acts to dehumanize the officers, said Norm Stamper, who served as chief of the Seattle Police Department during the 1999 WTO riots.

""It makes a huge difference. We are social creatures, we are human beings. We need to see people's eyes and we need to see people's expressions,"" said Stamper, who worked 34 years in uniform and holds a PhD in leadership and human behavior.

""When it's all hidden behind a military presence — like a Kevlar helmet — people aren't going to see the face of that officer. Citizens, in effect, depersonalize their police officers for very understandable reasons,"" Stamper added.

A fellow former top cop agreed that in the minds of those standing against a line of battle-ready officers, the person behind the badge vanishes.

""They see the police as occupiers,"" said Stephen Downing, retired deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. ""That’s a very natural reaction.""

In Ferguson, {following the fatal police shooting}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-brown-death-tear-gas-more-arrests-ferguson-missouri-n180166""> last Saturday of unarmed, 18-year-old Michael Brown, many locals turned into protesters and marches were mixed with riots. But Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson made a tactical error by deploying his military-clad officers early on, Downing argues, asserting that such a move will pacify the masses only when officers already enjoy a “reservoir of good will.”

“You’ve got a bunch of police officers on the street dressing up in this military mode. Their chief of police is allowing them to make that sort of show of force. So, they are reacting in a show of force as if they have transitioned into a military mode rather than remaining law enforcement officers dedicated to keeping the peace and preserving life,” Downing said. “You can do neither when you have a show of force that is excessive beyond the need for crowd control.”

Any shift away from community policing — genial collaboration between cops and civilians — has been exacerbated by the rapid acquisition of military weapons and material by municipal and county law-enforcement agencies across the country, said Jody Armour, a Roy P. Crocker professor of law at the University of Southern California. He is an expert in racial profiling and excessive-force issues.

When peace officers don war-zone wardrobes, the look naturally injects an adversarial gap between officers and civilians, Armour added.

“Military armaments put more emotional and psychological distance between officers and citizens, and they undermine the ‘to serve and protect’ credo stenciled on the doors of many police cruisers,” Armour said.

But the psychological divide goes both ways, the ex-police chiefs agree.

The routine duties of a uniformed patrol cop typically involve pulling over a driver or answering a dispatcher's instructions to head to a home.

""It's usually, in those situations, just two human beings,"" Stamper said. ""Yes, there's distance between somebody who's got authority and somebody who sees themselves on the receiving end of that authority. But there's a feeling of: 'Well, I can talk to this person, maybe even reason with this person.'

""Now, one of the things that happens is, even when a cop is no longer in that military garb, when they go back to their basic working blues, they don't turn it off. They may, in fact, find themselves behaving the same way they did when they were in that military uniform. That's a major concern I have,"" added Stamper, author of {""Breaking Rank,""}<hyperlink=""http://normstamper.com/""> an unvarnished look at work of policing America today.

Stamper served as police chief during the 1999 “Battle in Seattle” protests amid a ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization. He expressed — in a {2011 essay}<hyperlink=""http://www.thenation.com/article/paramilitary-policing-seattle-occupy-wall-street/""> — regrets about how he directed his officers when some 40,000 demonstrators gathered, writing: “My support for a militaristic solution caused all hell to break loose.”

Of course, tactical, heavily armored forces are sometimes needed when bad stuff goes down — school shootings, hostage situations or when armed individuals barricade themselves and threaten family or neighbors. Then the local SWAT team is summoned.

“Their mission is never a military mission. Their mission is always a law enforcement mission,” said Downing, formerly of the LAPD. “The law enforcement mission is to preserve life and order. The military mission — they have an enemy and their mission is to kill that enemy.”

In the best departments, when highly schooled SWAT outfits are called to action, their previous, long hours of preparation help them remain calm enough to make smart, professional decisions — no different than they would act when they wear regular police uniforms, Downing said.

“The problem is, American law enforcement has been provided all of this military equipment, basically free by the government, so that the government can leverage local enforcement to fight the war on drugs and the so-called war on terrorism. And there (sometimes) is no training,” Downing said.

“There are too many officers on the street sliding into these bullet-proof vests, putting on the fatigues, boots and helmets, getting to ride on these armored vehicles. And when they strap into that equipment without the proper training, they are going to metamorphize into a military posture,” Downing said. “That's what the testosterone is doing to them absent the training.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson released the video Friday, telling reporters that he had no choice because the media requested the release under the Freedom of Information Act. The Department of Justice, which is conducting its own investigation into Brown’s Aug. 9 death, has had a copy of the footage all along and never considered releasing it to the public, the source said.

The suburb of Ferguson, a town of about 21,000, has been wracked by protests and unrest in the week since Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by a Ferguson police officer last Saturday.

Some on West Florissant Avenue, the thoroughfare where most of the clashes have taken place, were skeptical earlier in the day whether the curfew would do more harm than good, with some calling the measure insulting. “I think it's a disgrace. I think it's unfair. No other municipality has a curfew for adults,” said Antoine Hobson.

Another man, Jeff Harris, said while he would obey the curfew said the curfew would do more harm than good. “I think it violates people's right to assemble. It's a bad idea. It further provokes these people,” he said. Others supported the move, although reluctantly. “I don't like it, but considering what happened, I understand it. It's just a few people who are causing these problems,"" said Marcus Johnson.

Brown’s cousin, Ty Pruitt, was among those helping to clean up business damaged in Saturday’s looting. He blasted those who have taken advantage of the situation to trash stores. “My family does not represent nor condone what’s going on here,” he told NBC affiliate KDSK. “We want answers, but this is not the way to get them. This is not the way to do it.”

“You guys say you’re doing this for my baby cousin, you say you’re doing this for justice,” Pruitt said of the looters. “What are you accomplishing? That’s what I want to know. What are you accomplishing by the ignorance you’re displaying in this community?”

The looting early Saturday morning came after Ferguson police on Friday released the name of the officer who shot Brown but also released surveillance video that appeared to show Brown robbing a clerk at a liquor store shortly before he was shot.

The officer, Darren Wilson, did not know Brown was a robbery suspect when he stopped the teen for walking in the street, Chief Thomas Jackson said. Brown’s family called the release of the video a “character assassination,” and a source with knowledge of the situation told NBC News that the Department of Justice {urged against releasing the video}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/feds-urged-police-not-release-michael-brown-robbery-video-n182346""> because it would inflame tensions",NA,NA,NA,NA

One person was shot and seven were arrested overnight, police said, after a midnight {curfew}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/missouri-gov-nixon-declares-state-emergency-issues-curfew-ferguson-n182341""> that was imposed to tamp nights of looting and rioting in the Missouri town. But the {bullets and tear gas}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/ferguson-protests-one-person-shot-seven-arrested-overnight-clashes-n182481""> of the overnight hours were replaced by brooms and Bibles on Sunday morning, as many from the community and others who had been watching the turmoil from far away called for peace.

National Action Network youth director, Mary-Pat Hector, just 16, traveled from Atlanta to address congregants of Greater St. Mark. Hector said the outbreak of violence was ""taking away from the justice of Michael Brown,"" the 18-year-old shot and killed by a police officer on August 9. ""I’m asking you to go to your communities, to go to your neighborhoods and say 'this is not the way to go.' We need to work together,"" she said.

On the streets of Ferguson, residents spent another day trying to communicate that the violence, which has {often broken out at nightfall during the past week}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-brown-shooting-ferguson-cleans-after-another-night-unrest-n182291"">, does not represent what Ferguson stands for.

The rioters ""are only a small section of our community,"" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told NBC News, while cleaning up outside of a barbecue restaurant that was the scene of Saturday night's shooting. ""The rest of the community is trying to operate normally.""

""It's one thing for people to protest. It's another thing to destroy the neighborhood,"" said Ferguson resident Toneta Smith, while discarding tattered reminders of Saturday night's chaos into a trash bag.

Others helping outside of the restaurant had traveled up to 30 miles to show their support for Ferguson.

""I'm just trying to help out. I just feel if it's clean, if it's orderly, that helps,"" said Justin Aisenstat, from Webster Groves, Missouri.

But Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said it would take more than tidy streets to quell the anger that has spilled over in Ferguson. Koster said an armored truck stationed on a main road in Ferguson served as a metaphor for the ""wall of armor"" that has grown between law enforcement and residents of the predominantly-black town.

""This problem existed long before any of us were here,"" Koster said at Greater St. Mark's morning service, ""and I am sorry that I have not done more to break down that wall of anger.""

""The question is, what are we going to do when we are here and have a chance to change it,"" Koster challenged.

Civil-rights activist and MSNBC host Rev. Al Sharpton followed Koster's remarks at the church and agreed that Ferguson and the country were facing ""a defining moment."" Sharpton said he and Michael Brown's family ""condemned"" the looters.

""There's a difference between an activist and a thug,"" Sharpton said.

[tweetbegin 501056102206029824 tweetend]

Sharpton asked that law enforcement officials similarly condemn the actions of ""police that shoot and kill unarmed people."" A second injustice, he said, was local police {releasing a video}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/ferguson-chief-names-darren-wilson-cop-who-shot-michael-brown-n181326""> that purportedly showed Brown stealing from a convenience store.

""I have never in all of my years seen something as offensive and insulting as a police chief releasing a tape of a young man — trying to smear him before we even have his funeral or his burial,"" Sharpton said.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Sunday also admonished the release of the tape and said the investigation into Brown's death would be thorough, but added, ""In order to get justice, we need peace.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt.

Johnson said the canisters of smoke and tear gas were used to reach the victim of the shooting, “and not in relation to the curfew.” It was not clear why or how the person was shot, and the shooter was still at large, police said.

Johnson said police used “proper response tonight to maintain officer safety and public safety,” even though he had vowed during an earlier press conference {not to use tear gas}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/missouri-gov-nixon-declares-state-emergency-issues-curfew-ferguson-n182341""> and armored trucks, but rather communication to disperse crowds at midnight. The strict curfew was enacted by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Saturday in an attempt to ease the tensions in Ferguson, which erupted over the death of Michael Brown and sparked protests and looting.

In law enforcement's telling, Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson fired only after Brown tried to grab his gun. According to eyewitnesses, Brown's hands were raised when he was killed.

But what if Wilson had been wearing a body camera? Courtney Curtis, a Missouri lawmaker, believes that many of the questions that have ignited violent protests in the days since could have been answered. ""The audio-video would have potentially provided that, or at least had given us the starting point,"" she told NBC News.

More than a thousand police departments around the country are now using such cameras. While agencies are still tweaking the rules that surround them, including how to prevent selective editing and when footage should be made public, law enforcement experts believe they could provide clarity during Ferguson-like disputes. The American Civil Liberties Union supports the use of cameras as well, saying in a statement that they ""have the potential to be a win-win, helping protect the public against police misconduct, and at the same time helping protect police against false accusations of abuse.""

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Next on Meet the Press, the racial divide in America. New developments this morning at the slaying of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer turns a Saint Louis suburb into a combat zone. The search for answers in the national debate over race and policing. It prompted President Obama to weigh in once again. I'll be joined by the governor of Missouri, and key voices from law enforcement and the political world.

And taking on the ISIS threat, to President Obama's refusal to intervene in Syria, new attempts to stop the terrorism from taking hold in Iraq. And why? And just how deep is the rift between Hillary Clinton and the president on the United States of force in the Middle East? Plus, the memory of a comic genius, as the world mourns the death of Robin Williams. Our Harry Smith has an insightful interview with Barry Levinson, director of Williams' breakout movie, Good Morning, Vietnam.

ANNOUNCER:

From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Good morning. A state of emergency is now in effect in Ferguson, Missouri, after another night marred by clashes between protesters and police. A group of protesters defying a new overnight curfew were met by the continued, massive, military-style police response, with armored vehicle, tear gas, and smoke bombs.

Seven people were arrested for violating the curfew, one person was hurt in an unrelated shooting. And more controversy Friday as Ferguson Police released the name of Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Michael Brown. The release was accompanied by a surveillance tape the police say linked Brown to a convenience store robbery.

But then Ferguson's police chief issued conflicting statements as, ""To whether the confrontation between Brown and Wilson wouldn't have been related to the robbery."" And adding to the confusion and anger of protesters. No details about the exact circumstances still of the shooting of Michael Brown have been released.

I'm joined now by the governor of Missouri, Jay Nixon. Governor, thank you very much for being with us. Tell me, why has a full week elapsed, and we still do not know anything? The public wants answers to what happened between Michael Brown and the white officer who shot and killed him?

GOVERNOR JAY NIXON:

Well, it's been a challenge week with the horrific death of Michael Brown, shot down in the streets of his home town and the appropriate energy and acts that everyone's had around there. I think with the dual investigations going on right now with the justice department and with the local prosecutor, and I'm especially appreciative.

After talking to General Holder, I appreciated them sending in 40 additional F.B.I. agents to make sure that they're moving to get a thorough investigation, to get justice here. And I appreciate their response and that energy to make sure that they get this right.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

But why is it taking so long? And you also have a county prosecutor who many say has a conflict of interest here, because he said that he disagrees strongly with your decisions in bringing the county police. He called it shameful, saying that that was in fact an illegal decision. So how is he the person that would be trusted by this very angry and eventful community to come with answers that are credible?

GOVERNOR JAY NIXON:

Well, he's a seasoned prosecutor that has an opportunity to step up here and do his job. And also though, when you see a dual investigation going on, and the resources of the Justice Department, an F.B.I. agent's out working in the community yet again yesterday, 40 additional officers, I think that having those dual investigations will help guarantee that this gets done in a timely fashion. That it's done thoroughly, and that it gets justice.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Isn't it more important to get answers, correct answers, and answers to the public? What of the timely investigation? What is taking so long about telling the people what happened to Michael Brown?

GOVERNOR JAY NIXON:

It's been a week, and it's a been a very long week. And late in the week, when we saw the additional militarization of the police response there and the security side, I had to take an unprecedented action, which was to replace and bring in our highway patrol to lead that. I think that that has made a big difference. You saw that first night, very much peace.

Second night, until late in night, there was peace. And last night, I think the vast majority of local citizens, the local elected officials and others called on me to put a curfew in place, so there'll be guaranteed peace late last night. And of the thousands of protesters and the community members out there, I think they made a difference. In order to get justice, we need peace. Those are both intertwined here. And we look forward to keeping the peace and getting justice.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Well, governor, there was peace. There was peace on Thursday night after you appointed the county police to come in and take over. The state police, rather, their takeover from the county. But then the local police chief who released that video, what justifies releasing the video about the convenience store, while there's still no details about what happened with the shooting itself? That is what caused everything to erupt again on Friday night and eventually led to the curfew having to be imposed.

GOVERNOR JAY NIXON:

Yeah, we and our security team and the highway patrol did not know that was going to be released. I don't think the attorney general knew that. And quite frankly, we disagree deeply I think for two reasons. Number one, to attempt to in essence disparage the character of this victim, in the middle of a process like this is not right. It's just not right. And secondarily, it did put the community and quite frankly the region and the nation on alert again. These are old wounds. These are deep wounds in these communities. And that action was not helpful.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Well, should the police chiefs, Chief Jackson then be fired or have to step down?

GOVERNOR JAY NIXON:

We've moved the highway patrol in to manage security. The Justice Department and the detectives in Saint Louis are doing the investigation. So he--

(OVERTALK)

ANDREA MITCHELL:

But he's still, with all due respect governor, he's still doing things, like releasing that video, without even reporting to the state police captain, Captain Johnson, who's supposed to be in charge.

GOVERNOR JAY NIXON:

Yeah. Everyone can rest well assured that we've had very serious discussions about that action and how much we felt that it was not the right way to handle the victim's family, which I had a chance to speak with. They were deeply troubled. And when you see your son gunned down in the street and then you see a police chief begin an attempt to attack his character.

That's just not the way to operate. And we've made that clear to everyone. And our hope and expectation is that now that our folks are in charge of security, and we have these dual investigations going on, that, that bump is behind us, hopefully.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Well, governor--

GOVERNOR JAY NIXON:

But the wounds are very real.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Well, governor, I know that when you say that you were doing a lot of things behind the scenes, but why did it take you till Friday to get to Ferguson, what they call ground zero? And when did you first hear from the president about all this?

GOVERNOR JAY NIXON:

I've been involved all week. I've been having meetings and phone calls and meeting with local officials, been here a number of times. And once again, yesterday in the morning conference call with local officials have asked me to put a curfew in place, to make sure that we have safety as well as peace, so that this community could be safe.

So we've been here all week. I've been here most of the days. And I talked to the president in the middle part of the week. I talked to General Holder at some length later in the week, and I appreciate deeply, and actually that conversation, General Holder and the F.B.I. sending 40 additional F.B.I. officers in to make sure they're getting a thorough but timely investigation here. And I think that's helping.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Thank you so much, Governor Nixon, from Missouri. While the events in Ferguson this week have certainly shocked the nation, focusing renewed attention on the nation's disparity that still exists in our justice system. Our Kevin Tibbles takes a closer look at that situation.

(BEGIN TAPE)

KEVIN TIBBLES:

A week of unrest and racial tension. In today's America, black men are six times more likely to be incarcerated than white men. Prison sentences for black men are 20% longer than those for whites convicted of the same crime. And on average, 100 black people are killed each year by white police officers.

JAMES CLARK:

They had to get America's attention. They had to get America to take notice of their pain.

KEVIN TIBBLES:

James Clark is a Saint Louis community activist who says he sees the disparity every day.

JAMES CLARK:

Crimes is going up. The perpetrators are now getting younger and younger. And there is a fundamental reason why, because they're living in subcultures that mainstream, would rather act like it doesn't exist.

KEVIN TIBBLES:

But they do exist. And some maintain there are two Americas, one white, one black. And they are not equal. Greg Howard is a columnist who was so outraged, he wrote an essay entitled America is Not For Black People.

GREG HOWARD:

We’re seeing so many black men killed by police officers because police officers don't value black men's life as they do that of white people. It's physically easier for a police officer to weigh what a black man's life is worth and to end up feeling what he's justified in pulling the trigger.

KEVIN TIBBLES:

Heather McDonald strongly disagrees.

HEATHER MCDONALD:

I stand the opposite. The criminology profession has been trying for decades to prove that the over-representation of blacks in prison or in arrest statistic is a result of criminal justice racism. It is black crime rates that predict the presence of blacks in the criminal justice system. Not some miscarriage of justice.

KEVIN TIBBLES:

Still, in Ferguson, as in many other impoverished urban communities, the authorities are often seen as the enemy.

JAMES CLARK:

After the cameras leave, and after young Michael is buried, if we don't reach into the neighborhoods, they'll become more bold. They'll become much more brazen.

KEVIN TIBBLES:

The death of a young man in suburban Saint Louis resonates across the nation. But will it encourage solutions or create further division? For Meet the Press, Kevin Tibbles.

(END TAPE)

ANDREA MITCHELL:

And to discuss the broader meaning of Ferguson for the rest of the country, I'm joined by Wesley Lowery, he's been covering this story for The Washington Post. He had his own encounter with Ferguson police that he shot on tape. He was arrested and released without being charged there on Wednesday.

And also here is Gilbert Bailon, editor of The Saint Louis Post-Dispatch, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, the mayor of Baltimore, Charles Ogletree, professor at Harvard Law School, and founder of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice. And from Los Angeles, Bernard Parks, former chief of the L.A. Police Department, now a member of the Los Angeles City Council. Welcome all. Wesley, first to you. You were on the streets that awful night and all week really. What has been the response now to the local police and the curfew as the state police have taken over?

WESLEY LOWERY:

Unfortunately, I think we've seen a lot of community leaders and members, protesters, organizers, who really tried to abide by the curfew. And I was talking to people getting on the plane on the way up here as well, I was talking to reporters who were still on the ground.

The community wanted to respect this curfew, by large. There was certainly a group of people who stayed past the curfew, protesters, and also what it sounds like, some people who were looking for trouble. We have a real anger on the ground here.

And we have not just an anger in the protesters and the residents, but also people who are seeing this as an opportunity to come into Ferguson, from outside of Ferguson, either opportunistically, to cause trouble, but also as a way of saying, ""This is a way of having the same voice. That this protest is happening here, these clashes are happening here. So maybe I don't live here in Ferguson, I live in a separate suburb, but I can now come here and express my voice."" And there were chants of, ""We have the right to peacefully assemble,"" back at the police after they said, ""You're violating the curfew.""

ANDREA MITCHELL:

And Gilbert Bailon, the back story here is there are 90 municipalities around Saint Louis, there is a deep racial divide, there's a history of police harassment. And you've got a police team here led by a chief who released that video about the convenience store without telling any of his then superiors. And you've got three black officers and 50 white officers with a town that is 67% African American.

GILBERT BAILON:

Well, it's interesting to know the history of this town. This town's been incorporated for more than a hundred years. It has historic areas. And people have been beginning to change in the last few decades. The African American population grew. What has not grown with that is the political representation, the economic opportunity.

They feel very isolated. And additionally, a deep mistrust for the police there. We have a story today in the apartment complexes where this happened, that people report being harassed, being profiled, being asked questions about why they're even in the neighborhood. So that's their feeling.

The police, on the other hand, will say there's a crime problem in this area, and we have to enforce it to keep the public safety. So that's the clash we have on there. This is not unique to Ferguson. I think many, many cities in our region and many cities throughout the country have similar issues.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

But a lot of people, Mayor, were shocked by the militarizationthat we saw on Wednesday night. And we've seen this started in 1996 and 1997 as an anti-drug war component. But then it became armored vehicle, the kind of surplus defense vehicles. I think more than $60 million in the last five years was spent in the Saint Louis area alone. Does Baltimore have the same kind of equipment? And who decides when it gets used?

STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE:

Well, we have some equipment that is used for emergencies, and emergency preparedness. And up and down the East Coast, especially after 9/11, our region has armed ourselves for that type of emergency. It's very unusual that it would be used against your own citizens. So I don't understand that decision.

There's a sacred bond that the police have with the community. And when it's broken, it has ripple effects in that community and across the country. People don't want their military equipment being used on them when they're just voicing their opinion. So you have to be very careful.

We had the Occupy Wall Street Movement. Baltimore is one of the only cities that was able to break up that encampment without any arrests, or any problems because we were very judicious in the use for force. You have to be. You don't get do-overs with things like that.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Stephanie, your city is 63% African American, yet your police and fire departments don't fully reflect that racial background. You have tried to have more community policing, tried to do something with hiring promotions. We talked about this this week, but it still hasn't worked.

STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE:

Well, we're determined to get it right. The issue of you can't do the same thing that you did year after year, knowing that you have a chip in the demographics and expect things to happen differently. We are doing things differently in the fire department, in the police department. We have members of the community who are now part of the panel when we are putting police officers up for promotion.

So the community has a voice in who responds, who are the first responders in their community. You have to do it on a consistent basis. You can't just show up after something that's happened and think that you're going to have that level of trust that is necessary in a crisis.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Charles Ogletree, we've seen some interesting and diverse races around the nation this week. One leading Republican, who may well be running for president, Rand Paul wrote, ""Coupling the militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury, we begin to have a very serious problem. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them."" Speak to that.

CHARLES OGLETREE:

I think Rand Paul is telling the truth. And I'm glad that the Republican is saying that. I think people are going to really understand that this is a problem. And what's going on in Ferguson, Missouri, is now like any other city. It's never going to change. The conflict between African Americans who are arrested too often, too young, too many times by white police officers, and this is a predominantly black community.

And you have these white officers who don't live there, who aren't a part of the community, who don't know the community, and yet they're given all the power to make things happen. We need to have a change in that sense right now. And I'll tell you what, people think that three days of rioting is the end of it in Ferguson, Missouri. It's just starting.

The people are upset, they're frustrated, they want to take their city back, they don't like the way the young black men are being stopped and killed. How many people have to bury young people for people to understand that something is wrong in Ferguson, Missouri? And I think we have to change that right now.

We have to change that urgently. The governor, the mayor, everybody involved, and I appreciate the fact that the federal government is involved in it, with President Obama and with the Attorney General Eric Holder. But we need a lot more to happen, a lot more to get going.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Well, and in fact, I think with a 67% African American community here, Wesley, and 83% is the arrest rate and incarceration rate is 93% African American.

WESLEY LOWERY:

That's exactly right.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

And so they're targeting. Bernard Parks, you were a police chief in a very complicated place, Los Angeles. And now a member of the city council. The disengagement in Ferguson is extraordinary. It's not just the police department that's virtually all white, it's the city council and the school board. They're not electing people who represent them ethnically or racially.

BERNARD PARKS:

I think it's very important as we watch the coverage of this incident, because we've not heard, in my judgement, heard one word from the mayor or the city council members. You hear from the governor, you hear from the highway patrol, you hear from the Saint Louis County Police. And I think one of the issues that is going to have to be addressed, what is the recovery plan for this city?

When is the Ferguson police going to get reintroduced to the community so where they can begin to work in a relationship? When is the community, in addition to raising their hands as to a protest, become activists and that energy goes into elections and voting so they can take that role that they request to be a part of city government?

Showing at the council meetings, electing representation? These are things that should be on the table, on the recovery of Ferguson, because this issue is going to pass. You're going to have the shooting investigation completed, the F.B.I., eventually all those people will go home. How are the citizens going to interact with Ferguson elected officials and the police department, the personnel department, and all those decision makers once everyone else goes home?

ANDREA MITCHELL:

And let's go around the table. What can be done? What do you think is the most important thing that should be done to try to move beyond the anger and the disengagement?

WESLEY LOWERY:

There should be a release of information. I think that one of the biggest issues, as I've talked to hundreds of protesters the last few days, hundreds of residents over the last few days, is there's still no police narrative provided whatsoever as to why Officer Wilson was interacting with Michael Brown, why he pulled his gun, why after the first shot, he continued firing.

And I think that that is where, that’s the core of the anger and the core of frustration is. There's been so little information. There's been an open hostility towards members of the press trying to get that information. And so do I think that would calm things completely? Not at all. I don't know if there's a plausible pathway forward that's peaceful, because I don't know. But I think that we need some more information.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Well, what was the range, how close was he, where did he shoot him, Charles Ogletree--

CHARLES OGLETREE:

All that is critical.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

We don't have any of that information.

CHARLES OGLETREE:

Exactly. And I think the first thing that needs to happen, we need to arrest Officer Wilson. He shot and killed a man, shot him multiple times. And he's walking free. No one knows anything about him, no one knows why he did it. We need to have that done, number one. And number two, the curfew is, I appreciate it, the mayor, it's very important. But that's not the answer.

You have to have a dialogue with people who are frustrated, who are angry, who are mad at what's going on in Ferguson, Missouri. Until that happens, until there's a dialogue, the people are going to continue to go out, they're going to continue to in a sense show their disobedience. And if you think about it, John Lewis, who I think will be coming on the program later, we need to have a lot of lessons learned from him.

He was beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, he was a person who has gone through all of this. And we have to realize that somebody who has been beaten, who ran for Congress, who was a young, nonviolent person, and still believes in non violence, I think that his message has to be listened to by not just seniors, but young people who were wondering what am I going to do. Because they're coming out. They're very angry. And they're going to be made until something happens to make that change.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

In fact, that's a perfect introduction to John Lewis. And we should point out that there is a continuing curfew not only in Ferguson, but a continuing curfew as well in Baltimore City. I'm joined now by Congressman John Lewis, Democratic congressman from Atlanta, who of course, marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Junior more than a half a century ago. And survived that beating by police in Birmingham, Alabama. Congressman, what do you see as the solutions going forward for this terrible situation in Ferguson, Missouri?

REP. JOHN LEWIS:

Well, I think it's important for people to come together and begin a dialogue. Begin to talk. That's what we did during the '60s. When we had difficult, when we had this order, black people and white people came together. In a place like Ferguson, and it's not just Ferguson. It may be Ferguson today, but tomorrow it could be someplace else.

We have to get police officers, locally-elected officials to respect the dignity and the words of every human being. It's a shame and a disgrace that in a city that is almost 70% African American to have only three African American police officers. Ferguson is not in the American South.

But we're doing much better in the small towns and cities in Georgia and Alabama and Mississippi. This is shameful. This is a disgrace. We must teach people the way of peace, the way of love, the way of nonviolence. But we cannot have peace and order without justice.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Well how would you persuade people there that they can believe in their local authorities, that they should actually participate in elections, run for office, when they're being harassed by their local police and when we see what the police chief did just on Friday?

REP. JOHN LEWIS:

Well, I think that the police chief and the mayor and other local officials have a moral obligation and responsibility to literally apologize to the community. And the city mothers or city fathers should come together in a fashion, reach out to the African American community and say, ""We're going to work together for the common good."" And say, ""We all live in this city together and we've got to learn to live together as brothers and sisters,"" as Dr. King would say, ""Or we're going to perish as fools.""

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Now Congressman, I know you voted against it, but does Congress bear some responsibility for the militarization of local police departments around the country?

REP. JOHN LEWIS:

Well, when I was watching the film footage coming out of Ferguson, it looked like it was in Baghdad or some other war-torn zone. Ferguson is a part of the United States of America. It's not China. It's not Russia. It's not the Congo. It's America. People have a right to protest. People have a right to engage in peaceful, nonviolent action. And the press have a right to cover what is going on.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Thanks so much, Congressman John Lewis, and to all of our other guests on this issue. And next, the U.S. has launched more air strikes targeting Islamic extremists in Iraq this weekend. But what does President Obama's failure to intervene in Syria has fueled the rise of ISIS in the first place. Hillary Clinton seems to think so. Our roundtable will discuss, coming up next.

***Commercial Break***

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Welcome back. The latest now in a key military offensive in the U.S. air war in Iraq. The U.S. is launching more air strikes as part of a joint operation with the Kurds to recapture a strategically important dam in Mosul held by ISIS militants. Kurdish forces say they are now advancing on that dam. And on Friday, at least 80 Yazidi men were reportedly killed by ISIS after refusing to convert to Islam in a Northern Iraqi village.

But there was some welcomed news for the U.S. this week with the nomination of Haider al-Abadi as prime minister to replace Nouri al-Maliki, whose divisive leadership created the vacuum for ISIS in the first place. All this as Hillary Clinton apologized to President Obama, for saying she believes his failure to act in Syria fueled the rise of ISIS. Our chief global correspondent Bill Neely looks at whether America's latest intervention in Iraq can be successful without going after ISIS strongholds in Syria.

BILL NEELY:

The Islamist militants of ISIS are on a fast march through the heart of the Middle East. In Iraq, they've taken the second biggest city, Mosul, and advanced to within an hour's drive of the capital, Baghdad. In Syria, they're threatening a bigger city, Aleppo, and killing off moderate rebel groups, many of them backed by the U.S.

They're doing what Al Qaeda never did in the region, holding ground, and defeating armies. American air strikes targeted its fighters to halt their advance. In the last 24 hours, and just half an hour's drive from here, American warplanes have hit ISIS targets nine times. But why is ISIS being hit here in Iraq?

Why was the plight of the Yazidi the trigger when the gassing of hundreds of civilians in Syria last year and the killing of tens of thousands more merited a threat from President Obama, and then no military action whatsoever? The president drew a red line in Syria. But when the Assad regime used chemical weapons in Damascus, he pulled back from airstrikes and struck a deal with Assad's main ally, Russia.

Questions are again being asked in Washington and elsewhere about American power and the President's willingness to use it. But bombing ISIS and bombing Syria are very different. The militants have no big country protecting them at the UN. America attacked them to stop the threat of genocide, but also to protect its own facilities.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA (ON TAPE):

We will continue airstrikes to protect our people and facilities in Iraq.

BILL NEELY:

Questions are also being asked about America's strategy. Striking a few ISIS vehicles will do little to halt their advance.

MAX FISHER:

Our success means that a few million Iraqi Kurds are saved from ISIS and Kurdistan is kept stable, which is a good thing. But that means really nothing for the millions of Arab Iraqis who are going to stay under ISIS rule for the foreseeable future.

BILL NEELY:

President Obama, wary of military action, is now the fourth consecutive president to bomb Iraq. But now that he's started, when and why will he stop? ISIS is a threat way beyond Syria and Iraq.

BRETT MCGURK:

There's no political solution to the ISIS problem. ISIS has to be squeezed, it has to be deprived of oxygen, and it has to be confronted.

BILL NEELY:

Analysts estimate perhaps a thousand Westerners have joined this fight, among them dozens of Americans. ISIS presents an indirect national security threat to the United States. ISIS wants to redraw the map of the Middle East to establish the Islamic state, the caliphate. It's already targeting not just Syria and Iraq, but Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. It has its sights on a far bigger prize. Bill Neely, NBC News, Iraq.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

And to talk about the Iraq crisis and the rest of the week's politics, the roundtable is here. Anne Gearan, diplomatic correspondent for The Washington Post, will be covering Hillary Clinton as well. Jason Riley a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board and author of Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed.

Jane Harman, the president and CEO of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and a former Democratic congresswoman from California. And Republican Congressman Michael Turner from Ohio. Welcome all. Thanks so much. Anne, you just got back off another round-the-world trip with John Kerry.

And you've been spending so much time in Iraq and Afghanistan as a conflict zone. What about the argument that ISIS would not have taken hold if the administration had a year ago labor day, gone after Assad with air strikes and done more militarily to help the rebels there?

ANNE GEARAN:

There's a fair amount of evidence that ISIS could have been blunted some time back. You can pick another various point where they were gathering strength. But when they were incubating in Syria, might have been a better time to have been paying more attention to how much weaponry they were amassing, what kind of training was happening, where they were getting the money.

Not that the Obama administration wasn't paying any attention to it, but it seems like it's a much more distant problem and it's a problem that got so big so quickly that a lot of people are asking now where were some vector points that American, even stopping short of the military power, but other kinds of American influence might've been able to stop it.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

And now we have military engagement, Jane Harman, it is described as a humanitarian mission. But then the president comes out and says, ""Well, we've done that. The Yazidis are okay."" And now we see air strikes, really successive air strikes to deal with retaking the dam in Mosul, working with the Peshmerga, the Kurds on the ground. Are we involved in a war there?

JANE HARMAN:

Well, I think it's important that we protect our consulate in Erbil, if that dam is sludge, our consulate and a lot of people will be taken out by ISIS. I don't think we should consider ISIS a rational actor, by the way. And I take this very seriously. I spent years on the House Intelligence Committee and Homeland Committee, and I think we should've acted in Syria.

This was something we said at the time. I think we sent a signal to the neighborhood that was disserving. The Saudis expected us to act and were very upset and still are that we didn't. But let me just say this about Saudi Arabia. Where are they? If they think that they can export terrorism again, they tried this with Osama bin Laden, I think they're wrong. And this big caliphate, if it should come to be, God forbid, and I think we will stop them, is going to have its center in Saudi Arabia. So this neighborhood better wake up.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Well, among the critics, by the way, all of you, is General Jim Jones. James Jones, the First Natural Security Advisor to President Obama, he wrote, ""Mr. Maliki's failure to unify Iraq's diverse populations is the chief cause of the current crisis, but Washington bears some blame for not taking timely action that could have limited this summer's chaos.

""The Obama administration could have maintained a limited military training presence in Iraq after 2011; could have acted in Syria last year when the chemical weapons 'red line' was crossed; and could have insisted that Mr. Maliki arm the Kurds. But what matters more is what the U.S. can do now."" Congressman, you I think were against going to Syria, were against continued military action.

REP. MICHAEL TURNER:

Well, what the president needs is a strategy and a plan. I think when we failed to garner the support for the action that he proposed in Syria was because he did not have a strategy and plan, and still we see the failure of that. The failure in his foreign policy and the neglect, as Anne was saying, as this threat involved in Syria, ISIS didn't evolve out of thin air, they were emerging.

And then also a neglect of the administration to work with Iraq. We see now how unstable Iraq is. How threatened they can be by ISIS. And then this very odd red line that the president established with the Yazidis. And instead of when ISIS was establishing a stronghold with major infrastructure, threatening Baghdad, mass killings, tens of thousands of refugees, the administration took action only when it was a humanitarian issue.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Well, that is a question. Who do we save, Jason? We don't save the Syrians.

JASON RILEY:

Just because we can't save everyone doesn't mean we don't save anyone. I think one problem is that we've consistently underestimated ISIS. This is a committed group of extremists that broke off from Al Qaeda because they felt Al Qaeda was too moderate. And our policy needs to reflect that reality.

I think the president has been obsessed with a political solution there. But the best political solution is to defeat ISIS. The Kurds in the North, the Sunni clerics in the West, which ISIS now pretty much controls, want to know that Baghdad can protect them. Defeating ISIS moves us towards that goal.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Hillary Clinton of course has disagreed with the president about this. She did say this in her book Hard Choices, but she made it a lot more explicit with Jeff Goldberg. First read was looking at it this way, the problem for Clinton: when she distances herself from Obama, to a degree she distances herself from, well, herself. With the book rollout, she's been suggesting that her hard choices at the State Department are a key qualifier for the 2016 bid. So how much can she really pull away from the person who gave her the job? And Jane, there is the disloyalty issue among the base.

JANE HARMAN:

Yes. She thought she was addressing one problem. And she created another. Some distance from Obama was inevitable. Foreign policy is a very natural place for her to have some distance from him, despite the fact that she implemented his foreign policy as secretary of State for four years. It's the issue on which the two of them disagreed most sharply during their own campaign.

And they do continue to have disagreements. It was natural and inevitable that there would be some distance created. The question for her politically is did she do it too fast or too much? And is the backlash saying, ""Hey, wait a minute, why are you going after our guy here from the--""

(OVERTALK)

JASON RILEY:

The other question is how plausible is it? She didn't say, ""I wanted to arm the opposition in Syria."" But she called Assad a reformer. And she refused to call for his ouster when the uprising began. She can say, ""Oh, I deplore this Russian aggression,"" but she was all for the Russian reset. So there's a plausibility issue here as well. But yes, she is acting like a lot of Democrats in this election cycle, trying to distance themselves from a president whose approval rating has fallen sharply.

JANE HARMAN:

Well, let's not forget, there are two and a half years to go, and there are opportunities to get this right. And I think Obama's made right choices in Iraq, right, and in Ukraine. But what's still missing is a narrative that links everything together. And it's not just what our foreign policy actually is, it's how it's perceived in the Middle East and how it's perceived in the Middle East is, ""Don't be stupid, let’s use drones.""

And that is going to take a lot of work. One last comment on Iraq. And that is about the Sunnis. Let's understand that there is an opportunity now with this new government, applause, applause, applause, to get the Sunnis back and to have a new Sunni awakening which will hopefully defeat ISIS, which is overreaching.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

But Congressman, is it too late? Because we now have a new prime minister, but he's been critical of the Kurds in the past. What could be proved that he's really going to be inclusive?

REP. MICHAEL TURNER:

Well, and this is a time for the president to engage. And I think we've seen again that's a result of the neglect that the president has had in his foreign policy with respect to Iraq, the instability that has occurred. But the president also has to come to the recognition that ISIS is a threat to the United States.

British Prime Minister Cameron wrote in an op-ed that he sees ISIS as a threat to Britain and to the British. Certainly this president needs to make a case and I think his policy should reflect it, that this is not just a threat to a stable Iraq, this is a threat to--

(OVERTALK)

JASON RILEY:

And that means more than air strikes. That means reconstituting the Iraqi army, that means arming the Kurds. Air strikes are not going to get it done. Containing ISIS is not going to eliminate that threat.

ANNE GEARAN:

Well, but it also means going after ISIS in Syria, which is going to be a whole different ballgame. And there are a lot of people in the administration who are worried about--

(OVERTALK)

ANNE GEARAN:

--alone.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

There will be another big headline--

(OVERTALK)

ANDREA MITCHELL:

I want to get to another big headline today which is Rick Perry. And what Rick Perry had to say that the fact that he has been indicted on two felony charges for vetoing a bill and all this stemming from a Democratic vacuum in this Republican state, Travis County, Austin. So there are a lot of questions about whether it's political and this is what he had to say.

RICK PERRY (ON TAPE):

I intend to fight against those who would erode our state's constitution and laws purely for political purposes, and I intend to win. I am confident that we will ultimately prevail. That this farce of a prosecution will be revealed for what it is. And those responsible will be held accountable.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

He's clearly been gearing up, Congressman, for the potential run for president. Is this going to hurt him? It could help him with debate.

REP. MICHAEL TURNER:

Well, I think everyone sees that this is the criminalization of just the legislative function. You do that, you weaken democracy. This is certainly a political attack. And this is very bad precedent.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Before we go, I want to ask you about Ferguson, because you've written a whole book, Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed. What we're seeing in Ferguson certainly shows the disengagement between the local police force and the community.

JASON RILEY:

You could say that. I don't want to litigate this in the press. But the officer used excessive force. I think he should be prosecuted. But at the same time, let's not pretend that our morgues and cemeteries are full of young black men because cops are shooting them.

The reality is that it's because other black people are shooting them. And we need to talk about black criminality. Blacks are only 13% of the population. But they're 50% of homicide victims in this country. And 90% of those victims are killed by other black people. We have to talk about that.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

We certainly saw that, the blacks were the victims of the looting as well.

JASON RILEY:

At the same time, the same weekend that this went down in Ferguson, we've had 26 shootings in Chicago. But Al Sharpton didn't head to Chicago. He headed to Saint Louis, because he has an entirely different agenda.

JANE HARMAN:

Well, he has--

(OFF-MIC CONVERSATION)

JASON RILEY:

--whites--

JANE HARMAN:

But that is--

(OVERTALK)

JANE HARMAN:

Obviously he's talking to everyone.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Because he's actually there on a peace mission today. But before I go, I just want to say a word about Mo'ne Davis, because she is showing that throwing like a girl is a great thing to do, 70 mile an hour pitches in--

(OVERTALK)

JANE HARMAN:

Here, here.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

And what a great moment for the Philly team and a shutout with a two-hitter. So you go. Thirteen years old, her goal is to go and be in the national league, let her into Major League Baseball. Thank you all. A great roundtable.

REP. MICHAEL TURNER:

Thank you.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

I appreciate your being here today. A lot to cover. Coming up, remembering Robin Williams. Barry Levinson, director of some of the most memorable performances. He tells our Harry Smith just what made his friend so special.

(BEGIN TAPE)

BARRY LEVINSON:

There are a lot of talented people that come along. And there's only a few that are in some other class that you can't even define.

HARRY SMITH:

And he was one of them.

BARRY LEVINSON:

Yeah.

As you may be aware, David Gregory's final show as moderator of Meet the Press was last Sunday. Meet the Press makes a lot of history. And a great deal of it was with David at the helm since he started in December 2008.

(BEGIN TAPE)

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Vice President Joe Biden made front-page news when he got ahead of the president in 2012 and embraced gay marriage.

JOE BIDEN (ON TAPE):

I am absolutely comfortable.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

And an important moment of the 2012 presidential primary, when David moderated a GOP debate live on a Sunday morning just two days before the New Hampshire primary. Then there was David's landmark interview in Afghanistan, 2010 with General David Petraeus, after he took command of U.S. and NATO forces.

Before taking the Meet the Press chair, David had a stellar eight years covering presidential politics at the White House for NBC News, where he covered George W. Bush from the first primaries to 9/11, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 20 years with NBC News, David has done it all. The O.J. Simpson trial, Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing. Today Show guest-hosted.

DAVID GREGORY (ON TAPE):

And how you doing?

ANDREA MITCHELL:

And when the cameras weren't rolling, dead-on imitations of everyone from the president of the United States to Tom Brokaw. Through all the years, David has been truly the traditions of this program and NBC News.

DAVID GREGORY (ON TAPE):

If it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.

(END TAPE)

ANDREA MITCHELL:

On Thursday, David tweeted, ""I leave NBC as I came, humbled and grateful. I love journalism,"" he wrote, ""and sitting as moderator of Meet the Press was the highest honor there is. I have great respect for my colleagues at NBC News and wish them all well. To the viewers, I say thank you."" As David leaves NBC News for his next adventure, I will miss him as a daily colleague. But I know he will always be a friend. We'll be back with more right after this.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Here now with a special edition of Images to Remember, looking back at the extraordinary life of Robin Williams. Robin Williams was a force of nature with the ability to make just about anyone laugh, but he was also an accomplished dramatic actor, winning an Oscar for Good Will Hunting. Barry Levinson directed him in three films, including two of his more politically-themed works, Good Morning, Vietnam and Man of the Year. Levinson spoke to our own Harry Smith about what made his friend such a special and unique talent.

(BEGIN TAPE)

ROBIN WILLIAMS (FROM “GOOD MORNING VIETNAM”):

Good morning, Vietnam. Hey, this is not a test. This is rock-n-roll. Time to rocket it from the delta to the DMV.

BARRY LEVINSON:

In a sense it was like fireworks went off.

ROBIN WILLIAMS (FROM “GOOD MORNING VIETNAM”):

Let's play this backwards and see if it gets any better. Freddie is the devil.

BARRY LEVINSON:

It's like, ""Boom,"" and then all of a sudden, he's off to the races.

ROBIN WILLIAMS (FROM “GOOD MORNING VIETNAM”):

Picture a man going on a journey beyond sight and sound.

BARRY LEVINSON:

And ideas are going through him so fast and coming out at lightning speed.

ROBIN WILLIAMS (FROM “GOOD MORNING VIETNAM”):

He's left Crete. He's entered the demilitarized zone.

BARRY LEVINSON:

To the point you go, ""How is this humanly possible? What is he connected to?"" That it's not like, ""Here's a joke and then here's a joke.""

ROBIN WILLIAMS (ARCHIVE):

Well, what do you use to look for them? Well, we ask people, ""Are you the enemy? And whoever says yes, we shoot them.""

BARRY LEVINSON:

It was like something that just came out in a way that he channeled something and he could run with it and take you on that little ride. It was pretty extraordinary to see.

HARRY SMITH (V/O):

Barry Levinson directed Robin Williams' first hit movie, Good Morning, Vietnam.

HARRY SMITH:

Did you guys talk politics? Had you ever talked politics?

BARRY LEVINSON:

We did. It wasn't necessarily political to one or the other. It was this is what's wrong, this is what's crazy and how come we can't address it and why is it so crazy. How is it we can't come to terms on some basic issues that shouldn't become a political football of a left and right?

ROBIN WILLIAMS (IN STAND UP ACT):

Nice to be in Washington, where the buck stops here. Way to go. And then it's handed out to AIG and many other people. Now I have a new Timothy Geithner $20 bill. It's just been printed. Kind of neat. And instead of, ""In God we trust,"" it just says, ""Trust me.""

HARRY SMITH (V/O):

In 2005, Williams and Levinson teamed up again for Man of the Year, a story about a comedy talk show host who decides to run for president.

ROBIN WILLIAMS (FROM “MAN OF THE YEAR”):

And you can't spend $200 million on a campaign and not be owing people something. And the next thing you know, they have to deal with special interests, and next thing you know, they're doing special favors for special people, and not dealing with what you need.

BARRY LEVINSON:

With all of the comedy that he would do, there something very humanistic about it. There was never an angry, putting down. He could show us how at times where we can be foolish and absurd, et cetera. But there was something that there was a human with a certain degree of kindness to all of the work that he did. And it's a very, very special person.

ROBIN WILLIAMS (FROM “MAN OF THE YEAR”):

Politicians are a lot like diapers. They should be changed frequently and for the same reason. Keep that in mind the next time you vote.

HARRY SMITH (V/O):

Levinson and I spoke on the stage of the Juilliard School, where Williams first learned his craft.

BARRY LEVINSON:

You're trying to find your feet. You're trying to figure out how do I connect to an audience. How do I navigate that? And then the brain starts to go to work. ""Well, this is good, this doesn't work, this isn't right, I need to do--"" And so I'm sure there was that personality that began to take shape.

HARRY SMITH:

Right here.

BARRY LEVINSON:

Right here.

HARRY SMITH:

Then took off like a rocket ship.

BARRY LEVINSON:

There are a lot of talented people that come along. And there's only a few that are in some other class that you can't even define.

HARRY SMITH:

And he was one of them.

BARRY LEVINSON:

Yeah.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

Robin Williams went on six USO tours from 2002 to 2013. He visited troops in the U.S. and 12 foreign countries, making three stops in both Iraq and Afghanistan. And traveling with him on the trip to Afghanistan is our Anne Gearan. You had a remarkable experience with him.

ANNE GEARAN:

It was really funny. It was actually it was in Iraq in 2010 with Chairman Mullen. And we were put up at one of those old Saddam palaces that had been turned into a guesthouse. And he was given a big fancy suite, but only half of it. And the other half was three women journalists.

The problem for him was that there was only one bathroom and only one shower. And he did not get a shower because we kept taking a shower and then we'd go back in our room and he'd come in and knock and say, ""Is it free yet?"" ""Oh no, not quite.""

ANDREA MITCHELL:

So you kept Robin Williams from having a shower?

ANNE GEARAN:

We did. But he was charming about it.

ANDREA MITCHELL:

What an amazing person. And thank you to the roundtable and that's all for today. And we'll be back next week. If it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.

In a rare move for him, the president planned a break in the middle of his Martha's Vineyard vacation to return to Washington on Sunday night for unspecified meetings with Vice President Joe Biden and other advisers. The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions.

Part of the decision appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises. Yet those crises turned the first week of Obama's vacation into a working holiday. He made on-camera statements on U.S. military action in Iraq and the clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri. He called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas. ""I think it's fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that's why you've seen the president stay engaged,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.

Obama is scheduled to return to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend.

Earlier, the Highway Patrol captain appointed to oversee security in Ferguson defended using tear gas as part of the police response violence which erupted Sunday night. Capt. Ron Johnson said law enforcement ""had to act to protect lives and property"" in the hours before a state-imposed curfew that had been due to take effect at midnight local time. Shooting was reported at 8:25 p.m. local time (9:25 p.m. ET), Johnson said. Shots were later fired at police, Molotov cocktails were hurled at officers and makeshift barricades set up, he added. Johnson said police ""deployed tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd."" Looters also targeted a Domino's Pizza outlet, a Family Dollar store, an auto-parts retailer and a self-storage business. Employees of a McDonald's restaurant hid in a storage room after it was ""overrun"" by a large crowd. At least two people were injured amid the chaos but no officers were injured, Johnson said. At least seven arrests were made by early Monday. Authorities also announced that schools in Ferguson would be closed on Monday.

Law enforcement officers were intent on not allowing people to gather in one spot for long. Officers arrested a man Monday afternoon in the parking lot of the convenience store where demonstrators have gathered to organize the nightly protests, and when asked why, one of the officers told NBC News: ""He was supposed to keep moving, just as you're supposed to keep moving.""

A second man was arrested Monday night and accused of failing to disperse. Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, whom Gov. Jay Nixon put in charge of security in Ferguson, was present at the arrest, and he told NBC News: ""There's not freedom of speech when you say I'm going to hurt someone, going to pull something out. That's not freedom of speech.""

Getty Images, meanwhile, confirmed that one of its photographers, Scott Olson, was also arrested. He was released several hours later and was back at work in Ferguson, it said Monday night. Widely circulated photos appeared to show officers taking other people into custody, as well, which NBC News couldn't immediately confirm.

National Guard members joined Ferguson and St. Louis County police and state Highway Patrol troopers on the streets of Ferguson, and protests remained peaceful well into Monday night.

At least six people were arrested Sunday night in the worst night of clashes between police and demonstrators so far. Johnson said the demonstrators who caused trouble Sunday were pursuing an agenda of their own.

""Their tactics are planned and calculated. I watched those in anger,"" {Johnson said on MSNBC's ""All In With Chris Hayes.}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/all-in-with-chris-hayes/watch/ron-johnson--we-have-to-stand-together-319337539701"">"" ""Those individuals last night are not reflective of who we are or what we want, and they are being disrespectful to Mike Brown and Mike Brown's family.""

Johnson promised again that ""we are not going to stop peaceful protesters from having a voice.""

Commanders told NBC News on Monday that they will keep changing tactics until they find the right balance between allowing peaceful protests and maintaining public safety. A curfew that was imposed over the weekend was lifted Monday night — but with the National Guard out in force, there were many more men and women in uniform on the streets with protesters.

They were once again being allowed to wear certain types of protective gear intended for riot situations after the St. Louis County Fraternal Order of Police threatened to go to court to overturn an order that they not wear or carry such equipment as a way to cool tensions, Gabe Crocker, president of the organization, told NBC News. Such equipment is vital ""when they're throwing Molotov cocktails,"" he said.

Obama also announced that Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with FBI agents and other Department of Justice workers conducting a separate federal investigation into the Brown shooting.

The president said Holder will also meet with law-enforcement officials and other leaders in the community to ""help bring about peace and calm in Ferguson.""

The press briefing followed meetings Obama had with his national security team in the morning and with Holder in the afternoon.

During the news conference on Monday the president also addressed the situation in Iraq, saying that U.S,. forces {had made gains against ISIS militants}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/iraq-turmoil/iraqi-kurdish-forces-retake-key-dam-iraq-n183421""> in the north who had taken over the country's largest dam and were threatening thousands of ethnic minorities.

Capt. Ron Johnson made the pledge one day after the worst clashes yet between police and demonstrators who are protesting the police shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

“Tonight, we will ensure the safety of the citizens of Ferguson, the visitors to Ferguson, the business of Ferguson,” he told reporters. “We will not allow vandals, criminal elements, to impact the safety and security of this community.”

He gave no operational details but added: “We will ensure that the rights and the freedoms that this nation provides us will allow for protesters. We will go back and work on a plan to ensure that.”

Before daybreak, Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the National Guard to provide additional security. The governor said later that the National Guard's mission would be limited to protecting the officers already in place.

There was no official word by Monday afternoon on how many National Guard troops were being sent in, or from which divisions. The governor said that the Guard troops would report to the Highway Patrol.

Missouri National Guard Brig. Gen. Gregory Mason said that his forces were “well-trained and well-seasoned.”

Nixon also said that a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew, which had been in place for two nights, would be lifted. Police and protesters clashed both nights, with looting, vandalism, an attempt to overthrow the law enforcement command center and law enforcement officers targeted by gunfire, the governor said.

Tear gas, armored vehicles, and flares were being used on demonstrators.

""We kept marching, they started firing tear gas and that's when everybody turned and ran back,"" said Reggie Edwards, 21, of St. Louis, adding that police fired rubber bullets during the protest. Another protester, Bobby Kalbfell, 27, said he had to help a woman who appeared to be in her 60s flee by placing her on his shoulders. ""There was absolutely no provocation,"" he said.

A police captain told NBC News that a Molotov cocktail may have been thrown behind a strip mall about a half mile from the main protest area, and dozens of police outfitted in riot gear could be seen standing in the parking lot. There was a volley of explosive-like sounds, and a helicopter could be heard buzzing overhead.

Police told MSNBC's Mike Biette and Bruce Carter that a market was set on fire and that shots were fired in Ferguson, though it was unclear who fired them.

Earlier in the evening, hundreds of people lined the avenue where Michael Brown, who was black, was shot to death by a white police officer, and where protesters and police have repeatedly clashed over the last week, triggering Gov. Jay Nixon to institute a state of emergency and President Barack Obama to call for calm.

In the hours before the midnight curfew, authorities were keeping a low-key profile. There were impromptu marches, with people sitting on cars and drivers honking horns — many were waving signs and wearing t-shirts in support of Brown. Justin Winfield, 38, said he would not obey the curfew. ""We're ready to go to war with the police,"" he said.

NBC,nbc84,http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/who-dr-michael-baden-coroner-examined-michael-brown-n183516,"Who Is Dr. Michael Baden, the Coroner That Examined Michael Brown?",Tony Dokoupil,08/18/2014,03/14/2016,"Dr. Michael Baden has examined more than 20,000 dead bodies, but even in a celebrity-spiked career as a forensic pathologist, fiction writer, and television host, few of his reports have drawn as much attention as the autopsy of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.

On Sunday, at the request of Brown’s family's legal team, Baden performed a four-hour autopsy on the young man's body in a mortuary office turned makeshift examining room. The county of St. Louis already conducted its own autopsy and {the Justice Department followed}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-brown-autopsy-conducted-veteran-military-examiner-n183491""> with an autopsy of its own.

For now, though, Baden’s word is the only first-hand expert commentary on what might have happened the day Brown died, a situation that has thrown the 80-year-old doctor into a place where many say he's most comfortable — the spotlight

“Michael never saw a camera he didn’t like,” said Dr. Lowell Levine, who has known Baden since the 1960s, serving with him as co-director of pathology for the New York State Police. “He used to yell at me about the press: 'They’re just trying to make a living — why don’t you help them?'”

“He knows how to give a good quote,” added Marion Roach, a writer who helped Baden write the book “Dead Reckoning,” his 2003 memoir-cum-crime saga on the future of forensic science. “He’s usually right.”

On Monday, as President Obama {called}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/heal-rather-wound-obama-calls-calm-says-holder-will-visit-n183396""> for peace in Ferguson, Roach and Levine praised Baden as someone the nation could trust, the kind of independent, yet lion-hearted expert needed to assist in a case where every outcome leads to controversy. Baden did not respond to requests to be interviewed by NBC News.

“He is absolutely one of the brightest people you will ever run across,” said Levine. “Why Mr. Holder has an independent autopsy going, I don’t know, because they’re not going to find anything different from what Michael found.”

“He is a great man,” added Roach. “Michael Baden gets up every day wanting to do good in the world. He can’t be bought. He can’t be convinced of the wrong story line. He is a pure scientist with a great heart.”

He is also a lifelong public performer. The thrill of crime-solving captivated him at New York University in 1960, where he graduated with an MD and went to work as a pathology resident at Bellevue Hospital. He then worked almost continuously in the office of the New York City Medical Examiner, rising briefly into the chief position in 1978, before joining the state police. He retired to full-time private practice in 2005.

Throughout his decades as an unsung public servant, unzipping body bags and working the bone saw, he consistently found the limelight. At first it was still within the confines of government. He chaired the federal committee that re-investigated the deaths of President Kennedy (Baden said it was Oswald) and Martin Luther King, Jr. (Baden said it was James Earl Ray).

After 1985, however, his work for New York State was only part time, and it allowed for private consultation. Suddenly, Baden was released into a world of six-figure court fees, national television audiences, and moody studio head shots.

Working with journalists, producers, and private legal teams, he investigated the deaths of the lost Tsar Nicholas, John Belushi, the president of Poland, Nicole Brown Simpson, Liz McPherson, Kathleen Savio, and, earlier this month, Eric Garner, who {died in an alleged choke hold}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Ramsey-Orta-Chokehold-Video-Eric-Garner-Gun-Weapons-Charge-Plea-271412401.html""> on the streets of New York City. Along the way, he also hosted HBO’s hit series “Autopsy” and landed a contract — active for more than a decade — as a “Death Correspondent” for FOX News.

He now lives in a sprawling 18th-floor apartment overlooking New York’s Museum of Modern Art, according to the New Yorker. He keeps a dog, a red-headed poodle named after the older, smarter, lazier brother of Sherlock Holmes. And he writes crime thrillers, with the main characters modeled after him and his second wife, Linda Kenney, a high-profile defense attorney.

But Baden’s success has not been without controversy. In 1979, after just 11-months as the chief medical examiner of New York Mayor Ed Koch fired Baden. He claimed that the hot-shot examiner had lost evidence and worked poorly with prosecutors. Baden later won $100,000 in a wrongful termination case, but he was pushed out of the office nonetheless.

A few years later, Baden was fired again, when he worked as the deputy medical examiner in Suffolk County on Long Island, according to the Los Angeles Times. An article in Oui Magazine quoted him giving advice for getting away with “high tech murder.” He later denied the quote, but one of his fellow pathologists grumbled about the ethics of a medical examiner giving “advice on how to kill people,” and Baden was forced out.

In 2007, Baden was again in the news for questionable conduct, this time as he took the stand in the Phil Spector murder trial. He had a fresh theory of how Spector's alleged victim had died, one that provided room for the defense to explain some blood on Spector’s jacket. During cross examination, the prosecutor asked Baden if he had any conflict of interest in this case.

“None that I can think of,” he said, according to the Los Angeles Times. Moments later it was revealed his wife was one of Spector’s main attorneys.

“He is very bright,” said a former classmate of Baden’s, who ran a big city medical examiner’s office around the same time Baden did. “But he has a propensity for giving out statements and testimony which are not entirely accurate.”

This pathologist, who requested anonymity because of the extraordinary controversy of the Brown case, was particularly critical of Baden’s work in Missouri. He said Brown was way too confident for someone who hadn’t seen x-rays, clothing, or lab reports, “all of which can be important.” It was also worrying that Brown had been embalmed, because that would alter the color of the wounds, potentially throwing off Baden’s analysis of entry and exit wounds, and his count of six bullets.

“It could be that only three bullets made those wounds,” the pathologist said.

As it stands, Baden’s testimony aligned with the portrait of events provided by Michael Brown’s lawyers. He said there were “no signs of struggle” and he predicted that his report would be supported by the official ones that follow.

“My impression,” he said, lingering at the podium until Brown’s lawyers pulled him away, “having done this for 40, 50 years, is that they are going to be very similar.”

A member of the public wanted to know why the officer involved had yet to be arrested. “Who gets arrested is a political, district attorney decision,” Baden said, “not a forensic science decision — for good or bad.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a separate inquiry into the death of Brown.

Ronald Davis, director of the department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, will arrive in Ferguson on Tuesday to coordinate crowd control among the various state and local law enforcement agencies that are on the scene, Holder said.

Holder said he understood there was ""tremendous interest"" in the case, but he asked for patience and criticized ""the selective release of sensitive information that we have seen in this case so far."" The federal investigation, he said, ""is a critical step in restoring trust between law enforcement and the community, not just in Ferguson, but beyond.""

“This is the last shot, and this is the only shot that is not treatable,” said the medical examiner, Dr. Michael Baden, pointing to a diagram of where the six bullets entered Brown’s body during the confrontation with an officer in the city of Ferguson on Aug. 9.

Brown’s parents did not speak at a press conference to discuss the autopsy results. But a family lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that the mother wanted to know: “What else do we need to give them to arrest the killer of my child?”

Baden and an assistant performed the autopsy Sunday at the request of the family. St. Louis County medical examiners performed an autopsy earlier but have not released results.

Daryl Parks, another lawyer for the Brown family, said that the private autopsy supported witness accounts that Brown tried to surrender to the officer, Darren Wilson.

Baden said that the private autopsy turned up no physical signs of a struggle between Brown and the officer — only abrasions on the right side of Brown’s face that appear to have been caused when Brown fell to the ground. Police and witness descriptions of the encounter both include a struggle between Brown and the officer.

Chaos once again broke out overnight in the St. Louis suburb where {Michael Brown was fatally shot}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-browns-family-asks-what-else-do-they-need-arrest-n183066""> by police on August 9.

""These criminal acts came from a tiny minority of law-breakers,"" he said. ""It is criminals who throw Molotov cocktails, fire shots and endanger lives. These are not acts of protesters but acts of violence.""

At least two people were shot in the violent overnight melee and 31 people were arrested - with some of those detained coming from New York and California, Johnson said.

He praised the restraint of police amid the chaos, saying he ""heard the screams of officers under gunfire"" throughout the night. Johnson insisted that the use of SWAT vehicles - which has drawn criticism - was necessary to protect lives and evacuate a gunshot victim.

Johnson early Tuesday acknowledged the frustration, saying it will take time for the community to heal. Addressing reporters after a short prayer - which began ""we are weary but we come to you today that you may continue with your spirit that our community may be whole"" - the Highway Patrol officer said he was inspired by the residents of Ferguson.

He urged demonstrators to gather only during the daytime so that authorities can deal with those ""bent on ruining our community"" and so criminals could ""no longer mask themselves behind peaceful protesters.""",NA,NA,NA,NA
NBC,nbc95,http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/st-louis-cops-shoot-kill-man-near-ferguson-crowd-gathers-n184216,"St. Louis Cops Shoot and Kill Man Near Ferguson, Crowd Gathers",Gabe Gutierrez; Rick Brown; Erin McClam; Tracy Connor,08/19/2014,04/13/2016,"Two St. Louis city police officers shot and killed a black man who came within several feet of them brandishing a knife on Tuesday a few miles from the turbulent suburb of Ferguson, authorities said.

A crowd of at least 100 people quickly gathered at the scene. Some people chanted, “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” — the refrain from a week of protests over the police killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, three miles away.

Several hours after the shooting, there was tension in the air, but no physical confrontation. Police presence was limited, in stark contrast to scenes that unfolded in Ferguson last week.

""I think protest here will remain peaceful as long as the police keep a low profile,"" said Daniel Brown, 34, a St. Louis attorney.

The man in the St. Louis shooting had taken energy drinks and a package of pastries from a nearby convenience store, Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters. He said that the man was “acting erratically, walking back and forth, up and down the street.”

The chief said that the officers repeatedly ordered the 23-year-old man to drop the knife and drew their weapons after he refused. The chief said the man told the police: “Shoot me now. Kill me now.”

He said the two officers fired after the man moved toward one of them and came within 3 to 4 feet.

“One of the witnesses described it as a suicide by cop,” Dotson said.

Initially, there was a heavy police presence at the scene, and officers marked off the intersection with yellow tape. Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who was arrested last week during protests over the Brown killing, urged the crowd to maintain peace.

“The last thing we need is violence in our neighborhood,” he said. “And that’s not going to be on the police to make sure there’s not violence in our neighborhood, that’s going to be on us. No silliness here.”

He said that he had much more confidence in St. Louis city police than in Ferguson police, and promised to work with the department to make sure there was not a “heavy-handed response” to any protests.

In Ferguson, protesters were confronted by a government “that quickly treated them like the enemy,” French told NBC affiliate KSDK.

“I think we have a different situation here, handled much better,” he said. “This is not Ferguson.”

The police shooting of Brown on Aug. 9 in Ferguson touched off more than a week of protests and clashes between police and demonstrators. Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the National Guard in on Monday to back up the state Highway Patrol and local police, and officials said the soldiers would be on patrol again Tuesday night.

Dotson said the tensions in Ferguson were on his mind.

“I think anyone who has been watching television over the last week has to be concerned. ... I think it’s important people understand what happened,” he said.

The chief stayed on the scene after the shooting, talking to people who gathered, some of whom angrily shouted questions at him. He said police were examining video and asking anyone else with video to come forward.

Four hours later, scores of people still milled about, some with signs and some chanting. A few predicted their numbers would grow at night.

""People have nothing to lose here,"" said Marvin Nelson, 40, a construction-firm owner. ""It's going to be crowded tonight.""

""We like that people are standing up to police brutality and are going to act as a community and fight back again,"" he said.

Alex Johnson; Bill Angelucci; Mary Murray,08/19/2014,04/14/2016,"Two people were shot and police launched several rounds of tear gas late Monday night to clear the streets of Ferguson amid a tense confrontation between police and protesters, authorities said Tuesday.

Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, told CNN that two people in the crowd were hit by gunshots. He said the shots weren't fired by police.

The renewed police activity started about a half-hour after community leaders appeared to have defused a showdown between several hundred protesters and a wall of law enforcement officers 60 wide and five deep.

The protesters, some of them throwing bottles, surged forward and back as the officers held their ground. An armored vehicle began moving toward the crowd, and as clergymen and other community leaders locked arms to hold the protesters back, the crowd appeared to retreat about 10 p.m. (11 p.m. ET).

As authorities ordered media crews to retreat — saying they were provoking the crowd — police with shields and weapons drawn briefly began advancing while retreating protesters shouted at them. All through the showdown, clergymen and other community leaders waved their arms and screamed for the crowd to stand down.

A lone protester who continued struggling was grabbed by officers, briefly setting off another round of object-throwing and shouts of ""Mike Brown can't relax! Mike Brown can't move back!""

Johnson said the law enforcement response was necessary to protect officers' lives.

""We had some people that were hiding behind bushes,"" he told CNN. ""Officers can't walk towards that.""

Of the 78, all but three were arrested for refusing to disperse, the records show. Two people, both from the St. Louis area, were arrested for unlawful use of a weapon, and a man from Rockton, Illinois, was arrested for interfering with an officer.

Authorities had reported early that 31 people were arrested overnight. Authorities early Tuesday {blamed people from out of town}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-brown-protests-ferguson-hijacked-criminals-cops-n183671""> for some criminal activity.

The records reflect people who were booked into the St. Louis County jail. It is possible, but not clear, that others were booked at other jails.

The records show that 18 people from outside Missouri were arrested Monday night and early Tuesday. They came came from as far away as Brooklyn, Washington, D.C., and San Diego.

Police said that they were fired on and had Molotov cocktails thrown at them overnight. Several people who were arrested and spoke to NBC News on Tuesday, however, blamed the police for overreacting to the protesters.

One of the people arrested for refusing to disperse, Kyle Niere, 23, told NBC News by phone on Tuesday that he was dragged from his truck by law enforcement officers as he was trying to drive away from the protests.

“They drug us all out,” said Niere, who said he lives in Ferguson and was among a group of 12 people arrested. “Face-first on the ground, stepping on the back of our heads. They’re being brutal for no reason. None of us were violent. We were just there.”

Niere estimated that about 20 law enforcement officers, all from St. Louis County, descended on his truck. He said that they were protesting near the QuikTrip station, a landmark of the demonstrations, when police began firing tear gas.

He said that his group walked through a residential neighborhood to get to the truck, with the intention of driving away.

“They said that we just looked like the type that were going to stir up drama and go start looting,” said another person from the same group, Tina Hanna, 24, of the St. Louis suburb of Florissant. She said the arrests took place just after 2 a.m. CT.

Both said that they were held overnight and released. Asked why he was protesting, Niere said: “Because I think that kid was wrongfully shot,” referring to Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager who was gunned down by a Ferguson police officer Aug. 9.

Even if Brown assaulted the officer, he said, “I thought that’s why cops carry mace and non-lethal weapons.”

He said that the arrest of the officer, Darren Wilson, would stop the protests.

“I think that would completely settle everything,” he said.

Chozen Botley, 34, of the St. Louis suburb of Jennings, said that police were looking for a reason to crack down on protesters.

“There is no outside instigator,” he said. “Mike Brown is in all of us. He’s with all of us. The brutality that we face as black Americans, you can face the same brutality as a white American. I just want to let the world know that all of the stuff that’s going on in Jennings, in Ferguson — there is no outsiders because we are all one.”

The Highway Patrol is in charge of security in Ferguson, backed by the Missouri National Guard. Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson {told MSNBC on Tuesday}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/michael-brown-dad-we-need-keep-the-focus-michael-brown""> that he hoped the peaceful protesters would stay home after dark.

NBC,nbc100,http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/in-plain-sight/michael-browns-former-high-school-resumes-classes-amid-ferguson-chaos-n183576,Michael Brown's Former High School Resumes Classes Amid Ferguson Chaos,Seth Freed Wessler ,08/19/2014,04/14/2016,"Students walked into Normandy High School on Monday to begin a new school year under a heavy shadow. Nine days earlier, Michael Brown, 18, was shot and killed by a police officer in nearby Ferguson, just five miles from the school where he graduated weeks before.

“My son is 15, and I feel like he is Michael Brown,” said Renee Perry, 36, who delivered her sophomore son Pierre to Normandy on Monday morning and stood beside her daughter Alia, who graduated from the school with Brown. “Kids are confused, thinking what is going to happen, how can this happen?” Perry said as several dozen local officials, alumni and clergy gathered to cheer for the kids as they climbed out of their parents’ cars or off buses and walked through the parking lot.

“Together we can do this,” chanted James McGree, mayor of Vinita Park, one of the 24 municipalities in North St. Louis County that send students to Normandy. Arriving students, nearly all African-American, many of their faces taut, filtered past the greeting committee and into the school.

Normandy opened Monday even as the Ferguson-Florissant School District a few miles away announced it would remain closed through this week because of ongoing fears of violence on the streets. But as classes resumed at Normandy, teachers and parents looked to strike a balance between helping students focus on school and cope with grief over Brown’s death and the police crackdown that has gripped their community in recent days.

This school year at Normandy was already going to be a challenge. The district lost its state accreditation in 2012 in the wake of steadily falling revenues, plummeting graduation rates—among the lowest in the state—and excessive disciplinary actions. Students in the district, where over ninety percent of children are eligible for free meals, were allowed to leave Normandy to attend other nearby schools; hundreds did. Now, they’ve been required to return after the state department of education this year took control of the school administration and forced all teachers to reapply for their jobs. Forty percent of teachers were not asked to return.

Many parents and current teachers say they worry that the changes will rattle this already vulnerable and grieving group of teenagers. “To have the turmoil of something like the incident last Saturday, added to the first day of school with a whole lot of newness to it with new teachers when the kids step back on campus, that’s rough,” said John Kennedy, who was rehired as a physical education teacher after spending years teaching students, including Michael Brown, in the alternative “credit recovery program.”

Kennedy and three other teachers said that there was nearly no discussion in the last week of state facilitated professional development trainings about how to approach Brown’s death with students. “It was just was not the focus, education was, and it’ll be interesting to see how it needs to be addressed, especially with so many new teachers who did not know [Brown],” Kennedy said, as he set up his classroom on Saturday.

Derrick Mitchell, who began as Normandy’s principal last year, said that he’s intent on providing a space for his students that’s walled off from the chaos outside. “Our task this year is to make sure our students have access to quality education. Our job is to make sure students are college and career ready,” Mitchell said on Saturday. “We have to stop letting this other stuff overshadow. We’ll deal with it on a case by case basis, but we have to let them know the school still exists.”

Many parents of students at Normandy say the events of the last several days have sparked a pressing anxiety. “I try to keep them busy with sports, you know,” says Carl Hopkins, father of sophomore Zaria Trotter and senior Deon Trotter. “I try to shield them from it all as best I can and hopefully they’ll make the right choices. But if you’re black around here, it’s not that safe.”

Zaria said that she’s nervous about returning to school, not knowing which teachers will be back and with outstanding questions about Brown’s death. “Everyone is going to be talking about Mike. What's going to happen to the one who shot him? Why did they shoot him?”

“It was a terrible empty feeling when I heard about Mike Brown,” said Calvin Black, a maintenance worker, whose football player son Kevin, 17, is a Normandy senior. Black rested on Sunday afternoon in Kevin’s grandmothers house, just a block down the road from an old African-American cemetery where Dred Scott’s wife is buried and the gravestones are obscured by overgrown grass.

“It was a shock it was so close to my son,” Black said. “His size and being a young black man, the cops can confuse him for an adult. It could have been my son. He’s the same size as Mike Brown.”

Kevin Black says he’s been harassed by local police, in Ferguson and in other North County municipalities more times than he can count—told to put his hands up against police cars because “they said I looked like someone who was reported for a fight,” or just “pushed around.”

“I always believed in keeping my kids safe and close,” said Selonia Black, 59, Kevin’s grandmother. “He doesn’t go out, doesn't go out with friends. If he is not at football, then he’s at the gym or he’s home.”

Local mental health practitioners say that youth in Ferguson and in the Normandy school are struggling with various degrees of trauma and grief that need to be addressed.

“Our children need to find normalcy in this chaotic time that we’re in, however normalcy must acknowledge that everything about their personal and community life is not normal,” said Marva Robinson, Psy.D, head of the St. Louis chapter of the Association of Black Psychologists, who has spent several days offering free counseling to protesters and residents of the neighborhood where Brown was killed. “This event bring up their past losses, relatives and friends who have been killed before. They need to know they can get support.""

High school students have been among the crowds gathered in rallies and protests in Ferguson and Florissant. School began less than 11 hours after police shot tear gas and rubber bullets and tear gas into crowds of protesters that included many families and young children, who believed that they were safe, with three hours remaining before the police imposed midnight curfew that had been in effect in Ferguson for two nights.

Returning teachers at Normandy say they are figuring out for themselves how to help their students understand what’s happened.

Amy Blackwell, an African-American woman who is returning for her second year as a freshman English teacher, says she plans to spend the first days of class focused on Brown, reading articles from national press and talking to students about what the loss means.

Tyler Jones, who is white and started at Normandy as a Teach for America teacher four years ago, says he will address the killing, too. “I plan to do a lot of listening, and to let them guide each other some.” He’s assigning a well-known essay by the author Kiese Layman called “{How to Slowly Kill Yourself and Others in America: A Remembrance}<hyperlink=""http://gawker.com/5927452/how-to-slowly-kill-yourself-and-others-in-america-a-remembrance"">,” whose first paragraph begins, “I've had guns pulled on me by four people under Central Mississippi skies — once by a white undercover cop.”

“This is my students’ experience,” Jones said. “There’s no sense it pretending it’s not and we can’t just move past it. A lot of these kids have been beaten up by cops. Now, most of them know someone who was killed.”

Coach Terrence Hamilton, the Normandy athletic director, says that there’s nearly no student at the 98 percent African-American school who has been spared intimate knowledge about violence. “Even if they didn’t know Mike, they know,” he said, sitting in his office last weekend. “We had a kid who was pistol whipped by a police officer for no apparent reason in the parking lot of the school last year. There was no explanation for it.”

Even as teachers grapple with how to help students wrestle with Brown’s shooting, some teens said they have found purpose and community in the marches and protests that have taken place in recent days - and they are reluctant to give it up to return to a classroom.

Marlon Hampton, 18, lives just blocks from where Michael Brown was shot and knew him from the neighborhood. He attends a school that hasn’t opened yet because of concerns over violence.

Hampton, who has a head of thin dreadlocks and wears bright yellow early style Air Jordans, said that for the last several months he had stopped going outside much to avoid local cops. “I don’t want to see the police,” he said. “I get harassed. They search me, say I look like someone in a crime.”

But since Michael Brown was killed, Hampton has joined thousands from the surrounding neighborhood who regularly gather near an altar of balloons, candles and bottles of liquor that has grown on the spot where Brown was shot by a Ferguson police officer. It has become a community space like none he’s seen before in the city. “These are just neighbors, you know, people I know and people I don’t, and they came outside and I started coming outside again,” he said. “They are like family.”

Hampton says going back to school will interrupt this ritual. “I’ll be honest,” he said, “being out here like this, free to be out here, we don’t want that to stop.""

""Kids were happy to see each other,"" said English teacher Tyler Jones, after an anxious first day at Normandy. ""It was good for people to just be together. Mike Brown was on everybody's mind.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

""We plan to learn from this tragedy,"" city leaders said in a memo lamenting the ""discord and heartbreak"" that have visited the community since Brown, 18, was shot to death Aug. 9.

The statement, which was unsigned but was attributed to ""our mayor, members of the City Council and city employees,"" said the city was exploring short- and long-term responses to ""the concerns raised as a result of this devastating series of events."" Most immediately, they asked residents to stay home at night to ""allow peace to settle in, and allow for the justice process to take its course."" But they also said they were reviewing wide-ranging changes in police operations, including the use of cameras in police cars and attached to officers' vests, working to boost the number of African Americans applying to the police academy, and requiring officers to live in the city of Ferguson.

Critics of the police say that had officers been wearing cameras, much more would be known about both the shooting of Brown and about interactions between police and protesters afterward.

Alex Johnson,08/19/2014,04/14/2016,"Prosecutors expect to begin presenting preliminary evidence to a St. Louis County, Missouri, grand jury Wednesday in the police killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the start of what could be weeks of secret proceedings that could end with Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson's being charged with first-degree murder or facing no legal action at all.

Grand juries are secret, and potential defendants usually don't appear. But Ed Magee, a spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch, told NBC News that Wilson would be given an opportunity to testify. There have been calls for McCulloch to recuse himself because of his close ties to police, but Magee said McCulloch was staying on the case.

Because grand juries aren't trials, they don't follow the same procedures as criminal juries, meaning only nine of the 12 members will have to agree on whether to indict Wilson, and if so, on what charges. ""They might have things in front of them that indicate murder in the first degree, but they might decide it's less than that"" or even that Wilson shouldn't face charges at all, said Susan McGraugh, supervisor of the Criminal Defense Clinic at St. Louis University Law School. {McGraugh told NBC station KSDK of St. Louis}<hyperlink=""http://legacy.ksdk.com/media/cinematic/video/14310585/going-inside-the-grand-jury-process/""> that could take weeks — the timetable, she said, ""depends on how long it takes for tests to came back and for witnesses to be interviewed.""

1. ‘Heavy gunfire’ in Ferguson during night of unrest
An outside criminal element is being blamed on turning the earlier peaceful protest on Monday night into one of more violence. Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said Molotov cocktails were thrown and police were targeted by gunfire. Police say two people were shot and 31 were arrested — some coming from as far away as New York and California. Police were backed up overnight for the first time by National Guard troops, who were deployed to the St. Louis suburb to help quell the unrest which first boiled over in the wake of 18-year-old Michael Brown’s death at the hands of police. Meanwhile, the parents of Michael Brown appeared on the TODAY show on Tuesday and said only “justice” can restore peace to the city of Ferguson. {Read more in NEWS.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-brown-protests-ferguson-hijacked-criminals-cops-n183671"">

2. Iraqi forces help to retake key dam from militants
With the help of U.S. airstrikes, Iraqi and Kurdish fighters stopped Sunni extremists from holding the Mosul Dam — an important strategic stronghold in Iraq. The dam is the largest in Iraq and is a key source of water and electricity. But despite the success in recapturing the dam, President Barack Obama warned Iraqi leaders on Monday that “the wolf is at the door” and that it will ultimately be up to them to ensure the stability of the country. {Read more in NEWS.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/iraq-turmoil/iraqi-kurdish-forces-retake-key-dam-iraq-n183421"">

3. U.S. finishes destroying Syrian chemical weapons
The stockpile of weapons has been destroyed at sea after no countries were willing to accept the shipments of the dangerous agents. The destruction — declared a “milestone” by Secretary of State John Kerry — involved mixing the chemical weapons in sealed containers with hot water and sodium hydroxide. Syria agreed to give up its chemical arsenal last fall when President Obama threatened missile strikes in retaliation for an attack carried out by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. {Read more in NEWS.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/syria-chemical-weapons-arsenal-eliminated-aboard-mv-cape-ray-n183506"">

4. Gaza truce extended another 24 hours
The cease-fire has been renewed and is expected to end by 5 p.m. ET Tuesday. The announcement came late Monday, less than an hour before a temporary truce was set to expire in the Gaza conflict, which has killed more than 2,000 Palestinians and 67 Israelis. Palestinian and Israeli leaders have failed to see eye-to-eye. The end of the truce, meanwhile, also raises questions about Gaza’s future and whether rebuilding efforts can begin in earnest. {Read more in NEWS.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/middle-east-unrest/palestinians-agree-extend-cease-fire-talks-israel-24-hours-n183406"">

5. Pope Francis suggests a short time in papacy
After a triumphant tour of South Korea this past week, the pontiff hinted that his time as leader of the world’s more than 1.2 billion Catholics may not be a long legacy. The 77-year-old said that he might have to one day resign from the papacy, and even joked that he probably won’t live past his 80s. “I know this will last a short time, two or three years, and then to the house of the Father,” Francis said. He has revealed that he suffers from nerve problems, which he treats with a South American tea-like drink. Meanwhile, the pope tweeted that he hopes to visit Asia again soon. {Read more in NEWS.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pope-francis-i-could-quit-benedict-or-even-die-2017-n183721"">

It has now raised over $15.6 million from July 29 through Monday, the ALS Association told NBC News.

7. The iconic voice of ‘Saturday Night Live’ silenced
Don Pardo, who started as the announcer of the sketch comedy show when it first premiered in 1975, has died at age 96. His long career included stints lending his legendary voice to “The Price is Right,” Jeopardy!” and “NBC Nightly News.” Pardo was a staple of “Saturday Night Live,” having only missed one season and more recently, two episodes in 2013 because of a broken hip. {Read more in POP CULTURE.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/don-pardo-saturday-night-live-announcer-dies-96-n183661"">

Alex Johnson,08/19/2014,04/14/2016,"Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon won't remove the controversial county prosecutor from the investigation of the police killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, Nixon said Tuesday — although he was quick to point out how easy it would be for the prosecutor to step aside.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley and other community leaders have called for the state to remove County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch, whose ""past has been suspect to the African-American community, quite frankly,"" {Dooley said Tuesday on MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show.""}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/watch/prosecutor-credibility-marred-by-mistrust-319346243684""> Nixon said in a statement that while he wasn't asking McCulloch to stand aside, ""there is a well-established process by which prosecutors can recuse themselves — a process Nixon said he didn't want to veer from ""and potentially jeopardize the prosecution.""

McCulloch has no intention of stepping aside, his spokesman said Tuesday, and a county grand jury is {scheduled to begin hearing evidence}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/grand-jury-hear-michael-brown-evidence-wednesday-n184486""> in the case Wednesday.

Further complicating the pain and loss in this tragedy is the fact that the killer of your son is alive, known, and currently free. In fact, he is on paid administrative leave. Your own feelings will bounce between sorrow and anger. Even when you don’t want to think about it because it is so much to bear, you will be forced to by merely turning on your television or answering your cell phone. You may find yourselves pulled in many different directions by strangers who may be well-wishers or detractors. Your circle will necessarily close tighter because the trust you once, if ever, you had in “the system” and their agents are forever changed. Your lives are forever changed.
Trayvon Martin, 17, who was black, was shot and killed in February 2012 during an altercation in a gated community of Sanford, Florida. The shooter, George Zimmerman, who is of white and Hispanic descent, said that he was acting in self-defense and was acquitted of second-degree murder. The case touched off a national debate about race and guns.
