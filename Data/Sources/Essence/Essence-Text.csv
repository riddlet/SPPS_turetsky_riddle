Essence,ess1,http://www.essence.com/2014/08/12/how-media-missed-mark-coverage-michael-brown%E2%80%99s-killing,How the Media Missed the Mark in Coverage of Michael Brown’s Killing,Nikole Hannah-Jones,08/12/2014,05/04/2016,"On Saturday, August 9, the national media began to report on an unarmed black teenager killed by the police in Ferguson, Mo., a small, predominately Black suburban St. Louis town. Michael Brown was an 18-year-old shot down two days before he was supposed to start college. The police officer who killed him is {part of a law enforcement agency currently being investigated}<hyperlink=”http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/naacp-files-civil-rights-complaint-against-st-louis-county-police/article_5e3ddfee-b883-55a1-bf08-948f74c96e47.html”> for civil rights violations. It’s the type of story the media should devour.

Yet by Monday morning, the national coverage was dominated not by hard-hitting reporting of how a weaponless young man walking down the street could be shot multiple times by law enforcement, but of scenes of Black residents looting items from store shelves and a burned-out convenience store set aflame by rioters in response to the teen’s killing.

The coverage since Monday has obsessed about the rioting. Nearly every story I saw about Brown’s death yesterday led with unidentified Black men and women grabbing loot, not with photos or video of Brown or his grieving family, or of the peaceful protests outside the Ferguson law enforcement building.

As a journalist, I get it. The images of the rioting were gripping. But coverage of the riots should not overshadow the cause of the riots. The real story has taken a backseat to the sensational.

A young Black man lost his life in a confrontation with police under very controversial circumstances. Ferguson is policed by a {nearly all-White police force}<hyperlink=”http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-missouri-shooting-idUSKBN0GA0Q420140812”>. This context has been missing in too many of these stories. And in the eyes of many people commenting on social media, this type of reporting has rendered the destruction of property more important than the destruction of Black life.

Our nation has long history of riots in impoverished Black communities after instances of perceived police brutality and misconduct. It also has a long history of mainstream media sensationalizing them. In 1968, {the Kerner Commission}<hyperlink=”http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6545/”>, a panel convened by President Lyndon B. Johnson to study the causes of three years of urban riots, released its report. It called out mainstream media’s role in stirring the flames:
""We have found a significant imbalance between what actually happened in our cities and what the newspaper, radio and television coverage of the riots told us happened,"" the commission wrote. The media ‘sensationalized the disturbances, consistently overplaying violence and giving disproportionate amounts of time to emotional events.’

Many of the inaccuracies of fact, tone and mood were due to the failure of reporters and editors to ask tough enough questions about official reports, and to apply the most rigorous standards possible in evaluating and presenting the news. Reporters and editors must be sure that descriptions and pictures of violence, and emotional or inflammatory sequences or articles, even though ‘true’ in isolation, are really representative and do not convey an impression at odds with the overall reality of events.’”
Forty-six years later, we are repeating those mistakes. 

The reporting thus far has offered no tallies of the destruction. We don’t know how many businesses were destroyed or looted, whether the destruction was limited or widespread. Were most of the Ferguson protestors participating, or just a few? Facts are always critical in reporting, but even more so in stories so rife with racial tension.

The anger in Ferguson is fueled by rumors that Brown was shot in the face, in the back, and that he’d had his hands raised in the air when law enforcement opened fire. Yet somehow, with all the national reporters on the ground in Ferguson covering the vandalism and looting, we still do not know basic facts about how this recent high school graduate ended up dead at the hands of police. We still do not know the name of the officer who killed Brown. We still don’t know why police stopped Brown in the first place. We don’t even know how many times the teen was shot.

What we have gotten, largely is the official police version of what happened: There was a confrontation, Brown tried to grab an officers gun, a shot was fired in the police car, Brown ran and a police officer shot him, according to St. Louis Police Chief Jon Belmar, {“more than a couple of times.” }<hyperlink=”http://newsnyork.com/st-louis-police-chief-says-fight-over-cops-gun-led-to-fatal-shooting-of-unarmed-teen/”> The reliance on law enforcement to provide the official record of a shooting it was involved in is highly problematic. Over and over again, we’ve seen the first reports on police shootings contain errors or just be plain wrong. For instance, in the July death of Eric Garner in New York, {an internal police report did not mention the chokehold used on Garner and said that Garner was not in “great distress.” }<hyperlink=”http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-internal-nypd-report-staten-island-dad-not-mention-chokehold-article-1.1875221”> Video of the incident, which surfaced after police wrote the report, showed not only officers using a chokehold, but Garner yelling that he couldn’t breathe before going completely still. 

Good reporting could deepen the sense of injustice felt in Ferguson and across the nation, or could explain that which at this point makes no sense. 

The shooting happened in a street in the daytime. There is also cell phone video. Good reporters are adept at getting law enforcement to talk off the record. The coroner should have examined Brown’s body by now. There are witnesses. This morning, {MSNBC published}<hyperlink=”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”> a devastating interview with the friend who was with Brown at the time. 

If the media weren’t so focused on images of lawlessness, we’d know more about this case. Far more important than the spontaneous outbursts of angry people is the potential story of official misconduct and racially biased policing that ended in a death. Reporters should be demanding answers. A kid lost his life. What story is more important than that?",0,NA,NA,NA

Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said the shooting occurred as her son walked to his grandmother’s house. A witness said she saw an officer trying to place Brown into a squad car. The teen then attempted to flee, at which point the officer shot him as he ran.

Williams,08/19/2014,05/04/2016,"Janaye Ingram, acting executive director of the National Action Network, spoke to ESSENCE.com about how civilians around the country can get involved in the movement happening in Ferguson.

Donate money to Mike Brown’s family. “The family is accepting donations at {http://www.gofundme.com/justiceformikebrown}<hyperlink=”https://www.gofundme.com/justiceformikebrown”>. What they’re facing, in pursuit of justice for their son, is going to take a toll on their finances. They’ll have to be out of work when (and I’m going to say “when”) this officer goes to trial. We absolutely should lift up the family during this time.”

Send medical supplies to Ferguson for the protestors on the ground. “We’re seeing a lot of images of police using tear gas on civilians. The people who are standing in protest will need medical care—maybe not a hospital visit, but some way to treat themselves. For instance, people are using milk to help deal with the tear gas. People can send medical supplies to the church where NAN is operating.”

3. Organize a protest in your own community. “We know people have jobs and can’t travel for a variety of reasons. But they can show solidarity by organizing peaceful protests in their own communities.”

4. Stay involved on social media. “There are a lot of images coming out of Ferguson. Continue to post them, along with news articles, to show people that this is an ongoing issue. Not everyone wakes up and turns on the news—they tap into social media first. It’s a way to keep people informed even though we all can’t be there.”
5. Train people in your neighborhood on how to interact with police. “Mike Brown and a lot of other cases, including Eric Garner, have shown us that even if you think you’re doing the right thing, it can be interpreted as something totally different. How should people respond? There should be some engagement with law enforcement. Figure out if there’s a community outreach representative in the police department that can engage and help deal with racial profiling and inherent bias. We shouldn’t just wait until the next incident happens to start having those conversations.”",0,NA,NA,NA

During his career, he experienced firsthand the racial tensions that exist between law enforcement officers and the Black communities they serve. In 1995, Leader co-founded 100 Blacks In Law Enforcement Who Care, as a way to give back to the neighborhoods he felt were being abused and misguided. Here, we talk to Leader about police brutality and what this country must do to improve relations between African-Americans and the police.

ESSENCE.com: What are your thoughts on the Mike Brown and Eric Garner cases? 

NOEL LEADER: In both cases, the police violated what is supposed to be our number one priority—the preservation of human life. Unfortunately, in the case of Mike Brown we don’t know too much, but the community’s response is an indication that they really believe this was unjustified. Fortunately, in the Eric Garner case we have a video of the police using a chokehold—an unlawful tactic and a direct violation of the New York Police Department guidelines—and are able to see exactly what happened. Had it not been for videotape, the official police explanation probably would have read: “There was an attempt to make an arrest, the individual resisted, and he succumbed to previous medical problems, i.e. asthma, heart attack, etc.”

ESSENCE.com: What needs to happen in federal law to forbid situations like these from happening again? 

LEADER: The primary thing that has to happen is for these officers to get prosecuted. You have to send a message that excessive force will not be tolerated. The government needs to not only take them to trial, but to convict and to sentence them when it is apparent that they have violated the primary objective of each police agency—to preserve human life. 

ESSENCE.com: The scene in Ferguson looks like a war zone. We’ve seen images of police in military body armor, armed with rifles, riding around in armored vehicles, using tear gas, etc. Do you think that police squads have become militarized? 

LEADER: I don’t think they have, I know they have.... The response of these public servants to a civilian population is preposterous. 

ESSENCE.com: What are your thoughts on the overall relationship between the Black community and police? 

LEADER: The problem isn’t with the Black community; the problem is with the police force and their treatment of the Black community. People don’t hate police if they do their job and save civilians from harm. The problem begins when officers aren’t public servants, but become an occupying force. They become disrespectful, abusive—that’s what the community hates. Officers who act that way need to be terminated. Police departments also need to reflect their community. In Ferguson the community is 65 percent Black and the police department only has three Black police officers. That shouldn’t be tolerated.

ESSENCE.com: How has 100 Blacks In Law Enforcement Who Care worked to repair that relationship?

LEADER: It was important for the people to hear from Black police officers. We often feel the same way as our community, because we still have family members who are or could be subjected to police mistreatment. So we work in Black neighborhoods to get criminals off the street. We hold workshops to teach youth how to react when they’re pulled over or detained by police. We also try to get the facts out to the public when we know they’re being fed misinformation about high-profile cases. Every person is a potential juror.

ESSENCE.com: What will it take to end the unrest in Ferguson?

LEADER: Justice. If you have justice, then you’ll have peace. If you want this to stop, give the people justice.",0,NA,NA,NA

Johnson is the closest witness to the altercation between Brown and an officer that led to the 18-year-old’s shooting death down just two days before he was to start college.

Johnson said he and Brown told the police officer, whose name has not been released, that they were close to their destination and then attempted to continue toward Johnson’s apartment nearby.  

By Johnson’s account, the officer then reversed his car toward them asking them to repeat what they said while pushing his car door open.  He then grabbed Brown by the neck and the two engaged in a “tug of war,” which Johnson claims consisted of the officer pulling on Brown’s shirt as Brown attempted to pull away. 

It was then that Johnson saw the officer pull out his gun and shoot Brown in his right side. He then released Brown who took off running along with Johnson, who managed to duck behind a row of cars before seeing Brown get shot a second time in the back. 

Johnson said Brown stopped running, turned around with his hands up in the air and said, ‘I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!’ However, the officer still shot Brown several more times.

“After seeing my friend get gunned down, my body just ran,” said Johnson, who retreated to his apartment following Brown’s killing.

Johnson said he returned to the scene five minutes later and saw Brown dead in the middle of the street surrounded by a growing crowd of neighbors who were shouting and taking photos with their cell phones.

Johnson’s eyewitness account is crucial in an investigation where no police car dash camera was used, and one involved party cannot defend himself because he is dead. But according to Johnson’s attorney, former mayor of St. Louis, Freeman Bosley, Jr., the Ferguson police have declined Johnson’s offer to speak to them.

The FBI is assisting in the investigation and looking into possible civil rights violations in the shooting of Brown. ",0,NA,NA,NA

But before she passes the baton, she is working on some unfinished business.  To accomplish this, she is using the help of alumni.
 
This summer, Tatum and her team completed a 10-year fundraising campaign. Back in 2004, Tatum set a goal to reach $150 million. But over the course of the campaign, she surpassed that goal, reaching a fundraising milestone of $157.8 million.
 
But more than the amount of money raised, Tatum stressed the support of the people closest to the school — the alumni. This year, over 7,000 alumni made a contribution.
 
“Whatever it is they’re doing, alumni are path-breaking,” Tatum said. “They are really demonstrating that the confidence and the empowerment that comes from the HBCU education they received at Spelman has served them well and continues to serve the community well. But at the same time, if those graduates leave and then don’t reinvest, the institution can’t thrive.”
 
Tatum said a $17 million gift to the Spelman endowment has gone toward funding the Center for Global Education. It is Tatum’s goal to have every single Spelman student to have an international experience before she graduates. Before the funding, only 50-70 students had access to that opportunity. Now, more than 400 students have taken advantage of travel abroad.
                    
Improving the institution’s curriculum and maintaining the legacy of Spelman is central to education for students of color. “HBCUs are the preservers of African American culture and producers of innovation and creativity,” Tatum said. While she doesn’t know who will follow in her footsteps next year following her retirement, Tatum is sure of her plans. She’ll pen another book that revisits the theme of her 1997 debut, Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?
