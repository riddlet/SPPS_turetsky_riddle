Former County Police Chief Timothy Fitch was one of 15 American officials to {participate in a weeklong training in Israel}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_9b614430-5679-11e0-999b-0017a4a78c22.html""> three years ago.

The April 2011 National Counter-Terrorism Seminar (NCTS) was sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). It brought together leaders from the largest American police departments, the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with members of the Israeli National Police, Israel Defense Forces and other intelligence organizations.

""NCTS enables Israel's counterterrorism experts to share their knowledge and lessons learned, to help American law enforcement better protect America, and prevent us from having to learn the same lessons the hard way,"" an {ADL press release said}<hyperlink=""http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/israel-middle-east/american-law-enforcement-1.html#.U-3JpvldWuI"">.

A spokesperson for the police department was unable to provide information about the trip's influence on subsequent operations in the county. The ADL was unavailable for immediate comment.

Over 9,000 American officials {have trained with Israeli police and military units}<hyperlink=""http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/2178""> on responding to civilian protests and terrorism. These operations reflect failure to distinguish between the apparent duty of police to protect civilians and military responses to war. This fusion has had life-costing implications for Americans, specifically black, Muslim and Arab people.

In 2006, 92-year-old Kathryn Johnson was {shot and killed by Atlanta police}<hyperlink=""http://electronicintifada.net/content/police-training-programs-twin-us-israeli-racism/9834"">, who had participated in an exchange program with Israeli soldiers on counterterrorism and drug enforcement.

LAPD executives took a trip to Israel in 2013 to learn about drones and other surveillance mechanisms.

""We are much more alike than dis-alike,"" {said the LAPD's head IT person}<hyperlink=""http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/lapd_scopes_out_israeli_drones_big_data_solutions""> during the trip. ""As civilized nations, we are all confronted with, in many cases, the same enemy: The ever-growing threat of terrorism and other major criminal elements.""

The LAPD {added drones to its cache of equipment}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lapd-drones-federal-basement-20140624-story.html""> in May.

Israeli companies currently {expect significant growth in arms sales}<hyperlink=""http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.609919""> following the ongoing Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip.

 “After every campaign of the kind that is now taking place in Gaza, we see an increase in the number of customers from abroad,” Meprolight CEO Eli Gold said {in a Haaretz  report}<hyperlink=""http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.609919"">.

Israel's operations have {killed over 2,000 Palestinians}<hyperlink=""http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_sitrep_14_08_2014.pdf"">. The UN estimates at least 72 percent were civilians. Missiles from Palestinian factions killed three Israeli civilians and one Thai migrant worker, while 64 Israeli soldiers have died in the fighting.

The US sends $3 billion annually in military aid to Israel, while American companies like Boeing, Raytheon and Hewlett-Packard make millions more off contracts with the Israeli military.

While Israel has played a role in the militarization of US police, this trend has been an ongoing practice in American society since the 1960s and exists beyond Israel's participation. Police responses to black political action grew more militarized during the ""law and order"" mandate following the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements.

Today, surplus homeland security funding has given police departments {over $75 billion in military equipment}<hyperlink=""http://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/14/militarization-u-s-police-dragged-light-horrors-ferguson/"">.

For some, the very public repressive events this summer represent a critical moment for global awareness and action.

Ebony,ebony2,http://www.ebony.com/news-views/ferguson-whats-respectability-got-to-do-with-it-987#axzz473hQKiHU,Ferguson: What's Respectability Got to Do With It?,Josie Pickens,08/18/14,10/20/16,"I always remind myself, and those desiring to survey the history of the United States, that America is still a very young nation.  Because this is so, in many ways she behaves childishly. Regardless, one imagines that 50 years of struggle on any matter would catapult her forward-- sending her through the growing pains of puberty and moving her on towards adulthood and a certain maturity. None of us, even those like me who were raised in the South and learned racism with reading, would believe that, as a nation, we would be standing still, or even moving backwards 50 years after a movement began. What movement? And why do I say 50 years when America is over 200 years old? Eerily and disconcertingly, this summer America celebrated the 50th anniversary of {Freedom Summer}<hyperlink=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/freedomsummer/player/"">.

For those unfamiliar, Freedom Summer was a project sponsored by the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee ({SNCC}<hyperlink=""http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/sncc"">) where college students mostly from the north were recruited to travel to Mississippi and advance the struggle for civil rights there. SNCC was founded in 1960 and had been doing the work to further “free” African Americans living in the south (by securing voting rights for them, and further working to integrate their social and structural spaces) when {Robert “Bob” Moses}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/08/02/206813091/to-60s-civil-rights-hero-math-is-kids-formula-for-success""> sought to bring in mostly White students to work alongside African Americans already in the struggle in Mississippi. Moses, who many regard as the brainchild behind the project, understood that with White children would come national media coverage, concern and empathy.

He understood what {Bayard Rustin}<hyperlink=""http://rustin.org/?page_id=2""> and {Ella Baker}<hyperlink=""http://ellabakercenter.org/about/who-was-ella-baker""> also knew, which was that White survival and White safety was significantly (if not entirely) more important to this nation than Black survival and Black safety. And that what future generations like you and I would witness through photographs and early video recordings, needed to be presented in a manner that would prove African Americans deserving of what America’s forefathers regarded as inalienable human rights. 

This is the paradox and the tragedy concerning the plight of African Americans in the US. Since we somehow survived the holocaust of the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade and crawled from the belly of the ships that carried us towards the atrocities of chattel slavery, we have been trying to prove that we are deserving—deserving of respect, deserving of equality, deserving of life itself—and we have yet to convince some of our countrymen of this basic fact.

Folk are traveling to Ferguson because there is something magical about oppressed people who live their lives in certain danger, standing firmly and collectively to say enough is enough.

It matters. It matters that what we know as social protest by African Americans, comes mostly through a certain lens—a lens of respectability. The social protests that represent the various stages of the American Civil Rights Movements were meticulously organized and carefully orchestrated. The fact that many participating as social activists at that time were not only college educated, but also trained in ""freedom schools"" that taught social, economic and political aspects of the movement, has to be acknowledged. Many of the {images}<hyperlink=""http://www.newseum.org/exhibits-and-theaters/temporary-exhibits/civil-rights-at-50/freedom-summer/index.html""> we see from the Civil Rights Movement show well dressed and articulate Blacks and Whites who were taught how to interact with vicious White supremacists, and even how to face ferocious brutality with the grace and power of non-violence. 

What I hope my students today will understand, and what we all should remember as our eyes are glued to the Ferguson {live streams}<hyperlink=""http://new.livestream.com/accounts/9035483/events/3271930"">, is that what we are witnessing there is not scripted and curated. It is not a movement of polished, pressed and proper college students; instead it is a movement of {Fannie Lou Hamers}<hyperlink=""http://www.howard.edu/library/reference/guides/hamer/"">, of everyday people. In the words of Hamer, the people of Ferguson simply began to protest only to “support whatever is right, and to bring in justice where we've had so much injustice.”  Supporters and the press are traveling to Ferguson because there is something magnetic, something magical, about oppressed people, who live their lives in certain danger, standing firmly and collectively to say enough is enough.

The people of Ferguson, through their daily struggles to have their voices heard, are demonstrating what we say it means to be American. Yet there is an uncomfortable murmur from outsiders, including Black ones, about how they look, about what they are not—instead of what they are. Has the White gaze come to mean that only a certain pedigree of African Americans be public in their protest? I maintain that we have absolutely no right to ask that those on the ground in Ferguson look any particular way as they fight for their lives, and even ours. Wearing suits and speaking proper English has never proven to aid us in surviving a policeman’s or other civilian’s murderous rage.

It is time for us to put our respectability politics, and the master’s tools we’ve inherited from our oppressors, aside and fully support the people of Ferguson. While Freedom Summer, and other similarly crafted movements, were brilliant; what we are viewing in Ferguson is a raw, and beautiful revolution that has been a long time coming.",6,1300,Educator Josie Pickens explains why respectability politics has no place in examining the situation in Ferguson today,There was a giant quote thing in the middle that wasn't taken out of the text so I included it where it was.

Here's How You Can Help,Brooke Obie,08/14/14,10/20/16,"As you may have seen on the news (or more likely read on Twitter) by now, there is unrest going on. But I'm not talking about Gaza, Ukraine, Iraq or Afghanistan—I'm talking about Ferguson, Missouri.

Last Saturday, police gunned down unarmed teenaged boy, Michael Brown, 18, while he was reportedly raising his hands in surrender. Not that it should matter, Brown had {no criminal record}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/13/michael-brown-ferguson-shooting-no-criminal-background/14023731/?sf29771364=1"">. Ferguson police then left the child’s body uncovered in the street for hours, in sight of his parents and others in the community who had come out to get answers from the police and to grieve. Almost a week later, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson is still refusing to release the name of the officer who reportedly shot Brown multiple times, or Brown’s autopsy. But that isn’t the worst of it. 

Saturday night, when mourners in the community came out to hold a candle light vigil for Brown, they were met with Ferguson police dogs, tear gas, armored police cars and police dressed in full riot gear. After police agitation, the peaceful vigil descended into chaos as frustrated, angry, heartbroken and desperate citizens looted the Quik Trip gas station and other stores, and for the past six days, the local police have been at war with the residents they are supposed to be serving and protecting. 

The police who have shown up and disrupted seemingly lawful and peaceful protests came fully equipped to do battle in a war zone, wearing every kind of camouflage available and pointing their automatic rifles at citizens. According to news reports, they’ve fired {steel bullets coated in rubber}<hyperlink=""http://pic.twitter.com/YIaNMuvdf5""> into crowds as well as smoke bombs and tear gas at people who were simply standing in their own front yard. Witnesses say police have confiscated footage from the shooting of Mike Brown and cell phone footage of police brutality during the protests.

Needless to say, it is an unconstitutional disaster in Ferguson and Missouri Governor Jay Dixon, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles have failed to contain the militarized, disproportionately responding police force. 
It is easy to feel completely helpless in times like these but we must remember those brave people who came before us and fought and died for the rights that are currently being violated in Ferguson and all over the country. Here are 5 easy things we can do to show solidarity with the people of Ferguson and to help ensure no more tragedies occur. 

1) Attend Tonight’s National Moment of Silence event in your city. Activist Feminista Jones is heading up a National Moment of Silence for Mike Brown tonight at 7 p.m. Eastern. Find a NMOS event in your city {here}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/search/more/?q=national%20moment%20of%20silence%202014&sid=0.9913936713710427""> and follow the hashtag #NMOS14 on Twitter for live updates.

If you want to hold your own event or protest against police brutality or vigil for Mike Brown and all who have lost their lives to police brutality, check out the Dream Defenders’ {great tips}<hyperlink=""https://storify.com/Dreamdefenders/tips-for-remember-when-planning-an-action?utm_content=storify-pingback&utm_medium=sfy.co-twitter&awesm=sfy.co_ipir&utm_source=t.co&utm_campaign=""> for organizing an action and protecting yourself and fellow protestors.  If you have been personally impacted by the killing of Michael Brown or the events that have transpired in Ferguson since, St. Louis County is providing mental health support today from 3-7 p.m. in the Epworth CGM Building, 7520 Natural Bridge Road. You can also call the STL County Youth Connection Helpline 314-628-2929 to speak to a mental health professional 24/7.

2) Put pressure on the Ferguson and St. Louis County Police Departments. The Ad Hoc Committee for Justice on Michael Brown has a {few simple demands}<hyperlink=""http://pic.twitter.com/N4zngeDNLq""> for the Ferguson Police Department, the most immediate of which are to identify officer who killed Mike Brown, arrest him and charge him with murder. The Ferguson Police Department and St. Louis County Police are doing unspeakable and unconstitutional acts knowing that the world is watching them. Can you imagine what they might do if no one was watching? You can put pressure on them by calling the Ferguson Police Department at (314) 522-3100. Twitter has also been a tremendous asset in letting the world see and hear what’s been going on in Ferguson since Saturday, since members of the media has largely been shut out, harassed and arrested. Tweet the St. Louis County Police Department @{STLCountyPD}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/stlcountypd""> to demand #JusticeforMikeBrown.

3) Help those protestors who have been jailed. Organize Missouri has started a jail bail fund to help protestors and citizen journalists who have been jailed. They are asking lawyers and others who wish to volunteer to help these citizens to email them at join@organizemo.org, and those who wish to donate to the bail fund can visit their secure webpage: {https://secure.piryx.com/donate/mS25KFCe/MORE/mikebrown}<hyperlink=""https://secure.piryx.com/donate/mS25KFCe/MORE/mikebrown"">. If you have been arrested, you can call 314-862-2249 to get in touch with Organize Missouri’s jail support team who will advocate for you. The Missouri ACLU can also be reached at 314-652-3111.

4) Put pressure on national leaders to end state-sanctioned police violence. It's been reported that {every 28 hours}<hyperlink=""http://mxgm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Operation-Ghetto-Storm.pdf""> a Black person is killed by a member of law enforcement. Mike Brown wasn't the first in August and wasn't even the last one this week. There is a Change.org {petition}<hyperlink=""http://www.change.org/petitions/president-barack-obama-please-enact-new-federal-laws-to-protect-citizens-from-police-violence-and-misconduct?utm_campaign=new_signature&utm_medium=email&utm_source=signature_receipt#share""> being circulated calling on President Obama and Congress to enact federal laws that would make it a federal offense for police to kill an unarmed citizen with no arrest warrant for a violent offense. The petition also calls for a federal ban on police choke holds, like the officer who killed Eric Garner in New York used so recently. Finally, the petition calls for all police officers to wear forward-facing cameras while on duty, an unpaid suspension for any officer being investigated for these crimes and a mandatory minimum sentence for convictions. So far, the petition has garnered nearly 100,000 signatures, and you can help put pressure on national leaders to stop these out-of-control attacks on Black bodies. 

5) Follow locals on Twitter for more. These are just some ways you can help locals in Ferguson from outside of the St. Louis area, but as their needs grow and change, follow locals who have been reporting on what’s going on in their community from the beginning, like @AntonioFrench, @Nettaaaaaaaa, @Vandalyzm, and @tefpoe, as well as the #Ferguson hashtag.",3,3800,"Brooke Obie offers 5 ways you can show solidarity with the #JusticeForMikeBrown movement and the other people of Ferguson, Missouri who are under attack",NA

Drake Joins Ice Bucket Challenge in Support of ALS Awareness

There’s a new challenge taking off on social media and becoming increasingly popular among celebrities in particular—it’s called the Ice Bucket Challenge. The goal is to raise awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig’s disease, by—you guessed it—recording yourself having a bucket of freezing ice cold water dumped on you and posting it on a social platform. Participants also have to call out a friend to partake in the challenge or donate at least 100 bucks. Well, with the help of Lil Wayne, Drake just joined the likes of LeBron James, Kevin Hart, Chris Brown, and Weezy himself (plus many more) in getting frozen to near-death during the Drake vs. Lil Wayne tour stop in Pittsburgh last night.

Tyrese Angers Twitter Followers with Mike Brown Tweets

Known for getting his T.D. Jakes on when it comes to his social sites, Tyrese is another celebrity who’s been vocal about the shooting death of Michael Brown. But his sentiments rubbed Twitter-heads the wrong way when he went on a rant pointing out the almost non-existent nature of protests or national news stories concerning the alarming rate of Black on Black crime in America. Of course, his followers saw this as a deflection from the cold-blooded slaying of Mike Brown and the issue of police brutality against Black men in general, thus the dragging began. But whether you agree with his words or not, we need to fight for the end of mistreatment and the murdering of all our people by any means.

Ebony,ebony5,http://www.ebony.com/news-views/will-a-federal-investigation-provide-justice-for-mike-brown-043#axzz473hQKiHU,Will a Federal Investigation Provide 'Justice for Mike Brown?',Susana Morris,08/15/14,10/20/16,"In the wake of the murder of Mike Brown, an unarmed Black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, leaders, from the Reverend Al Sharpton to the U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, have called for a federal investigation into the circumstances of Brown’s death. But will an investigation bring justice for Mike Brown, his grieving loved ones, and the citizens of Ferguson who have been under siege by their own police force?

{Lisa Bloom}<hyperlink=""http://lisabloom.com/site/about-lisa/"">, a civil rights lawyer who practices law in Los Angeles and is the author of {Suspicion Nation: The Inside Story of the Trayvon Martin Injustice and Why We Continue to Repeat It}<hyperlink=""http://lisabloom.com/site/suspicion-nation/"">, believes that a federal investigation is warranted. She notes that, “the Federal government needs to take the lead, move immediately, and really aggressively investigate” the events of Brown’s death in Ferguson.

Currently, the St. Louis County Police Department, along with the FBI and civil rights attorneys from the Justice Department are {conducting parallel investigations}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-police-shooting-08132014-story.html""> into Brown’s murder.

Nevertheless, Bloom is less than optimistic about the possible results of a federal investigation. She notes that there was a federal investigation for Oscar Grant’s murder, which has lead nowhere. Likewise, the federal government has been investigating the Zimmerman case—another instance of a stalled federal case that has brought neither justice nor closure.

Considering the history of racial discrimination in our courts, some might argue that looking for justice in our legal system is too much to ask. “There is no question that our criminal justice system is, unfortunately, filled with racial bias and is perhaps the most racist institution in America. I don’t think a lot has changed when it comes to the widespread characterization of Black men as criminals,” says Bloom.

So, in short, a federal investigation will likely not be a panacea that solves all of the complex issues that incited Mike Brown’s tragic death and the ensuing civil unrest.

If we concede that a federal investigation may do little more than a cursory look at the circumstances of Mike Brown’s death, what might be our other options?  Bloom advises that “we don’t need more studies, we need more action.” She suggests that we can enact other measures to combat police brutality. She suggests that, for one, “we need more diversity in our police departments and more Black prosecutors. Only 5% of prosecutors are Black.” However, diversity is not enough, because as Bloom warns, research reveals Black and Brown officers can also behave in biased ways towards other people of color. Retraining law enforcement, even those of color, to disassociate criminality with Blackness is key, Bloom argues.

Mike Brown’s murder in Ferguson bears eerie similarities to other recent instances of police and vigilante brutality against Black people, including the deaths of Travyon Martin, Jordan Davis, Renisha McBride, Islan Nettles, John Crawford, Eric Garner, and Ezell Ford, just to name a few. It is this incessant and seemingly endless stream of violence that has many recalling the violence that preceded and accompanied the civil rights movement of the 20th century. As Bloom notes, “The analogy between Trayvon Martin and Emmett Till is sadly appropriate.”

Bloom also believes that the “utter lack of transparency” on the part of law enforcement has rightfully sparked distrust, as “secrecy generates suspicion.” The peaceful protests and civil unrest in Ferguson should be then no surprise. Bloom further wonders why the burden to be transparent is on the citizenry and not also on the police. She insists that while the residents of Ferguson should be peacefully protesting in the street and demanding change, it is the elected and appointed leadership that should be stepping up to address issues and being accountable to their constituents.

LOUIS IS BURNING (And It's Been a Long Time Coming),Lisa Bonner,08/14/14,10/20/16,"Where is Ferguson?” As a native St. Louisian, I've been asked that question many times this week as the world watches White cops unleash tear gas and rubber bullets on Black  citizens, marching toward the unarmed crowd in full riot gear for the fourth night in a row.  This is the aftermath of the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black  teen, in a city where disenfranchised Blacks have had enough of the institutional racism that permeates one of the country's largest metropolitan areas.

Ferguson is part of the same St. Louis that is home to {nine Fortune 500 Companies}<hyperlink=""http://fortune.com/fortune500/2013/wal-mart-stores-inc-1/"">, three major sports teams, and one major brewery. The country’s 19th most populous metropolitan area, St. Louis has an economy {larger than some first world nations}<hyperlink=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_Census"">, but the economic and resulting political power is held primarily in the hands of the Whites and rarely trickles down to its Black  citizens.
The St. Louis metropolitan area is comprised of 94 municipalities that define the St. Louis we all know, the city that gave us such cultural icons as Josephine Baker, Maya Angelou, Tina Turner and Miles Davis. It is my hometown, “Tha Lou” as we call it, and it is burning.  As I sit watching, feeling helpless 900 miles away, I witness the town that shaped me, unravel with social unrest. And the sad thing is that I, and most St. Louisians, know exactly why.

We St. Louisians have our own language. When we meet each other, the first question we invariably ask is, “Where did you go to high school?” That is St. Louis speak for “Where did you grow up?” or more importantly “How did you grow up?” Were you likely to graduate? Were you likely to leave St. Louis? What about becoming a geographical statistic? Just ask someone from St. Louis that “high school” question, and we’ll “know.” In St. Louis, generally speaking, where you were raised within our city and county limits speaks volumes about your past and can often predict your future.

St. Louis was one of the destination cities populated during the Second Great Migration from the 1940s-1970’s that brought many of our ancestors to cities north of the Mason Dixon line in search of better jobs. As our parents moved into cities such as Detroit, Philadelphia, and New York, many of these cities fell victim to suburbanization, as Whites began to flee the cities heading for the suburbs, and St Louis was no exception.

When the Whites fled the city of St. Louis, some established restrictive zoning laws in their new residential municipalities that were designed to keep Black s out. Whites benefited from economic advantages in these new neighborhoods, such as school districts funded by homeowner’s tax dollars, while the neighborhoods they left behind suffered the loss of those tax dollars and a crumbling infrastructure. Between 1960 and 1970, {34 percent of St. Louis’s White residents moved out of St. Louis City}<hyperlink=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/185/4153/757"">.  That economic downturn caused a Black  flight, taking an overall toll on St. Louis city as a whole. Between 1950 and 2010, St. Louis lost 62.7% of its population. As Blacks began moving into neighboring suburbs in search of better economic circumstances, Whites fled once again, this time scrambling to suburbs as far away as 50 miles from the city and county. This second White flight further segregated the races and kept Blacks away from the jobs and money needed to sustain thriving communities. 

This is what happened in Ferguson, a tiny municipality in St. Louis. Before the 1980’s, Ferguson, which is still home to the Fortune 500 company Emerson Electric, was 85% White. When Whites fled the city heading to Ferguson, Blacks eventually followed—then the White flight began The result: Ferguson now has a population that is two thirds Black  but the governing power is held by Whites who have made Ferguson, and many St. Louis municipalities that mirror that same demographic and migration pattern, into their own little fiefdom, dictating who, for example, they stop (the Michael Browns of the community) and who they choose to protect (the police officer that shot him). Ferguson has a White mayor, a White police chief, 50 of its 53 police officers are White, and {only one of the six seats on the school board is held by a Black  person}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-shooting-20140811-story.html"">. The result: rampant racial profiling, higher arrest rates and {lower graduation rates than its White neighbors}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf"">. 

Which brings me back to the high school question. Ferguson, where Brown’s grandmother lived, is two-thirds Black, {a quarter of its residents live below the poverty level}<hyperlink=""http://www.sunherald.com/2014/08/11/5740443/a-look-at-town-where-police-shot.html"">, has a school district on the verge of {losing state accreditation}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2013/08/23/will-your-school-district-lose-its-accreditation/""> and a graduation rate of only 69.8%.  In neighboring Normandy, the city where Brown graduated high school, is 70% Black , with a {median household income of $21,316.00}<hyperlink=""http://www.city-data.com/city/Normandy-Missouri.html"">, and a {graduation rate only slightly better than 50%}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/graduation-rates-for-area-districts-in-missouri/article_89d3721b-4f52-5810-a9ed-f90f7cbe7d42.html"">. Contrast that to {Clayton, Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.claytonmo.gov/Business/Economic_Development/Demographics.htm"">, whose population is less than one percent Black , has a median household income of $89,316.00 and a {graduation rate of a staggering 98.5%}<hyperlink=""http://www.claytonmo.gov/Business/Economic_Development/Demographics.htm"">. Simply put, in 2014, the largely Black population of St. Louis doesn’t live in or have equal access to the educational and economic opportunities afforded to our White neighbors.

What’s plaguing St. Louis, as dictated by the high school/geographical game, is sadly just a simplified reflection of what’s going on across our country as a whole; segregation and Black disenfranchisement still exist, we just don’t call it Jim Crow anymore. As members of the media struggle to blame the ""rioters"" for the unrest this week–unrest that has been increased by the militaristic actions of local police–those of us from there know that the tension has been bubbling for a long time. The death of Michael Brown has made the trouble with St. Louis impossible to ignore, but it's certainly nothing new.

Due to Congressional resistance, the Constitution and world events Obama can’t fix the economy, rescue public schools and give everybody 40 acres and a mule either. But he can certainly sure do much more than the statement he gave on violence in Ferguson Missouri this afternoon. It is painfully apparent, for those who still hold out hope, that President Barack Obama will never use the full power and influence of his office to come to the aid of African Americans while he is president.  

This is the point where eyes roll and anger rises as many supporters of President Obama point out the historic levels of resistance he faces from Congress, and crazy Tea Partiers–let alone the GOP and fellow Democrats. But the resistance to one’s efforts is not freedom from accountability for results. After 5 days of civil unrest, police brutality and civil liberties violations blatant enough to make Palestinians blink, the President finally made a statement about the death of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

He offered nothing.

Not one solid policy solution that would mitigate the crisis on the ground, or lesson the likelihood of similar crimes happening in the future. And there are solutions President Obama could bring to the table, he simply chooses not to.

The president could have proposed restrictions on the 1033 Program that allows local police departments to get {free military surplus with little or no oversight}<hyperlink=""http://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537"">. Cops in Ferguson have rubber bullets, tear gas, and tanks for free from the federal government, but they didn’t want to spend extra money on dash cams or body cams for local cops. Police cameras are much more essential to effective policing than tear gas. This program is the equivalent of giving away free donuts but charging 10 bucks for an apple.

He could have ended the FAA no fly zone above Ferguson to make it easier for journalists to observe and report on the action on the ground without putting themselves in harm’s way. These are just two of dozens of policy actions that could be taken with the flick of a pen and an executive order, with no obstruction from Congress. Instead, in the wake of race riots we got boilerplate from the first African American president of the United States.

President Obama used to have an excuse for his milquetoast support of African Americans when the rubber hit the road. He has to be president of “All of America” was the mantra. He was in his first term everyone argued, he can’t get all “Blackity Black” right now. When Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012 the same chorus screamed, “He’s running for re-election, he can’t get too involved right now.""

But Mr. Obama has been re-elected, his job is safe, his legacy is his to make, and he’s been willing to go out of his way in creating executive orders to support gay marriage, and address Latino American concerns about the border. Meanwhile, African Americans, the constituency that voted for him upwards of 94% in both elections is getting killed at a rate of {once every 28 hours}<hyperlink=""http://www.occupy.com/article/black-man-killed-us-every-28-hours-police""> and he’s got nothing.

What about Eric Holder? There are many who believe ({especially on the Right}<hyperlink=""http://www.vdare.com/articles/j-christian-adams-s-injustice-the-racial-agenda-of-the-obama-justice-department-turns-out-t"">) that President Obama does most of his most powerful racial work through his crusading Attorney General. This argument holds that the AG is essentially Holder is {Obama’s anger translator}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX8tL3PMj7o"">, the Batman to his Bruce Wayne persona that has to stay clear and free from the racial underbelly of this country in order to get things done. There is some truth to this, and clearly Eric Holder’s comments about race, and aggressive efforts on behalf of voting rights, racial discrimination and immigration are reflections of President Obama’s beliefs on some levels.

However, Americans didn’t elect Eric Holder. They elected Barack Obama. Obama was elected to not only advance policies from the White House but express symbolic and powerful messages about power, race, class and justice. The very things Obama spoke about when he ran for president in 2008. As nice as some of Holder’s activities have been, there are some jobs only a president can do. When the L.A. riots happened in 1992 the nation wanted strong words from George Bush, {not Housing Secretary Jack Kemp}<hyperlink=""http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-05-05/news/1992126127_1_verdict-pure-and-simple-tinderbox"">. When Southern Black churches were being bombed in 1996, the nation wanted to hear from Bill Clinton, not {Attorney General Janet Reno}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/churches/reaction.htm"">. The idea that in the wake of race riots and police holding a city hostage that the nation should be comforted by the behind the scenes efforts of Eric Holder rather than the President of the United States-the first Black president, at that-is absurd.

President Obama has always had an amazing sense of history, and when the time is right and of his choosing he can deliver some dynamic words to match the magnitude of the moment. Speaking at the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, he spoke of his life being the result of 50 years of struggle. Yet somehow during the week that marks the 49thanniversary of the Watts riots in Los Angeles, this president, this man of the moment and great historian utterly fails to see how his own inaction and lack leadership is a shameful abdication of presidential power that he cannot recover from.

Barack Obama’s legacy with African Americans will not be judged by what he couldn’t accomplish. It will not be judged by cute photo ops and rap references. It will be judged by when the power of his office, in both symbol and policy collided with critical moments in the history of this nation. Would he embrace all of his power and ability, as a president and a self chosen African American man, or would he duck, blink and defer to the very process that he has claimed is already broken. We have our answer. Not from Rev. Wright, not from Skip Gates, not from Shirley Sherrod and not even from Trayvon Martin.

When an entire town of American citizens who happened to be black are being held hostage like they’re in occupied territory he had nothing to say about race, justice and no solutions. In another 50 years no one will look at this moment of his presidency with pride. It be remembered as the day President Obama finally repudiated his contract with Black America, and no amount of post hoc volunteerism from My Brother’s Keeper will make up for it.",10,930,[OPINION] Dr. Jason Johnson says the notion that President Obama can't get 'too Black' has allowed us to stop holding him accountable to Black Americans,NA
Ebony,ebony8,http://www.ebony.com/news-views/dear-michael-brown-morehouse-brother-987#axzz473hQKiHU,"Dear Michael Brown, Morehouse Brother",Marc Lamont Hill,08/18/14,10/20/16,"August 15, 2014
 
Michael Brown, Our Morehouse Brother,

As we begin a new academic year at Morehouse College, we are in memory of Michael Brown. Michael, a young Black man who could easily have been enrolled in our college classes – who looked like us, who is us – was gunned down in Ferguson, Missouri two weeks before beginning his college career. The instance of violence visited on Michael is not unique in the experiences of Black men and boys, college bound or not.  The killing in Ferguson signifies a gross historical reality of Black men positioned as but only bodies to be governed, exploited and exterminated within the context of The Great Experiment that is the United States.  

What we know of Michael Brown, his character, ambitions, and his friends’ testimony contradicting the official police narrative suggests the even more egregious nature of this likely racially-statist killing. That his shot-through body was left in public view for close to four hours recalls the spectacle of slavocracy-era revenge killings of recalcitrant enslaved Africans. Michael’s killing as spectacle is matched by the racist rhetoric of the police officers responding to the protests of Ferguson’s African American community. Police references to the protesters as ‘animals’ and threats against their collective person underscore the violent racism that we have the responsibility to confront forthright and without hesitation.  

The number of Black men and boys who have been killed because of the popular and politicized framing of us as predators is heart wrenching and intolerable.  It is no hyperbole to acknowledge that young Black men are understood through the lens of a police state, which has its roots in the near ‘ancient regime’ of American slavery.

We will not stand for this. We will live for Michael Brown and for others who were brutally killed before him for simply being Black men.  In that living, we commit to scholarship that is practical and activity based. Social justice is at the core of Morehouse College, and we will work to achieve this for our Black men and Black boys and for the communities that so desperately need Black men and boys within them.  We will leverage our thinking and doing toward liberation from violent attack on Black men and boys and others who are marginalized because of a hegemonic norm that refuses to understand us for the full, complicated, loving and loved persons that we are.

The undersigned faculty of Morehouse College invite others to stand with us against the sickening oppression that the killing of Michael Brown represents.  We ask that you stand in whatever ways your respective spaces can afford. We need your creativity. We need your courage. We need your voice. We need your activism. We need your resistance. We must be free.

Instead his body lies in a morgue somewhere, and his community is in an uproar. It seems like a pathetic scene out of the movie Groundhog Day: another unarmed Black teen is dead, murdered in cold blood while questions swirl surrounding the facts of his shooting.

At press time, the police are not releasing many details, but what few details have emerged from eyewitness and police accounts are not surprisingly, vastly different. Police claim a scuffle ensued after Brown and the officer exchanged words, when Brown then allegedly pushed the officer into his police car assaulting him, causing the officer to fire shots in his cruiser, then fire more shots at Brown as he was running away from the car. Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson who was with the teen when he was killed told the {St. Louis CBS affiliate}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Heavy-police-presence--270609091.html""> that he and Brown were walking home in the street when the officer demanded they get on the sidewalk. The two teens kept walking when the police officer allegedly got out of his car, fired shots, scaring the two boys, who then ran. The officer allegedly fired again, with one of those shots hitting Brown. At that point, Johnson said Brown turned around with his hands in the air, and the officer approached, allegedly firing several more shots, killing Brown who was already on the ground.

What unfolds in the next few days from eyewitness accounts, videos and Johnson’s own account, will be telling. But so far, the policeman who shot Brown and the Ferguson Police Department are sticking by their stories. The Ferguson Police Department is making sure there is a “thorough” investigation of its own, with the Chief of the Ferguson Police “personally” calling the St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar asking for an investigation. Belmar, for the record, doesn’t believe there’s any cover up, adding, he didn’t think {“anyone would do that if they had something to hide.”}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-ferguson-teen-struggled-over-gun-before-being-shot-to/article_f9d627dc-e3c8-5bde-b2ab-7f0a3d36a083.html?mobile_touch=true"">

In reality, the fact that the Ferguson police referred this case to the St. Louis County Police department has nothing to do with transparency and everything to do with protocol. The St. Louis County Police Department would routinely take over a homicide investigation from a municipal police department once a case like this was thrust into the national spotlight, just as the Justice Department would {monitor a national hotbed of a case}<hyperlink=""http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2014/08/10/holder-instructs-justice-department-to-monitor-ferguson-developments/""> where there are questions surrounding alleged violations of the civil and constitutional rights of the deceased. 

What’s not alleged, but fact, is that the officer shot the unarmed Brown, “more than couple” [of times] (“but not much more,” said Belmar, as if that’s supposed to be some consolation to Brown’s mother) while running from the officer. What’s also not in dispute is that even as I am writing this article, people in my hometown are looting and rioting, diminishing the dignity of Brown and this senseless murder.

Dr. King once said, “rioting is…reactionary and invites defeat.” But so does being a Black teen in America, or so it seems.  On a video from the scene of the shooting, Michael Brown’s mother, Leslie McSpadden can be seen tearfully recounting the challenges of keeping her son in school only to be undermined by the system. She and many of us seem resolute that, despite best efforts, a Black boy’s fate is often sealed by his racial identity. McSpadden says that our boys often feel {“they have nothing to live for… because [the police] are going to try to take [them] out anyway.”}<hyperlink=""http://www.keyt.com/news/crowd-angry-after-teen-killed-by-police/27398818"">

Where the truth lies this case remains to be seen. What has emerged from the undisputed facts is an amalgamation of the recent spate of senseless murders of Black citizens that have been plastered across our TV screens since Trayvon Martin. This time, it was another teen, someone’s child, in my hometown who lay dead in the street face down for four hours while the community watched. Just a few weeks ago, it was Eric Garner, someone’s husband and father, who was strangled by police in my adopted hometown, and also died as we watched in horror. Last week, we nearly celebrated the fact that the killer of Renisha McBride was actually found guilty–the idea that someone could face consequences for such an act being unfamiliar to us. What’s sad, foreboding and statistically probable is that there’s a Black man, woman or child in your hometown that’s surely next.",8,9100,"As details emerge over the shooting of a Missouri teenager, outrage spreads through the streets of his hometown and across the nation",NA

They are there to intimidate blacks, to persuade us with their violence that we are powerless to alter the condition of our lives.”

–Angela Davis

The ink has barely dried, and we’re adding yet another name to the growing list of unarmed Black men killed by the police. 25-year-old, Ezell Ford, was only a few blocks away from home when he was stopped by police officers investigating an alleged shooting in the area. According to family members, he was lying on the ground, complying with officers, when he was shot several times in the back. 

Ezell joins the long list of victims to anti-black, state sanctioned violence in “post-racial America”. His death coming only days after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri. Hardly a week after Ted Wafer was convicted of 2nd degree murder in the death of Renisha McBride. Only a few weeks after the nation witnessed Eric Garner die from a chokehold at the hands of NYPD. If there was an actual “war on Whites” being waged, as expressed by members of the Tea Party this week, we would be losing.

Like everyone else, I was watching the events unfold in Ferguson on social media when the news of Ezell’s death hit my twitter feed.  I decided to reach out to one of the family members, not simply as a community organizer, but also a victim family member. I lost a loved one to police violence several years ago, and that experience is what led me to a career in activism and community organizing. With every name added to the registry of unarmed Black victims the emotional trauma triggers like a tape reel, reminding us that justice isn’t accessible for everyone. I was able to share this experience with Ezell’s uncle, Chauncey Perkins, who told me “It’s sickening to lose them in this manner.”

We’ve been asked, yet again, to defer in our anguish to the justice system. The same justice system that allowed George Zimmerman to walk free. The same system protecting the identity of the police officer who killed Michael Brown. The same system that is levying a war on the people of Ferguson. We are asked to trust the same process that systemically relegates people of color to second class citizenship as we scramble to appeal to the consciousness of America that we deserve the right to life. A country that readily consumes the narrative that black bodies are inherently violent, labeling our slain “{drunks}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/07/ap-renisha-mcbride-tweet_n_5659545.html"">”, “thugs”, and “{may-be-gang-related-we-really-don’t-know-but-he's-Black-so-It’s-fitting-to-speculate}<hyperlink=""http://ktla.com/2014/08/12/man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-by-police-in-south-l-a/"">”.

This assumption even informs the way {police departments recruit and train}<hyperlink=""http://www.ebony.com/news-views/the-right-to-resist-how-will-you-fight-police-brutality-403#axzz3ACF1o4Ad""> officers, leading to the over policing of black communities. “I spent 20 years in the department, and we were conditioned to profile. It was drilled into us that particular [communities] were just more dangerous…and likely to get us if we didn’t get them first.” offered an Ex-LAPD officer who wishes to remain anonymous. “There wasn’t much training on non-lethal tactics, no. We were taught to shoot to kill.” Another former police officer, Bryan Marshall, retired NYPD, said that the department did have cultural sensitivity training when he came through the academy 20 years ago, but that officers come on with their prejudices. “I think it’s fear, heightened by race. When they saw Eric Garner they saw a large black man. He wasn’t being aggressive, but that was enough to assume he’d be violent.” The reality is that despite viral arguments popping up all over facebook statuses, preaching respectability politics as some sort of revolutionary path to liberation, history tells us that even the most well dressed, saintly, educated black men have been gunned down, armed only with melanin and hope.

The implications of this reality are especially troubling with the Ferguson Police Department outfitting itself in excessive militarized weaponry. Evidence of police departments across America having {similar capabilities}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=2""> is especially sobering. If one thing has become abundantly clear, it’s that a war is being waged against our most vulnerable communities.

So what’s next?

It is important to remember that incidents like the killing of Ezell Ford are not isolated events. The tragedies that have unfolded over the last several weeks are indicative of an overarching issue of institutional racism in the criminal justice system. When we hear Ezell’s name we can also call on Troy Davis’s name, both victim’s of state sponsored anti-Black violence. Add this reality to countless other deaths, racial profiling, sentencing disparities, and mass incarceration and we begin to get a very clear picture that the criminal justice system has not failed, it has done exactly what it was designed to do–subjugate people of color to second class citizenship.

We must organize. We must continue to lift these names up, over and over. We have to look into alternatives to policing. We have to ask ourselves really tough questions, like how can we, as a community, respond to non-violent crimes in non-carceral ways? We must also challenge the mechanisms by which we hold police accountable by forming community autonomous civilian reviews boards. We still have to {repeal ""stand your ground"" laws}<hyperlink=""http://www.dreamdefenders.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Dream-Defenders-Stand-Your-Ground.pdf"">, and pass {Trayvon’s Law}<hyperlink=""http://www.dreamdefenders.org/trayvonslaw/"">. And while “{Know Your Rights}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights?redirect=know-your-rights-essential-resources-aclu"">” trainings may not be as useful when dealing with law enforcement who care nothing about rights, it’s still a valuable tool in navigating legal spaces.  ACLU-NY has also developed an application called “{police tape}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu-nj.org/news/2015/11/13/aclu-nj-launches-mobile-justice-smartphone-app"">” that helps discreetly record interactions with police and provides some citizens’ rights information.

As we continue to look on in horror at the human rights violations and arrests in Ferguson, I wonder if we should take a page from our forefathers of the Civil Rights Movement and start bussing folks in.

By now, we have all seen the video of Eric Garner’s murder at the hands of the NYPD.  As we are still trying to make sense of his killing, we receive the news of two more murders of unarmed Black men by law enforcement.  Twenty-two-year old John Crawford, shot and killed in Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio for holding in his hand a BB gun that was being sold in the store. Unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, gunned down by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. 

I avoided watching the video of Garner's death until I couldn't any longer. I avoided it, because every encounter I’ve had with NYPD resulted in physical confrontation.  For many people of color this isn’t a surprise.  NYPD culture authorizes the police to escalate the encounter to secure physical control and dominance.  This dominance comes in many forms but often includes being 'roughed up' by police.  It isn’t uncommon for this roughing up to include the now-infamous chokehold.  This deadly maneuver is not new and came under scrutiny in 1994 with {the killing of Anthony Baez}<hyperlink=""http://pix11.com/2014/07/22/brother-of-anthony-baez-sees-heartbreaking-parallel-to-eric-garners-death/""> and before that with {Arthur Miller.}<hyperlink=""https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1299&dat=19780703&id=dA4QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aosDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4775,7113&hl=en"">

Miller, a popular figure in Brooklyn's Crown Height's neighborhood, was choked to death by members of the NYPD in 1978. His murder ignited a community response led by two organizations-the Black United Front and the East, who organized a people’s patrol against local police. As a form of resistance dozens of disciplined members from the organizations stood outside of the 77th Precinct for weeks to simply say ""No more!""   One of the demands by organizers was the elimination of the chokehold responsible for Arthur Miller’s death.  

Over 40 years later, the struggle to fight police violence continues in New York, Missouri, Ohio and all across these United States. 

Those who have never had to deal firsthand with the reality of police violence often ask, why not just cooperate? Why resist? Why did he run? A long and recent history tells us any encounter with the police is typically just the beginning of a series of dehumanizing and probably violent experiences.  We should not be surprised when victims of police violence “resist” not arrest, but consistent police misconduct.  That resisting may come in many forms.  For Eric Gardner it was a simple statement – “This stops today.”

Although the murder was captured on videotape, an indictment of the police officer weeks later has not happened and we have already heard the extremely far-fetched analysis of the footage by NYC Patrolmen's Benevolent Association claiming he did not die due to the chokehold, to make us believe we did not see what we saw.  Adding insult to injury is the idea that re-training of the NYPD is a meaningful remedy to decreasing unnecessary violence in general and the use of the chokehold specifically.  Training is not enough and can't be taken seriously when only three years ago, NYPD counterterrorism officers were required to watch The Third Jihad, an anti-Muslim film depicting worshipers of Islam as extremists and terrorists. This was their ""training"" and it is consistent with failed attempts at training/re-training police officers across the country. 

Instead of facing this issue with the intentionality it deserves, cities like New York would rather payout large settlements than make policy changes to prevent deaths/lawsuits in the first place.  The nation's largest police department has paid over a billion dollars in the past decade to victims/victims families for wrongful deaths, beatings and false convictions. 

The violent history of the NYPD is not different than that of police departments across the country and without community accountability, these killings will continue. Traditional methods of fighting police brutality must be updated.  {""Know Your Rights""}<hyperlink=""http://changethenypd.org/resources/know-your-rights-help-end-discriminatory-abusive-illegal-policing""> workshops are necessary, but many leave our young people feeling demoralized.  These workshops usually detail the specific parameters in which police officers are supposed to operate, unfortunately young people are also told these laws are frequently broken and offer no real recourse to remedy it.  We can not escape the necessity of our communities to organize.  As we discuss our rights and painfully detail the contradicting realities, we must recognize our responsibility to make resist by organizing.  This organizing can be as simple as creating a culture of police observation.  This means whether we have cameras, cell phones or other technology, we must make it clear, we are watching!

What are a people who experience consistent systemic forms of violence at the hands of law enforcement and are just as consistently denied any justice expected to do? Nearly 49 years ago to this day, Watts, California went up in flames in response to police terror. As America turns it attention to the rage in and around Ferguson, Missouri this week, rest assured that unless this pattern of police killing stops, there are sure to be other cities in line for similar uprisings.  If we are concerned about the possibility of similar uprisings, we have a responsibility to make sure the overpolicing, brutality and killings in our communities end.

Invariably between half-listening about reception hall capacities and caterer rates, I have begun to anticipate the next question from our friends and family: “When are you guys going to have a baby?”

After the all-too-familiar story of an unarmed Black teenager, Michael Brown, was shot to death by police in Ferguson, Missouri, I cannot say that I am that eager to bring a Black child into this world, specifically America. Even with Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network in Missouri and Attorney General Eric Holder “monitoring” the situation, the horse is out of the proverbial barn for the Brown family.

This news broke a few days after another Black youth was gunned down by police, {this time in Ohio.}<hyperlink=""http://www.ebony.com/news-views/john-crawford-killed-405#axzz4Nf2s1ial""> In that case, John Crawford picked up a toy gun in a local Wal-Mart and was later believed to have been brandishing a real weapon, which caused a fellow customer to notify the authorities who arrived to the scene and fatally wound Crawford.

While the obvious and immediate thought of raising a Black  child in America is terrifying, a more worthwhile conversation must be had in regards to why it is that police continually prove that they are unable to “protect and serve” the Black  community without profiling, abusing, and murdering members of it.

The matter is simple or complex, depending on how one decides to look at it. The simple answer is that the Black population of this country is not the right complexion for this type of incident to matter enough to substantiate overhaul of police, legal, and court protocols.

A complex discussion of this matter can be conducted from a statistical and academic viewpoint. Research conducted by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement (MXGM) highlighted inequities in excessive force. They {compiled data from police departments all over the country and from news publications}<hyperlink=""http://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/operation_ghetto_storm_updated_october_2013.pdf""> and then analyzed the amount of Blacks and Latinos that had been extrajudicially killed by police, security guards or vigilantes in the year 2012. In a city like Chicago where the Black  population comprises a third of the city’s population, 91% of the cases had Black victims. Cities such as New York City and Houston had approximately 87% and 48% Black victims in these types of cases, respectively. At the time the report was released, there was a extrajudicial killing of a Black person every 36 hours. One year later, the number increased to {every 28 hours}<hyperlink=""http://www.occupy.com/article/black-man-killed-us-every-28-hours-police"">. 

{A 2010 annual report by the Cato Institute}<hyperlink=""https://www.policemisconduct.net/2010-npmsrp-police-misconduct-statistical-report/#_Excessive_Force"">, a public policy research organization, stated that out of 6,613 sworn officers involved in criminal misconduct cases that year, approximately 24% of them were involved in excessive force complaints. This percentage was more than double of any other type of complaint. Approximately 8.1% of these cases involved a fatality due to excessive force by police officers. The report does not explicitly state how many of those cases involved Black  victims; however the report does {contain a map}<hyperlink=""http://www.targetmap.com/viewer.aspx?reportId=6469""> which illustrates the frequency of excessive force incidents by location. Based on the map, the highest excessive force totals are found in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Chicago; cities with very obvious and prominent minority populations.

According to scholars {Brad W. Smith and Malcolm D. Holmes}<hyperlink=""https://studysites.sagepub.com/walshstudy/articles/section6/Holmes.pdf"">, there is a direct and positive relationship between the amount of minority citizens in a city and the sustained level of excessive force complaints against police departments. They also shed light into a theory in sociology known as the ‘Minority Threat Theory” which explains police behavior when dealing with minorities. The scholars explain:

Popular stereotypes associate race/ethnicity with serious criminality and urban violence and the presence of large minority populations, whether real or perceived, heightens fear of crime among White citizens. Police authorities may likewise believe that culturally dissimilar minority groups threaten social order and relatively large minority populations may be seen as presenting a substantial problem for social control. Given their shared concern about the alleged threat of minority crime, the dominant White citizenry and local police authorities may marshal their political power to promote the use of various coercive crime control strategies against subordinate minority citizens in cities with relatively large minority populations.

“But won’t these officers have their day in court?”

The statistics say they will, but that little justice will be served to the victims of excessive force. The common protocol for citizens is to submit a complaint to his or her local police department, however as it was discovered in central New Jersey, those complaints rarely lead to any consequence. {The New Jersey Press obtained statistics}<hyperlink=""http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/2014/08/10/nj-use-of-force-internal-affairs-investigations/13822965/""> regarding excessive force complaints to the Central New Jersey Police Department through the Open Public Records Act and discovered that just 1% of all complaints submitted from 2008 – 2012 were sustained by internal affairs. New Jersey is not alone in its tendency to protect its’ own (police that is). {The Minneapolis Police Department created an “Office of Police Conduct Review”}<hyperlink=""http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/221422101.html?page=all&prepage=1&c=y#continue""> to review complaints made by citizens; however within its’ first year, the office reviewed 439 cases of police misconduct, and decided to recommend punishment for none of the officers cited in those cases. Two of the 439 cases involved off-duty officers involved in using racial slurs and fighting with Black  citizens of nearby Wisconsin. 

This is not an attempt to vilify or discredit all police officers or police departments; however, the racial biases that exist and manifest themselves through almost every element of American life have manifested themselves over and over again through incidents of police brutality. However, this research and the recent events in Missouri and Ohio are meant to reiterate how worthless we appear to be to judicial system in this country.

Nothing is more beautiful than the idea of bring new life into the world, but nothing is more hideous and despicable as the treatment of Black people by those who are sworn to “protect and serve."" The idea that my future child could be lost for no other reason than being Black and in public shakes me to the core and there's no way to prepare our family for that.",5,4700,"Writer Bryan Graham on the inability of police officers across the country to treat Blacks as civilians, not criminals-by-default",NA
Ebony,ebony15,http://www.ebony.com/news-views/the-hillary-clinton-two-step-987#axzz473hQKiHU,The Hillary Clinton Two-Step,Michael Arceneaux,08/18/14,10/20/16,"After reading {Hillary Clinton's interview with The Atlantic}<hyperlink=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/hillary-clinton-failure-to-help-syrian-rebels-led-to-the-rise-of-isis/375832/"">, a few characters come to mind.

For starters, {Major Benson Winifred Payne from Major Payne}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrfqxrOUqS8""> (given both and he and Hillary seem to want to handle conflict in a similar manner). The same goes for {Lieutenant Dan from Forrest Gump.}<hyperlink=""http://forrestgump.wikia.com/wiki/Lieutenant_Dan""> Then there are more hilarious albeit still menacing real-life characters like John McCain, a war hawk if there ever were one. McCain is the most apt comparison of course, and it's no wonder they speak of each other so fondly (at least by contemporary standards anyway). They are both defiantly dated in their perception of the world surrounding them.

Likewise, they share contempt for certain aspects of President Obama’s point of view on global affairs. As Clinton explained, “Great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle.”

Even if Hillary Clinton has since ""clarified,"" nee removed her heel from her mouth before angry, war weary liberals told her to shove it someplace else for criticizing President Obama, all she did was remind many of why they were relieved that she didn't win the Democratic primary six years ago. No matter how simple Clinton felt Obama's use of the phrase ""don't do stupid stuff"" was in assessing foreign policy, it now highlights that simplicity would still go a long way in deflating Clinton's more stern outlook of how the U.S. should behave on the global stage.

As we now face the prospects of the United States sending more troops to help cool the chaos of its own creation—Good Morning, Iraq—I, {like David Axelrod}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/499193669975834624"">, can't help but think back to Hillary's choice to support the invasion in the first place. She did so for political reasons —i.e. why she just essentially threw a rock and hid her hand as she criticized the [unpopular] President Obama for the sake of separating herself from him. She is well within her right to do so, but it feels unnecessary.

Should she coast to the Democratic primary win in 2016, her Republican opponent will be from a pool of circus clowns. And even if their current front-runner, Rand Paul, has offered a more nuanced, less war mongering mantra that we are not used to hearing from GOP pols on the national stage (select hypocritical stances be damned), this country is tired of aggressively sticking its nose in everyone else's business while America literally crumbles (Good Morning, Ferguson). Meanwhile, though I have read analysis that argues Obama and Clinton do not differ on Syria as reports suggests, her comments about Israel—basically they are right, right, right, and everyone is else is wrong, wrong, and then some, are frustrating.

Comparing the global response to what’s recently taken place in the Ukraine as opposed to events along Gaza, Clinton says it’s far worse in the former country before noting, “and yet we do see this enormous international reaction against Israel, and Israel’s right to defend itself, and the way Israel has to defend itself. This reaction is uncalled for and unfair.”

Perhaps that is just how it works in this country – Israel can do no wrong ever – but it doesn't make it any less bothersome. Clinton already has to contend with the perception that she may be a relic among select voters and this interview did her no favors. Clinton may want to reposition herself as a populist to secure the presidency, but {she has already shown struggles with that}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/08/13/hillary-clinton-expert-shape-shifter/?utm_term=.20ae266ed2fb"">, too. She's in the club doing the same old two-step. Someone has got to at least show her the Shomney dance.

I'm not totally averse to a second Clinton presidency, but I am not excited about it either beyond the celebration of a gender barrier being broken. Maybe she can truly evolve, though it will have to come from challenge from a serious challenger. So please, continue whispering sweet political nothings in the ear of Elizabeth Warren. If this is Clinton’s vision of the U.S. in the future so be it, but we better make her fight for it first.",0,83,Michael Arceneaux takes likely Democratic Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton to task on her recent Obama criticism,NA

Ebony,ebony17,http://www.ebony.com/news-views/mike-brown-killed-st-louis-042#axzz473hQKiHU,"Waiting in Rage: As Another Black Teen Is Killed, Justice Feels Impossible",Charles F. Coleman Jr.,08/11/14,10/20/16,"Today would have been Michael Brown’s first day at Vatterott College.  As you read this, he should be sitting in a classroom, pondering the cost of textbooks, making a new friend. Instead, his future was taken from him just two days shy embarking upon on what many of us consider to be life’s best years. Instead, he is now part of a legacy of violence and aggression against Black people in America, and specifically against young Black boys. A cop’s gun has turned him from a young man to a memory in just moments, and left us all with the stinging shock that this has happened to one of our own. Again.

As an officer of the court, I suppose I am obligated to say something about notions of justice, and encourage patience for the ""facts: to come out as we listen to the same rhetoric about how race played no role here and that this was somehow the result of Brown’s own actions. However, as a Black man who is again forced to deal with another example of unchecked deadly force being used by police against one of our own, I simply can’t do it. Incidents like these expose a sensitive layer of double-consciousness that I feel as an attorney who, one hand relies on the law as my weapon of choice, but as a Black man, also understands that weapon is not enough. 

As we morn Michael Brown, we face a sobering and unspoken reality: just as he was not the first unarmed Black man to lose his life after being killed by police, he is unlikely to be the last. When one is incapable of seeing Blacks as human in the same manner that they see themselves, they are equally incapable of affording them the full and equal benefits of personhood. The killings of Brown, Davis, Martin, and countless others whose stories have not made national news all reflect a mindset that Blacks are threatening, overly-aggressive, and filled with rage. This mindset, incubated throughout the ranks of law enforcement (and sometimes within our own communities) promotes the idea that we simply must be controlled at all costs, and that the use of force against us knows no bounds so long as it is exercised in the purported interest of maintaining that control and keeping order. Because, without such control of us–not humans but rather some type of wild animal species let out of cages–we are the biggest threat to ""order"". How else can one explain the over-policing of communities of color that we see across the country? Surely it cannot be simply about crime prevention. If that were so, then there would hardly be as many incidents resulting in death to unarmed, and often innocent victims.

In the wake of Brown’s killing, media outlets across the country have callously addressed the justifiable rage of Ferguson residents with little attention to the young man who has been lost and how such a death would impact a community. The images of what have been labeled “angry mobs” of “rioters and looters” only further promulgate the notion that we are unruly and police dogs and riot gear are all necessary to keep us from getting further out of hand.

National outrage around law enforcement’s abuse of discretion will not likely occur unless and until police start shooting youths of other ethnicities. When families from other communities are unable to sympathetically remark about such tragedy from the comfort of their living rooms in passing conversation, but must deal first-hand with the reality of burying a loved one because of a policeman’s gun, something tells me things will change. Quickly. Alas, that reality is a far off one, if only because members of law enforcement are keenly aware of the consequences—both professionally and personally—for violating White bodies.

My friends of other races may not understand the depths of emotion that I and so many like me may feel in coping with Brown’s killing. For some, they see me as “different” than Brown. That’s the part that they don’t get. I, and other Black males like me, are no safer from a cop’s bullet than Brown was when he was killed. Fancy titles and degrees aside, to that badge, I pose the same threat and will be dealt with using the same force. Even in doing everything “right,” in being unarmed, in breaking no laws, it can still happen to me. (It should be noted that there is strong reason to believe that Brown, too, had done everything “right.”) The reason why we are all so angry is that we know it can just as easily happen to any one of us.

So what about justice? The old adage tells us that justice is blind. But, right now it seems I am the one having trouble figuring out what she looks like. Admittedly, justice doesn’t seem like burning down or destroying what little that we have in expressing our anger and frustration only for more people to end up hurt or in jail. It certainly doesn’t seem like an officer being on paid leave after shooting and killing an unarmed teenager. Right now, justice would seem like Michael Brown walking into class after leaving his dorm room, excited to experience what college is all about.

But, we know that won’t happen.

I don’t know where justice is. Or, when she will show up. I just keep praying for us all that she gets here soon.",1,2400,Attorney Charles Coleman says the death of Mike Brown makes him feel like the law he works to uphold and protect will never serve us,NA
Ebony,ebony18,http://www.ebony.com/news-views/no-more-requiems-a-protest-for-michael-brown-and-my-son-403#axzz473hQKiHU,No More Requiems: A Protest for Michael Brown and My Son,"Stephane Dunn, PhD",08/14/14,10/20/16,"A few weeks ago this summer, on one of those perfectly sunny, sky blue early afternoons that amazingly isn’t too Atlanta hot yet, I’m driving in my car down a side street by our home towards the highway. My soon to be five year old son is in the backseat. The windows are down, and I’ve got the music up a notch. On my way to tuning to NPR or some other talkfest, my son hears a top-40 radio station playing one of those catchy overplayed songs that he digs, so I crank it up and he’s singing. ""Why you gotta be so rude…I’m gonna marry her, marry her… ""

Before we make it to the highway, I see it, two white police officers on the street side of a black and white cruiser handling a young Black man in a white-t-shirt and long dark shorts.  He’s already cuffed. One White arm is pressed into his back. The young man’s arms jut awkwardly behind him, skinny elbows twisted into uneven angles.  His body isn’t outwardly in all out war with the police, but his thin legs burrow into his high top tennis shoes with no socks, fighting to stay standing, and not forced to his knees. I cut the music and slow down to a crawl.

“Mommy!” My son protests, but his eyes follow mine to the scene outside the open window. 

I don’t want him to see this, what he hasn’t seen before, what could happen. I want drive past and go about my business. Instead I’m at a crawl and I’m watching and not because I’m nosy that way. I am on guard, prepared to bear witness. To what?  What is happening, what could. My heart plays tag in my chest.  I turn into a parking lot across from the cruiser instead of keeping straight to the highway. I can’t hear but I can see.

“What the police doing, Mommy?” My son asks?

“Hold on, Baby, shhhh,” I beg. “Hold on.”

The two officers push into his back still, one with his stick lodged against the young man back. He’s pressed down flat on the ground, his jaw making an imprint in the dirty concrete. Another police officer, Black,pulls up, parks in front of the other, and gets out. Why? Other than trying to move his head, his body isn’t making much movement. Why does it take three officers to subdue one handcuffed, thin young man, already face down on the concrete? The Black cop joins and takes over for one while he goes to the first cruiser. I contemplate what to do if things really jump off and reach in my purse, grab my phone and swipe to the video camera. Then I sit and wonder. If things escalate, can I calmly tape while a young man, another mama’s son, gets beaten, maybe to death? Would the years of this rise up in me and send me rushing out of the car to protect that son and maybe end up beaten or killed myself in front of my own son?

“Mommy . . .” My son is confused. Why have we pulled over? Why is Mommy sitting there staring, not talking? Why do the police push the young man into the ground? Why is it the police and not the boy who look scary?

The officers lift and push him roughly until his thin body folds into the back of the cruiser, his head barely missing the hood of the car. I ease back into the street, and pass the cruiser, glimpsing the dark face in the back seat.

“Mommy, are the police bad?”

Several White police officers visited my son’s preschool a few months back. They smiled, shook his hand, and talked about safety, how and when to dial 911, how they should not play with guns, talk to or accept gifts from, or go off with strangers, how they could trust a police officer if they are lost. One child wondered if the officers were going to take them to jail.

“No, buddy, we only take bad people to jail.”

My son, the aspiring doctor-NBA player like Lebron went home and said he was going to be a police officer. His father, barely able to veil the flash of anger, of pain that crossed his face, reminded him about the doctor-athlete ambition.

Now my son was asking, “are the police bad?” I couldn’t say no, and I couldn’t say yes. When I knew I was having a son, I feared for him from an endless line of future threats. This was one of my top fears, so troubling in my spirit that I avoided talking about it aloud. I know I am haunted, haunted by the knowledge of the years and years of before I was born lynchings and the bloody hand of the law in a hundred Southern towns and Northern cities, by Emmett Till, Rodney King, Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin, by the woman beaten down on the side of a California highway by a trooper just this summer and the killing of young black boys, of girls too by police in my home state of Indiana and others across the country that didn’t get major news attention or justice, haunted by the tears of their mothers, fathers, grandparents . . . by the White campus and local police in the southern Indiana town where I started college, harassing us as we went to basketball games or parties or crossed into town to go to the store. I was an enraged forced witness on the edge of losing it myself when they threatened and goaded my boyfriend, friends, me. 

I am haunted by all the years of comforting and commiserating with proud blood and friend brothers, cousins, uncles, and students sharing in anger, indignation, and pain their cold concrete police profiling experiences.

Police officers at parks, schools, and banks, had been smiling at my son for almost five years, shaking his hand, giving him play badges. “How you doing Buddy?” saying what other kindly White folk said ‘handsome little guy’ as they offered lollipops. Since he was in the womb, I’ve been trying to figure out what I’d say when it came time for his Dad and I to explain to his preteen and teen age self the whole history, the continuing realities of how he could be walking down the street in his own neighborhood, minding his business, or out buying candy not stealing, or hanging out at a game or driving with his fellow long legged black make friends and be instantly typed and tagged and in an instant quickly ‘mistakenly’ killed.  How could I explain this to my smart little boy not too long out of toddlerhood and not terrify and confuse him yet not lie, but plant a tiny seed to the big truth I was being swept toward explaining in the not too distant future.

It pissed me off; I shouldn’t have to explain. Black parents should not still be explaining this to our sons. We should be making this kind of killing of our sons and daughters uncommon, exhibiting zero tolerance of the police criminalizing them on sight rather than being moved to try and save them first.

Mommy, Mommy, the police are bad?” My little boy persisted.

“Well, there are good police officers, Son, but there are bad ones too, just like other people…""

“What ones Mommy? You will tell me the bad ones?”

I merged onto the highway and sped up. ",10,208,Mother and writer Stephane Dunn struggles to explain 'bad' police to her innocent young son,NA
