Police responding to reports of armed men and gunfire shot a man in Ferguson who they said had pointed a handgun at an officer early this morning. The unidentified man {was reportedly shot}<hyperlink=“http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-police-shooting-08132014-story.html”> just blocks from the place where hours earlier civil rights activist Rev.

In {a separate incident}<hyperlink=“http://legacy.ksdk.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/13/ferguson-woman-shot-in-head/13990051/”> approximately one mile away, an unidentified woman was reportedly shot in the head in a drive-by shooting, in an incident that authorities had not yet confirmed was related to the earlier protests. The woman is now in stable condition and is expected to survive. Police are still searching for the suspects.

At least seven people were also arrested overnight, as police told defiant protesters to ""go home"" or face arrest. Reporters on the scene described several protesters walking towards police lines in defiance of their orders, with their hands raised up.

Today police in Ferguson released their first statement since Brown's death, saying members of the department ""have heard the community's cries for justice"" and ""will continue to cooperate fully in the investigations"" by the FBI, the St. Louis County Police Department, and the Justice Department. 

""The City of Ferguson has been through tough situations in the past, albeit nothing to this magnitude, but will continue to display resilience and fortitude,"" the statement said.

Residents of Ferguson, a primarily black suburb of St. Louis, have been taking to the streets since Sunday, a day after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a still unnamed police officer, following an altercation of which the details are still being disputed.

On Sunday, after a candlelight vigil for Brown, angry protesters were met by heavily armed police in riot gear, and the initially peaceful protests turned into riots. Some groups looted and burning local businesses — including the QuikTrip, a local gas station that has since become a flashpoint for protests.

On Monday protests over Brown's shooting turned into clashes, as police met local residents with tear gas and rubber and wooden bullets. Tuesday evening was initially calmer, but protesters reportedly clashed with police as the night went on.

[tweetbegin 499219813575557121 tweetend]

Accounts of the events leading up to Brown's death differ widely, with police saying the teen had attacked an officer and attempted to take hold of his weapon. Dorian Johnson, 22, a friend of the victim who was with him at the time, has said that police shot at Brown after the two refused to immediately move from the middle of the street to the sidewalk.

Johnson and other witnesses {said that}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/michael-brown-shooting-witness_n_5671156.html”> Brown was on his knees, with his hands raised up high, when he was killed.

The gesture — and the slogan ""hands up, don't shoot!"" — has become a symbol of the protests, adopted by demonstrators rallying peacefully but also by some more provocatively confronting police with their hands up high.

Johnson said police told him and Brown to ""get the fuck onto the sidewalk,"" and then proceeded to grab and choke the teen when he refused to follow orders. He said an officer shot him when he attempted to flee.

""We weren't causing no harm to nobody,"" Johnson {told CBS News on Sunday}<hyperlink=“http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-brown-shooting-some-ferguson-missouri-residents-do-not-believe-cops-story/”>. ""We had no weapons on us at all. He shot again and once my friend felt that shot he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down, and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.""

Johnson's lawyer, Freeman Bosley, a former mayor of St. Louis, said on Tuesday that police had declined to interview Johnson, who has taken his testimony to the media instead.

""They didn't even want to talk to him,"" Bosley {told MSNBC}<hyperlink=“http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri”>. ""They don't want the facts. What they want is to justify what happened.""

Police asked for calm and time to carry out an investigation into the incident and said on Tuesday that they would not publicly disclose the name of the officer involved in Brown's death, as previously announced, because of threats made on social media and fear for the officer's safety.

""The value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family,"" Thomas Jackson, the police chief in Ferguson, told reporters.

St. Louis police have since taken over control of the suburb from the Ferguson police department, also by instituting a no-fly zone over the neighborhood.

Also on Tuesday, the St. Louis County prosecutor said the autopsy of the teen's body won't be released.

Brown's family, local and national community leaders, and President Obama have appealed for calm.

""The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time,"" Obama said. ""As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed.

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.

In Ferguson on Wednesday Rev. Sharpton also called for calm. ""Don't be a traitor to Michael Brown in the name of 'you mad,'"" he said.

Sharpton had recently rallied in New York over the death of another black man, Eric Garner, who died after police put him in a chokehold for resisting arrest.

Those calling for ""Justice for Michael Brown"" also took to social media to remember other unarmed black victims of police or vigilante violence — from Garner to Trayvon Martin, who was shot to death in 2012 in Sanford, Florida.

On Wednesday, {reports emerged}<hyperlink=“http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/12/lapd-shooting-ezell-ford/13985607/”> that another unarmed 24-year-old black man had been killed by police in South Los Angeles.

Following Brown's death in Ferguson, social media sites were abuzz with tributes to black men killed by police.

""One every 28 hours,"" some said, citing a statistic turned slogan begun by the {Malcolm X Grassroots Movement}<hyperlink=“https://mxgm.org/operation-ghetto-storm-2012-annual-report-on-the-extrajudicial-killing-of-313-black-people/”>, a group fighting racism. In a report named ""Operation Ghetto Storm"" the group found that, in 2012, a black man was killed by police every 28 hours.

LaQuanda Brown, 28, has spent her entire life in Ferguson, and lives in the same housing complex where Michael Brown — unrelated — lived. She struggled for words to describe the atmosphere of the last few days.

""Tension, anger. Everyone in this community has had enough,"" she told VICE News. ""People want to be heard and they want justice.""

""They are wondering why all this police is here, why they are coming to peaceful rallies,"" she added. ""Police come out with their helmets, vests and shields. They are so aggressive. They just make it worse.""

On Thursday, vigils for victims of police brutality and racism are set to take place across the country, including in St. Louis.

The NAACP also issued a statement following Brown's death. ""Even as we call for accountability by those charged with protecting the community, we call on the community to act — collectively and calmly,"" the statement said.

Despite some lootings, residents said that the protests over Brown's death had been largely peaceful, and that protesters had instead been met aggressively by police in a militarized response.

""It's messed up, they're suited for war against civilians,"" Miller Gardner, a young protester, told the Daily Beast on Monday, while standing, hands raised before a line of riot police officers. ""I'm not on that side, and I'm in the military. They need to come on this side of the line.""

Over the past few days, the suburb was heavily patrolled by officers in riot gear, with police lines all along West Florissant Avenue, a main strip in Ferguson. Journalists reported being denied access to some of the protests' sites — and residents compared the militarized police presence in the streets of their neighborhood to an ""occupation.""",130,NA,NA,NA

The curfew will last from midnight Saturday through 5AM Sunday — and officials did not specify how long the emergency would last.

Protesters at the press conference met the announcement with anger and frustration, yelling at the governor that the people of Ferguson wanted ""justice"" not curfews, and complaining that the police officer who killed 18-year-old Michael Brown — the incident which sparked the week of protest — has not been arrested.

""The only reason people have been in the street for a week now is that they want justice,"" someone shouted.

[tweetbegin 500770285717450752 tweetend]

[tweetbegin 500772748755746816 tweetend]

Capt. Johnson, of Highway Patrol, said that officers would not enforce the curfew with tear gas but would ""talk to people"" instead — though breaking curfew would theoretically constitute enough grounds for arrest.

Johnson also said that FBI agents went door to door in the residential community where Brown was shot on August 9, ""trying to find other witnesses.""

[tweetbegin 500748840564445186 tweetend]

Speaking with VICE News, some Ferguson residents said they had no plans to stay at home on Saturday night.

""I don't think this is gonna be nice at all. Violence will be met with violence,"" one of them told VICE News after the conference. ""They shouldn't have shown the tape."" He was referring to the surveillance video released by police earlier today that allegedly shows Brown stealing $50-worth of cigars from a local convenience store

He also said protesters would likely come in, past curfew, from different parts of Saint Louis — ""just to tell the motherfucking government, 'Fuck you.'"" 

Another evening of large, peaceful protests on Friday took a turn for the worse early today as small groups of people confronted police and some individuals broke into several stores.

Tensions in the St. Louis suburb flared up again after an almost festive reaction to a shift in police response earlier. Highway Patrol officers took over control of the area on Thursday after widespread criticism of the local force's aggressive response to residents protesting Brown's fatal police shooting.

[tweetbegin 500520639376011265 tweetend]

Earlier on Friday, police identified Darren Wilson as the officer who killed Brown on August 9, but at the same time released the surveillance video.

That store was broken into and looted this morning — despite efforts by dozens of protesters to keep looters out.

Police cited Brown as a primary suspect in the robbery last Saturday, sparking angry protests from local residents who accused the department of running a ""smear campaign"" against the teenager to justify the killing.

People in Ferguson were skeptical of the video's authenticity and argued that petty theft is no excuse for ""execution.""

""Not only did you murder him but now you draw up this story?"" Mark Evans, a 43-year-old father of three teens, told VICE News. ""I'm sure they took a lot of time to contemplate and put the story together. We were waiting to see what they would come up with to justify this, and this doesn't justify anything anyway.""

Evans was one of several witnesses who heard the shots that killed Brown and came to the scene. He suggested that by moving the ""crime scene"" over to the convenience store, police were trying to steer attention away from witnesses' accounts of Brown dropping to his knees with his hands raised when he was shot.

""It's sad to say it wouldn't shock me if they let [Wilson] loose, because he's one of their own,"" Evans added. ""But remember, they slaughtered him. One, two shots maybe, but they slaughtered him.""

Many questioned the timing of the video's release — with some charging the Ferguson Police Department of sabotaging efforts to bring peace to the neighborhood. Others said the robbery was unrelated to the shooting.

The Department of Justice, which launched a separate investigation into Brown's death, had {reportedly}<hyperlink=“http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/16/us/missouri-teen-shooting/”> asked police not to release the video. 

Capt. Ron Johnson, of Highway Patrol — the face of police's de-escalation efforts in Ferguson — told VICE News on Friday that he had not known the details of the police report's release, and found out about it from the media.

""At this point I don't know the why… But I don't know if I'm gonna get an answer that's really going to satisfy the why,"" Johnson said about the release of the video. He said his officers would continue to show restraint but agreed the release would negatively impact efforts to keep the peace.

""Last night we were able to build a lot of things up, I think we've taken a couple steps back here and we need to talk about that,"" Johnson added.

Privately, other Highway Patrol officers said the release was poorly timed, and added that there had been ""bad feelings"" over authorities' decision to relieve St. Louis County Police of control of Ferguson.

As the Ferguson Market liquor store — where Brown allegedly stole the cigars — was broken into early today, protesters on the scene accused looters of being outsiders, taking advantage of the situation, but also criticized police for giving them an excuse to do so.

[tweetbegin 500527708925747200 tweetend]

""The police fucked this up by saying Mike Brown stole from here,"" one of several protesters (pictured below) that barricaded the liquor store in a failed attempt to keep looters out, told VICE News. ""What you see in here, they're rats. We don't steal people's shit, we work for it. That's what real black men do.""

[tweetbegin 500556853659463680 tweetend]

Tensions ran high throughout the night, as several groups faced off. Some protesters walked up to police lines and threw Molotov cocktails — to which police responded with tear gas at least once. Volunteers, including several members of the New Black Panthers, desperately attempted to push protesters back.

Later, as looters arrived — from outside Ferguson and alerted by social media of rising tensions, locals said — groups of young protesters attempted to stop them and keep them out of stores, despite being threatened with shooting.

A young woman, almost in tears, complained that the media had focused on the looting following Brown's death, rather than on {the community's efforts}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/ProjectTakeBck”> to keep looters and ""outside opportunists"" away.

""This is not us,"" she said after leaving a store she and others had tried to protect from looters — but stopped when threatened with shooting. ""Did you see how peaceful it was earlier?""",134,NA,NA,NA
Vice,vice3,http://www.vice.com/read/michael-brown-st-louis-suburb-ferguson-missouri-americas-latest-racial-hotspot-812,A St. Louis Suburb Is America's Latest Racial Hotspot,Justin Glawe,08/12/14,05/16/16,"Last night, I walked out of the Target in Ferguson, Missouri, to find my car behind police tape. Cops in riot gear were extending their security perimeter around West Florissant Avenue, where protests over the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown turned into looting and riots Sunday night and clashes with police on Monday.

“You better hurry up and go get it,” a man in a group parked near me said. The cops let me retrieve my vehicle after a stern warning (complete with a rifle being waved around) to go left and not right when I reached the edge of the lot. Five minutes later I heard four tear gas canister volleys. Ten seconds after that a 20-something black man in a caravan of Ferguson residents came over.

“We going,” he said. “You coming?”

What followed was a raucous four-hour stretch marked by smoked out streets and rage. By midnight, West Florissant was littered with rocks, broken glass, spent tear gas canisters and pepper balls. As we approached the police line from the north, cops were flying everywhere and people were honking and and screaming. After hearing the canisters fly, people were angry enough to run stoplights, ignore cop cars and speed across town to make it to ground zero and figure out what was happening.

Brown, as you may have heard, was {killed Saturday by a St. Louis County police officer}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/why-not-assume-the-worst-after-missouri-police-shot-unarmed-black-teen-michael-brown-811”>. One protestor told me his death was the “spark that lit the fire,” one that’s been long smoldering in this St. Louis suburb, where relations between residents and police aren’t so hot. The details surrounding the 18-year-old's death have been the subject of much contention, but whether Brown was shot between seven and ten times, as his cousin Sabrina Webb and many others claimed Monday, or whether it was less than that doesn't really matter here. Nor does the fact that police maintain Brown struggled with the as-of-yet unnamed officer. What is gnawing at emotions and bubbling up at protests where many chanted ""black power"" Monday is the fact that Brown was unarmed and was apparently approached by the officer for jaywalking.

""They thought he was somebody else,"" Webb told me after pleading through a bullhorn that protestors not resort to the looting that resulted in damage to several businesses Sunday night. ""It was racial profiling.""

Webb stood on a concrete barricade as she spoke Monday. In front of was her a crowd of mostly young, black men; behind her, a wall of police from multiple agencies, ostensibly there to protect the remnants of the QuikTrip station that had been gutted and torched the night before.

The looting was fairly contained, and the gas station that was decimated, not far from the apartment complex where Brown lived, was the only building actually destroyed as a result of Sunday’s initial uproar. It has become a gathering point for those who continue to express equal parts anger, sadness and disbelief over Brown's death. On a bridge over a creek nearby, tags read ""KILL COPS"" and ""FUCK THE POLICE."" “Fuck 12” and “Fuck the police” chants carried on throughout the night once the shit hit the fan.

But over and over again Monday I heard people deriding violence and looting, even if they had mixed feelings about its impact.

One man outside the gas station, sweating profusely under heavy dreadlocks drenched in 90 degree sunlight, spoke with a particularly enraged tone.

""If this shit didn't happen last night,"" he said of the looting, ""the whole world wouldn't know shit about that boy getting shot.""

But Carissa McGraw, standing not far from the makeshift memorial on Canfield Drive that marks the bloody section of asphalt where Brown went down, refuted the claim that looting was necessary to bring attention to this awful situation.

""It's got to do with the fact that his body stayed out here for 4.5 hours and (the pictures) went out on social media,"" McGraw said. ""It took the community to cover him up.""

McGraw, a 26-year-old with family in Ferguson who travelled from Colorado to join the protests, said in her mind the imagery of Brown's corpse laying in the street meant only one thing.

""The symbolism of that is a body hanging from a tree after a lynching,"" she said.

By the time I reached the protest zone just after 8 pm, smoke was filling the air. I hopped the curb behind a local TV news reporter and ran toward the police line. You couldn’t see the QuikTrip through the haze and beyond the wall of police, walking in lockstep with that apocalyptic riot gear and armored vehicles that have been made more available to law enforcement than ever before as they’ve become increasingly militarized. You also couldn’t see the street that leads to Brown’s memorial, where wax from candles burned in his memory stain the road (and where it was apparently too dangerous for reporters to go even after the last of the protestors went home). For hours cars approached the line, mainly to taunt police, before being turning away and flying north.

It was the reverse of what had been a mostly peaceful day, with gatherings at churches where Brown’s mother and step-father spoke to the press standing next to Benjamin Crump, the attorney who represented Trayvon Martin’s family. Crump and Anthony Gray, a St. Louis lawyer, are the parents’ counsel. At another church across town, elders in the black community met at a town hall event, where NAACP national director Cornell Williams Brooks spoke, among others. So many wished to attend that the doors had to be locked and a crowd carried on their own town hall on the steps of the Murchison Tabernacle CME Church. But there was a noticeable lack of young people inside.

As I left, a young man with a beret, black military vest and Black Panther pins was telling someone behind me, “They’ve got tanks over there. We need to be with our people!” He may have been referring to the tank-like SWAT team transports that the St. Louis Metro Police had sent to the area to assist local cops. In the smoky street, there was a noticeable lack of elders to talk people down from the ledge.

After midnight, I was stopped by police pointing flashlight and assault rifles. They asked for identification and credentials. “Hey, who the fuck is this?” an especially jacked and on-edge cop with cocaine eyes said to another. I answered, and told him I wanted to get through the line to lead a Reuters photographer to the memorial.

“You can’t get down Canfield. It’s blocked,” he told me with unblinking intensity.

“What do you mean, it’s blocked? It’s a public street.”

“There is no way to get down Canfield.”

Shoulder tick. Rifle adjustment.

“Got it?”

Prior to Sunday night's eye-stinging chaos, the anger of many protestors was explained, if not justified, by Justin Brown (of no relation to Michael). He said it was ""anger used in the wrong way. It was just people getting steamed up, but we're not going to be intimidated by police.""

Those statements reflect a pattern here in Ferguson. Protestors gather, police respond in significant number, and someone fires an insult or, in the case that seems to have initiated Sunday night's looting, a police flare. At this moment Ferguson is like a lot of hot spots around the world, this one with a specifically American brand of conflict between blacks and whites. And it appears the good intentions of peaceful protestors were overshadowed by Sunday's ominous turn.

If the older members of the black community who gathered to hear NAACP director Brooks speak represented Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision of civil dispbedience through non-violence, the crowds that jeered at police and defiantly breathed in tear gas smoke recall the approach of Malcolm X.

McGraw, the activist visiting from Colorado, told me, ""I came out here for a purpose, but I feel like that purpose is being diluted.""",14,NA,NA,NA

St. Louis police said today that a 25-year-old man wielding a knife was shot and killed by two officers responding to calls about a convenience store robbery. The man had stolen energy drinks and pastry from the convenience store and was pacing around in front of the store when officers arrived, according to police and witnesses.

When confronted with police, the man reportedly told officers to ""shoot me now, kill me now"" repeatedly.

""The store owner and the alderwoman said the suspect was armed with a knife, acting erratically, pacing back and forth in the street, talking to himself,"" {said}<hyperlink=“http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-police-fatally-shoot-man-who-brandished-knife/article_85d27316-a17a-5e0a-b1d6-8a6753e2fcb2.html”> St. Louis City Police Chief Sam Dotson, who spoke to reporters at the scene of the incident.

According to Dotson, neither of the two officers at the scene were injured, and they have been put on administrative leave pending an investigation. An angry crowd had begun to gather at the scene while Dotson was speaking, {according to}<hyperlink=“http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-police-fatally-shoot-man-who-brandished-knife/article_85d27316-a17a-5e0a-b1d6-8a6753e2fcb2.html”> the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The incident {occurred in the city's Sixth Ward}<hyperlink=“http://mynews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/news/article.html/content/news/articles/cfn/2014/8/19/ferguson_shooting_st_louis.html”>, only miles east from where Michael Brown was shot on August 9.

The protests following that incident — now in their second week — show no sign of letting up, and the atmosphere in Ferguson has grown tenser by the night.

Monday night's demonstrations were the first for which the National Guard was deployed, though members of the Guard were nowhere to be seen on West Florissant Avenue, the epicenter of the protests. However, the police were out in full force.

According to arrest records obtained by {NBC News}<hyperlink=“http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/78-arrested-overnight-most-missouri-arrest-records-show-n184036”>, 78 people were arrested overnight, though authorities had originally claimed that only 31 had been arrested. Most of those arrested were from Missouri, though some were from as far away as New York and California, and nearly all of them were arrested for ""failure to disperse.""

Though Missouri Governor Jay Nixon called off the curfew on Monday, police were already trying to keep protesters from gathering early in the evening.

The protests continued peacefully until later in the night when police began attempting to disperse crowds with tear gas and other measures. Police were claiming they were being shot at and were having objects thrown at them, and have said they fired no shots themselves. 

""You are unlawfully assembling and you are subject to arrest and/or other measures,"" police repeatedly yelled at protesters through loudspeakers.

But there was no violence from protesters when police started responding — first with smoke, then with tear gas. 

The crowd on the street Monday night was slightly smaller than in previous days — largely because police had been trying to disperse protesters for hours already, making several arrests. Many people refused to clear the street, and some threw trash towards police. A man pulled up a ""yield"" street sign and dragged it to the middle of the street, refusing to leave.

As the tensions quickly exploded, police blocked off the two main access points to the street, telling people to ""disperse"" but effectively preventing them from getting home.

""We were told to head in this direction, there was tear gas shot in this direction,"" Jackson Brown, a local resident who found himself stranded on West Florissant Avenue as police started to push forward, told VICE News in frustration. ""Then we were pushing back this way and officials told us to go back the other way, where we were told to disperse.""

""You can't tell us to go this way, when this guy just told us to go this way,"" his friend added.

""Every night we're getting closer to someone getting killed,"" Cleo Willis, an elderly resident who was watching police from a sidewalk with tears in his eyes, told VICE News. ""Tonight might be the night. I hope I'm wrong.""

""What will tomorrow night bring?"" he added.

But with all the tension, solidarity is palpable across Ferguson. Volunteers from across the country have flocked to the area, and many have started donation drives to help local residents.

On Monday night, volunteers were handing out free hot dogs and giving words of support to protesters and residents alike. In a church near the area blocked off by police, residents have set up a ""safe space"" where people can find shelter when fleeing police gas, or when they are unable to go home because the streets are on lockdown.

Jess Luby, a young single mom from Minneapolis, told VICE News she drove nine hours to Ferguson with two friends — carrying gas masks, water, and milk and antacid to combat the effects of tear gas.

""We were watching a livestream of everything happening here, and decided that we couldn't sit in our kitchen crying at three in the morning, and so we got together and we were like, 'let's go,'"" she said, adding that she raised $500 for supplies from friends. ""You just have to go, and see what's happening, and help.""

""I'm just so sad and angry that this is happening,"" said Luby. ""The fact that they can take a community and turn it into a war zone, when people are trying to be peaceful, doesn't make any sense.""",150,NA,NA,NA

At the very least, things are more than a little tense right now, after police shot an killed Mike Brown, an unarmed, 18-year-old black man. Resulting protests have been quashed by force and journalists arrested, with all-important live feeds shut down by the police. Know what would help the country get a handle on what's going on? A drone.

Right now, we've been flooded with a deluge of snippets from the media, social media from on the ground, hogwash and analysis from talk radio schmoes, and an overall zoomed-in look on the protests that are occurring right now in Ferguson. This situation is begging for some perspective—on the scale of the protests, on the size. 

The police are shooting crowds with rubber bullets, they're arresting journalists and religious figures. {Protesters are throwing molotov cocktails at police}<hyperlink=“http://gawker.com/tear-gas-grenades-and-arrests-on-fourth-night-of-unre-1621469863”> and police are throwing tear gas canisters and pointing assault weapons right back at them. 

The work that journalists and citizens on the ground are doing to show this horrible situation to the world is laudable, but it's not enough. Aerial images could show the scope of the situation, the sheer numbers on each side, the destruction, the smoke, the flames, the police roadblocks in a way that people on the ground simply can't.

This is why it's such a huge deal that the Federal Aviation Administration issued a {no fly zone over Ferguson earlier this week}<hyperlink=“http://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_2599.html”>. The news helicopter might be on its last legs, but it's not dead, and getting them in the sky is crucial to bringing light to the situation. 

But, for all the FAA's hemming and hawing about them, small drones—model aircraft—aren't and haven't been subject to no fly zone restrictions. The FAA has said so itself.  {Just months after 9/11}<hyperlink=“http://www.scribd.com/doc/221623587/FAA-Letter-Post-9-11”>, the FAA said that ""Federal Aviation regulations do not apply to [drones] …general operating and flight rules do not apply to model aircraft.

Today I haven't been out. I had to go do a show in Memphis, and then I'll be back in St. Louis probably about two o'clock tomorrow. Last night, man, was probably one of the craziest nights of my life. I woke up, I had a regular day, we had a peaceful protest walking down the street, and then it escalated. The police brought out tanks and armored vehicles. By sundown the street looked like we were in a scene from Full Metal Jacket.

There's a lot of organized protests going on. I've organized a few myself. A few of the community leaders have organized some. It's not as chaotic as the mainstream media tries to portray. To be honest you can sit around in Ferguson for eight hours before you see an incident. The incidents usually occur when the police show up. Of course, the police are out always right now, but I mean when the armored trucks and the body armor and the tear gas and the rubber bullets come out, that's when the crowd just goes irate. People at this point are really attempting to push the peaceful protest aspect of it. A lot of people are ashamed by the riots, but at the same time, a few of us realize the only reason this thing got national coverage is because of the riot. So it's a double-edged sword. It was the ultimate outcry for help. I just think it's crazy the way that the Ferguson PD is treating its actual citizens at this moment it time. I can't even wrap my mind around it. I can't even find the words to describe the things that we're seeing on the ground.

The way St. Louis is designed—people don't understand that—the only thing that separates the county from the city is basically a line. You put your toe over it you're in the city, you put your toe over it you're in the county. We wouldn't consider Ferguson like its actual own subdivision even though it is.

You can't dodge it in St. Louis right now. Martial law was declared in Ferguson, so you can't avoid that in St. Louis. You can't drive into certain portions of north county. Highways are blocked off. People have seen tanks being brought into the downtown area to be used in Ferguson. Even though the violence and the police presence is omnipresent throughout the city, the closer you get to Ferguson you start noticing the brutality of the police state. All municipalities have been working in Ferguson, and that's just something that's pretty unprecedented.

For people like myself, the primary goal has been to give the younger people an outlet that makes sense to them without getting hurt. The older folks, they come out during the day, they do the marches, they pray, they sing, and then they go home. And we need the prayer, we need the marches, but the police state won't de-escalate if we don't confront it, so a lot of the young people have been finding ways to confront it and expose it rather than go home at night and let them have their way.

Sunday, when everything really hit the fan, we organized one of the earliest counter-protests that there was at the time, and there really was kind of a trickle effect. There was a press conference at the police station in the morning. A bunch of people went out there. They were outraged, they didn't know what to do, they were confused. Everybody was just lost. We had been out there a few hours at that point, and the church eventually came, and they put on their show. It was lights, camera, action. They took the stage over, and after that, they pretty much left. We had been out there for hours upon hours at that time, and people were getting restless, and people really just wanted some answers. Which we still haven't gotten the answers. We decided that we were going to cut off traffic in front of the police station and we were just going to sit down in the middle of the street. And for the duration of that day no traffic would be allowed to flow through in front of the police station.

It started with two regular guys. I don't even know their names. They were standing in the street, and they were like 'you know, we're going to stand here and block traffic.' And we didn't know what to do. Nobody knew what to do, and I saw those two guys standing in the street. And I told all my friends 'let's just go support these dudes.' Initially people were shocked by it. They were like 'you guys need to get out of the street. The police are going to shoot you.' The police chief himself asked us to get out of the street, and we replied to him 'you left Michael Brown in the street for four and a half hours, so we're not getting out of the street.' We sat down. State [senator] Maria Chappelle-Nadal ended up joining us, and it became one of the first signs of people exercising their right to assemble peacefully. But unfortunately, that was also the same night that the vigil was held over at Canfeld on the same street that Michael Brown was shot on. And that exploded into a riot.

The police have been very aggressive over there. I kind of knew that was going to happen because I was there the night before—literally a few moments after his body was picked up—and the police aggression was still there. I think the police might have thought that once they got his body off the street that people might have declined from engaging them and go in the house and calm down. But you have to understand, people literally saw this kid laying in the street for almost five hours. He didn't have a weapon. Everybody in the community knows he wasn't a thug. I didn't know him personally, but my brother knew him. My brother called me crying because he was like 'this is the last person that you would have to shoot this many times.' It's just a real tragic incident.

I've been out every day. I don't even have a voice any more. I've got to go do some shows, and my voice is gone. We've been out, sun up [to] sundown. I've seen it grow from bad to unimaginable.

Last night, they locked up all Antonio French, who is one of the leading voices in the media for the counter movement to be positive, to have a peaceful protest. I’ve been trying to follow his lead with the social media and informing people across the nation and on a worldwide level what’s happening. I think we both understood that it’s important to get on social media and expose what’s happening because it’s the only tool we have here. We can’t fight back. We can’t punch back. We have to show the brutal nature of what they’re doing. I firmly believe with all of my heart that Ferguson is working on a massive cover-up. That’s the primary reason we haven’t gotten any facts. They’re building this story. They’re crafting it. They’re vetting the witnesses. They’re vetting their witnesses. They’re coming up with things to discredit certain aspects of Mike Brown’s personality. They’re going to try to run his name through the mud and they may not even charge the officer at the end of the day. But you know, last night, they locked up Antonio and prior to them locking Antonio up we had a peaceful assemble. People came out. Of course, people are angry because you just killed an innocent teenager so you have to allow people to be angry. But at the same time, we’re being peaceful.

[tweetbegin 498293870833463296 tweetend]

The hottest area in the entire thing is the area where—the QuickTrip. The QuickTrip has become this weird, cosmic cathedral type of place. It’s almost like holy ground. Young Jeezy came there the other day and took a picture in front of the QuickTrip. We were out there last night when the cops came with the tanks and the M-16s. I saw some people I’ve been knowing all of my life—for 15 years or better—standing there by armored trucks with M-16s pointed at their chests. They don’t have guns. They have their hands up. They’re not being belligerent. They’re not being irate. And they have these weapons pointed at them. Right now, to be honest, I’m really upset because I feel like the police force is mocking us. I feel like, you know, we’re assembling in peace and they’re mocking the fact that we can’t fight back with weaponry. I’ve seen pictures where they aim guns at people and another officer stands to the side with their hands in the air, mocking the chant that we’ve been chanting. The “Hands up, don’t shoot,” chant. At first, I was sad. I cried twice the day after the riots. I cried twice that morning. Now I’m angry at the fact that they’re doing this as if they can get away with it. It took it from me feeling personal about Mike’s death to now I feel personal about the demise of the Ferguson Police Department. People like myself absolutely will not stop until we gain progress on making them pay for this. Even if they do whatever they’re going to do in the judicial system and they don’t charge the officer, the community will absolutely guaranteed that the Ferguson Police Department pays for this. I can vow with every breath in my body that everything I do will be aimed at that they pay for mocking us, for killing one of our own. I really mean that.

This isn’t a new issue. The culture of St. Louis is, for black males, you can drive in the city. You might get pulled over but for the most part, if everything’s cool—you don’t have any warrants and you’re not breaking any laws to a crazy degree—you’ll be okay. But in St. Louis County, no matter what you do, no matter how squeaky clean you are, there’s still a chance that you’ll go to jail. There’s still a chance that they’ll beat you. There’s still a chance that they’ll plant drugs on you. City cops do the same, but they’re a little bit more discreet with it. County cops have absolutely no range of morality and it’s been a problem for years. It’s not a brand new problem. There are cops that told my father, “I didn’t you, but I’m going to blow your son’s brains out.” And it’s just acceptable.

One thing I really wanted to say, too, is that St. Louis isn’t really that unified of a city. There’s a lot of segregation amongst us in St. Louis. For different reasons—not just racial—it’s a segregated city. The thing what I like about St. Louis is that when it’s go time, we know how to pull it together. The fact that you have unarmed citizens, for the most part, be escalating a military-type police force should speak volumes to the world. Of course, they get on the news and they say that the citizens are shooting and the citizens are doing this, but for the most part—and no one has as many guns as they have, there is no way we can match their weaponry. Even if one or two people do shoot, it doesn’t even remotely equal up to the amount of brute force they have. What you have is people linking together and bonding together and running out this military-like police force. On the ground, it’s actually quite amazing to witness, and that’s the aspect of this that I hope we can carry on into the future. The unity aspect. The sticking together aspect. I hope that’s the lesson we ultimately learn from this.

On Friday, local police named Darren Wilson as the killer while also releasing footage that they claimed showed Michael Brown stealing from a local convenience store called the Ferguson Market. Yesterday, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and announced that a curfew would be enacted from 12 to 5 AM. {VICE News is on the ground in Ferguson with more updates}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/topic/ferguson”>. What follows is a lightly edited transcript of Tef Poe's conversation with Noisey's Kyle Kramer describing his impressions from yesterday.]

It's a little bit more festive than it was when I left to go do the show in Memphis. People are happier. There are more and more people coming out every day, and people seem to have a very resilient spirit. I can't really describe it. It's just a very wide open energy, a very positive energy. It's just a very community-based type of spirit. People are bringing [bottled] waters out. There are massive amounts of food out. Everyone's looking out for the children, helping the senior citizens that are out. And people are really pushing to keep this thing peaceful and also just show the Ferguson police department and the St. Louis County police department that we're not going anywhere overnight and that this won't be a fly-by-night type of thing.

It's a very powerful feeling, and I wish that I could really share it with other people because it's really what this thing is all about, is just people being unified from all different creeds and colors and backgrounds and genders and economic backgrounds. People are just united, and it's unlike anything I've ever witnessed.

Yesterday was a very crazy day. There was a series of marches up and down West Florissant. It started out with Jesse Jackson leading a march in the morning. I was taking photos and catching some video clips of that, but I didn't stay for the speech.

One thing that's very interesting to me is that the New Black Panther Party has been on the ground out here. They were on the ground yesterday, and they were one of the main groups of people helping push back on the curfew. Early in the day, when the curfew got announced, you could hear and feel that people were really taking that personally, and more and more people started to set up campsites and places that they were going to post up for the duration of the day and the night.

It started to rain. There was a really bad thunderstorm, and I thought this would cause people to go in. [But] people began to march up and down the street in the rain. I believe that if it didn't rain, we might have been looking at a different scenario on the first night of the curfew getting issued. There's no way to gauge how people would have responded. But it was like a scene of a movie. All you saw was hundreds upon hundreds of people in the streets marching while it's raining, people on a bullhorn encouraging people to stay out. I don't even think the police could have predicted that.

[tweetbegin 500818348347633664 tweetend] 

Folks had to go in because we couldn't stay out there in the current conditions. There were rumors that the police were going to use real bullets instead of rubber bullets this time. Jay Nixon basically said “clear the streets by any means necessary,” and that was the tone. So people all up and down the street on bullhorns at different stations telling people “look, you've got to get out of the street tonight. It's not going to be safe. If you have warrants, you will be arrested.” Of course, naturally, some folks pushed back at the cops and didn't go in, and by the end of the night they did tear gas West Florissant. But by that point there weren't that many people out there.

People didn't want to [go home], but we did. Most people stayed up until the very last second, until you could no longer stay any more. And I'm usually a big advocate of staying out and resisting a rule that they try to establish, but even I said “it's time to fall back.” I'm usually out 'til three or four, even five or six o'clock in the morning. But I knew that they weren't playing with this one, so it was time to pack it up and go in. I just feel like we've dealt with the tanks and the armored vehicles enough, and if we could go around that without having to deal with, then let's just be smart about it. We know how they're going to bring it, so it's kind of up to us to be a little bit smarter. You can only keep saying “they're shooting me with rubber bullets” so much before someone's like “we'll strategize around that.” So that's where I'm at with it.

[tweetbegin 500864140597264384 tweetend] 

I think the older people are responding to Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton more so than the younger people. And that just shows you the difference in the styles of protesting. I think the younger folks are more radical, in-your-face with it, and I think the older folks are a little more old school, community and church-based protesters.

This is still very early in the process. We haven't even really begun the real fight.

I think right now the key demand, of course, is the arrest of Darren Wilson, but aside from that, it's just also a push for more information, period. They haven't released how many times Mike Brown's been shot. There are certain key elements of the story that appear to be withheld from the public for intentional reasons. And we're really just trying to push to get more transparency from the police department about the ordeal. When they put the tape out of [Michael Brown] at the Ferguson Market, the community didn't respond to that in the most positive way because they felt as if it was a slander tactic on behalf of the Ferguson police department.

[tweetbegin 500780406225244160 tweetend] 

So now we're just looking for a bridge of communication between the community and the Ferguson PD. They just don't appear to really showcase very much compassion in regards to the situation, and they still seem to be stuck on this path of villainization of the victim or of protection for Darren Wilson. It just seems as if they're trying to shield him from the people, shield him from the media. We still don't know much about him. He's kind of a mysterious figure at this point. I think people are just looking for answers in those regards: Tell us more about the police officer that pulled the trigger, tell us more about the autopsy findings, and we really just want the murder charge for Darren Wilson. I think if you want to calm the streets down, get people to finally go back in the house, and maybe restore the order, I think it really begins with a murder charge for Darren Wilson.

[As far as the highway patrol's presence], there's either extreme policing or no policing at all. There's no in-between. There's no medium. So during the day when the peaceful protests are going on and it's sort of like a party and everyone's really sharing this ginormous community spirit, you don't see any police officers. As nighttime comes about, more officers come out of the shadows, and things begin to get a little bit more intense.

[tweetbegin 500811746186387456 tweetend] 

Yesterday I was out there when the highway patrol captain walked through the crowd. I introduced myself to him, and a few people in the community asked him questions. He's giving straight-up answers. I won't say that he's not giving us straightforward answers, but, at the same time, he's working for a system that's broken, so he represents that system. I think in the media they make him appear to be a bit more of a champion than the people are making him. Folks aren't really as crazy about him as it might appear on CNN.

I was watching CNN in my hotel room in Memphis, and all I saw were these news clips of people clapping and celebrating and doing cartwheels because he arrived. And when I got to the grounds, I noticed a few things immediately: I didn't see him; I barely saw any highway patrol. And when he got there, people weren't confrontational, but they wanted some answers for things. A lot of people wanted to know last night how he could let the curfew situation happen without being vocal about it in the public media. A lot of people also wanted to know how he could let the tape of Michael Brown in the Ferguson Market to be released the same day as the police officer's name. He gave a few people some answers, but it was really more of a patch-up answer. Even though, like I said, he really does seem to be a sincere person—when you meet him, he has a very sincere energy—at the same time, he took the oath of the badge, so you know a portion of what he's saying is in the name of protecting the police as well.

[tweetbegin 500903155559698432 tweetend]

Last night, they started to tear gas the protestors that didn't go in after curfew. Initially they said it was smoke bombs, [alderman] Antonio French got hit with it, and he put a video on Vine. A few other people were getting hit, and it was obviously tear gas and not smoke. So I think they ended up having to recant that statement and admit that it was tear gas. Once again, another broken promise.

Vice,vice8,http://www.vice.com/read/everything-wrong-with-police-has-been-on-display-in-ferguson-818,Everything Wrong With Police Has Been on Display in Ferguson,Lucy Steigerwald,08/18/14,05/19/16,"After Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot {18-year-old Michael Brown}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/why-not-assume-the-worst-after-missouri-police-shot-unarmed-black-teen-michael-brown-811”> on August 9, the cops’ reaction provided a neat snapshot of just about every dangerous aspect of policing in modern America.

For starters, there’s the reliable archetype of the racist cop. Brown, though he allegedly stole cigarellos from a convenience store not long before he died, was not stopped over a theft report. The weak jaywalking excuse for a police stop adds a flavor of profiling which angers people further, and makes the racial element of the shooting more pronounced. In Ferguson, the numbers suggest that {black individuals are targeted for police stops more than whites}<hyperlink=“http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/how-much-racial-profiling-happens-in-ferguson/378606/”>. A few of their cops also once {beat a 52-year-old man}<hyperlink=“http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie.html”>, then charged him for damaging their uniforms with his blood. Brown himself may have been a dumbass teenager who committed a strongarm robbery, but now he can never grow up to be better than that.

The police showed up like an army, thereby antagonizing the mostly peaceful crowds, both before and after looting began on August 10. This reaction, where store owners often got screwed by the mob but the peaceful, pissed off folks got their First Amendment rights violated, underlined another major problem with the police: Aren’t they violating {Posse Comitatus by now}<hyperlink=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act”>? {Men in SWAT gear that resembles paramilitary garb}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/ferguson-photos_n_5674573.html”> may bust down the doors of various suspected drug criminals at night, but that mostly goes without video evidence (when there are exceptions to that, {people tend to be shocked}<hyperlink=“http://www.theagitator.com/2012/02/05/another-drug-raid-video-from-columbia-missouri/”>, even when it’s a normal drug raid). Seeing a roadblock that belonged in the Middle East during a weekday afternoon in Missouri was jarring to people just starting to grasp its new normalcy.

Yet another strike against the Ferguson Police was their incredible opacity after one of their own killed. They enforced a curfew, and then took six days to release the name of Wilson. They did everything they could to block media attention. On Sunday night, a SWAT officer screamed “Turn off that light! Get down!” and then “Get the fuck out of here!” at a student who was broadcasting live radio. The officer, allegedly pointing a gun, also yelled what sounds like: “Get that light out of here, or you’re getting shot with this.” Some outlets—{including Mediaite}<hyperlink=“http://www.mediaite.com/tv/get-the-fck-out-of-here-ferguson-police-threaten-reporter/”>—thought the cop yelled “or you’re getting shot in the face.” Others say the cop might have been yelling “getting shelled with this” instead of “shot.” Regardless, it was bad.

The Huffington Post’s Ryan Reilly and the Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery were detained on August 13. The same night, {an Al-Jazeera American crew was teargassed}<hyperlink=“http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/6001193/al-jazeera-journalists-teargassed-by-security-forces-in-ferguson”>, and fled, and then cops were seen taking down their camera equipment. {On the evening of August 17, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes}<hyperlink=“http://gawker.com/ferguson-police-threaten-to-shoot-reporter-and-mace-chr-1623125660”> was threatened with a macing if he crossed a police line. Reporters with Sports Illustrated, the Telegraph, and the Financial Times {were cuffed for a few minutes by Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, a man who}<hyperlink=“http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/263931/more-journalists-arrested-in-ferguson/”> some had cheered as a good cop when he took command of law enforcement in Ferguson. That same good cop’s underlings also lied about using teargas while they were using teargas over the weekend.

And though the Ferguson PD has two body cameras and two dash cams, none of them are installed yet—reportedly {due to the high cost involved}<hyperlink=“http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/ferguson-dashcams/”>. Four cameras for 18 cruisers and 53 officers is unacceptable even without that additional fuck-up.The police department does, however, have a Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected vehicle and a whole bunch of other gear that was made for the streets of Afghanistan and Iraq.

The mainstream media has been taking multiple angles on the Ferguson backlash, and the militarized police one seems to be the easiest to swallow. {Sen. Rand Paul}<hyperlink=“http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”>, {Rep. Hank Johnson}<hyperlink=“http://thehill.com/policy/defense/215160-lawmaker-drafting-bill-to-stem-flow-of-tanks-and-m16s-to-police”>, and a few other politicians are now demanding an end to the Pentagon’s 1033 program that helps even small police departments get war gear. But {in June, a suggested amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act}<hyperlink=“http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/08/militarization-police-force-ferguson-congress?mbid=social_twitter”> could have done just this, and it was soundly rejected by most Democrats and Republicans alike. Both parties apparently prefer things the way they are.

The drama of protest-porn photography tends to distract people from serious policy questions. So, indeed, do the folks who always think those damn hippies/anarchists/thugs—meaning black people—deserved it, so there’s no need to hold police to a higher standard. News is easy, and fixing things is hard. We’ll see whether Ferguson’s anger can continue to sustain itself, and whether the attention span of the public, who really do lead (while politicians follow when it’s safe), is good enough to turn this outrage into reform.

Perhaps they were in danger, but that was their own damn faults. Officers Eric Wasierski and Edwin Perez shot Westcott, who was holding a pistol, after busting down his door in a pot raid. Wescott, 29, purchased the gun after being robbed, and had reportedly been urged by police to get a weapon to defend himself. Approximately $2 worth of pot, and some paraphernalia, was found in the home. One hundred dollars in sales of a plant to an informant lead to cops “justifiably” shooting a man down in his own home, in front of his boyfriend. That’s your drug war.

Vice,vice9,https://news.vice.com/article/there-was-a-state-of-emergency-in-ferguson-long-before-saturday,There Was a State of Emergency in Ferguson Long Before Saturday,Natasha Lennard,08/18/14,05/19/16,"On {Saturday}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/article/state-of-emergency-and-curfew-in-ferguson-after-tensions-flare-again”>, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon {declared a state of emergency in Ferguson}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/article/missouri-governor-orders-national-guard-to-ferguson”>. The following day, Nixon confirmed emergency status by {calling in}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/article/missouri-governor-orders-national-guard-to-ferguson”> the National Guard — the mark of a domestic crisis.

But what does it mean to declare a state of emergency? In practical terms, the invocation of ""emergency"" by a politician is not just a description — it does something. Specifically, emergency declarations enable the authorities to deploy extraordinary state powers and restrict ordinary rights and liberties. In Ferguson, Nixon's declaration of emergency was delivered with his (doomed) imposition of a nighttime curfew.

I see a lot of problems with what gets to be, officially, an emergency. The issue begins with unfinished sentences. We are not explicitly informed for whom, or for what, this is a state of emergency. It is not enough to answer “{Ferguson}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/topic/ferguson”>.” A reality in which police officers shoot dead unarmed black teens with apparent impunity is already a state of emergency — for unarmed black teens. The people of Ferguson who took to the streets in response to Michael Brown's death declared as much.

But the governor did not proclaim that an ""emergency.""

Indeed, the ongoing state of emergency for black youth facing police violence in this country was not declared by state heads following the deaths of Oscar Grant in Oakland, New York's Ramarley Graham and Kimani Gray, LA's Ezell Ford — a mentally ill 25 year old killed by police days after Brown's death — or so many others.

The fact that protests are met with stun grenades, lungfuls of tear gas, and M4 rifles is an emergency for constitutional rights to free speech and assembly. But this emergency likewise was not declared by Nixon.

Instead, a number of other factors have earned Ferguson its official ""emergency"" status. For one, the authorities in Missouri are facing a crisis of reputation, which, following the failure to quell unrest with an ""operational shift"" at the end of last week, reached emergency levels over the weekend. The public relations disasters of arrested journalists, warrior cops, and tear gas did not provoke an immediate declaration of emergency. Rather, the ""emergency"" lies, I believe, in the realization that rightful rage in Ferguson will not be contained. The curfew was ignored. People did not go home. As was the case with the Los Angeles riots in 1992, the risk of calling in the National Guard — of admitting that authorities already on the ground did not have control — was deemed worth it.

Nixon explicitly attributed the calling of the National Guard to ""deliberate, coordinated, and intensifying violent attacks on lives and property in Ferguson."" Pause for a moment on the immediate juxtaposition, as if of equal import, of ""lives and property."" Consider too, that while property has been damaged and stores have been looted, claims of civilian-on-civilian shootings have not been confirmed. And so the difference now, what gets to be an ""emergency,"" is the intensified threat to property.

On this point, I agree with writer Raven Rakia, who {noted in the New Inquiry}<hyperlink=“http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/black-riot/”> long before the Ferguson unrest:

Nothing gets the attention of the elite like taking away or destroying what they value above all else: property. In America, property is racial. It always has been…. For 300 years, the very idea of a black person's freedom was a direct threat to white men's property…. When property is destroyed by black protesters, it must always be understood in the context of the historical racialization of property. When the same system that refuses to protect black children comes out to protect windows, what is valued over black people in America becomes very clear.

It seems relevant here that the word ""emergency"" derives from the Latin, emergere, to arise or bring to light. In fealty to original meaning, we can see that to talk about a state of emergency is to recognize an incontrovertible bringing to light in Ferguson. The underlying situation — the racism, the police violence and militarization, the fierce response to dissent, the government's treatment of black youth as threats, the government's fear of black anger — is not new. For those of us whose daily existence does not include reminders of these facts, attention on the streets of Ferguson over the passed week has brought them to them to light.

While Nixon's declared state of emergency has, I believe, to do with order and property, a more general state of emergency is worth more attention. Namely, that the worst violence we're seeing in Ferguson is not emergent, but constant. ",59,NA,NA,NA
Vice,vice10,http://motherboard.vice.com/read/reddits-gun-community-take-aim-at-novice-over-militarized-police-in-ferguson-0814,Reddit's Gun Community Takes Aim at 'Novice' Over-Militarized Police in Ferguson,Brian Merchant,08/14/14,05/19/16,"The photo above, which features a camouflaged police officer sitting atop a mine-resistant armored truck in Ferguson, Missouri, with a decked-out rifle, has been widely circulated {as evidence}<hyperlink=“https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/14/militarization-u-s-police-dragged-light-horrors-ferguson/”> of {how militarized}<hyperlink=“http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/08/14/mine-resistant-armoured-trucks-military-grade-rifles-why-are-police-treating-ferguson-missouri-like-its-a-war-zone/”> the American police force has become. To the trained eye, it's also suggestive of how poorly prepared those police are to be militarized. 

Reddit's gun aficionados are pointing out that the rifle is so loaded with conflicting gadgets—a flashlight, ""red dot"" sight, bipod—that it demonstrates that the officer probably isn't very familiar with using it. One user, who owns two similar weapons, called it a ""novice"" setup. Others called it ""goofy,"" ""HORRIBLE,"" and a ""waste of taxpayer dollars."" It's also part of a trend—many of the rifles being used in Ferguson have the same setup, which baffles the gun owners and enthusiasts over at r/Guns. 

""[I]t's a really goofy and impractical setup. If that is a standard configuration then they are wasting a lot of money for no other reason than to look like characters from Call of Duty,"" {thereddaikon}<hyperlink=“http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/2djqd6/hey_all_im_a_reporter_trying_to_identify_as_many/cjq6iio”> wrote. 

Like countless other Americans, I've watched with awe and horror the events unfolding in the small St. Louis suburb of 21,000 people. I saw mine-proof vehicles, flash bang grenades, rifles, and tear gas being deployed against unarmed protestors, so I set out to write about the range of technology the civilians were up against. 

I'm not a gun expert, however, so {I turned to Reddit's r/guns forum}<hyperlink=“http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/2djqd6/hey_all_im_a_reporter_trying_to_identify_as_many/”>, which has been very helpful in the past, for some background. I asked if they could tell me what kind of gun the officer in the photo was using. The response—on the thread, and in direct messages—was nearly immediate, and certainly unexpected. 

""Probably an AR10 style rifle in 308. It could be chambered in 5.56 NATO,"" user ToxDoc wrote. ""That set up would actually be kind of goofy, if the whole thing weren't so screwed up.""

Another, Prettyniceguytoo, chimed in soon after: ""That's actually hilarious. Reminds me of {this classic picture}<hyperlink=“https://www.tactical-officer.com/files/backward2.jpg”>.”


""He seems to be using high powered optics... for relatively short/medium range,"" Prettyniceguytoo wrote. ""He has a flashlight, a bipod but is using a tripod and has a red dot sight mounted at the front of his gun on a 45 mount on the wrong side of the gun. Also, it's usually best to shoot without wearing a helmet that gets in the way but that's forgivable.""

""All in all, this guy looks like a goof and I'd be amazed if he was even capable of aligning his scope and rifle,"" the user went on. ""Also, the fact he's wearing Marine camouflage (MARPAT) shows just how militarized their police force is."" 

In other words, it's evidence that many police in Ferguson have little idea how to use the weapons tech they've loaded onto their guns. They also referenced other officers carrying similar weapons as evidence that ""it seems it's a standard (HORRIBLE!) setup for them."" Perhaps this is part of the reason that {the FBI had to be called in}<hyperlink=“http://rt.com/usa/180360-police-louis-policing-ferguson/”>.

User IrishCherokee agreed: ""He has no justifiable need for at least half the stuff he has. It would be his prerogative to do this on his own time and dollar... and sure, we would still make fun of him.... but the fact that he is a public servant blatantly wasting tax dollars to mistreat his neighbors that adds to the tragedy of the setting. The word mallninja comes to mind.""

""I want to know how that cop can even see that red dot he has on that 45 [degree] mount,"" FubarFreak wrote.

""The gun is set up with equipment for vastly different roles, thus making it it heavy and unwieldy,"" ToxDoc said. 

""It looks like he can't decide if he will shoot multiple people quickly from 20 yards away in the dark or one person carefully from 500 yards away in the blindingly bright sunlight,"" IrishCherokee wrote.

You're getting the picture. The police officer appears to be in way over his head with a weapon he is, at best, not familiar with or fully prepared to use. It's the same phenomenon at play in the image that Prettyniceguytoo linked to above, which features an NYPD officer peering through a sight on his rifle that's on backwards. 

This, of course, is in keeping with what you'd expect when police departments are {handed down weapons from the Pentagon}<hyperlink=“http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-michael-brown-militarization-column/14006383/”>, as part of a program that redistributes military arms and tech across the country for domestic use. This is, in part, what makes the militarization of police forces so scary—not just the sheer quantity and advanced nature of the arms, but the fact that the departments aren't trained to use them properly. 

""A lot of new, inexperienced soldiers do that too,"" DBDude wrote, referring to the over-stuffed rifle. ""After a while of lugging around all that weight, the unnecessary stuff gets taken off."" 

Other redditors disagreed that the rig was goofy, and noted that the sight was on the wrong side was probably an optical illusion. Sausagedownatrain wrote that ""The reason it has a goofy set up may well be because he doesn't know what he's doing and he's shoved a few things too many on there or that is his rifle for everything... These things aren't there because he wants to have the best rifle and chance of killing as many ethnic minorities as possible. They're there to make him a better shooter so he can deal with any threats he needs to, whilst being less likely to accidentally hit something he's not meant to - ie a civilian.""

The whole exchange was illuminating, and it served as an opportunity to recognize how we in the media often oversimplify gun enthusiasts' ideas. Nobody on the ever-growing thread was overly eager to defend the PD, and no one was zealously pro-gun for pro-gun's sake. They were, by and large, critical of the way they saw the weapons being deployed. A few mocked me or were skeptical of my intent, which, fair enough—it's Reddit. And of course we should take the diagnoses of anonymous commenters with a grain of salt. 

But it was eye-opening nonetheless, and an important reminder that there likely were squads of police walking around Ferguson with weapons they don't know how to use—and that there will be again, next time demonstrations or protests are met with a militarized response.",NA,NA,NA,NA

On Monday, Governor Jay Nixon brought in the National Guard and ended the midnight curfew he imposed on the town over the weekend. The unrest may continue to escalate, but activists hope that protests in Ferguson will produce a greater movement and bring lasting change to the community.

Civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson sat down with VICE News to discuss the deep roots of frustration in Ferguson, the present upheaval, and the lasting change that can come out of it.

VICE News: Why do you think the situation in Ferguson has gotten so out of hand?
Rev. Jesse Jackson: The police have handled this so badly. They have not been transparent. The officer who did the killing has not been interrogated yet. He's still being protected, he's in hiding. It took six days to reveal his name, and even now that we know his name, and on Google you see his picture, {on the video}<hyperlink=“http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2014/08/18/newday-intv-ferguson-shooting-crenshaw.cnn.html”> you see his picture, he's not yet been subjected to interrogation. It seems like a kind of cover up, so it creates a gap of alienation and distrust, and that's a big factor in this.

Police held a press conference on Sunday night in which they said that there was no plan to bring in the National Guard, then less than an hour later the governor announced that it would in fact be called in…
See, when the law become lawless and distrustful, they have no moral authority. There is chaos. And now with an extra layer of military, the National Guard, I'm not sure what they can do except maybe create a perimeter. But the National Guard is not trained to handle sensitive people relationships. It's not what they do.

What do you think is going to come out of this?
It's very difficult to say, in the sense that, at one level, we have a community that's on the occupation, about a 70 percent African-American community without anyone on the school board, 53 police, three are African-American, hardly any on the fire department — almost none of them live in Ferguson, for example. They don't have a fair share of the contracts, they're living under a kind of legal looting — their jobs have been looted. If you had a 50 percent black and white police force, 50 percent black and white fire department, in contrast, you'd have a much fairer distribution of resources and a sense of shared territory, a sense of shared responsibility. But right now, police are seen as very hostile, and at some point the cup ran over, and this thing is simply spiraling out of control. My main concern is that Ferguson is just a metaphor for urban America.... The infant mortality rate is high, life expectancy is short, unemployment three or four times the national average, kids dropping out of school — they've lost their sense of hope and vitality. And unless there's a kind of commitment by the White House and the Congress to urban policy, to reconstruction, to revitalize hope, we stand a real chance unfortunately of this being replicated.

Apart from the clashes and violence, what kind of opportunity does Ferguson present for renewed activism? Walking around during the day, I've seen many expressions of political action and commitment.
In the case of Ferguson, if 5,000 blacks register to vote, they can completely change the political construction of the city. They have that power. This community has 21,000 people. So if 5,000 register to vote, they can determine the mayor — who appoints the police and fire chiefs, who issues contracts — the city council… They have the capacity to have a renewed, multiracial, multicultural city. And there are a number of whites who are predisposed in that direction. It's not all hostile and anti-black, that's not true. There is a possibility of building a governing coalition in Ferguson.

Do you see that hope emerging from the anger and frustration gripping Ferguson?
There's a lot of anger, but it must be directed. When the iron is hot, you can really reshape the iron, but you shouldn't pour the heat on yourself. Riots have a way of self-destructing and self-degrading. There are elements that tend to care less about an outcome, they want to simply vent. Most people who are marching are very focused on non-violence and discipline…. They want to see a full autopsy and they want to see it done quickly. They want some changes in the construction of the city's governing makeup — these people are very focused. There's another element that simply could care less about order. They've exhausted their capacity to make sound judgment, and my fear is that if police feel on the tight, they're gonna fight back, and God forbid somebody gets hurt or killed in that process. We can just hope and pray that that does not happen. But with so many guns, and so many explosives, something is bound to happen.

Everyone in Ferguson is telling us that these tensions have been simmering for a long while before Michael Brown's shooting…
People have adjusted to the injustice. One thing worse than oppression is to adjust to it. And some people become maladjusted, in the sense that we share quietness. Quietness is the absence of noise, peace to presence of justice. There are relatively few people calling out for justice and fairness. If you have on a shoe that is too small for your foot, for a while you can make adjustments with your toes, but at some point blisters will set in, and pain, and now you see a lot of blisters, lots of pain, in that community.

And you think it's reached its breaking point?
In Ferguson, this is a defining moment for Missouri. It's a test for the governor's leadership. He has not done very well. It is a test for the police, the occupiers' leadership. They have botched it badly. Since it's so broadly covered by the media, you could have replications across the country. I hope that does not happen. But I do know that the sense of disgust, the sense of disappointment, is very prevalent.

What do you think about President Obama's response so far?
Well, when the journalists were arrested, he did respond at that time. He sent in the FBI, and the Department of Justice is investigating. So far that's about all he really can do at this stage, except to look at the implications of the gap between those who have surplus and those who have deficits, and begin to think through some kind of reconstruction, comprehensive urban policy, to remove these conditions of darkness around the country.",18,NA,NA,NA

Ten days ago, {the people of Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/article/raw-coverage-ferguson-missouri”>, had no idea how to help someone who's having a panic attack because they've been pepper sprayed, how to flush a tear gas victim's eyes with a mixture of equal parts Maalox and water, or how to get the lingering effects of tear gas off their clothes. 

Now, they're old pros, in part thanks to a network of volunteers and organizations from as far away as Australia and Palestine who have dealt with police brutality and abuse in the past.

""I don't think any community, at least in the US, is equipped to deal with getting tear gassed by the people who are supposed to be helping them,"" Kalaya'an Mendoza, an activist with Amnesty International who has been in {Ferguson for much of the last week}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/read/when-will-someone-fly-a-drone-over-ferguson”>, told me. ""Palestinians have been emailing and sending tips for dealing with tear gas that they use in their own struggle. When people post on Twitter that they've been tear gassed, people are speaking up and saying 'do this, not that.' It's fascinating to see how fast Twitter has figured out how to help.""

[tweetbegin 501584131235799040 tweetend]

Last night, Mendoza helped a journalist who was having trouble breathing after he'd been tear gassed. In Ferguson, there isn't really a street medicine brigade, with duct-taped red crosses on their shirts, as there were during the civil rights protests of the 1960s and the Occupy protests of a couple years ago. 

Instead, the general population has really taken it upon themselves to learn how to treat each others' medical maladies, with the help of Twitter (and people who have learned what to do thanks to Twitter). Mendoza says that if he hadn't been around to help the journalist, someone else likely would have been able to help him eventually.

""Being a street medic has become normalized within the scope of being an activist,"" he said.
 
That's in part, he says, a testament to the way Ferguson residents have banded together in the last week or so (and an unfortunate consequence of having this protest, and the police response to it, spill over into a second week) but it's also thanks to organizations such as the {Melbourne Street Medic Collective}<hyperlink=“http://melbsmc.org/”>, which has been organizing people on the ground from the other side of the world.

The collective, which earned its stripes during the height of Occupy, has been instrumental in developing health material that can be printed out and handed out to residents of the city.

""Over the last few years, we've seen a lot of shit, talked a lot of shit, and learned a lot of shit,"" a medic with the collective, who goes by the pseudonym John Zoidberg, told me in an email. ""We're no stranded to international solidarity and support … even if we can't have a presence on the ground, we can share guides on basic first air techniques.""

The Melbourne collective has been tweeting information about how to deal with panic attacks, directing people on the ground to injured people, and are generally helping in any way it can.

""We mightn't be able to do much but if we can take some of the pressure off the medics on the ground so they can focus on the critical tasks then I'd like to think we've done something positive,"" Zoidberg added.

Darren Wilson, a 6-year veteran of the force, is the officer, and he was placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation, officials said. Police had previously declined to name the officer, citing threats and concerns for his safety.

The shift was immediately felt on Thursday night, as the streets of Ferguson resembled the stage of a huge, loud street party rather than the ""war zone"" — as residents described it — of the earlier days.

Gone were the armored vehicles, the tear gas, and the hundreds of police officers in riot gear that had been arresting people on the same blocks just a day earlier.

The rage at the police killing of Brown was still there, no doubt, as was the anger towards police's aggressive crackdown on earlier protests. But officials had promised a shift in tactics and, at least on Thursday, they delivered.

As it turns out, dozens of police cars, tanks, and officers were on standby just a few blocks away — but they were virtually a no-show at the protest-turned-party.

Capt. Ronald Johnson of Missouri's Highway Patrol — newly in charge of policing the suburb after widespread criticism of the St. Louis county police's handling of the situation — made a quick appearance by the burnt down gas station that has become Ferguson's ""Ground Zero.""

""Of course they send a black man now,"" a bystander proclaimed, but with a smile. ""The whole world's watching now — who's gonna bring in tanks now?"" someone else chimed in.

Johnson greeted people, hugged some, then left — leaving a crew of young residents, including one in a Guy Fawkes mask, to direct the paralyzed traffic.

Not that traffic really mattered, as drivers joined in the rally by honking their horns endlessly well into Friday morning. As the night went on, drivers turned up their music and made their way through the streets, with dozens of teens sitting on roofs and hanging out of windows.

There were a couple scuffles here and there — but of the street carnival sort, and people sorted them out on their own.

Someone found a small train cart that was promptly filled with slightly intoxicated teens and paraded it through the streets. There was also a man on a horse.

""This is so surreal, I have never seen anything like this,"" Lance Taylor, 58, a Vietnam veteran who spent his whole life in the neighborhood, told VICE News while sitting on a sidewalk wall and watching the scene. ""I didn't come here to protest, I came here to safeguard. If I see an officer pushing around a woman or a child I will intervene. Now it's turned into a party, I don't think I'm needed.""

""No police, that's a good strategy. Let people get it out of their system, let them calm down,"" he added — noting that the festive atmosphere didn't mean people had forgotten Brown's death or the abuse of the last few days. ""The government figured out, 'this is not working for us.' So now they are letting the kids play…""

Ferguson still needs answers of course — and solutions to problems that run much deeper than the events of the last few days.

""I haven't seen my people come together like this in a long time,"" Leon Johnson, 28, told VICE News while sipping a beer. ""It means a lot. I hope it lasts.""

But Johnson, who is unemployed but hoping to go back to school to be a mechanic, said the community needs to deal with issues bigger than Brown — including systematic racism, growing poverty, and violence — and not only by police, he noted. He was down to party for the night, rather than getting tear gassed like the night prior, but he said many didn't forget someone died.

""People are trying to make a statement, saying they're gonna change things,"" he said, wondering how long that would last after the cameras left Ferguson. ""All police do is harass us, I doubt they will be more respectful now.""

""We never got this kind of attention,"" another guy pitched in. ""We'll see what happens after tonight.""",56,NA,NA,NA
Vice,vice15,https://news.vice.com/article/anger-is-boiling-over-in-ferguson-as-governor-brings-in-highway-patrol,Anger Is Boiling Over in Ferguson as Governor Brings in Highway Patrol,Alice Speri,08/14/14,09/01/16,"Governor Jay Nixon announced today that the Missouri Highway Patrol will be taking over control of policing in the town of Ferguson from St. Louis County police. Nixon also promised to ""step back a little bit,"" ""allowing more movement,"" and he would ""bring in a different tone.""

The governor said that a ""multidisciplinary team"" will continue to be on the ground — but did not specify whether that would include the SWAT teams that have been patrolling Ferguson's protests over the last few days.

He also declined to comment on whether mistakes were made, saying ""I'm not looking backwards.""

""But there will be resources on the ground if things get difficult,"" he said.

The strategic shift followed widespread condemnation of what many residents and observers described as a police-made escalation in the town on Thursday.

Capt. Ronald Johnson of Highway Patrol, who grew up in the area, promised a different approach.

""If you are gonna critique, critique me from today,"" he later told reporters. ""Before I came here today I had all my troopers take their tear gas masks off of their belt.""

Earlier today when meeting with members of the suburban {Ferguson}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/topic/ferguson”> community that's still trying to make sense of days of intense protests that have turned the town into a flashpoint for years of anger and racial segregation, Nixon promised a ""a solution that would bring justice and peace"" — before heading out for a photo op by shooting victim Michael Brown's makeshift memorial.  

Speaking to local residents gathered at a church on Thursday morning, Nixon called the events of the week following the shooting death of Brown, an unarmed teen, by police ""horrific,"" and promised ""operational shifts that are going to be necessary to make sure that this matter is brought to a peaceful resolution.""

""Sometimes in the complicated nature of facts and in the disparate way of opinions, folks sometimes sway away,"" he said, but conceded, ""there is a certain level of emotion that must be expressed.""

""Because we will not get the feeling that we need if the only response from the public is, 'just be quiet,'"" he said, adding that people had a ""right to speak in a peaceful manner, even if emotion is involved.""

However, St. Louis Pastor Freddy J. Clark told the governor that the community wanted the matter out of the hands of the state and turned over to ""higher authorities.""

""We don't trust this process anymore,"" he said, and as met by a standing ovation. ""I hope people are not in a hurry to put a lid on this… This has been a long time coming.""

""At the end of all this, the conversation that we should have been having years ago will finally take place,"" he added.

Flanked by her two small children, Sierra Smith, a local resident, angrily told the governor that, ""the police have no respect, at all, for the community.""

""We can't bring Michael back, we know that, all we ask for is for peaceful protest, all we ask for is to stop being treated like outsiders, because we live in this community,"" she said, adding that she and many others haven't even been able to get into their apartment complexes because of police presence. ""Something needs to change, people do have the right to protest. What we are asking is for the violence to stop, and that's coming from the police officers.""

Protests and clashes continued for the fourth night in a row in Ferguson overnight as community anger at the police shooting death of Brown escalated, fueled by people's indignation at police response to the protests.

Officers — many sent in from towns across the state — closed in on a peaceful march on Ferguson's main road on Wednesday afternoon after some demonstrators had sat down in the middle of the street and refused to leave. Later in the evening, police locked all entrances and exits to a residential area not far from where Brown was killed, firing tear gas at protesters on foot and in cars, as some demonstrators reportedly responded with Molotov cocktails.

Several people — including some reporters and community leaders — were arrested.

As the eyes of the country turned to the violence in this otherwise tranquil suburb of St. Louis, people in the streets continue to demand answers for the death of Brown — who was shot and killed this weekend by a still unnamed police officer, following an altercation of which the details are still being disputed — and expressed horror at the lack of official response to their treatment by police.

The St. Louis police department took over control of the area from the Ferguson police department — but Nixon was expected to relieve them of that responsibility after widespread criticism of their response.

But as police officers moved in with SWAT teams and armored vehicles once again, Ferguson residents said they had no desire for patience, and that the militarization of their neighborhood over the last few days would only prompt them to hit the streets again.

While the protests continued, some in Ferguson said they were trying to get back to normal. With businesses mostly closed and boarded up, many took a hit in the last days.

""We just need our peace,"" said Paul Simon, 29, who owns a pet store on Florissant Road, one of the streets that became stage to the riots of the last few days. Simon, like many in the area, kept his store closed following the looting — but came in again to check on his animals. ""My heart goes out to all the other businesses. It's like a small recession for them. This week was a ghost town over here.""

He said he condemns the destruction but understands people's anger.

""This community is still looking for answers. It was a nice little candle vigil, and then it just turned into something different,"" he said, adding that many of those doing the looting were not from the neighborhood. ""They were people out there to take advantage of the situation.""

Why are the Michael Brown protests sticking?
As a man standing by the burnt out shell of a QuikTrip gas station's store put it early on Wednesday, this was no longer ""only about Mike Brown.""

""This is years and years in the making, it was going to happen,"" said Andrew Rucker, 30, who lives in the area and has been coming out to the destroyed gas station every day this week. ""This is bigger than Mike Brown, this is years of saying that something is wrong. This is what happens when people are fed up. The violence is misguided, but this is what happens. And it's sadder that we had to lose a life. ""

Rucker, who was posing for pictures with a friend by the burned out station, spoke about a childhood friend of his that was also killed by police, and recounted some of his own contentious exchanges with officers.

He and many others put the blame on Ferguson's extreme racial segregation — and on the lack of black police officers and public officials in a largely black neighborhood. Three of Ferguson's 53 police officers are black, {according to Mother Jones}<hyperlink=“http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/10-insane-numbers-ferguson-killing”>.

""St. Louis is a racially charged powder keg. This is the result of not getting a fair shot, of anger, and of racism. It's so racist here, this is the most segregated city ever,"" he added, drawing an imaginary divide line in the air, Delmar Avenue, then pointing to those around. ""This side, it's the have-nots.""

The riots, he said, were just a matter of time.

The QuikTrip gas station on Florissant Road has become a pilgrimage site of sort, where people come to pose for photos, their hands raised up, in front of the gutted shell of the station. Groups of men gather by the gas pumps to rehash the developments of the last few days, and a man with a small child preaches passionately — to nobody in particular, and anyone that will listen — about the centuries of abuse endured by African-Americans.

Some spoke about turning the burnt out station into the set of a music video, and others showed up looking for a community-driven cleanup effort that had just moved a few blocks away. Meanwhile, nearby counselors offered support for traumatized residents.

""This is our Ground Zero,"" Rucker said.

Just minutes away from the station, on Canfield Drive, in the residential complex where Brown was killed, makeshift memorials became the gathering point for still stunned neighbors — some drinking beers next to teddy bears and signs demanding justice for Mike, and others watching their children play next to a handwritten sign that says ""beware killer cop on the loose.""

The conversation moves from boys who swear they know the officer that killed Brown, to those asking ""why didn't they just Taser him if he was so violent?"" Many still can't believe the world's sudden attention to this quiet residential road, while others are growing angrier as they recount what they heard of the dynamics of the incident for the hundredth time.

""He had his hands up,"" 25-year-old Tommy Keely, whose cousin was with Brown at the time of his killing, says over and over. ""They are saying we are hooligans, the people here are tripping. We're not doing anything, we're just protecting our rights.""

Kelly and other young men from nearby homes have been coming out to the memorial every day. ""We aren't going nowhere,"" he adds. ""If he beats his case, there are gonna be more and more riots,"" he promises, referring to the officer. ""If there were no riots, they would have swept it under the rug.""

""This isn't Trayvon Martin shit. Florida let that one slide,"" Rico Smove, 35, adds. ""But St. Louis, we are not letting them off this one.""",16,NA,NA,NA
Vice,vice16,http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/its-not-just-ferguson-protesting-police-violence-in-la-818,It’s Not Just Ferguson: Protesting Police Violence in LA,Charles Davis,08/18/14,09/09/16,"“From Ferguson to LA, killer cops have got to go,” nearly 1,000 people chanted on Sunday outside the headquarters of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) before marching through the city's gentrified downtown to protest a spate of law enforcement shootings that have killed unarmed people of color across the country.

While media attention has focused on the police riots in {Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=“http://www.courant.com/news/data/hc-military-equipment-sent-to-connecticut-towns-20140814,0,6213133.htmlpage”>, following the police killing of an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown, police in America's second largest city have also been shooting brown people left and right.

On August 11, for example, LAPD officers shot and killed a 25-year-old black man named Ezell Ford who family members say suffered from mental illness—and who cops claim reached for an officer's gun, the same claim police in Ferguson have used to justify killing 18-year-old Michael Brown. A week earlier, four blocks away, cops from the same devision {allegedly beat to death}<hyperlink=“http://ktla.com/2014/08/14/lapd-officers-fatally-beat-father-during-traffic-stop-a-week-before-ezell-ford-shooting-family-says/”> 37-year-old Omar Abrego, a father of three, in front of his home.

“The cops are killers,” Abrego's widow told the crowd at Sunday's rally. “They're not supposed to be killing people,” she said, “leaving their kids without the love of their dad. That's not right.”

Over the last 12 months, 39 people have been killed by deputies from either the LAPD or Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office, which has jurisdiction over unincorporated parts of the city. That comes out to almost one killing every two weeks, and while not all the victims were unarmed, nearly all were black or Latino, according to a {database of homicides}<hyperlink=“http://homicide.latimes.com/officer_involved/true”> compiled by the Los Angeles Times.

Since 2000, more than {538 people}<hyperlink=“http://homicide.latimes.com/officer_involved/true/year/all”> have been killed by LA police. Nationwide, a black man is killed by either police or vigilantes {every 28 hours}<hyperlink=“http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/1-black-man-killed-every-28-hours-police-or-vigilantes-america-perpetually-war-its”>.

It's in the wake of that violence, disproportionately directed toward poor communities of color, that hundreds of people—young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian—took to the streets of downtown LA demanding community control over those tasked with policing their communities.

“This is an issue of white supremacy,” said one speaker, to ravenous applause, with whom it is hard to argue: While police killings are a major issue in communities of color, white America is generally oblivious. Charlie Beck, for instance, {was reappointed}<hyperlink=“http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/1-black-man-killed-every-28-hours-police-or-vigilantes-america-perpetually-war-its”> to another five-year term just days after the killing of Ezell Ford, and the 188 people who have been killed by the police under his watch considered less scandalous to the political and media establishment than the fact that Beck helped push the LAPD to {buy a horse}<hyperlink=“http://www.latimes.com/local/cityhall/la-me-beck-horse-20140807-story.html#page=1”> from his daughter.

That reappointment may have been on the minds of the crowd when one speaker urged those gathered to take their fight from the streets to the ballot box. “We need to vote blue,” she said, eliciting a few groans but absolutely nothing in the way of applause. The problem for the speaker was that most of those listening to her had probably already tried that: voting Democrat. Like nearly every major city in America, Los Angeles is dominated by the Democratic Party, with a Democratic mayor and a Democratic city council. And there they were on Sunday, because all of those people had failed them.

California also has a Democratic governor who has tried to block the release of non-violent offenders from the state's {overcrowded prisons}<hyperlink=“http://www.salon.com/2014/01/16/our_demented_public_safety_priorities_how_non_violent_offenders_attract_more_concern_than_natural_disasters/”>, while over in Missouri, a Democrat has imposed a curfew on those protesting police brutality, all while a Democratic president sits back and calls for calm on both sides—{while arming just one}<hyperlink=“http://www.courant.com/news/data/hc-military-equipment-sent-to-connecticut-towns-20140814,0,6213133.htmlpage”>—a policy he has stuck to from Peoria {to Palestine}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/israels-war-on-gaza-is-it-genocide-813”>.

Of the 1,000 or so who gathered outside LAPD headquarters, not one was a politician.

And that's why the people were forced to take to the streets: to send a message not just to the police, but to those in political office who are paying their checks.

“I'm out here to show them that it's not right—that black lives matter,” one woman told me. “Their lives matter,” she said, flanked by her two young children, “and just because the police are authorities does not give them the right to take innocent black lives.”

The woman's daughter held a sign that said “Don't Shoot” while just behind her, LAPD deputies on motorcycles brought up the rear of the march. Young and optimistic, she looked on the bright side of being murdered by the police. “At least when people die,” she said, “they go to heaven.”",NA,NA,NA,NA

This isn’t the first time a local police force has turned an American city into something resembling a war zone in the name of civilian crowd control. In 1999, during the “Battle of Seattle” protests against the World Trade Organization, national headlines were accompanied by images like what we’re seeing out of Ferguson today: prrotesters being tear gassed and beaten by men in uniform. The Seattle chief of police was forced to resign in the wake of that debacle.

Since that time, former Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper has made an astonishing political transformation, not only owning up to his own mistakes at the WTO protests, but becoming a staunch advocate of reforming the police and {legalizing and regulating drugs}<hyperlink=“http://www.leap.cc/”>. I got in touch with Stamper to get his take on modern police culture and the militarization of law enforcement in Ferguson and across the country.

VICE: The images we've seen coming out of Ferguson over the last week are reminiscent of the ones we saw 15 years ago at the WTO protests in Seattle, when you were the police chief there. At that time, you almost immediately regretted your decision to use tear gas, flash bang grenades, and other military-grade hardware against the protesters, and resigned the day after the ministerial ended. What comes to mind as you watch the Ferguson police make essentially the same mistakes that you made?
Norm Stamper: A whole lot of heartbreak, and I have to admit to some irritation, and some righteous anger. It seems like the rest of the country is hell-bent—I think back to the Occupy movement, for example, and the May Day demonstration—that so many police departments seem to outdo themselves in not paying attention to the lessons of WTO. I made, personally, the biggest mistake of my career that week. If you’re looking for a prescription of what to do wrong, you need look no further.

I think with the advent of the drug war, which certainly preceded WTO in 1999, and, for that matter, 9/11, we still see something that is extremely troubling to me, and that is that in the name of the drug war, we continue to uniform, equip, and arm police officers as soldiers, and then commit them to early morning, sometimes pre-dawn drug raids, in which the target is somebody alleged to have a half a baggie of marijuana in the family home. And of course we’ve seen tragedy after tragedy result from that kind of mentality.

And then we get 9/11. I was retired roughly two years when 9/11 struck, and one of the things that was most unsettling to me was while we had a president who was saying “Bring ‘em on,” and talking tough and so forth, we were very slowly but surely sending a message to local law enforcement that this can happen in your community. Well, of course it can, but it hasn’t, nor is it likely to. That’s no reason, obviously, not to be prepared; it’s no reason not to do training exercises; it’s no reason not to have proper equipment on hand.

But what are the chances that it’s going to happen in Morven, Georgia, for example, which, as I understand it, is a department of about three people, who have acquired {millions of dollars}<hyperlink=“http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-impact-little-restraint-military-giveaways”> of federal military surplus? There’s a small town in Texas with one officer. He’s the chief, he’s the patrol officer, he’s the traffic officer, he’s the homicide investigator, assuming that jurisdiction ever gets a homicide. He’s it. And yet that small town has been given somewhere in the neighborhood of $3 to $4 million. Billions of dollars overall are portioned out to small departments with no provision for training, no provision for maintenance. And that’s a recipe for disaster. I’ve heard the expression that this is a situation very much akin to “boys with toys.” You give them this military equipment and they want to play with it.

You've written that, ""simply put, white cops are afraid of black men."" You depict that phenomenon as not solely one of officers coming into the department as bigots, but also as a process in which the cops are learning prejudice and discrimination on the job. Can you explain what this looks like up close from your experience?
Let’s assume for a moment that a department wants to create diversity, sets out to do it. It has to make its organizational climate inviting. It has to make it hospitable to people of all races and ethnicities, to both genders and all sexual orientations. Whatever screening can be accomplished to help block those with racial or other prejudices is essential. And I think, all in all, law enforcement has done a fairly good job at the entry level.

But what happens to, let’s say, the average police candidate once he or she becomes a police recruit, and is going through the academy, is that they get exposed to the culture. And as professional as many police academies are, there are cops on the streets. And the cops on the streets are fond of saying things like, “Well, kid, forget what they taught you in the academy; you’re in the real world now.” And that’s really problematic. What’s being said in the real world and what’s being said in the academy ought to be the same, and it ought to be reinforcing non-discriminatory policing.

Let’s assume for the moment that you’re white, you’ve grown up in an all or predominantly white community, you’ve had little interaction with African-Americans, and you are now a police officer. And you’ve been told either in the academy or upon graduation from the academy, sea story after sea story of tales from the streets. You’ve heard about dangerous people. You’ve heard about individuals who have threatened or attacked police officers, pulled a gun on a police officer. Almost always, in police departments that are not thoughtful, those stories are situated in the black community. So what’s happening at a very subtle level—you don’t have to even express a racist point of view, you’re just simply telling a story from your point of view, as factually as you’re inclined to relate it. But what you’re doing, the meta-communication of all of that is: If you’re going to get hurt as a cop, it’s going to be at the hands of a black person. It’s going to be a male.

Nobody wants to get hurt, everybody wants to get home from their job everyday without suffering great bodily injury or worse, so it’s important for outsiders and insiders to recognize that officer safety is a legitimate and very important responsibility of executive leadership, and middle management, and first-line supervisors; indeed, it’s a responsibility of peers. So that if, for example, I’m scared of young black men that I meet on my beat, but with fear being a socially unacceptable emotion in police work, I can’t really express it, then I’m going to sublimate the fear, and I’m going to compensate in my behavior. In other words, because I’m scared, I’m going to act tough. I’m going to become the bully. Officers don’t say that, not even to themselves, but it is in fact, I’m convinced, what happens when fear is operating among white cops in black neighborhoods.

These recent events would seem to suggest that this culture of institutional police racism has not changed much since you began your career. Would it be a mistake to assume that?
It has changed a lot. That doesn’t mean it’s changed necessarily for the better. If it has become a sub-rosa problem, if it has become a hidden problem, in some respects, that’s even worse. Because if you get serious about improving race relations, one of the things you need to say to your cops is, “If you use racial or ethnic slurs, if you are trigger-happy, if you are heavy-handed in working in the African-American community and we document that case, you’re history. You’re out of here.” So one of the things that happens is, the tougher the talk gets, the smarter those forces within the ranks—not everybody, but those forces within the ranks who are for whatever their personal reasons, committed to a campaign of racism—will become more subtle and discreet. But if the phenomenon is still operating, it is going to affect the way cops behave toward the community.",NA,NA,NA,NA
Vice,vice18,https://news.vice.com/article/possessing-military-grade-weaponry-isnt-the-only-reason-police-wage-war,Possessing Military-Grade Weaponry Isn't the Only Reason Police Wage War,Natasha Lennard,08/16/14,09/09/16,"""Waste not, want not,"" as the saying goes. The opposite sentiment — ""Want not? Waste!"" — has never really caught on. Which, in the case of US military equipment, adds up to a nationwide disaster in domestic policing.

The images this week coming out of Ferguson, Missouri showing a poor American suburb under siege have highlighted the militarized state of municipal policing. Between Sunday night and Thursday, Ferguson saw thick clouds of tear gas, L-RAD sound cannons, camouflage fatigues, and M4 rifles. Surely, commentators noted, we reserve this war machinery for foreign soil?

SWAT-teams in Ferguson brought the fact of militarized domestic policing to the fore, but it's nothing new. Investigative reporter Radley Balko could have predicted the scenes of Army-style law enforcement in suburban Missouri. His book, Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces, traces the trend back several decades, pinpointing the emergence of the SWAT unit in response to dissent in the 1960s.

The movement of military technologies and equipment to the domestic law enforcement sphere — from guns to armor to drones — is now so common it is basically a rite of passage. A number of {reports this week}<hyperlink=“http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/ferguson-missouri-militarized-police-1033-program”> prompted by shock at the militaristic policing of suburban unrest highlighted the specific Pentagon program responsible for funneling military gear into municipal police departments. The Defense Department's Excess Property Program — also known as the 1033 program — provides refurbished military equipment to domestic law enforcement.

It's little surprise that after more than a decade of protracted wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there is no shortage of this ""excess."" And indeed, program 1033 has seen transfers from the US military to US cops increase considerably in recent years. As the {Washington Post}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/militarized-police-in-ferguson-unsettles-some-pentagon-gives-cities-equipment/2014/08/14/4651f670-2401-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html”> reported, ""In 2006, it made 34,708 transfers worth $33 million to law enforcement agencies. Last year, the number grew to 51,779 transfers valued at $420 million, according to data provided by the Defense Logistics Agency, which manages the program. Through April of this year, the agency had made 15,516 transfers of equipment worth $206 million."" Program 1033 sits alongside similar programs enacted by the Justice Department and DHS.

Programs like 1033 might explain the hows of militarized local police. The whys are more concerning. In Balko's estimation, a paranoid national security ideology, emergent and crystallized in recent decades, undergirds the rise of the ""warrior cop."" There is a framework of domestic governance that sees a possible enemy in every citizen — and likely enemies in black and brown men. It is the sort of mentality that wages boundless war on amorphous concepts, like drugs and terror. The US has in recent decades picked enemies unconfined by geography or border; little wonder, then, that the war zone crept home.

As such, I see little promise in legislative efforts to put an end to increased militarization of domestic policing. Georgia Representative Hank Johnson {has drafted}<hyperlink=“http://thehill.com/policy/defense/215160-lawmaker-drafting-bill-to-stem-flow-of-tanks-and-m16s-to-police”> a bill to limit program 1033 and curtail the flow of surplus military equipment to cops; he intends to introduce the bill to the House when Congress returns from recess in September. Meanwhile, Senator Rand Paul on Thursday {opined in Time magazine}<hyperlink=“http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter”> against ""using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies.""

In terms of the proliferation of SWAT team policing, I'd say efforts toward moderation come a little too late. Attempts to lessen the rate of increased militarization would not amount to a rollback; we will not be seeing a ritual destruction of Bear Cat armored vehicles in the name of demilitarized policing. And, to be sure, military-grade weaponry is not the only problem with US police departments. Tanks and teargas make for a terrifying visual, and serve as a daunting reminder of the lengths authorities will go to in response to dissent.

Problems of police thuggery and racism transcend militarization. Which is not to say I don't support efforts to stem the flow of tanks and assault weapons to trigger-happy local police. My point is simply that this would only address the issue of equipment, not attitude or ideology. It's an insidious civil war that won't be ended by a decrease in hand-me-down tanks.",64,NA,NA,NA

COLE'S MICHAEL BROWN TRIBUTE ""BE FREE"" IS THE HEARTFELT PIECE OF MUSIC YOU NEED RIGHT NOW",Kyle Kramer,08/15/14,09/09/16,"On Saturday afternoon, {officer Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/us/darren-wilson-identified-as-officer-in-fatal-shooting-in-ferguson-missouri.html”> of the Ferguson, Missouri, police department repeatedly shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown in broad daylight in the middle of the street. Michael was left lying there, in the street, for multiple hours.

The {ensuing days}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/topic/ferguson”> have seen, after an initial riot, an outpouring of peaceful protest and increasing unease about the deployment of excessive police force. Yesterday, {when I talked to St. Louis rapper Tef Poe}<hyperlink=“http://noisey.vice.com/blog/st-louis-rapper-tef-poe-describes-the-scene-in-ferguson-missouri”>, who has been one of the most visible figures on the ground protesting police behavior in Ferguson, he described seeing people he's known his whole life ""standing there by armored trucks with M-16s pointed at their chests,"" unarmed. The country has watched in horror and rage, first as the story of Michael Brown unfolded and then as the continued show of police force underscored the brutal, suspicious mindset that led to his killing in the first place.

But the last thing Tef said to me yesterday was more encouraging: ""What you have is people linking together and bonding together and running out this military-like police force. On the ground, it’s actually quite amazing to witness, and that’s the aspect of this that I hope we can carry on into the future. The unity aspect. The sticking together aspect.""

That's one of the feelings that comes across listening to the Michael Brown tribute song that J. Cole released early this morning, ""Be Free."" It comes from the fact that J. Cole, one of the biggest rappers in the world, someone who can broadcast his message to 5.4 million Twitter followers, recorded a song about this. And even more so from the way that the song strips away any of the posturing and moralizing that usually makes J. Cole's message songs fall flat and just emotes. He howls "" it ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul,"" and it's reassuring. He sobs ""all we want to do is break the chains off/all we want to do is be free,"" and it's heartbreaking.

That's the other feeling that comes across in ""Be Free"": palpable grief. Beyond channeling the rage of the moment, beyond highlighting the chilling interview excerpts describing the scene, this is a song that aches deeply, that reaches into a much longer-standing despair. It's in J. Cole's voice. It's in the way he sings. It's in the way this isn't a rap song but rather a sort of raw nerve freestyle born of deep frustration and sadness. This is a song about Michael Brown, but it's also a cry for, in Cole's words, ""every young black man murdered in America."" Michael Brown's death drew national attention, but the problem it represents is not new, nor will it go away when the armored vehicles roll out of Ferguson, and that's what this song is about, too.

""Don't just stand around/don't just stand around,"" J. Cole pleads. Music is, at its best, a purer expression of our emotions, a more elevated version of who we are. ""Be Free"" is a great piece of music, probably the best J. Cole has ever made. And it's also something more. It's a song that's needed right now. It might make you cry. Let it.",NA,NA,NA,NA
Vice,vice20,http://motherboard.vice.com/read/we-need-dystopias-now-more-than-ever,We Need Dystopias Now More Than Ever,Brian Merchant,08/15/14,09/09/16,"It seems a strange time to implore authors to {“Stop Writing Dystopian Sci-Fi—It's Making Us All Fear Technology.”}<hyperlink=“http://www.wired.com/2014/08/stop-writing-dystopian-sci-fiits-making-us-all-fear-technology/”> That call, after all, was issued precisely when the nation was fixated on the highly dystopian spectacle of {heavily militarized police officers}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/read/reddits-gun-community-take-aim-at-novice-over-militarized-police-in-ferguson-0814?trk_source=popular”> storming streets lined with unarmed protestors in a suburb in middle America. 

Writing in Wired, Michael Solana argues that writers should be glorifying the potential of technology instead of issuing warnings of its perils: ""for their capacity to change the way people think and feel about technology, the stories we tell ourselves can save us—if we can just escape the cool veneer of our dystopian house of horrors."" 

That seems easier for someone to say when they aren't staring down the barrel of {a highly assault rifle}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/read/reddits-gun-community-take-aim-at-novice-over-militarized-police-in-ferguson-0814?trk_source=popular”> or fleeing {flash grenades}<hyperlink=“http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-chief-we-have-to-respond-to-deadly-force/”> or being blasted by an LRAD sound cannon, and instead work for a ""venture capital firm dedicated to the identification of and investment in highly scalable technology companies,"" as his bio states.

It certainly wasn't Solana's intent, but he has powerfully illustrated how differently the future is often viewed within the Silicon Valley bubble—and hasn't thought much about why the genre he is frustrated with is currently so popular.  

When I began reading the headline, I immediately figured its construction would end with 'Because {Dystopia's Already Here}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/tag/Dystopia+Now”>’ or some such. Especially since one of Wired's top competitors, The Verge, was simultaneously featuring as their lead story a piece titled {‘Is This How Dystopia Begins?’}<hyperlink=“http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/14/6001243/ferguson...”> in reference to the events in Ferguson. 

Dystopian literature has, in other words, already provided a popular, obvious (yes, {perhaps too obvious}<hyperlink=“http://www.wired.com/2014/05/5-non-dystopian-works/”>), and {useful reference point}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/tag/Dystopia+Now”> for many to understand and contextualize the ill tide of current technological trends. 

Many look at Ferguson and recognize the seeds of a society depicted in, say, {Elysium}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/elysium-science-fiction-tricked-hollywood-into-making-the-years-most-radical-film”> or The Hunger Games. Those films offer a lens through which to consider {the wealth inequality}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-1-percent-raked-20-percent-of-americas-cash-last-year-dystopia-looms”>, militarized policing, and prejudice against minorities that is informing those events—and where those trends might conclude if left unaddressed. Ferguson is a stark example of our cautionary fiction aligning, regrettably, with reality, right here in the richest country on earth. 

(A more valid gripe about dystopian lit is that it tends to describe what are commonplace woes in much of the world happening to wealthy white Americans, then bemoaning them as novel.) 

We need our dystopias more than ever. As Motherboard futures editor {Claire Evans often points out}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/feminist-science-fiction-primer”>, our science fiction almost always tells us more about the present moment than it does about tomorrow. Films, TV shows, and books that portray the widening gap between the elites and the poor and the use of technology to subjugate the have nots are beyond apropos right now. 

So when Solana, an employee of a venture capital firm, writes that ""Our fears are demons in our fiction placing our utopia at risk, but we must not run from them,"" it isn't just myopic, it borders on ignorance. What utopia? There is no semblance of a utopia in sight for any save the richest techno-optimists. Structural inequities are placing society at risk, and no technology alone is going to fix them.

Furthermore, sci-fi is often best when it's subversive—from early classics like Edward Bellamy's utopian Looking Backward to H.G. Wells' capitalism-critiquing The Time Machine to, of course, 1984 and Brave New World to, most recently, {Snowpiercer}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-years-best-film-about-income-inequality-was-nearly-ruined-by-the-1-percent”> and, yes, The Hunger Games—not when it's an advertisement for technology invented by companies that Solana's firm might like to invest in.

Now, Solana's point is also that we need more Jules Verne's and Arthur C. Clarke's predicting new technologies (they're credited with dreaming up the submarine and satellite communications, respectively), and future societies for readers to become enamored by. 

In this call, he's not alone. Cyberpunk laureate Neal Stephenson, for instance, has beseeched writers to {stop being so pessimistic}<hyperlink=“http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ist/?next=/science-nature/dear-science-fiction-writers-stop-being-so-pessimistic-127226686/”> and ""get big stuff done""—that's why he helped found the Heiroglyph project, which is working to imagine {space elevators and massive towers}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-twelve-mile-high-skyscraper-is-on-pause-thanks-to-the-jet-stream”>, and generally doing exactly that. 

But that's evidence that the two strains of speculative fiction aren't mutually exclusive—Stephenson himself imagined an astonishingly iPad-like 'Primer' in his very dystopian Diamond Age, and Kim Stanley Robinson thought up hollowed-out asteroid barges, roving mobile cities on Mercury, and empowering gender-bending biotech in his opus, 2312. By the way, in that book, Earth is still burning. 

In other words, these sci-fi writers are being pragmatic—they're envisioning a crumbling world and the fascinating technology that might help save or distract us from it. Yet there's still a reason that we can't wave off pure dystopias, either. They help diagnose our ills and suggest a few ways forward; Elysium, as ham-handed as it was, {ends with universal healthcare}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/elysium-science-fiction-tricked-hollywood-into-making-the-years-most-radical-film”>. The Hunger Games, meanwhile, has actually {inspired real-world revolutionaries in Thailand}<hyperlink=“http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/03/hunger-games-salute-banned-thailand”>.

Films like those may be relatively sterile big-budget Hollywood entertainment, but they still convey a message that is eminently and unfortunately relatable to an increasingly large and diverse slice of the world: There's a sharpening divide between very comfortable elites, like people who run venture capital firms, and those whose labor the elites are profiting off of. Those who worry, in addition to how they're going to pay their bills, about persecution at the hands of militarized police and digital government surveillance.

I especially hated the outright lies, like the one about {gang members going around with their car headlights off}<hyperlink=“http://www.snopes.com/crime/gangs/lightsout.asp”>, and shooting you if you flash them. I thought access to information would help the truth prevail. OK, you can stop laughing at me.

Now the kids think there are going to be real-life purges, and they’re spreading the notion via the {Giant Lie Factory}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/the-internet-is-a-giant-lie-factory”>. Perhaps it's some last-minute marketing for The Purge: Anarchy, now playing in a theater near you. But it's almost certainly no coincidence that this hoax got started around the same time as the Ferguson protests. 

If you don’t read the taglines on movie billboards, a purge—as posited by the movie The Purge and its recent sequel—is a night on which everything is legal. The cops pack it in. Looters and murderers have a field day, and the audience has a good time. 

On Friday night, in real life, Louisville lost its mind when kids there started tweeting about a Louisville purge, and the grown-ups believed what the kids were telling them—something you should never do.

They started shutting down businesses and locking themselves in their homes. Police {went on high alert}<hyperlink=“http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2014/08/16/aftermath-louisville-purge/14169789/”>, because, according to the cops there, ""We have to err on the side of caution, to keep our city safe.” 

You have to? Really? Even when what you’re preparing for, on the taxpayer's dime, is based on internet rumors that don’t even make sense when taken at face value?  

Next, purge hysteria escalated because people started saying one had happened. A Redditor posted what they claimed was photographic evidence of {a Louisville purge}<hyperlink=“http://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/2dqj77/op_claims_there_was_a_purge_in_louisville_ky_last/”>. According to the post, someone let a giraffe out of the Louisville zoo. This was—are you sitting down?—a lie. The image was taken from a different news story in a different city, eight months ago. 

[tweetbegin 500494533881516032 tweetend]

Next, a vortex of stupidity took hold. One Direction were gearing up for a performance in Detroit Sunday night, and either because of, or in spite of it, people started tweeting about a {Detroit Purge}<hyperlink=“http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/08/17/louisville-purge-one-direction-security-safety-detroit-concert/”>. Such an event might set the stage for a tragedy if One Direction were to be robbed and beheaded by a roving gang of masked psychopaths. 

By then the idea had caught fire, and it was everywhere. 

Before long, there were people making up all kinds of stories about purges in every major city in America. Everyone gave themselves the rhetorical authority to tweet sensational nonsense by couching it in concern for others. Most tweets about Purges have the refrain “Be safe” tacked onto the end. 

[tweetbegin 500482775745847296 tweetend]

Inevitably, with all these rumors swirling around, the idea of a {St. Louis purge}<hyperlink=“http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/882672-ferguson-purge-twitter-rumors-spread-about-st-louis-ferguson-missouri/”> during the Ferguson protests was irresistible. It didn't happen. Ferguson got hit with a curfew, now in its second night. Looting wasn't exactly at LA-Riots levels Saturday night, but just being outside was illegal. It was the exact opposite of The Purge.

But look, kids, there’s no purge coming to your town anyway. You 100 percent cannot just have a Purge. Here's why:

Purges Are Impossible in the United States.

I'm going to take this seriously for a second.

No city or state in the US has the authority to declare a purge. If, hypothetically, the police intentionally backed off for a night, and the people who were the victims of crimes pressed charges afterward, but the bored receptionist at the police station was like, “Sorry your grandma was murdered, but nothing was illegal that night. Next!” they could just take their complaints to the state or federal level. It would be easy to argue, even though there’s no law that explicitly bans a jurisdiction from decriminalizing things like theft and murder. You would just use the always-handy ninth amendment, which says you have rights not explicitly outlined in the constitution. It wouldn’t be hard to get a judge to agree that you have the unalienable right not to be murdered or robbed with the tacit approval of the local authorities. 

The purge in the movie was made possible by amending the constitution. I feel like I would remember reading about it if there had been a 28th amendment that added purges to the fabric of our political system.

Rumors of Violent Flash Mobs Are Mostly Racist Hysteria.

If the people spreading this idea around don't actually think crime is going to be legal, and instead they think a ""purge"" is just the new name for one of those violent flash mobs they heard about on TV, I've got more good news: that shit doesn’t really happen. “Wilding,” isn’t really a thing, except when followed by ""out."" The Central Park 5 case, often cited as the quintessential example of young people running amok in huge crowds, {didn’t happen like you think}<hyperlink=“http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/centralparkfive/”>. Bad things happened that night, but accounts of events were tainted by racism and paranoia. 

People get in crowds sometimes, yes, and they lose their shit sometimes, yes. Ten unruly members of a peaceful crowd of 10,000 can cause the whole crowd to get blamed for a few stores being looted. Ferguson isn't the only case where something like this has happened. Cops tell stories to newscasters that further this ""the world is going to hell in a handbasket"" narrative because it keeps them in a job. Similarly, when a newscaster interviews Sylvester Stallone, he'll tell you it's a good idea to see The Expendables 3. That doesn't make it true. 

For instance, looking for an example of a ""violent flashmob,"" I found an often cited story from 2011 where {1,000 gang members}<hyperlink=“http://boston.cbslocal.com/2011/05/30/hundreds-of-teens-fighting-at-bostons-carson-beach/”> were supposedly fighting on a beach in Boston. It turns out there were just a few fights, and the vast majority of the people in that crowd were just guilty of hanging around while being black or Hispanic. 

The Purge Is Just a Movie.

When I was fourteen, and the Columbine shooting had just happened, there were whispers in my school that the vast and powerful Trenchcoat Mafia would carry out a coordinated assault on every high school in America the following Friday. It was a dumb rumor in retrospect, but a really scary, non-movie thing had just happened in real life. I stayed home that Friday because on one hand, yes I'm a coward, but there was an upside: I didn't want to go to school anyway, and I got a three-day weekend out of the deal. But as for the purge hoax, if you're a high schooler who responded to this movie-based rumor by locking yourself in your house during a weekend, that was dumb, and a waste of a weekend.

Kids have wild imaginations. If you'd told me there was going to be a real life {Thunderdome}<hyperlink=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU6K47qgc8”>, a real life {Logan's Run}<hyperlink=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSUAAKFLoL0”>, or a real life {Battle Royale}<hyperlink=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04bZIZDn0jo”>, I would have been too excited not to spread the rumors. Adults, though, are supposed to know the difference between science fiction movies, and stuff that can actually happen.

The {small but significant pockets of misbehavior}<hyperlink=“http://nypost.com/2014/08/11/st-louis-suburb-erupts-in-rioting-after-cops-shoot-dead-unarmed-man/”> in Ferguson and elsewhere last week were no match for the enormous shows of force the law enforcement machine demonstrated, and will apparently always demonstrate, when people start to get out of line. That's not to say we have law and order, just that, to compensate for the lack of law and order, there are sudden surges of violence from the cops that have become routine.

America has a lot of problems with violence in the streets, but the fact that much of that violence is committed by law enforcement should tell you that if you think there's a purge coming, you’re focusing your paranoia in the wrong direction.",NA,NA,NA,NA
Vice,vice22,http://noisey.vice.com/blog/punks-please-hate-the-police,"Punks: Please, Hate the Police",Noisey Staff,08/15/14,09/28/16,"Things are just as bad as they've ever been, so why are our punk bands more outraged?

Here’s a story: an openly gay man fronts a rights-minded punk band in Austin, Texas. That could be 50 different groups in 2014. But in 1979, before Austin needed to be kept weird, you could count the open rock groups on one hand. At the forefront of this change were Gary Floyd and his band of Dicks.

One of The Dicks’ crowning achievements was their first single, “Hate The Police”—a taut, balled fist of a song that raged with anger against a racist, trigger-happy cop. It’s unfathomably depressing that the track still resonates with such ferocity 34 years later. The too-true song takes the point of view of a prejudiced cop with anger to spare and power to abuse:

“Mommy, mommy, mommy / look at your son / you might have loved me / but now I’ve got a gun. / You better stay out of the way / I think I’ve had a bad day / … Daddy, daddy, daddy / proud of his son / he’s got him a good job / killing ni—ers and Mexicans / I’ll tell you something / and it’s true: / You can’t find justice / it’ll find you.”

A punk song or script from George Zimmerman’s inner monologue? It’s one of the first things I thought of when Trayvon Martin was murdered and, unfortunately again, two and a half years later, as the Ferguson PD killed another young black man, Mike Brown.

Clearly, there is blood in the streets. But where are our punk bands’ teeth?

Without getting into the granularity of what constitutes a punk band these days, I think it’s supremely safe to say that the majority of the “scene” has been inundated with an inward-looking slackerdom that, given the current state of affairs, feels downright empty. And at one point, and on some days still, there is definitely a place for that. Since The Replacements there’s been plenty reason to wake up with beer for breakfast. But do we need another FIDLAR song about doing coke at the Cha Cha? Another call to arms to meet at the bar with Deer Tick? It’s not like every punk band has to be political and every political punk band has to make every song about politics, but Christ, can we engage with the world, please?

While The Dicks were still green in Austin, Rollins and MacKaye were getting their hands on their first Ramones record just as the era of Reagan doom began to bloom. For the next eight years punk would fight the man and his politics. The Minutemen sang in opposition to Iran-Contra. Almost every band in the genre went at him, maybe most vocally The Dead Kennedys leading the charge. One of the best latter-era Ramones songs, the glittering “Bonzo Goes To Bitburg,” was written for their disgust at Reagan’s visit to a Nazi cemetery.

The women were also rearing their heads at the system that perpetuated rape culture, misogyny, homophobia, violence; culminating in the early 90s, most visibly by Bikini Kill. Riot grrrl, a classification some would buck, was a vocal, vibrant scene calling for change and equal rights. Even bands on the softer end of the spectrum were discussing the issues, like the brutally wonderful “Atta Girl” by tweecore champions Heavenly.

Then came Bush and a rash of liberty-spiked anti-Republicans, led largely by snarl-over-substance Billie Joe Armstrong. Looking back on the line-up for Rock Against Bush is unfortunately a bit embarrassing in 2014. Although Fat Mike’s Punkvoter drive did increase youth voting by ten percent it was technically a failure, and an example of shortsightedness. Instead of painting Bush as Target Numero Uno and pushing to tip the largest election in the country, with a more focused strategy and aligning closer with the DIY punks it’s possible they could have made some real change. They tried to win the war without going to any battles. Iraq went on and the scene faded. Now, the most prominent political punk band is probably Propagandhi, who have earned their position at the forefront simply by virtue of survival: they formed in 1986 and have been rocking against injustice ever since.

And here, now, America as boiling and brittle as ever, and we’ve got our muzzles on. Granted, I’m speaking on this from the point of view of the thematic elements unifying these pockets of the genre and their cultures. There will always be exceptions, outliers, unknowns. But here we still live with insane racism, a grotesque rape culture, outrageous police brutality and murder, leaked documents out the ass, wage disparity, a severe homelessness problem, inaccessible health care, mental disease still in the dark, a laughable minimum wage, and a constant struggle for equal human rights. Just to name a few.

As of Wednesday night the protests marched on in Ferguson while a militarized police force attempted to censor media coverage, teargas peaceful citizens and journalists, and war toward a grieving city yearning for justice and accountability. Does it even need to be said how important of an event this is? How more than ever punk bands should be politically, civilly, socially conscious?

If political activism in punk peaked with Reagan, then the punks of hip hop grabbed the baton at the same time. Public Enemy, N.W.A., Tupac, Ice-T, all scraping their lungs dry on police brutality, the fear of a black planet, bringing to light issues mainstream America surely wasn’t fucking privy to at the time. Immensely talented men and women with powerful statements continued through the 90s and aughts with countless artists in both the mainstream and the underground releasing mindcrushing tracks about the realities of being black in an ostensibly “post-racial” America. The snarl for a truly free country has continued to the current climate. Killer Mike and Tef Poe have both been highly vocal about the scene in Ferguson and who could forget Questlove’s heartbreaking essay, “Trayvon Martin and I Ain’t Shit”? Hell, Kanye West’s “Black Skinhead” might be the best punk song of the past ten years, and Killer Mike's R.A.P. Music the past decade's best punk album. (Secret: It’s never had to rock to be punk rock.)

Hip-hop has long been the voice of the streets, resonant to those familiar with the lifestyles often described, though for some time perceived as misplaced anger and needless descriptions of violence. But whose violence? Similar to “Hate The Police,” ten years ago Ghostface Killah released the single “Run” wherein he, Jadakiss, and Comp discuss the only alternative to facing a corrupt and biased police force. At the time of its release, however, the word “gun” was still being edited out of the radio and video versions. Surely not in country songs, surely no bleeped huntin’ rifles or six shooters. And the placement of that word is wildly important:

“Run! / If you ain’t do shit, you it / That next felony, ni—a, is like three zip / So run! / Hop fences, jump over benches / when you see me comin’ get the fuck out the entrance / Run! / Fuck that! / Run! / Cops got guns!”

There have been black punks pioneering their slice of the scene since the 70s—Bad Brains, DEATH, Living Colour—but in more recent years, when it comes to prominence and coverage, a strong black voice in the genre has been hard to find, and with the napkin-scrawled demise of anti-labelists Death Grips, it’s become even harder.

The punk bands who do get a chance to tell you about anything have often been picked by Mr. Checkbook—and they’ll never stop selling us four skinny white dudes whose biggest problem is having to think deeply about some truly shallow shit. Certainly not many of them have had to run from the cops. Certainly none of them have been shot for not running, for standing innocently with their hands in the air, unarmed. But that doesn’t mean they can’t talk about it. Black issues should be American issues. It’s still a fight for civil rights, and these are our countrymen. When Malcolm X was once asked why he was against whites joining the Black Panthers, he explained that it wasn’t their place to make change, that if whites wanted to help blacks in this country they should be trying to alter those who they can directly affect, with their access to aspects of white culture the Panthers would never be able to infiltrate. Which is why it’s important for punk bands with influence, with MTV spots and car commercials, with slots on Letterman, should be using their visibility to influence a culture that may not be as exposed to or understanding of the current situation, of the perspective that isn’t specifically theirs.

So this is my plea: if you’re a punk and you’re as angry as you should be, don't focus it inward. Existentialism is tough, and it’s fun as fuck to cope by partying, but people are being shot down in public, Ferguson was a fucking war zone this week, the police state has plenty of ammunition—maybe you should be using music to shoot back.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Protests over the killing were countered by a {militarized police force}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/article/hands-up-dont-shoot-ferguson-protests-in-photos”>, complete with SWAT gear and armored vehicles. The incident has been covered from every angle: how Ferguson is America's {latest racial hotspot}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/michael-brown-st-louis-suburb-ferguson-missouri-americas-latest-racial-hotspot-812”>; how this represents a sort of Chekhov's (military-grade machine) {gun}<hyperlink=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov's_gun”> and the {inevitable conclusion}<hyperlink=“http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/ferguson-missouri-militarized-police-1033-program”> of post-9/11 defense spending; how eight unarmed teens are {still at large}<hyperlink=“http://www.clickhole.com/article/8-more-unarmed-teens-still-large-731”>; and how {white people}<hyperlink=“http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119102/what-white-st-louis-thinks-about-ferguson”> in suburban St. Louis don't give a shit.

It took a bunch of protests for Ferguson police to name {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/article/police-have-named-the-cop-who-shot-michael-brown-as-fergusons-anger-turns-to-peace”> as the officer who killed Michael Brown, which they finally did Friday morning. Police also released a report saying that Brown was a suspect in a {“strong-arm robbery”}<hyperlink=“http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/15/ferguson-police-say-michael-brown-fit-description-strong-arm-robbery-suspect/”> of a box of Swisher Sweets cigars, and that Wilson was responding to the crime when Brown was killed. Whether Brown actually shoplifted is unknown at this point, not that it would in any way justify his death. All that’s clear is that we're in a pretty terrible place right now, and there is no obvious path for things to get much better.

–There’s a perception out there that teens are adults in training, but they’re more like children and adults at the same time. With their baby fat and spindly legs and acne and scumstaches, teens are an already human manifestation of the {uncanny valley}<hyperlink=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley”>—the idea that when robots start to look too human they stop being cute and start being scary. Similarly, their brains just aren’t all the way there. They’re confused. Sometimes they don’t even know why they do what they do, so it’s no wonder their actions can be completely confounding and horrifying to others. A particularly gruesome example of this occurred this week in {Frisco, Texas}<hyperlink=“http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/16-year-old-son-accused-killing-parents-texas-home-article-1.1900890”>, where a 16-year-old boy taped a flashlight to a gun and murdered his parents. When police arrived, they overheard the boy’s sister asking, ""What do you mean you did it?"" and him responding, “I did it.” When she asked if it was his plan, he didn’t answer. News reports note that his motive is unclear, but they’ve all focused on the idea that the boy was “sheltered”—he was homeschooled by his strict parents, who wouldn’t let him watch violent movies or drink soda. While it’s entirely possible that this fueled his crimes, lots of people have strict parents whom they don’t kill. This sort of tabloid speculation doesn’t help anyone; besides serving as another example of the dangers of widespread gun ownership, there’s probably not a lesson here.

–One bright spot in this bleak week (just like Shark Week but instead of forcing memes we're just sitting in our rooms and don't want to talk about what's wrong) is that teens in Colorado are {smoking less pot}<hyperlink=“http://reason.com/blog/2014/08/08/despite-legalization-colorado-teenagers”>. On the surface this seems pretty neutral—teens are hard to deal with whether they're on pot or not—but it's actually a net positive, because it means that the alarmists about marijuana legalization will have one less talking point. The ""won't somebody think of the children?"" crowd has long argued that legal weed will lead to an explosion of bong hits among teens, but it’s safe to say at this point that the fear was misguided and silly. As the slow march of legalization {continues}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/looks-like-weed-legalization-will-be-on-the-ballot-in-dc”>, this will only help speed things up.

–Speaking of high teenagers, have you ever tried having sex stoned before? It's one of the grossest things you can do, maybe only slightly less disgusting than taking a hot afternoon nap with jeans on. You start to feel like you're really connecting in ways that you never have before, and then you realize that you have slobber on your face (but whose slobber is it?) and you both still have clothes on and you've spent 25 minutes just grinding really hard. That said, the fact that you'll probably fall asleep well before anyone achieves anything approaching an orgasm makes stoned sex a less-than-terrible method of birth control. If you're looking for a more effective and less heebie-jeebie-inducing way to prevent pregnancy, though, go with an intrauterine device, or IUD. That's what Colorado has used to {lower the teen pregnancy rate}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/12/how-colorados-teen-birthrate-dropped-40-in-four-years/”> by 40 percent since 2009. As part of a program created by an anonymous (and thus kinda creepy) $23 million donation, young women with low incomes have been given free or low-cost IUDs. Unsurprisingly, this provision of free birth control has resulted in fewer pregnant teenagers.

Not only is the pregnancy rate down, but the teen abortion rate also fell 35 percent. According to the Washington Post, ""The state also spent less on food programs for low-income mothers and children; infant enrollment in WIC supplemental nutrition program declined 23 percent between 2008 and 2013. The governor’s office said the state saved $42.5 million in health-care expenditures associated with teen births. For every dollar spent on the contraceptives, the state saved $5.68 in Medicaid costs.""

So, basically, this is a win-win-win. Teens stay baby-free, the government spends less money, and fewer abortions are performed. Even conservatives should be thrilled, right? Not quite: For one thing, if you think back many, many outrages ago to the Supreme Court's {Hobby Lobby decision}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/stores-can-be-anti-abortion-christians-supreme-court-rules),”>, you'll remember that some Christians believe IUDs are themselves an abortifacient. Replacing abortions with different abortions is hardly progress in God's eyes. Plus, people like Focus on the Family director Carrie Gordon Earll don't buy that the decrease in pregnant people has anything to do with easy access to things that stop people from being pregnant. “What we have seen over many years is that access to contraception does not equal fewer unintended pregnancies and fewer abortions,"" she {told}<hyperlink=“http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26085784/colorado-teen-birth-rates-drop-state-hands-out?ok”> the Denver Post. ""Availability of contraception leads to increased sexual activity, which leads to unintended pregnancies and abortions.”

While this worldview might seem comical in Colorado, it's less funny in places where it shapes public policy. In Kansas, for example, parts of the state that focus on promoting abstinence see as many as {10 percent of teen girls}<hyperlink=“http://ksn.com/2014/08/13/teen-pregnancy-high-in-southwest-kansas/”> become pregnant. Essentially, what all this means is that we can either have kids continue to get pregnant or give them the greenlight for consequence-free sex. That a huge part of the country wants teens to keep having babies brings the national divide into brutally sharp focus.",13,NA,NA,NA

Vice,vice25,http://www.vice.com/read/police-brutality-is-bringing-people-together-819,"In New York City, Police Brutality Is Bringing People Together",Aaron Miguel Cantu,08/19/14,09/30/16,"Last Thursday in New York City, thousands of people marched from 14th Street to Times Square to protest a very American brand of unhinged police power. The show of paramilitary suppression against mostly black folk the night before in Ferguson, Missouri, had pissed everybody off, from radicals to moderates, and the glowing embers of unrest needed only a breath of oxygen to spark their latent flame.

In New York, those oxygen breathers were actually a bunch of commies from the New York City Revolution Club, a local branch of the Revolutionary Communist Party. The party’s {website}<hyperlink=“http://revcom.us/”>. looks like an old Maoist pamphlet gone digital, but its members were keen to seize on the outrage over police violence that has recently gone mainstream.

It started in Union Square, where activists affiliated with the {National Moment of Silence for Victims of Police Brutality}<hyperlink=“https://www.facebook.com/NMOS2014”> campaign ({#nomos14}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nomos14&src=typd”>) had planned to organize a vigil for victims of police brutality. While the vigil gathered, a second group began forming around members of the Revolution Club, who were joined by another leftist group, People’s Power Assemblies. They held a large yellow banner aloft and made incendiary remarks about mass incarceration, police violence, and capitalism.

The reason people knew to go to Union Square was the vigil, but as people gathered, it was clear many wanted more than just prayers. There was enough fury on the ground that it seemed like it could turn into a genuine uprising. 

Did communists hijack a vigil? Maybe, but who cares? The militant rhetoric was what many needed to hear, and demonstrating was cathartic. It didn’t matter that some of the people leading the crowd profess a cultish devotion to a chubby wannabe-Lenin named {Bob Avakian}<hyperlink=“http://revcom.us/avakian/”>; what mattered was that people of all backgrounds came together to tell the state that enough is enough. And the fact that so many were drawn to militancy suggests just how tired people are of the status quo.

Shortly after 7 PM, the Revolution Club and People’s Power Assemblies began leading a march down Broadway toward Times Square, while the vigil stayed to observe the planned moment of silence. The vast majority of people marching, many of whom were still dressed in business-casual attire, were unaffiliated with any of the groups, and few seemed to know who was actually directing the action.

The swarm of marchers eventually grew to a few thousand, as onlookers joined and word spread on social media (one woman told me she left dinner at a nearby restaurant to join the march after seeing photos of it on Instagram). Demonstrators walked through the streets, chanting and halting traffic, while tourists on sightseeing buses snapped photos from above.

The NYPD tried to corral protesters in Times Square, but many circumvented the police and charged down another street. After cops kettled several dozen people for nearly an hour, most were freed, save for five people who were detained.

Jason “JJ” Woody, one of the men arrested for “disorderly conduct,” later told me it didn’t matter who was leading the protests.

“There were thousands of people,” he said. “It was the people who did it. Everybody—we were all part of it.”

The fervor of the night signaled more than solidarity with Ferguson: It revealed a groundswell of people tired of {racist policing}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/black-people-are-more-likely-to-be-arrested-for-marijuana-possession-than-white-people-twir”>, in New York and {beyond}<hyperlink=“http://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6002175/its-not-just-ferguson-americas-criminal-justice-system-is-racist”>, and everything that comes with it: militarism, mass incarceration, dead black men and boys, immunity for killer cops and an aggressive, selective enforcement of a growing litany of laws. And unlike Occupy Wall Street, dominated at least early on by white people, many of those who gathered in Union Square were young people of color.

“This is a black issue, and we can’t be afraid to say that,” said one speaker in Union Square.

That’s a sentiment shared by more than just people on the street that day. Noel Leader, a former NYPD sergeant who leads the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement, a coalition of black law enforcement officers who oppose racism, has {publicly called}<hyperlink=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msWbeewTFuw”> for both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton to be fired over the {widely publicized death}<hyperlink=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner”> of a black man, Eric Garner, who was choked out by the NYPD for selling loose cigarettes.

The cop who {killed}<hyperlink=“http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/eric-garner-death-ruled-homicide-medical-examiner-article-1.1888808”> Garner has still not been charged, another signal that impunity is the norm for NYPD officers, who have also killed Ramarley Graham, Nicholas Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell, and {many others}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/18/killed-by-the-nypd-black-men_n_5600045.html”>; all unarmed, all whose killers were given a slap on the wrist, if that.  

And with the NYPD still overwhelmingly {targeting}<hyperlink=“https://gallery.mailchimp.com/f6b63e2555a5fd40610a66a67/files/120b5193-f278-4521-9513-4ef39a6c2fcf.pdf”> black and Hispanic men to enforce laws {everybody breaks equally}<hyperlink=“http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/06/04/marijuana_possession_laws_aclu_report_why_blacks_are_four_times_more_likely.html”>, not to mention laws that target {poor people}<hyperlink=“http://gawker.com/why-broken-windows-policing-is-so-broken-1621008911”>, there’s a sense that the begrudging, fear-based tolerance of racist policing is giving way to a youthful strain of resistance that no liberal mayor can quell.

This resistance comes in many forms, and where it goes will depend on what grassroots groups are doing right now.

Marco DeWalden, a 19-year-old New York native who performs on the subway with the dance crew 2 Live, says he’s been arrested or cited over seven times for dancing on the city’s trains, including three arrests since January.

“Once you get arrested three times, you don’t qualify for tickets, you go straight to the precinct and from there you go straight through the system,” he told me.

DeWalden spoke with me at a press conference organized by Busk NY, a group that advocates for arts in New York’s subway, as well as New Yorkers Against Bratton, which has organized past demonstrations against the NYPD. Arrests of train performers of all colors have jumped {500 percent}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/subway-dancers_n_5675438.html”> since the election of liberal mayor Bill de Blasio.

Josmar Trujillo, an organizer with New Yorkers Against Bratton, said his group is holding public education campaigns in communities of color about broken windows policing in order to build awareness of the strategy.

“I think if we don’t have a citywide conversation about broken windows policing, people are just going to be guessing as to why policing is closing down in and around their lives,” Trujillo told me.

“Broken windows” refers to the aggressive policing of low-level quality-of-life crimes, a strategy pioneered by current Commissioner Bratton. These offenses range from bike riding on sidewalks to dancing on subways. An {investigation}<hyperlink=“http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/summons-broken-windows-racial-disparity-garner-article-1.1890567?utm_content=buffer6a8e3&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw”> by the New York Daily News found that 81 percent of the people busted in the last decade for quality-of-life crimes—carried out under the broken windows policing strategy—were black or Hispanic.

Educative outreach was also the rationale behind a new mural in the Bronx for Eric Garner and other victims of police brutality. The mural blends commentary on police brutality and gentrification with QR codes and phone numbers that enable targets of police harassment to get in touch with legal counsel.

“The interactive part is the most important part of the mural,” said Raul Ayala, the lead artist of the piece. In total, a dozen young people painted the wall.

The coalition of activist groups who worked on the mural, which are united under the moniker Peoples’ Justice for Community Control and Police Accountability, also hosts Know Your Rights info sessions and cop-watch trainings for people in highly-policed communities, teaching members of the community their legal rights when dealing with and observing law enforcement.

“Everything we do to watch our communities is helpful,” said Aidge Patterson, a leader with People’ Justice, at a recent cop-watch training in Flatbush, Brooklyn.

Yet despite activists’ efforts, there is a well-founded sense that those at the top are not listening. For his part, Commissioner Bratton insists that the NYPD is not a racist organization, and that his brand of quality-of-life policing targets behavior, not people. 

“Are there more minorities impacted by enforcement? Yes. I'm not denying that,"" he {told Huffington Post}<hyperlink=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/09/bill-de-blasio-choke-hold_n_5664453.html”>. ""But it's not an intentional focus on minorities. It's a focus on behavior.""

An NYPD officer who recently ticketed me while I biked on a sidewalk in my neighborhood echoed this sentiment. I had been on the empty sidewalk for less than ten seconds, and was two blocks from my apartment, but it was a dangerous enough move on my part for police to bravely drive their car onto the sidewalk for the protection of the community.

One of the cops acknowledged that his ticketing me was “bullshit,” but insisted he had to do it because of orders from up the ladder. As his partner ran my ID and wrote my ticket, we talked about Eric Garner, the protest in Times Square, and the unrest in Ferguson.

“It’s been a hot summer, with all this stuff happening everywhere,” he told me. “It’s not a race thing. It’s because these are the neighborhoods where you have the highest rates of crime.”

For what it’s worth, 93.7 percent of the people in my neighborhood, including me, are either black or Latino.",5,NA,NA,NA
Vice,vice26,https://www.vice.com/read/its-time-to-start-preparing-for-president-rand-paul,It's Time to Start Preparing Yourself for President Rand Paul,Grace Wyler,08/18/14,09/30/16,"For the past two years, from the moment Ron Paul called off the Revolution and headed back to Texas, the political establishment has been eagerly waiting for his son, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, to run for president. They've watched with amusement as Paul popped up around the country—in Iowa and New Hampshire, at Evangelical powwows, Howard University, the ACLU—and {at the top of early 2016 polls}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/07/17/rand-paul-is-right-where-he-wants-to-be-in-the-2016-race/”>. Unlike his father, it's hard to deny that he Paul is a ""serious"" candidate. But the idea that he could actually be elected President of the United States? That's never been taken very seriously.

But with half of the GOP's 2016 bench {trying to avoid prison time}<hyperlink=“http://www.texastribune.org/2014/08/16/five-things-know-about-perry-indictment/”> and Democrats spinning their wheels in Obama's second-term rut, the idea of a President Rand Paul is starting to sound less and less crazy. On issues like criminal justice reform, {mass surveillance}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/rand-pauls-mission-to-save-silicon-valley-from-the-government”>, and drug policy, Paul is casting himself as Another Option, carving out new space as the candidate who can make room for both small-government libertarians and other voters—young people and minorities, mostly—who don't see either party as particularly effective or relevant. And some of what he's saying makes a lot of sense.

Take Paul's comments about the events in Ferguson, Missouri. In an {op-ed published by Time}<hyperlink=“http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/”> on Thursday, the Kentucky Senator laid out a remarkably blunt, even angry, assessment of the racial tensions at the center of this week's riots, linking policing issues to his broader critique of the federal government.

""If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn't have expected to be shot,"" Paul wrote. Going on to condemn the aggressive police response to protesters, he then focuses his criticism on the militarization of the police forces in Ferguson, a problem he, perhaps predictably, blames on ""big government.""

""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement,"" Paul wrote. The result, he argues, is an erosion of civil liberties that is disproportionately felt by minorities.

""Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them,"" he states, adding later: ""Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention.""

The argument here isn't shocking; in fact, lots of people who aren't politicians have argued that giving cops billions of dollars in military hardware is scary and exacerbates racial tensions. ({Washington Post blogger Radley Balko}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/08/14/after-ferguson-how-should-police-respond-to-protests/”>, for one, {has been sounding the alarm for years}<hyperlink=“http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/police-militarization-an-interview-with-radley-balko”>.) A {recent ACLU report}<hyperlink=“https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf”> on the militarization of America's police forces points out that federal grant programs provide incentives for local police departments to acquire and use billions of dollars in military-grade hardware, and found that the ""use of paramilitary weapons and tactics primarily impacted people of color."" According to a December {poll conducted for Reason}<hyperlink=“http://reason.com/assets/db/13867453755251.pdf”>, most Americans—57 percent, as well as 53 percent of Republicans—are concerned by these trends, and think that police use of military weapons and vehicles is ""going too far.""

But while other politicians, including Obama, have tried to avoid the politics of #Ferguson, Paul forcefully articulated, and shared, the public's outrage over #Ferguson—including the racial issues in play—and offered a policy solution in line with his ideas about small government. In short, he hit the elusive sweet spot between the libertarianism and civil rights—because you don't have to have read Ludwig von Misesto know it's a fucking problem that images of suburban St. Louis are {virtually indistinguishable from the Battle of Mosul}<hyperlink=“http://mashable.com/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-protests-vs-iraq/”>. By contrast, most politicians, including Obama, have avoided the politics and racial issues surrounding #Ferguson.

On other issues, too, Paul has been able to find unexpected common ground with voters outside of the aging, white GOP base. His views on issues like medical marijuana, federal sentencing laws, government spying, drones, and military intervention are much more closely aligned with public opinion—particularly among young voters—than those of any of his potential 2016 Republican rivals, and also of Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. This is probably not, as {last week's New York Times Magazine suggested}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/magazine/has-the-libertarian-moment-finally-arrived.html?_r=0”>, the harbinger of some national libertarian moment. But it does give Paul the space to expand his appeal with the younger generation of voters—something the {Republican Party admits it needs to do}<hyperlink=“https://goproject.gop.com/RNC_Growth_Opportunity_Book_2013.pdf”> if it ever wants to win another presidential election.

Paul seems to be seizing the opportunity. His 13-hour filibuster protesting Obama's drone policy made him a national figure last year, and since then, he's become a leading voice against the NSA's sweeping domestic surveillance programs, earning a {standing ovation from a roomful of college students at UC Berkeley}<hyperlink=“http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Republican-Rand-Paul-fires-up-a-Berkeley-crowd-5332740.php”> this spring. When his neocon colleagues (and Obama) wanted the military to intervene in Syria last year, Paul joined forces with Democrats to oppose the effort. Recently, he introduced two bills with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, one that would advance criminal justice reforms for juveniles and non-violent drug offenders, and another that would {bar the Drug Enforcement Agency from using its funds to crackdown on legal medical marijuana providers and their patients}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/congress-has-had-a-surprising-moment-of-clarity-in-the-war-on-drugs”>. Of course, some of Paul's voter outreach efforts, {like his speech at Howard University last year}<hyperlink=“http://www.businessinsider.com/rand-paul-drug-policy-howard-university-2013-4”>, have fallen flat. But he's gotten people's attention, and at the very least, made it harder for them to hate him.

So what does all this mean for 2016? Civil liberties issues don't usually dominate presidential elections, and on the big issues—the economy, immigration reform, healthcare—Paul has been decidedly less bipartisan. But presidential elections are mostly a numbers game: As you are no doubt aware, Obama crushed both John McCain and Mitt Romney among voters ages 18-29 ({66-32}<hyperlink=“http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_08.html”> and {60-37}<hyperlink=“http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html”>, respectively). But George W. Bush was {basically tied with both Al Gore}<hyperlink=“http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_00.html”> and {John Kerry}<hyperlink=“http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_04.html”> among that demographic. If Paul can use civil liberties as a wedge issue to eat away at Democratic margins with young people—particularly in swing states like Ohio, Virginia, Iowa, and in the West—he might actually have a shot in 2016.

Vice,vice27,https://www.vice.com/read/is-president-obama-about-to-send-a-new-york-times-reporter-to-jail-815,Is President Obama About to Send a 'New York Times' Reporter to Jail?,CJ Claramella,08/15/14,09/30/16,"It was one of those frequent but still oddly satisfying moments when the duplicity of the executive branch of the US government is on full display.

In a televised address from Martha's Vineyard Thursday, President Obama declared that ""police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs."" He was referring to the arrest of two reporters Wednesday night in Missouri by the paramilitary clown brigade known as the Ferguson Police Department.

At almost exactly the same moment as Obama's address, embattled New York Times journalist James Risen and several leading press freedom groups were pleading with the Justice Department to drop its years-long crusade to force Risen to reveal his confidential sources under threat of jail time.

Speaking at the National Press Club in DC, Risen called on the Obama administration to drop its case against him- assuming it has any respect whatsoever for the First Amendment.

""The Justice Department and the Obama administration are the ones who turned this really into a fundamental fight over press freedom in their appeal to the Fourth Circuit,"" Risen said. ""I'm happy to carry on the fight, but it wasn't really me who started it.""

A federal grand jury subpoenaed Risen in 2008, and then again in 2010, for allegedly incorporating classified information he received from former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling into a chapter of his 2006 book, State of War.

Risen refused to testify, citing his right to protect his sources, also known as ""reporter's privilege."" A lower court initially sided with him, but the Justice Department won on appeal. The Supreme Court declined to hear Risen's case in June, and he will do time or endure heavy fines {for civil contempt of court}<hyperlink=“http://www.rcfp.org/category/glossary-terms/contempt-court-0”> if he continues to resist the subpoena.

After years of pursuing the case, the Obama administration is now faced with a dilemma of its own making: whether to continue its crackdown on unauthorized leaks and lose the respect of the press, or live up to its lip-service on press freedom and alienate the angry men who run the intelligence community.

Since President Obama took office, his White House has charged more people under the Espionage Act-{eight}<hyperlink=“http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/12/5/obama-and-leakerswhoaretheeightchargedunderespionageact.html”>-than all previous administrations combined. But forcing a prominent journalist to confront jail time would be a different move altogether.

""I don't think the US wants to join Cuba in becoming the only countries in the western hemisphere to have a jailed journalist,"" Courtney Radsch, advocacy director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said at the press conference.

Twenty Pulitzer-winning journalists {issued statements of support}<hyperlink=“https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/08/more-than-dozen-pulitzer-winners-call-justice-dept-end-its-pursuit-james-risen”> for Risen this week, pointing out that he was just doing his job.

""As Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama classified more and more of the government's actions over the last 14 years, denying the public critical information to judge how its democracy is faring, it has fallen to reporters like Risen to keep Americans informed and to question whether a gigantic government in the shadows is really even a good idea,"" Washington Post reporter Dana Priest said in a statement. ""We will all be worse off if this case proceeds.""

Risen's supporters also delivered a {petition}<hyperlink=“http://act.rootsaction.org/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=9775”> Thursday morning to the Justice Department with 100,000 signatures.

""Your effort to compel New York Times reporter James Risen to reveal his sources is an assault on freedom of the press,"" the petition reads. ""Without confidentiality, journalism would be reduced to official stories-a situation antithetical to the First Amendment. We urge you in the strongest terms to halt all legal action against Mr. Risen and to safeguard the freedom of journalists to maintain the confidentiality of their sources.""

Whichever choice the Obama administration makes will leave a lasting mark on its legacy. It will also have implications for a federal ""shield law"" bill currently moving through the US Senate.

The {bill}<hyperlink=“http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:S.987:”> was revived last year after revelations that the Justice Department {secretly}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/under-sweeping-subpoenas-justice-department-obtained-ap-phone-records-in-leak-investigation/2013/05/13/11d1bb82-bc11-11e2-89c9-3be8095fe767_story.html”> subpoenaed phone records from the Associated Press in an attempt to root out leakers. It has {passed}<hyperlink=“http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/09/12/senate-judiciary-committee-approves-media-shield-bill/2807045/”> through the Senate Judiciary Committee but has yet to make it to the floor for debate.

Facing intense backlash from the media after the AP scandal, the White House {came out in support}<hyperlink=“http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/15/politics/presidents-leakers/”> of the shield law bill, even as its Justice Department continued to press the Risen case.

Shield law advocates hope that, if Risen is held in contempt of court, it will at least give the Senate bill enough momentum to pass in the scant time before the current legislative session ends.

Although 48 states have enacted some kind of shield law protecting journalists from being compelled to reveal their sources in court, there is no such federal statute.

""My oldest son Tom is a journalist, and I want to make sure the same protections I had are still there for future journalists,"" Risen said.

The Justice Department did not respond to calls and emails from VICE seeking comment. However, spokesman Brian Fallon did tweet his support for the two reporters arrested Wednesday, The Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly and Washington Post's Wesley Lowery.

""DOJ is lucky to have a gutsy reporter like Ryan J. Reilly on our beat,"" Fallon {tweeted}<hyperlink=“https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/499770404412882946”>. ""We knew that even before tonight. Glad he and Wesley Lowery are ok.""

Vice,vice28,https://news.vice.com/article/how-dare-mayor-de-blasio-tell-new-yorkers-to-submit-to-the-nypd,How Dare Mayor de Blasio Tell New Yorkers To Submit to the NYPD,Natasha Lennard,08/17/14,09/30/16,"This week, Mayor Bill de Blasio asked New Yorkers to be entirely irrational. With some incredulity-provoking remarks, the mayor did the equivalent of asking well-reasoned atheists to get on their knees and pray anyway. He asked us to trust the police.

Specifically, de Blasio {advised that}<hyperlink=“http://gothamist.com/2014/08/14/dont_f_the_police.php”> New Yorkers should always submit to arrest when an NYPD officer decides to detain them. ""When a police officer comes to the decision that it's time to arrest someone, that individual is obligated to submit to arrest,"" he said during a press conference in Harlem. ""They will then have every opportunity for due process in our court system.""

The problems with his suggestion are myriad. Firstly, he delivered them in the midst of national furor over the police killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black young man {in Ferguson}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/article/the-ferguson-riots-are-not-a-shift-away-from-peace-theyre-a-challenge-to-violence”>, Missouri, and just a few weeks after NYPD cops strangled {Eric Garner to death}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/article/after-eric-garners-death-cops-still-wont-do-the-right-thing”> on a Staten Island sidewalk. 

In the last ten days, cops in Los Angeles {killed two unarmed men}<hyperlink=“http://ktla.com/2014/08/14/lapd-officers-fatally-beat-father-during-traffic-stop-a-week-before-ezell-ford-shooting-family-says/”> — Ezell Ford, who suffered from mental illness, was reportedly lying on the ground when shot dead by the LAPD and, a week earlier, Omar Abrego was apparently fatally beaten by police during a traffic stop. With these deaths being just the latest incidents in a brutal pantheon, de Blasio's comments did the tacitly violent work of victim blaming. 

The suggestion is that if these young men had simply submitted to arrest, they might be alive. Perhaps de Blasio thinks Brown should have subjugated himself more. It is apparently not enough to raise one's hands and say, ""Don't Shoot."" Perhaps Oscar Grant could have been more prostrate on the Fruitvale Station platform in Oakland, to have avoided death by cop bullet. 

Furthermore, what counts as resistance to arrest in this country would be laughable if it weren't so tragic. ""Resisting"" charges are tacked on in the case of nearly any physical altercation. The mechanics of police impunity begin with their ability to liberally claim that they were faced with resistance. No activity is too docile to avoid charges of resisting arrest. Therein lies the rub: De Blasio's comments support a system in which citizens, particularly young black citizens, are forcible taught that any behavior except total docility and subjugation can and will be punished. 

De Blasio's suggestion that we should trust police judgment on arrests — or at the very least have faith that any bad cop decisions will be rectified in the courts — flies in the face of pretty much everything we see in the criminal justice system. De Blasio must know (his very mayoral campaign relied on touting such facts) that of the more than 5 million stops-and-frisks carried out under his predecessor Bloomberg, {88 percent}<hyperlink=“https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/freedom_watch/nypd_make_5_millionth_stop_and_frisk_under_bloomberg”> did not result in an arrest or a summons, let alone conviction. Yet his platform for mayor rested on agreeing with enraged New Yorkers that this police practice was discriminatory and ruinous to the lives of young black and brown men in the city. 

How dare the mayor of New York ask for our trust in ""due process"" while the officer that shot dead unarmed Bronx teen Ramarley Graham in his grandmother's bathroom walks free. That happened two years ago and the promise of a Justice Department investigation remains unfulfilled. Eric Garner's killers have not even been removed from the police force. And how dare he speak of ""due process"" when at least 94 percent of criminal cases in this country {don't even go to trial}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/us/stronger-hand-for-judges-after-rulings-on-plea-deals.html?_r=0”>, but end in guilty pleas as the threat of draconian mandatory minimum sentencing runs high. 

Of course, I don't expect a mayor to urge citizens to resist arrest. And I never had faith in de Blasio's lofty promises to cleanse the NYPD of its violent and racist tendencies — his choice of {Bill ""Broken Windows"" Bratton}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/article/nypds-broken-windows-policing-is-the-same-old-stop-and-frisk”> confirmed that the police war on the poor and black would push on. But de Blasio's remarks about arrests give pause for thought on our authoritarian reality. To resist arrest at all can be a fatal game for young black people in this country; and anything at all can and will be construed as resisting. There's no hyperbole in seeing totalitarianism here — total subservience to authority, we have been told, is the least required.",54,NA,NA,NA

There have been conflicting media reports about exactly what happened, {but police say that after they told Brown and another young man}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/us/looting-and-unrest-follows-vigil-for-st-louis-teenager.html?_r=0”> to use the sidewalk, there was a physical altercation with the officer in question, and Brown tried to take the officer’s gun before beginning to flee.

Police said only that another individual was with Brown, that one of the two fought with the police officer, and that Brown was shot multiple times about 35 feet from the cop cruiser. The other individual—Johnson, presumably—was not arrested. 

A photo of Brown’s body lying face down in the street circulated on social media over the weekend. The FBI began looking into the shooting. And on Sunday, a peaceful protest turned violent after riot cops moved in, and some of the protesters started looting, leading to 32 arrests, and two police officers injured.

It’s easy to say that the looting of unrelated small businesses isn’t justified—it isn’t—and leave it at that. But {the anger}<hyperlink=“http://jezebel.com/this-is-why-were-mad-about-the-shooting-of-mike-brown-1619522935”> needs to be explored. It’s not just the {loss of yet another young man’s life}<hyperlink=“http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2014/08/mike_brown_shooting_ferguson_family.php”>, but that an entire community assumes the worst of the police after this incident. It’s humanly possible that they are mistaken, but even if all the proper investigations indicate they are, the locals will doubt it. And it’s hard to blame them.

Cops need to understand that they have done a great deal to cultivate distrust over the years, particularly in minority communities, and most especially {among blacks}<hyperlink=“http://www.gallup.com/poll/163175/minorities-less-confident-police-small-business.aspx”>.

They need to understand why this all sometimes feels like a {bitter joke}<hyperlink=“http://www.clickhole.com/article/8-more-unarmed-teens-still-large-731”>.

If you read PoliceOne or other websites where cops interact with each other, you can pick up the attitude that now permeates law enforcement—namely, {that they are warriors}<hyperlink=“http://www.policeone.com/Officer-Safety/articles/6261735-Warrior-mindset-8-elements-of-tactical-performance/”> going into {battle}<hyperlink=“http://www.policeone.com/police-products/training/articles/1832533-Cognitive-thinking-and-the-tactical-warrior/”>. This is more than unhealthy: This idea has a casualty count.

And there just doesn’t seem to be any justice for individuals killed by police. It’s not just young black males who suffer the brunt of that, but they sure seem to be among the most expendable. On August 9, VICE News’ Natasha Lennard {wrote a depressing summary}<hyperlink=“https://news.vice.com/article/the-fight-for-justice-is-a-fight-against-the-nypd?utm_source=vicenewstwitter”> of some of the New York Police Department’s most alarming incidents of shooting unarmed black men, and the lack of accountability thereafter.

Stop and frisk continues with {“Broken Windows” policing}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/is-going-after-subway-panhandlers-smart-policing-strategy”>. Repeat, repeat, repeat.

The spike in violent crime back in the 80s and early 90s was real, but {many cops seem immune to statistics about crime having declined}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/is-going-after-subway-panhandlers-smart-policing-strategy”> since then. The drug war as an excuse to pat down passers-by has not exactly improved the tone of police interactions with communities they supposedly serve. Police departments flush with riot gear and military technology further alienate officers from the people they are tasked with protecting. International blowback teaches us that people get pissed when an occupying army rolls into town. Police may not be an army, per se, but in practice they are too close for comfort. Many Americans do not feel protected by police, and instead feel threatened. And when someone dies by an officer’s hands, folks can’t help but assume the worst, and that the truth will never come out.

Now for the rest of this week’s bad cops:

-On Tuesday in Antioch, California, {police violently arrested an as-yet unnamed man, and part of the arrest was captured on bystander video}<hyperlink=“http://abc7news.com/news/witnesses-upset-over-antioch-arrest-police-taking-cellphones/249975/”>. According to a bizarrely-timid news report on the incident, however, multiple people said that police browbeat them into turning over their phones or deleting video evidence. Witnesses say the victim was a mentally ill homeless guy, and that he was handcuffed while police used a Taser, batons, and set a police dog on him. In video uploaded by one of the witnesses, you can hear the sound of a Taser being used. To clarify, cops can tell you to stand back and not “interfere” with their arrest. They might demand your phone if you film something, but {they may not legally take it from you}<hyperlink=“http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2014/08/09/northern-california-cops-beat-mentally-ill-man-seize-phones-claim-right/”> just for recording an arrest. They might act like they can take it, but don’t give in. Somebody may need you to be tough on their behalf.

-Until earlier this year, Illinois had what turned out to be an unconstitutionally broad anti-wiretapping law that was sometimes used to prevent normal people from filming the police. That law was overturned in March, but not all cops have caught up. In a video uploaded to YouTube on August 7, seven cars of Chicago Police disperse a nonviolent crowd. The video begins with a woman on camera, who has apparently been giving out massages, and she shows one officer her massage chair. The woman says the park is the place where people feel safe from the Chicago crime, and that they don’t mind cops being present, but they do resent being automatically kicked out just for being in a group. This first officer, to his credit, is listening to the woman speak her mind without throwing his weight around. {Then another cop car pulls up, and a female officer}<hyperlink=“http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2014/08/08/chicago-cop-snatches-camera-handcuffs-man-recording-without-permission/”>—holding a cellphone—steps out of the car and instantly grabs the man filming, aggressively asks whether he had been given “permission to record me” and eventually cuffs the guy. Know your rights, as {Chicagoist pointed out}<hyperlink=“http://chicagoist.com/2014/08/09/watch_chicago_police_officer_harass.php”>, but that goes for cops as well: know our rights, such as the right to film you.

-Previously at Bad Cop Blotter, {I mentioned the case of Shaneen Allen}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/you-can-get-years-in-prison-for-bringing-legal-guns-to-the-wrong-state-728”>, a mother of two arrested after a traffic stop in New Jersey because she was carrying her (legal in Pennsylvania) concealed weapon. In that space, I wished that at some point in the law and order chain, a cop, or the prosecutor—someone!—would have used some restraint and realized that this woman did not mean anyone harm, and should not be facing three and a half years in prison. Well, the latest news is that Allen now faces {11 and a half years in prison instead}<hyperlink=“http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/26222456/honest-gun-owning-mom-now-facing-11-years-behind-bars”>. Citizens had damn well better know the laws; for cops, they often seem more like a suggestion.

-The July 1 beating of 51-year-old Marlene Pinnock by a member of the California Highway Patrol provoked media attention and popular outrage. The CHP never released the name of the officer captured on witness video repeatedly punching the homeless Pinnock, officially to prevent her from walking into traffic and endangering herself or others. However, {according to a federal lawsuit filed by Pinnock}<hyperlink=“http://abc7.com/news/lawsuit-filed-against-chp-in-roadway-beating-case/196860/”>, the officer is Daniel L. Andrew—and she wants him fired. Last weekend, {Pinnock told an ABC affiliate}<hyperlink=“http://abc13.com/news/woman-beaten-by-chp-officer-speaks-out-to-eyewitness-news/251673/”> her thoughts about the incident. She said Andrew didn’t speak to her at all, and she thought “he was trying to kill me. He was just socking me with all his strength, with his hands all up over his head, giving it all he had.” CHP’s unwillingness to even name the officer suggests they are not interested in accountability. Andrew’s apparent belief that repeat punching is how you help people suggests that he should not have a job anymore.

-Internal Affairs {is investigating}<hyperlink=“http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Family-Says-SWAT-Team-Roughed-Up-Children-270526351.html”> how the Miami Police Department injured two children during a July 31 SWAT raid. During the course of the narcotics bust, the 13-year-old nephew of Bobby McClendon was allegedly hit on the head by the butt of a firearm, and McClendon’s 12-year old son received an eye injury—allegedly from the fist of a police officer who decided he was not responding to command quickly enough. Officer Delrish Moss said the nephew “ran into” the gun of the officers, and he was unaware as to how the 12-year-old was injured. McClendon disputes the accuracy of the search warrant, though Miami Police say they got the right house. Unspecified narcotics and a firearm were found in the home, but no arrests were made.

Michael Brown
A MAN WAS SHOT IN FERGUSON DURING PROTESTS AGAINST POLICE
A state of emergency was declared by the Missouri governor on Saturday

On Saturday night, a man was shot in Ferguson, Missouri during a protest against police.

The demonstrations erupted the previous Sunday after police shot dead Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in the St Louis suburb. 

In response to the lootings and clashes with police that followed the shooting, Missouri governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency in Ferguson, imposing a curfew from midnight to 5AM.

On Saturday, a crowd remained on the town's main street after midnight, shouting, “No justice, no curfew” at police. The cops responded with a barrage of tear gas, which they defended as a ""proper response"" after a police car was shot at.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt Ron Johnson said one person was shot and critically wounded, and that police had arrested seven others.

A group of 35 people understood to be Afghan Sikhs were found in a shipping container at Tilbury Docks after they were heard screaming for help.

One man was found dead, while the others were taken to hospital to be treated for severe dehydration and hypothermia.

Thirty of the men, women and children have since been released into the care of police and Border Force staff, and will now be interviewed to find out they came to be in the container, which travelled to Essex on a freighter from Zeebrugge, Belgium. 

Essex police have described the group as victims of ""people trafficking"" and have launched a homicide investigation into the man's death.


Scottish Independence
POLLS SHOW THE SCOTTISH PRO-INDEPENDENCE VOTE IS GROWING
But Salmond's uncertainty over currency is still holding the Yes campaign back

({via}<hyperlink=“http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/17/scottish-independence-poll-yes-gains-ground”>)

Scottish referendum polls suggest that the No camp's lead is narrowing, with the future of the health service set to be the focus of the Scottish independence debate this week. 

The prospect of NHS cuts in Scotland is increasing backing for independence among women, and an ICM poll found that the Yes campaign had gained support by four percentage points since last month.

Excluding undecided voters, the poll found the lead for no remained at 55 percent, a decrease of two points from last month, while support for yes had increased by two points to 45 percent. 

Last week, Alex Salmond claimed that a no vote would lead to worse NHS services in Scotland; the Scottish Conservative health spokesman, Jackson Carlaw, called his suggestion ""shameless scaremongering"".

In other independence news, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said “as a friend of Britain, as an observer from afar, it’s hard to see how the world would be helped by an independent Scotland”.

But are we really too tough on white-collar criminals? And has it always been this way-with the rich getting preferential treatment? Or have public institutions been corrupted in recent years (as {Matt Taibbi argued}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/we-talked-to-matt-taibbi-about-criminalized-poverty-and-why-wall-street-is-above-the-law”> in his recent book The Divide) by the {growing stranglehold}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/mass-incarceration-in-america”> of the prison-industrial complex and {Wall Street money}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/big-moneys-obama”>? I called up Noah Feldman, a legal historian at Harvard Law School, for some context on the dire state of criminal justice in America.

VICE: How new is this problem of two criminal justice systems?
Noah Feldman: It's definitely not a new thing. Go back to, say, the Great Depression when the Roosevelt administration came into office saying, 'We're going to get rid of the fat cats.' They initiated a criminal prosecution of Andrew Mellon, who had been secretary of the treasury three times. He was the third-richest man in America. He was like Bill Gates and [former Clinton administration Treasury Secretary] Bob Rubin wrapped into one.

They realized very quickly that they weren't going to be able to get a criminal conviction. They couldn't even get an indictment of him. You know how they say they can indict a ham sandwich? But they tried to indict him in Pittsburgh-where he was God basically-so that was pretty telling. They went far with the civil case against him. And even there, the best they could come up with was not a judgment he had done anything wrong, but that he had to pay some extra taxes.

This is a guy who would literally sign over all his assets to a shell company on the 29th of December and then they'd sign them back to him on January 1st. So we're talking about a very old tradition where the very rich are not like you and me.

How should we be dealing with white-collar crime in America?
There are different minds about the right way to go about prosecuting these big, faceless corporations, right? But going after the corporation-like getting a criminal conviction of the corporation-which happened in the Enron situation and more importantly the Arthur Andersen situation, has a weird result. Which is that it can often bankrupt the company. And that's what happened in the Andersen situation. So there will always be people who will say, if you bankrupt the company, you're sticking it to the shareholders. But it's not the shareholders' fault. And if you look at who are the main shareholders with Bank of America, it's a blue chip stock. So that's like, a bunch of pension funds. There's a kind of credible argument that putting them out of business is a bad idea. And when you add to that that these are major American companies that employ a lot of people and add to that the economy is a little iffy anyway, you can sort of see the rational argument for not going after them criminally. I would describe that as classic Obama administration pragmatism.

But was it the right move? 
My gut says the same thing yours does. People should be hanging for this. We should see people swinging in the wind. But this is the problem with the Obama approach, no matter how moralistic you are, when you break down the pragmatic arguments, there's something to them. They can't be completely ignored. But often that ends you up in some terrible place. Like, there's lots of pragmatic reasons not to get involved in Syria: Assad is bad, the opposition is bad, everybody's bad, and then boom here comes ISIS. So there's times when being pragmatic leads directly to your own funeral. Is this an example of that? It's always hard to know. You don't want to mess with the financial system in this delicate moment. If Bank of America had been held criminally liable, who knows what the consequences would have been?

Except most critics of the Obama administration on its approach to financial crime don't want to see the banks put out of business. They just want a few of the guys running the show singled out and prosecuted for wrecking the economy. 
It's hard to identify individuals. And once identified, it would be hard to get convictions. And once you've got convictions, they're not going to be higher-ups. The interesting conviction would be some senior-level executive who allowed people to get mortgages in 15 minutes. I know that to be a factor because I got my mortgage for my house in 15 minutes. So it'd be nice, but to show that kind of thing, first you'd have to convict all the little guys who actually did the lying, to show a pattern in their practice. And then once you've done that, then you can come in and go after the senior guy. But that senior guy will probably get off because he'll say I didn't know anything about it. There's some kinds of things that should be criminal that are really hard to prove in practice. It's a quirk of our system designed to protect the innocent rather than to punish the guilty, but it protects a lot of the guilty people along the way and this is a classic example of that. I don't want to say you couldn't get any convictions, but you wouldn't get many and they would not be of high-level people.

Maybe I'm just being nostalgic, but for a while there it seemed like we were really going after white-collar crime. Lately, though, government lawyers have {become cautious}<hyperlink=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html”> and shied away from some of the thornier cases. 
I think that these things go in cycles, and the Obama administration cycle has been not just cautious, but super cautious. And you ought to go beyond the financial side and look at the torture. The president said, not that long ago, ""We tortured some folks."" Torture is a crime, it is a criminal violation, and the president of the United States said we tortured. So how does that shit happen and there's no criminal prosecutions? The pragmatic cautious approach: 'We don't want to be vindictive, we want the CIA to do its job, and by the way, it would be bad politics and look partisan.' What this adds up to is really something pretty depressing. Should the CIA guy who actually poured the water over the guy's mouth go to prison? Should it be Dick Cheney? Well it can't be Dick Cheney, so therefore it's going to be nobody.

So you don't see this as a longer term trend toward corruption in the legal system, but instead a cyclical process that just kinda sucks right now?
Go back to the 1870s, when the railroads were being built and the robber barons controlled the courts, a lot of those New York State courts. They were using them to enrich themselves at the expense of the public. And there was a real fear at the time among progressives, the first progressives, that basically law and politics had been completely corrupted by monied interests, and that we were no longer a republic run by the citizens but we were a kleptocracy run by robber barons. And they responded to that by coming up with the invention of regulation. And they invented, among other things, the Interstate Commerce Commission to fight corruption, specifically in the railroads. And they saw it as make or break for democracy. So there are moments in history when it looks like the money is running the show. In those moments, there needs to be a structural response. And I think we're in need of a new set of structural responses.",10,NA,NA,NA
Vice,vice32,http://www.vice.com/read/inside-the-grand-jury-why-texas-governor-rick-perry-was-charged-with-two-alleged-felonies-665,Inside the Grand Jury: Why Texas Governor Rick Perry Was Charged with Two Felonies,Murray Waas,08/16/14,09/30/16,"A grand jury indicted Texas governor Rick Perry late yesterday on two felony charges alleging that he had abused his public office and engaged in the coercion of another public official—a district attorney who was investigating Perry’s administration and political backers.

The criminal charges stem from Perry using the official powers of his office as governor to attempt to remove Rosemary Lehmberg, a Travis County district attorney, from office, while Lehmberg was investigating allegations that Perry’s political allies and campaign contributors had received preferential treatment while obtaining grants from a Texas state cancer-fighting agency.

After Lehmberg pleaded guilty to drunk driving charges last year, Perry vetoed a $7.5 million appropriation by the state legislature to fund the Travis County Public Integrity Unit of the district attorney’s office. Perry said he vetoed the funding for the anti-corruption unit because the drunk driving charges proved that Lehmberg was unfit for office—while others viewed the governor’s actions as an attempt to stymie and defund an investigation of many of Perry’s closest political associates as Perry himself was preparing his second run for the presidency.

There was nothing illegal in and of itself with Perry vetoing funding for the anti-corruption unit. Perry's attorneys and backers weren't the only people arguing that Perry was acting within his proper constitutional authority. Most outside legal experts and scholars have agreed that that was the case. For that reason, most of the state's political establishment expected that the grand jury would complete its work without charging Perry.

But the grand jury alleged that Perry had committed two felonies. And the charges were not brought solely because of Perry's veto, but because Perry had told Lehmberg through intermediaries that he would refrain from the veto in the first place if Lehmberg resigned, and when that did not work, he offered to restore the funding if she resigned.

The indictment stunned both Perry and his top aides.  As a reporter for VICE last week questioned senior aides to the governor for a story that was to detail their testimony before the grand jury, suggesting that Perry might be charged, the aides said none of them had been contacted again since their grand jury testimony. The aides also said that the special prosecutor investigating the matter had given no indication to Perry or his legal counsel that any charges might be brought.

Despite the widespread belief that Perry would not be charged, Michael McCrum, the special prosecutor who led the grand jury investigation, previously said {in an interview with VICE}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/rick-perry-hired-a-lawyer-who-once-tried-to-turn-him-in-to-the-fbi-717”>, posted on July 17, that even though the grand jurors hearing the evidence had not made, as of that time, any decision as to whether or not to charge the governor, they had heard “crucial testimony that could be a cause of serious concern.”

“I’m investigating the circumstances surrounding the veto and whether the governor’s actions were appropriate or not under the law,” {McCrum said}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/rick-perry-hired-a-lawyer-who-once-tried-to-turn-him-in-to-the-fbi-717”> during the interview. “My duty is to look at all of the laws and determine whether any were broken by the governor or anyone else.”

Yesterday, McCrum surprised seemingly everyone, disclosing that the grand jury had decided to charge Perry with two felonies: “I looked at the law and looked at the facts, and I presented everything possible to the grand jury,” he said. “In this case, the grand jury has spoken and I am going forward with the duty bestowed upon me.”

In its first felony charge, the grand jury alleged that Perry abused his official authority as related to Perry’s vetoing the funding for the anti-government unit. (The indictment can be read in its entirety {here}<hyperlink=“https://lintvkxan.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/rick-perry-indictment.pdf”>.)

The second charge related to coercion of a public official, {which, as McCrum explained}<hyperlink=“http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140815-gov.-rick-perry-indicted-on-charges-of-abuse-of-power-coercion.ece”>, involved Perry “threatening Rosemary Lehmberg in her capacity as a public servant to resign or otherwise he would veto” funding for her Public Integrity Unit. 

“Like many schemes, it started with vodka,” Christopher Hooks, a blogger and columnist for the Texas Observer, {commented}<hyperlink=“http://www.texasobserver.org/everything-wanted-know-rick-perrys-new-scandal/”>.

In April 2013, Lehmberg was arrested on drunk driving charges after authorities found her with an open vodka bottle in the front seat of her car, while she was parked in a church parking lot. Lehmberg pleaded guilty, was sentenced to a 45-day jail term, and served about half her sentence—and then she successfully deflected calls from Perry and others for her resignation.

At the time of Lehmberg’s arrest, virtually everyone knew that she would plead guilty to misdemeanor charges. Nobody foresaw the governor later being indicted by a grand jury on two felonies.

When Lehmberg refused to resign, Perry threatened to veto funding of her Public Integrity Unit—which investigates corruption of local, state, and federal public officials. Sources close to the investigation told me that Perry’s threat happened as the unit’s prosecutors were investigating whether Perry’s political backers and campaign contributors had received preferential and improper treatment in receiving grants from an anti-cancer state agency, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is now running to be Rick Perry’s Republican successor as governor, {sat on the CPRIT’s governing board}<hyperlink=“http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houstoNArticle/Abbott-s-role-at-cancer-agency-under-fire-4691334.php”>. Abbott’s largest campaign contributors also {allegedly benefited}<hyperlink=“http://lonestarproject.net/greg-abbott-cprit-favors-friends#.U-9Gb7xdUVk”> from preferential treatment and received grants.

Last December, a grand jury indicted Jerald Cobbs, a senior executive of CPRIT, on charges that he allegedly violated the law while awarding an $11 million grant to Peloton Therapeutics, a Dallas, Texas-based biotech company. A major investor in the firm had earlier made more than $440,000 in campaign contributions to Perry and his Lieutenant Governor, David Dewhurst.

And as he prepared for a suspected second presidential run, Perry obviously didn’t want to be diminished. Only last week, apparently unaware that the Travis County grand jury would indict him, Perry returned triumphantly from a four-day trip to Iowa, which holds the first presidential caucus. Perry was also readying to go to New Hampshire and South Carolina, the two states that hold the first and second presidential primaries. Frustrated statehouse Texas newspaper reporters complain that they can go months and months without being able to ask the governor a single question while Perry has eagerly made himself available to any obscure radio station or small Iowa weekly paper that wishes to speak to him.

Had Perry simply vetoed funding for the anti-corruption unit, he probably wouldn’t be facing criminal charges today. But before the veto, Perry, through intermediaries, said he would not veto the funds if Lehmberg resigned. After the veto, he then offered to restore the funding if she resigned from office. Sources close to the investigation say that the Travis County grand jury, which indicted Perry, heard testimony from at least four of Perry’s senior aides. They allegedly described to the grand jury Perry’s strategy to remove Lehmberg. Two other people testified in detail about how they had served as intermediaries in an effort to convince Lehmberg to leave. 

The grand jury indictment of Perry is further complicated by {VICE’s recent disclosures}<hyperlink=“http://www.vice.com/read/rick-perry-hired-a-lawyer-who-once-tried-to-turn-him-in-to-the-fbi-717”> that over a decade ago Perry’s own defense attorney, David Botsford, brought evidence of alleged wrongdoing to the FBI in an unsuccessful effort to initiate a federal criminal investigation of Perry.

The man entrusted with defending Perry before a jury of his peers and keeping him from going to prison once worked just as hard to put Perry in jail.

So far, Texas taxpayers have been footing the bill to pay Botsford to defend Perry. According to state records, the defense attorney has received more than $80,000 to date. Now that a criminal indictment has been brought, the price tag will almost certainly increase by hundreds of thousands of dollars and possibly millions. Some in the Texas state legislature have also questioned whether public funds should be used to pay for Perry’s legal defense. The issue will almost certainly intensify in coming days, a senior legislative staffer told me yesterday.

In a statement last night, Botsford said: “The facts of the case conclude that the governor’s veto was lawful, appropriate, and well within the authority of the office of the governor. Today’s action... is nothing more than an effort to weaken the constitutional authority granted to the office of Texas governor, and sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a grand jury to punish the exercise of a lawful and constitutional authority afforded to the Texas governor.”

Conservative backers of the governor and {a news article in the Washington Post}<hyperlink=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/texas-gov-rick-perry-indicted-for-abuse-of-office-coercion/2014/08/15/d173907c-24d5-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?hpid=z1”> last night also questioned the validity of the prosecution, pointing out that Perry’s veto was carried out as part of his constitutional responsibilities. But the grand jurors alleged in their indictment that Perry’s threats to Lehmberg and pressure to have her resign, coupled with the veto, led to the criminal charges.

The Washington Post’s article and many conservative blogs suggested that the criminal justice process might have been politicized because the grand jury that indicted Perry was empanelled in progressive Travis County. Botsford echoed these beliefs, alleging that his client’s indictment was the result of politics. He said in his statement yesterday: “This clearly represents political abuse of the court system.” 

As VICE first reported, however, Perry largely hired Botsford because he’s a progressive Democratic activist whom Perry believes can more effectively represent him because of his political connections.

“I think if Governor Perry had chosen a Republican lawyer from Houston or Dallas, that would have been a mistake,” Ben Florey, a former Travis County assistant district attorney, told me in an interview. “David knows the nuances and practices of law in Travis County.”

But the charges of partisanship appear not to stand up to scrutiny in this particular instance. McCrum is a former federal prosecutor and considered non-partisan. In 2009, both of Texas’s conservative Republican Senators, John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison, recommended to President Obama that he {nominate McCrum}<hyperlink=“http://www.mainjustice.com/2014/08/16/michael-mccrum-special-prosecutor-of-texass-rick-perry-and-the-road-not-taken/”> to be the United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas. San Antonio’s Democratic Congressman, Lloyd Doggett, initially held back his support for McCrum to be US Attorney because he was upset that the Obama administration was too deferential to Republicans when they made such appointments. Later he also supported McCrum.

Earlier, McCrum had been an assistant US attorney in the Western District of Texas for the better part of a decade. Solomon Wisenberg worked as a federal prosecutor alongside McCrum in San Antonio and considers McCrum a friend. Wisenberg told me that McCrum is a measured and careful lawyer—“a stellar person and attorney in every sense of the word.”

Some news organizations and blogs also erroneously suggested that McCrum was associated with or had even been appointed by the Travis County’s district attorney’s office. In fact, McCrum was appointed as a special prosecutor in the case by a judge from a conservative county. The only role that the district attorney’s office had in the investigation was that Lehmberg and others were questioned as witnesses, sources close to the investigation told me.

Texas Republican and Tea Party Senator Ted Cruz went even further. In a Facebook post supporting Perry after his indictment, Cruz suggested to his 802,978 followers that Perry had actually been charged by the Travis County district attorney’s office: “Unfortunately, there has been a sad history of the Travis County district attorney’s Office engaging in politically-motivated prosecutions, and this latest indictment of the governor is extremely questionable,” Senator Cruz wrote. “Rick Perry is a friend, he’s a man of integrity—I am proud to stand with Rick Perry.”

Whether Cruz’s misinformation was intentional of not is unclear—his office was unavailable for comment as this article was posted—but 28,301 of his Facebook supporters liked his comment as of early Saturday evening.

Perry is the first governor of Texas to face criminal indictment while in office in nearly a hundred years. A Travis Country jury charged {Governor James E. “Pa” Ferguson}<hyperlink=“http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffe05”> in 1917 with embezzlement and other alleged crimes. Facing impeachment, he resigned from office. Seven years later, however, Ferguson’s wife was elected governor, and he returned to help running the state—only for the couple to be turned out of office once again after facing new allegations of malfeasance.

Perry has also been the longest-serving governor of Texas—and one of the state’s most powerful governors in the modern era.

Unsurprisingly, much of the news coverage of Perry’s indictment last night, such as {this Politico article}<hyperlink=“http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/rick-perry-indicted-110071.html?hp=t1”>, focused on how the criminal charges might affect his presidential bid.

But there is much more at stake for the governor. If convicted of the first felony count of abusing his office, Perry would face a penalty of between five and 99 years in prison. Perry also faces two to ten years in prison if he is convicted of the second charge of the indictment.

The governor is expected to be arraigned sometime next week in the Travis County courthouse, not too far from the governor’s mansion.

When at a press conference yesterday a reporter asked McCrum whether the governor will be fingerprinted and also have to endure his mugshot being taken, McCrum replied: “I imagine that’s included in that.”",10,NA,NA,NA
Vice,vice33,https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/theres-a-horrible-new-website-called-satire-105,"'Satire' Is the Dumbest, Most Ridiculous New Website On the Internet",Gavin Haynes,08/19/14,09/30/16,"We’re all aware of the clickbait articles you get on Facebook. Upworthy. Distractify. Viral Nova. But beneath all of them in the moral hierarchy, a new site has sprung to massive popularity pretty much overnight, simply by saying some of the most vulgar, dumb and downright false things in history. It is called Satire, and – warning – it is coming to a Facebook stream near you.

Just how bad is Satire? Well, let’s have a look at some of the recent articles it has posted and see exactly why Satire is the worst new website in the world.

1. They Might Be Racist

Article: ""8 More Unarmed Teens Still At Large"" ({link}<hyperlink=“http://www.clickhole.com/article/8-more-unarmed-teens-still-large-731”>)

Well I’m sorry, Satire, but this is simply outrageous. These teens have done no one any harm. How can you say they are ""still at large""? They’re NOT GUILTY OF ANY DAMN CRIME. It’s not a crime to be ""unarmed"", you idiots. If that were true, you should probably lock up half of America. Just like the Mail, Satire is using emotive language to try to scare you. And are we really to believe that it's just pure coincidence that the majority of the kids in the article are non-white? Or is it an indication of a much deeper, much uglier moral attitude festering beneath the surface? With a headline like that, are Satire seriously suggesting that the likes of Missouri 18-year-old Michael Brown ""deserved"" to die?

Come on, Satire, stop talking in riddles.

2. They Crudely Manipulate Your Heartstrings

Article: ""These Clowns Are Still Beautiful Even Without Their Makeup"" ({link}<hyperlink=“http://www.clickhole.com/article/these-clowns-are-still-beautiful-even-without-thei-676”>)

This is just a crass attempt to harness the power of clowns and personal empowerment to generate more ""likes"" on Facebook. Quit trying to jump on the bangwagon, Satire, it already left; #nomakeupselfies went viral five whole months ago! It’s almost a joke how badly they’ve got this one wrong.

3. They Publish Poorly-Researched Stories

Article: ""5 Tragedies Weirdly Predicted By Adam Sandler"" ({link}<hyperlink=“http://www.clickhole.com/article/5-tragedies-weirdly-predicted-adam-sandler-783”>)

In their latest dispatch, Satire try to claim that Adam Sandler has predicted five major modern tragedies. It goes as far as to say that the comedian and all-round funnyman wore a T-shirt during a 2005 episode of Late Night With Conan O’Brien, that had: “BP OIL SPILL IN FIVE YEARS” written on it. I’ve tried to look up this so-called ""episode"", but there doesn't seem to be a single record of this happening. Did they just make it up? [Editor's note – Our lawyers have asked us to point out that we’re not accusing Satire of lying. But we do await further evidence to ""clarify"" their journalistic standards.]

4. They Treat Their Audience with Contempt

Article: ""Area Facebook User Incredibly Stupid"" ({link}<hyperlink=“http://www.theonion.com/articles/area-facebook-user-incredibly-stupid,36712/”>)

This is really taking the P. People upvote your shit all over their news feeds, and you repay them by writing yet another clickbait article calling them stupid? Just so that people will get angry and click on it and be outraged at how you called them stupid? Do you think people are really that stupid? What a bunch of trolls.

5. But: Every So Often, They March to Their Own Beat

Article: ""GlaxoSmithKline Releases New Drug To Treat People Who Just Feel Sort Of Weird Sometimes"" ({link}<hyperlink=“http://www.theonion.com/articles/glaxosmithkline-releases-new-drug-to-treat-people,36585/”>)

Alright. For all of the evils they are perpetuating, to give Satire their due, they do also cover important stories that most of the mainstream media seem to have purposefully avoided. For exampe, I don't know if this is down to the influence of ""Big Pharma"" or whatever, but I have not read about GlaxoSmithKline releasing a drug to treat people who ""just feel kinda weird sometimes"" at a single other news site. It must count as a scoop.

Clearly, these guys occasionally put real money into proper journalism. More of this, please, and less of all that other nonsense. That way, Satire, maybe it wouldn't feel like you were setting out purely to hoodwink everyone.",31,NA,NA,NA
