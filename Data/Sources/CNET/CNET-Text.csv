One of them concerns the rights of citizens and journalists to film law enforcement.

Reports from Ferguson suggest that law enforcement officers -- many from the St. Louis County Police Department -- have become aggressive in their requests for members of the media and others to stop filming with their mobile phones and other cameras.

Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery, who was arrested Wednesday along with the Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly, {said he was brusquely asked by the police to stop filming.}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html"">

Over the last few years, as smartphones have become almost ubiquitous, police officers across the US have occasionally responded with anger to being filmed in the course of their duty. {Some situations}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnet.com/news/cops-allegedly-get-violent-at-sight-of-samsung-galaxy/""> seem trivial, others much more serious.

{Police have even been accused}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnet.com/news/police-accused-of-erasing-cell-phone-footage-of-fatal-beating/""> of erasing bystanders' mobile phone footage of their behavior.

The law, though, has only really been tested since 2011. And legal decisions move far more slowly than technological developments.

In essence, citizens do have {the First Amendment right}<hyperlink=""http://blog.lawyer.com/index.php/2012-11-2is-it-legal-to-film-police/""> to film police officers in their line of duty in any public place. The one caveat is that those filming shouldn't be obstructing the officers in the process.

""As long as you stay behind the police's yellow lines, you have the right to film or photograph them,"" Clay Calvert, a University of Florida professor of mass communication, told me Thursday.

When it comes to the two reporters who were arrested, Calvert said he could see no evidence that the journalists were somehow impeding the police in their line of work.

First Amendment rights are, however, sometimes treated in a more fluid manner by police acting under extreme stress or merely attempting to unreasonably assert their authority. Some police officers, Calvert said, prefer that the First Amendment issue is decided in a court, rather than debating it on a street.

In the case, for example, of a traffic stop, when police have no idea with whom they might be dealing, gray areas arise -- at least in a police officer's point of view. The individual may be armed. There may be other safety concerns.

One case that remains up in the air {is between Carla Gericke and the Weare, N.H., police. }<hyperlink=""http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/12-2326P-01A.pdf""> She tried to film a traffic stop involving a friend in 2010 and was charged with breaking wiretapping laws. The charges were dropped, but she has sued the town and the police department. Her suit reached the US Court of Appeals. which sent it to US District Court for a jury trial.

Now, {as the New Hampshire Union-Leader reports,}<hyperlink=""http://www.unionleader.com/article/20140525/NEWS07/140529379""> Gericke must try to persuade a jury that she complied with police instructions amid the filming. The police contend that her behavior disrupted them in the line of duty. Who will the jury believe?

It's no surprise that with inconsistent behavior among the police with respect to filming, sites like {Photography Is Not A Crime}<hyperlink=""https://photographyisnotacrime.com/""> exist to reveal instances that might not otherwise be seen or heard of.

Just last week, after the filming of a New York police officer allegedly choking a man to death, the New York Police Department had to remind its officers of the law. {As the New York Daily News reported,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-cops-told-memo-filmed-article-1.1898379""> the NYPD sent out a memo that read, in part: ""Members of the public are legally allowed to record police interactions.""

The memo added: ""Intentional interference such as blocking or obstructing cameras or ordering the person to cease constitutes censorship and also violates the First Amendment.""

This reminder may also have been a response to {a lawsuit asserting that on eight separate occasions,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/nyregion/suit-seeks-to-establish-right-to-record-new-york-police-officers.html?_r=2"">  officers had arrested those who filmed them.

{Now that the Missouri Highway Patrol has been put in charge of Ferguson}<hyperlink=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/missouri-gov-puts-highway-patrol-charge-ferguson-n180891""> by Gov. Jay Nixon, different principles and sensitivities might prevail.

In essence, though, once the police had threatened the media's rights to film them -- as opposed to targeting, as some do, citizen journalists -- their public standing was even shakier.",90,NA,NA,NA

Now, Anonymous is apparently trying to shine a light on police involved in the incident.

The hacking group allegedly got its hands on police dispatch tapes. On Wednesday, Anonymous released a slew of details from police dispatch calls from the day of the shooting on Twitter and posted hours of tape to YouTube.

""#Anonymous has obtained audio files of police dispatch and EMS during the #MikeBrown shooting,"" Anonymous {boasted}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/TheAnonMessage/status/499458771799015424""> from its @TheAnonMessage Twitter account.

Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, was shot multiple times by a local police officer on Saturday. The shooting happened around 1:40 p.m. and Brown's body was left on the sidewalk for hours afterward. The Ferguson police have since been accused of racism and become the focus of intense criticism and violent protests.

St. Louis County Police have taken over the investigation into the Brown shooting. The name of the officer involved in the shooting hasn't been released.

According to the dispatch tapes released by Anonymous, the police allegedly requested assistance for crowd control before mentioning any shooting or calling in for emergency medical services. The dispatcher in the tapes also mentions that the department got information about the shooting from the news, rather than from police at the scene.

It's unclear whether the tapes are authentic. CNET has contacted the St. Louis County Police to verify their authenticity and for comment. We will update the story when we get more information.

Anonymous has hacked into police departments in the past. Sometimes the group looks for information to publish. Other times it just wants to take down police websites -- as it did in {Utah}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnet.com/news/ohio-man-charged-in-utah-police-hacks/""> and {Illinois}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnet.com/news/hacktivists-claim-takedown-of-chicago-police-web-site/""> in 2012.

Presumably, the hackers involved in this distributed-denial-of-service attack are protesting the St. Louis County Police's involvement in the killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and the demonstrations that have ensued.

Brown was shot multiple times by a local police officer on Saturday. The shooting happened around 1:40 p.m. and Brown's body was left on the sidewalk for hours afterward. In the wake of the shooting, police have declined to name the officer involved.

The Ferguson police have since been accused of racism and become the focus of intense criticism and violent protests.

On Wednesday, a group claiming to be affiliated with Anonymous announced it had {hacked the St. Louis County Police to get dispatch tapes}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnet.com/news/anonymous-hacks-into-ferguson-police-site-for-dispatch-tapes/""> from the day of the shooting. The group released alleged details from police dispatch calls on its @TheAnonMessage Twitter account and posted hours of tape to YouTube.

Then, earlier on Thursday, the group said it found the name of the officer involved and tweeted out the name of a man. The St. Louis County Police quickly {tweeted}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/stlcountypd/status/499929823704133633""> back that the person identified ""is not even an officer with Ferguson or St. Louis County PD.

Since this incident, the @TheAnonMessage Twitter account has been suspended. When CNET contacted Twitter for more information, a company spokesperson said, ""We don't comment on individual accounts.""

CNET,cnet4,http://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-testing-satire-tag-for-parody-news-in-the-feed/,Facebook testing 'satire' tag for parody news in the feed,Dara Kerr,8/18/2014,3/21/2016,"The {top story}<hyperlink=""http://www.theonion.com/article/area-facebook-user-incredibly-stupid-36712""> on parody news site The Onion on Monday was titled ""Area Facebook User Incredibly Stupid."" It was a spoof story about a Facebooker that appears ""frequently frustrated"" but is really just ""incredibly stupid.""

While any reader on The Onion site would know this story was a joke, apparently some Facebook users are confused by real news and satire when such stories appear on their News Feeds. It's become so much of a problem that Facebook revealed Monday it's testing a ""satire"" tag for articles from parody news sites.

""We are running a small test which shows the text '[Satire]' in front of links to satirical articles in the related articles unit in News Feed,"" a Facebook spokesperson told the {BBC.}<hyperlink=""http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28834682""> ""This is because we received feedback that people wanted a clearer way to distinguish satirical articles from others in these units.""

Apparently, a handful of parody stories have brought on angry comments from Facebook users who weren't aware the articles were satire, according to the BBC.

Much of the response was critical of the article and many users were seemingly unaware it was meant to be satire.

CNET,cnet5,http://www.cnet.com/news/police-warned-about-tweeting-drunk-or-with-doughnuts-before-social-media-ends-their-career/,Police warned about tweeting drunk or with doughnuts,Richard Trenholm,8/19/2014,3/21/2016,"Police officers have been warned not to tweet while naked, drunk or eating doughnuts. Some boys in blue have failed to show such good judgement online in the past, with UK officers revealed to have committed such offences as making racist or homophobic comments or posing with weapons. Nearly one in 10 such misjudgements proved to be career-ending.

Freedom of Information requests have revealed 828 cases of social media and online-related incidents in England and Wales, taking place between 2009 and February this year. Breaches of online and social media rules include racist or abusive postings, remarks about senior officers, or being spotted in ""compromising positions"".

Most cases were resolved with advice given to the officer in question, while 14 percent required no action and 9 per cent resulted in the officer resigning, retiring or being dismissed.

With 88 incidents reported, Greater Manchester had the highest amount of social media-related incidents, followed by West Midlands and London's Metropolitan police. Essex, Hampshire, Merseyside, and Staffordshire kept their figures under their helmets.

Official social media guidelines issued by the UK's Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) suggest officers and staff shouldn't use social media when they're off-duty and when they've been drinking. But the guidelines are designed to prevent more damage than just the embarrassing viral potential of police officers spotted eating doughnuts (a foodstuff specifically identified by Suffolk police).

The rules also warn of the danger of criminals searching out a police officer's personal information ""with a view to embarrassing, discrediting, harassing, corrupting or blackmailing them or their families for their own benefit"" -- which is just an extension of the advice for police officers to be ex-directory (unlisted in the phone book) and hidden from the electoral role.

Aside from personal use, social media is increasingly used by UK police to offer transparency, with initiatives such as {tweeting every 999 call}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnet.com/news/bobbies-on-the-tweet-as-manchester-police-post-every-incident-to-twitter/""> or {every court case}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnet.com/news/140-characters-make-a-sentence-as-police-tweet-from-court-for-a-day/""> to show the -- often surprising -- problems and requests that really take up an officer's time. When communicating with the public, officers are advised to use plain language, avoiding txt-speak or police jargon. They're also told to ignore trolls.

Oh, and Starsky? When you're undercover, it's suggested, you should turn off the location settings on your phone.

Social media has become a new beat for bobbies to patrol, with one senior office recently telling {the BBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-27949674""> that social media-related complaints made up ""at least half"" of calls to British police. The offences -- bullying, threats, harassment -- are nothing new, but officers are still adapting to the new technology.

CNET,cnet6,http://www.cnet.com/news/the-future-of-tv-may-be-what-comcast-dreams-q-a/,The future of TV may be what Comcast dreams (Q&A),Joan E. Solsman,8/16/2014,3/21/2016,"Everybody wants a crystal ball, but Comcast comes closest to not needing one.

Television is in the midst of its biggest transformation in decades. Traditional networks are putting more programming online, and Netflix and YouTube are putting online video on more TVs than ever before. As the lines blur, ""television"" is becoming any video, and ""TVs"" are becoming any screen.

As the borders between the Internet and television fall, Comcast is grabbing more land than anyone, and in more ways than one. The company's X1 operating system is the first of its kind in the industry, and, based online in the cloud, it basically lets Comcast's TV delivery do anything the Internet can. At the same time, the country's No. 1 pay-TV provider is expected to take over Time Warner Cable. The $45 billion deal will give it control of TV delivery to nearly a third of US homes, and its share of US broadband homes -- depending who you ask -- will range from about 35 percent to more than half.

Combined, that gives Comcast unprecedented sway over TV's future look and feel.

Last year, Marcien Jenckes took the helm of Comcast's Consumer Services Group, which combines all the company's consumer businesses -- video, Internet, phone and home monitoring and security. The executive vice president spoke to CNET about changes in video demand, Comcast's efforts to adapt to it, and his reaction to customer-service train wrecks. The following is an edited Q&A.

Q: How have you seen consumer demand for video shift?
Jenckes: If you went back a few years and asked us what is the future of television, here's what we would have said. It's a lot about time-shifting: Consumers are watching things when they want them. It's about location-shifting: You're no longer tethered by a cord to your television. Content sources are melding: If you want to watch everything about Ferguson, Missouri, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to go to the same place and see what MSNBC or YouTube or the Onion are saying about it. Personalization: Everything else I've talked about leads to a very personalized experience -- I can now watch what I want on demand, when I want it, on whatever device I want, from whatever source I want.

Going back several years, we've had this view of the world. Everything that we've done from a product perspective has gone toward enabling it.

Q: As video started moving online, cannibalization was a common fear, but it has played out that the more you give people, the more they watch -- the math of how much people are watching video almost doesn't seem to add up to the hours in a day.
Jenckes: You can't go wrong with doing what's right for the consumer. You can't do it irresponsibly, too, to the economics of the industry. If we showed up and said to our network partners, ""Here's what we want to do, and we're not sure whether or not it's good for you,"" we wouldn't get very far. Honestly, it's probably one of the things we're most proud of. We've gone, from three years ago, maybe 50,000 hours of on-demand content to now 250,000 hours. We've gone from no live streaming networks out of the home to 60 live streaming networks.

Q: Cannibalization fears affect more than just networks. Were there ever tensions about the fact that Comcast invested so much in cable video delivery, which is being swept closer to irrelevancy by moves like these?
Jenckes: No, not really. This company is 50 years old, and it has always been built with an eye toward being relevant for the next 50 years. There's always been a realization that you have to deliver the best services and the most innovative products in order to be relevant. What's changed over time is what's required in order to do that. While the answer 10 years ago might have been scale, the answer today is having the flexibility to deliver a lot of these services from the cloud and being almost ambivalent as to what screen you're delivering it to.

Q: A critic who heard Comcast say its north star is whatever's right for the consumer might immediately point out that {recent}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnet.com/news/another-comcast-call-recorded-another-comcast-apology/""> customer-service {fiascos}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnet.com/news/could-this-comcast-rep-be-the-worst-service-rep-in-the-world/""> seem to {contradict}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnet.com/news/comcast-admits-service-rep-did-what-he-was-trained-to-do/""> such a claim. How would you respond? 
Jenckes: A couple things. This is a company that is reinventing itself. There's a great line, that cable companies used to be construction companies -- that's what we did, we laid cable and broke up streets -- and we're now software companies, companies focused on consumer experiences. That takes a change in skill-set, a change in mind-set. We're in that same migration around customer service. Are we perfect? Nope. Unfortunately, it's when something goes wrong that it creates a real passion point and it gets a lot of attention.

My mother was a teacher her whole life, and her students love her -- what I used to say to my mom is that most of the time, if you take a take a course and you don't do well, it's because you had a bad teacher, whereas if you take a course and you do do well, it's because you're so smart. That isn't to say we shouldn't do away with the bad, we should, and there's a lot of focus and energy and desire to do that.

The other example I'll tell you about, it doesn't involve us but another cable provider: Last September, when the last season of ""Breaking Bad"" was about to air the season premiere, there was a cable system in Connecticut that went out. And people started calling 911. Imagine what great passion people have to get them to do that.

What I always believe is that we deliver so much value, all these great experiences, we allow people to connect with everything that they're passionate about -- entertainment, their families with their phone, the stuff that they need to do online -- we should be loved. Sometimes things happen that get in the way of that. We have to minimize those. The passion around those negative experiences is long lasting. The bar is very high, but we are very committed to working on it, and we are in the middle of that transformation.",38,NA,NA,NA

For the past week, those protesting a police officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old African-American man, Michael Brown, wanted to film or photograph the police, often with cell phones.

After journalists and members of the public were ordered by some police officers in Ferguson, Mo., to stop filming, some wondered {whether First Amendment rights were being flouted.}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnet.com/news/ferguson-unrest-tests-legal-right-to-film-police/"">

As the situation has calmed a little, but not completely, the ACLU in Missouri met with the Highway Patrol (which is now in charge of security in Ferguson), as well as with the city of Ferguson and the St. Louis County government.

{As Politico reports,}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/08/missouri-aclu-authorities-reach-agreement-on-recording-of-police-194043""> there was agreement that -- as legal experts attest -- everyone has the right to film the police in the course of their duty, as long as those filming are not obstructing the police.

The ACLU had brought a case against the authorities on behalf of journalist Mustafa Hussein, who works for the Argus Media Group.

It alleged that police ordered him to stop filming. He, asserting his First Amendment rights, continued to film.

After incidents in which {police officers have been filmed on cell phones}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/01/justice/new-york-choke-hold-death/""> performing their duties in a questionable manner, police forces across America have been reinforcing to their officers that the right to film is, indeed, a First Amendment right.
