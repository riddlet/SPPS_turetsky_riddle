The SLA, one of the loopiest and most dangerous of the homegrown terrorist groups that flourished in the madhouse of the early 1970s, was already famous for kidnapping and “converting” Patty Hearst when its members engaged in a nationally televised shootout in Los Angeles in 1974.

The firefight, in which six terrorists died without injury to police or bystanders, helped publicize the innovations of a small group of Angeleno police officers. Eight years earlier, after the Watts riots, they began to develop the combat-ready police unit that played a central role in taking down the SLA. That unit was America’s first special weapons and tactics team, or SWAT.

In an era of riots and hijackings, the SWAT model understandably spread nationwide. But as the riots died away and the threat of domestic terror receded, SWAT tactics — helicopters, heavy weaponry, the works — became increasingly integrated into normal crime-fighting, especially into the war on drugs.

This was phase one in the militarization of America’s police forces, as described in Radley Balko’s essential 2013 book on the subject, The Rise of the Warrior Cop. Phase two, in which the federal government began supplying local police with military hardware, began in the 1990s and accelerated after 9/11, under the theory that Islamic terrorists could strike anywhere and that it might take a cop with a grenade launcher to stop them.

In the name of local preparedness, Washington has been bestowing anti-terror grants and Pentagon surplus on communities barely touched by major crime, let alone by terrorism. Tanks and aircraft, helmets and armor, guns and grenade launchers have flowed to police departments from Des Moines (home of two $180,000 bomb-disarming robots) to Keene, N.H., (population 23,000 and the proud custodian of an armored BearCat).

Last week, The New Republic’s Alec MacGillis ran the numbers for Missouri and found that the state’s Department of Public Safety received about $69 million from the Department of Homeland Security in the past five years alone. Which helps explain why the streets of a St. Louis suburb flooded so quickly with cops in gas masks and camouflage, driving armored cars and brandishing rifles like an occupying army. It’s our anti-terror policies made manifest, our tax dollars at work.

It’s also a path to potential disaster, for cops and citizens alike. The “S” in SWAT was there for a reason: Militarized tactics that are potentially useful in specialized circumstances — like firefights with suicidal terrorist groups — can be disastrous when employed for crowd-control purposes by rank-and-file cops.

To many critics of police militarization, of course, the helmets and heavy weaponry are just symptoms. The disease is the entire range of aggressive police tactics (from no-knock raids to stop-and-frisk), the racial disparities they help perpetuate and our society’s drug laws and extraordinary incarceration rate.

Well before Ferguson, this broad critique, long pressed by a mix of libertarians like Balko and left-wingers, was gaining traction in the political mainstream. This is why sentencing reform has a growing number of Republican champions.

For decades, we’ve been equipping our cops as if the SLA were about to come out of retirement, as if every burst of opportunistic lawlessness could become another Watts, as if the al-Qaeda sleeper cells we feared after 9/11 were as pervasive in life as they are on 24 or Homeland.

And this is where it’s ended: with a bunch of tomfool police playing soldier, tear-gassing random civilians, arresting journalists and turning Ferguson into a watchword for policing at its worst.

Blow,08/18/2014,02/24/2016,"The community of Ferguson, Mo., is struggling to find its way back to normalcy, but it would behoove us to dig a bit deeper into the underlying frustrations that cause a place like this to erupt and to explore the untenable nature of our normal.

Yes, there are the disturbingly repetitive and eerily similar circumstances of many cases of unarmed black people being killed by police officers. This reinforces black people’s beliefs, supportable by actual data, that blacks are treated less fairly by the police.

I submit that this is bigger than that. The frustration we see in Ferguson is about not only the present act of perceived injustice but also the calcifying system of inequity — economic, educational, judicial — drawn largely along racial lines.

In 1951, Langston Hughes began his poem “Harlem” with a question: “What happens to a dream deferred?” Today, I must ask: What happens when one desists from dreaming, when the very exercise feels futile?

The discussion about issues in the black community too often revolves around a false choice: systemic racial bias or poor personal choices. In fact, these factors are interwoven like the fingers of clasped hands. People make choices within the context of their circumstances, and those circumstances are affected — sometimes severely — by bias.

These biases do material damage as well as help breed a sense of disenfranchisement and despair, which in turn can have a depressive effect on aspiration and motivation. This all feeds back on itself.

If we want to truly address the root of the unrest in Ferguson, we have to ask ourselves how we can break this cycle.

Otherwise, Hughes’ last words of “Harlem,” referring to the dream deferred, will continue to be prophetic: “Does it explode?”",0,NA,NA,NA

The unrest over a {fatal shooting by Ferguson, Mo., police,}<hyperlink=""http://www.dallasnews.com/news/headlines/20140817-missouri-governor-sends-national-guard-to-ferguson.ece""> combined with two shootings by Dallas police last week and old scars from past shootings here, have stirred up some raw feelings and protests among some activist groups.

Dallas police officials aren’t staying out of the national news story that is unfolding hundreds of miles away.

Chief David Brown {wrote an op-ed in The Dallas Morning News last week}<hyperlink=""http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20140814-openness-restraint-were-key-after-dallas-police-shooting-chief-brown-says.ece""> about his dismay at the scenes in Ferguson and his experience after an officer fatally shot an unarmed man in 2012 in Dixon Circle, nearly sparking a riot. Brown took the unusual step that night of hosting a news conference explaining everything police knew at that point — a move that won him plaudits from police associations (although they didn’t much care for his policy changes in the aftermath). The officer was eventually cleared by a grand jury.

Lt. Danny Williams and Sgt. Robert Proctor {talked about Dixon Circle}<hyperlink=""http://www.fox4news.com/clip/10479986/dpd-officers-weigh-in-on-ferguson-protests001""> and how to handle protests on Fox 4.

He specifically mentioned how Ferguson police didn’t release the name of the officer involved for days, which Dallas police usually do pretty quickly after a shooting. Here was what he had to say:

""That may be the policy there. But you have to look at the situation. You have a community that is upset, that feels wronged. It’s important to establish trust with them. A big part of that is helping them to believe that you’re being straight and transparent with them. You have to be sure to protect the officer’s safety, but to win trust you have to be aware of the people’s fears, and you need to show you’re willing to make concessions to accommodate those fears.""

There could be more talk about Ferguson to come.

Protesters and police standing nose to nose. These photos of fear, violence and chaos in Ferguson, Mo., look to be pulled from 1960s archives.

If only they were.

We Americans have spent a lot of time this year patting ourselves on the back as we’ve marked the 50th anniversary of civil rights legislation. But the photos out of Ferguson remind us that we are a long way from being a nation of justice for all.

Last Saturday afternoon, Michael Brown was walking with a friend in this St. Louis suburb. Roughly speaking, we’ve got two versions of what happened next. One comes from witnesses who say Brown wound up standing with his arms in the air. The other comes from police, who — although they won’t provide details — point to a larger altercation.

Both stories converge here: The unarmed black teen was shot and killed by a white police officer.

It’s a nightmarish rerun, as Brown’s death is the latest of four incidents involving unarmed black men killed by police in the past month.

Amp-ed up militarization by police and other leaders’ being largely AWOL only exacerbated this tragic event.

Did police truly need to leave Brown’s body in the street for so many hours Saturday afternoon, as they conducted their investigation? Couldn’t Police Chief Thomas Jackson explain some of what happened during the moments before the shooting? And why, despite expressing a desire to reduce tensions, did authorities meet protests throughout the week with an increasingly aggressive show of force?

Finally, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon stepped up Thursday to promise a “different tone” in Ferguson and call on the state highway patrol to take over security. Unfortunately, that came days too late for residents of this city, where two-thirds of the population is black and 50 of its 53 police officers are white.

Paul Quinn College President Michael Sorrell tweeted early Thursday, “It’s wrong for anyone to pretend that the root issue in cases like this one is not very, very real.”

He’s right. While none of us condone looting or vandalism, we should all want anguished, peaceful protesters to be heard. Especially those who, because of deeply rooted cultural and historical dynamics, don’t trust that authorities have their best interests at heart.

Actions like we’ve seen in Ferguson this week only cement that point of view and slow the march to justice.",0,NA,NA,NA
DallasMorningNews,dallas5,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/washington/20140818-obama-sending-ag-holder-to-missouri-to-meet-with-officials.ece,"Obama: Time to 'listen, not just shout' in Ferguson",The Associated Press,08/18/2014,02/26/2016,"WASHINGTON —  Calling for understanding in the face of racially charged anger, President Barack Obama said Monday that the vast majority of protesters in a St. Louis suburb were peaceful, but warned that a small minority was undermining justice for the unarmed black man shot and killed by police.

During a brief pause in his summer vacation, Obama expressed sympathy for the ""passions and anger"" sparked by the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., but said giving in to that anger through looting and attacks on police only stirs tensions and leads to further chaos. He said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to ""listen and not just shout.""

""That's how we're going to move forward together, by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another,"" Obama told reporters at the White House.

Obama said Attorney General Eric Holder would travel to Ferguson this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death. He said he also had told Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon he wanted to ensure the use the National Guard in help calm tensions in Ferguson must be limited in scope, and said he would be monitoring that operation in the coming days to see whether the guard's involvement was helping or hurting.

Obama also weighed in for the first time publicly on the militarization of some local police departments, saying it probably would be useful to examine how federal grant dollars had been used to allow local police to purchase military-style equipment, an issue that's come to the forefront amid the violent protests in Ferguson. Obama said the distinction between the military and domestic law enforcement was one of the great things about America.

Appearing in the White House briefing room in a dress shirt but no tie, Obama also spoke for the first time to the racial tensions and grievances perceived by African-Americans in Ferguson. In previous comments about the situation, Obama had avoided talking directly about race, wary of rushing to judgment or further inflaming the situation.

Weighing his words carefully, Obama said it was clear that disparities in how blacks and whites are treated and sentenced must be addressed, calling for more safeguards and training to prevent missteps. At the same time, he acknowledged the difficult situation that police officers sometimes face.

""There are young black men that commit crime. We can argue about why that happened — because the poverty they were born into or the school systems that failed them or what have you— but if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted,"" Obama said. ""Because every community has an interest in public safety.""

Obama's remarks on the crisis were the first since the situation in Ferguson escalated over the weekend, with Nixon, the Missouri governor, ordering a midnight curfew for Ferguson and ordering the National Guard to help restore order. Nixon lifted that curfew on Monday, but tensions remained high the morning after police once again deployed tear gas in response to what they said were reports of gunfire, looting and vandalism by protesters.

The ongoing confrontation, with military-style vehicles rolling through suburban streets, has left citizens across the country wondering how such a war-like scene could play out in America's heartland.

Shortly before speaking to reporters Monday, Obama received an update from top advisers including Holder and White House Counsel Neil Eggleston. Obama has asked the Justice Department and FBI to investigate Brown's death, and Holder over the weekend ordered a federal medical examiner to perform a third autopsy on Brown.

Obama weighed in on the crisis during a brief break in his annual summer vacation at Martha's Vineyard, where the president was spending two weeks with his family while juggling multiple crises in the U.S. and overseas. Obama returned to the White House late Monday and planned to return to the Massachusetts island on Tuesday. His brief return to Washington had been announced by the White House before the standoff in Ferguson began.

Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a police officer on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, a predominantly black community that long has been at odds with the mostly white police department. Results of an independent autopsy released Monday by Brown's family determined that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.",0,NA,NA,NA

Soon after the shooting, rioters burned stores and looted –  senseless destruction of property that had to be brought to an end with a show of force. But instead of taking steps to dial down  tensions, police silence about the incident dialed up the tensions. It all erupted on national television last night. Police fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse a crowd; protestors tossed Molotov cocktails.

{There’s a lot about the original incident that we don’t know}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html""> – and that seems to be the design of a police department that has treated this entire incident and the violent surge of community anger more like a military action than domestic policing.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson says the officer who shot teenager Michael Brown was struck in the face as Brown tried to take the officer’s gun — an account disputed by a witness, a friend of Brown’s who said his hands were raised when the last of several shots was fired. The name of the officer isn’t known because the police department say they fear for the officer’s life. That delay has further angered protestors, leading Internet hackers to spread rumors about the officer’s identity.

What is missing is leadership, especially from local authorities whose actions have breed suspicions of a coverup. Police created a void that others now are filling with rumors and accusation. The situation has escalated to the point  that police also seem unable — or unwilling — to distinguish between rioters, legal protestors and others. {Two reporters doing their jobs}<hyperlink=""http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140814-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest-in-ferguson-mo..ece""> were taken into {custody at a McDonald’s, apparently for not packing up their gear}<hyperlink=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-two-reporters-detained-20140813-htmlstory.html""> quickly enough, then released without charges. Police also detained St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who had posted protest video to social media. And local authorities have received help from Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D), who has been almost invisible during the chaos. So too, until today, has been President Obama, who this morning briefly spoke on the Ferguson unrest.

This incident is yet another example of  a serious racial disconnect between police and minority communities, one heightened by a growing militarization of police forces since 2001 when departments everywhere began acquiring gear previously seen only on the battlefield. Coupled with the heavy weaponry is a changing police attitude from “Serve and Protect” to “Don’t Mess with Us.” To their credit, the FBI and civil rights attorneys from the Justice Department are conducting parallel investigations.

A police officer accused of shooting an unarmed civilian is always a potentially ugly mix because rumors can fly halfway around the world while the truth is still in bed. I am outraged at what I’m seeing from both sides, especially the police. It’s time to ratchet it down and let the legal process work through the facts.",0,NA,NA,NA
DallasMorningNews,dallas7,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140812-st.-louis-suburbs-long-simmering-racial-tensions-boil-over-after-police-shooting.ece,St. Louis suburb’s long-simmering racial tensions boil over after police shooting,Jim Salter,08/12/2014,02/26/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Racial tensions have run high for decades in this former railroad town that was once a mostly white St. Louis suburb until school busing and urban decay sent many families packing for more distant communities.

Today, Ferguson is nearly 70 percent black, but the law here is still enforced by a police department that is more than 90 percent white. That fact has helped engender widespread distrust of officers — never more so than last weekend, when a white officer shot and killed an unarmed young black man who was about to start college.

The suburb of 21,000 has been on edge since Michael Brown, 18, and another teenager were confronted by the officer Saturday near Brown’s apartment. Police say one of the teens shoved the officer back into his car and a struggle ensued. Brown was struck by several bullets after emerging from the car.

Eyewitnesses have said Brown was raising his hands in surrender and that the officer kept firing.

The FBI and St. Louis County police are conducting separate investigations.

The shooting sparked two nights of unrest. Looting broke out late Sunday at dozens of stores in Ferguson and neighboring communities. On Monday night, police used tear gas and fired “bean bag” rounds after a crowd turned rowdy, throwing rocks and bottles at officers. No serious injuries were reported.

Pleas for a name, calm

On Tuesday, the Rev. Al Sharpton pressed police to release the name of the officer.

Police said death threats prompted them to withhold the name of the officer, who was placed on administrative leave.

“The local authorities have put themselves in a position — hiding names and not being transparent — where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,” Sharpton said during a news conference in St. Louis where he was joined by Brown’s parents.

Sharpton also echoed pleas for peaceful protests by the NAACP and Brown’s father, Michael Brown Sr., who told the crowd: “I need all of us to come together and do this right. … No violence.”

President Barack Obama also urged calm, saying people must comfort each other “in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.”

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told a standing-room-only crowd at a community forum Tuesday night that the shooting feels “like an old wound torn fresh” in a nation still struggling with race relations.

The forum, held at a church, was organized as an alternative response to two nights of unrest in which more crowds have burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers. Ferguson’s mayor and police chief also attended the meeting and were welcomed with applause.

Earlier in the day, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said he had decided against releasing the officer’s name Tuesday after death threats were called in to police and City Hall and posted on social media. He said it could be weeks before he releases the name.

“If we come out and say, ‘It was this officer,’ then he immediately becomes a target,” Jackson said. “We’re taking the threats seriously.”

The officer had been with the force for about six years and was on a routine patrol when he encountered the two young men, Jackson said.

‘An uphill battle’

Ferguson was once a middle-class suburb known for its sprawling parks and tidy brick homes. For many years, it was largely white.

Over the last few decades, the demographics changed. As St. Louis city schools deteriorated, a voluntary busing program started in the 1980s that allowed parents to send their children to suburban districts. Some black families decided to leave the city, and the crime, behind and moved to nearby suburbs such as Ferguson.

As more black residents moved in, whites in Ferguson began to move to outer suburbs.

Jackson said 50 of the city’s 53 police officers are white. He said he made recruiting and promoting black officers a priority when he took over four years ago after a three-decade police career in St. Louis and St. Louis County.

Jackson said he promoted two black officers to sergeant in his first year in Ferguson, though one of those officers has since left for a better-paying job.

“I’m constantly trying to recruit African-Americans and other minorities,” he said. “But it’s an uphill battle. The minority makeup of this police department is not where I want it to be.”

The elected leadership of Ferguson — the mayor and five of the six City Council members — are also white.

Mayor James Knowles III said he’s having a hard time with the image of Ferguson as a racially divided, riot-torn place.

“We’re all broken-hearted, regardless of our race,” Knowles said. “This is not representative of our community.”

‘Not the first time’

Some of the town’s young blacks feel unfairly targeted by police.

Jarrett Snider, 19, said he was stopped while walking in his neighborhood. He showed his identification, but the officer still called for several backup units.

“You get harassed,” said Snider, who lives in the apartment complex near where Brown was shot and described himself as a good friend of Brown. “It’s too much. … Mike’s situation is not the first time.”

Stephen Bussey, 29, said he was recently stopped by an officer while walking to a convenience store before his pre-dawn shift at a fast-food restaurant.

“The cop told me I looked like a guy who robbed a bank nearby,” Bussey said. “I didn’t make a big deal about it. But since when is walking a crime?”

The mayor acknowledged the resentment.

“The African-American community — youth in the African-American community in particular — has something against law enforcement in many ways,” Knowles said. “They don’t like law enforcement, and they don’t think law enforcement likes them.”

Knowles said that suspicion is part of the reason the city has so few black officers.

“We don’t get nearly as many African-American applicants as we would like,” he said.

Most hold their fire

University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist David Klinger said there are no reliable statistics on police shootings in the St. Louis region, but he said police in the U.S. kill at least a few hundred suspects every year.

Klinger, who has led two federally funded studies on police shootings and interviewed about 300 officers involved in those incidents, said police often show tremendous restraint, refraining from shooting suspects who come at them with knives or guns. Sometimes, he said, they simply have no choice but to fire.

In other instances, mistakes are made.

“Officers really aren’t out there to shoot people,” Klinger said. “That doesn’t mean there aren’t knucklehead cops out there. But the vast majority of officers have held their fire far more often than they’ve pulled the trigger.”",0,NA,NA,NA
DallasMorningNews,dallas8,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140818-national-guard-enters-restive-ferguson-latest-in-whipsawing-tactics.ece,"National Guard enters restive Ferguson, latest in whipsawing tactics",The Associated Press; The New York Times,08/18/2014,02/26/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Missouri National Guard troops entered this battered city Monday even as an overnight curfew was lifted, the latest in a series of quickly shifting attempts to quell the violence that has upended this St. Louis suburb for 10 days.

In the days since a black teenager was shot to death by a white police officer on Aug. 9, an array of state and local law enforcement authorities have swerved from one approach to another: taking to the streets in military-style vehicles and riot gear, then turning over power to a state Highway Patrol official who permitted the protests and marched along, then calling again for a curfew.

Early Monday morning, after a new spate of violence, Gov. Jay Nixon said he was bringing in the National Guard. Hours later he said that he was lifting the curfew and that the Guard would have only a limited role, protecting the police command post.

In Washington, President Barack Obama said that Attorney General Eric Holder would go to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with FBI agents conducting a federal civil rights investigation into the shooting. He did not seem enthusiastic about the decision to call in the National Guard.

Obama said he had told the governor in a phone call on Monday that the Guard should be “used in a limited and appropriate way.”

He said he would be closely monitoring the deployment.

“I’ll be watching over the next several days to assess whether in fact it’s helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson,” said Obama, who emphasized that the state of Missouri, not the White House, had called in the Guard.

He once again tried to strike a balance between the right of protest and approaches to security.

“While I understand the passions and anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions,” he said.

Before dark, along West Florissant Avenue, one of the city’s main thoroughfares and a center of the weeklong protests, scores of people marched peacefully, carrying signs and chanting. Officers herded some into a parking lot, where the police said protest was permitted.

A few blocks away, at the police command post, National Guard members, dressed in Army fatigues, some with military police patches on their uniforms, began rolling up in white buses and military vehicles around 6 p.m.

Residents seemed puzzled and frustrated by the continuously changing approaches, suggesting that the moving set of rules only served to worsen long-standing tensions about policing and race.

“It almost seems like they can’t decide what to do, and like law enforcement is fighting over who’s got the power,” said Antione Watson, 37, who stood near a middle-of-the-street memorial of candles and flowers for 18-year-old Michael Brown.

“First they do this, then there’s that, and now who can even tell what their plan is?” Watson said.

The latest turn in law enforcement tactics — the removal of a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew imposed Saturday and the arrival of members of the Guard — followed one of the tensest nights so far. Police officers reported gunfire and firebombs and responded with tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets.

By Monday, police seemed intent on taking control of the situation long before evening and the expected arrival of protesters, some of them inclined to provoke clashes. Authorities banned stationary protests, even during the day, ordering demonstrators to continue walking, particularly in an area along West Florissant, not far from where the shooting occurred.

In federal court, a judge denied a request from the American Civil Liberties Union for a restraining order that would have prevented authorities from enforcing the rule.

Several people were arrested during the day, including a photographer for Getty Images, Scott Olson, who was led away in plastic handcuffs in the early evening.

After nightfall, police and protesters were again in a tense standoff as crowds filled the streets. Officers used bullhorns to order people out of the street and deployed noisemakers and armored vehicles to push demonstrators back. There were no immediate reports of violence.

Brown is now the subject of three autopsies. The first was conducted by St. Louis County, the results of which were delivered to the county prosecutor’s office Monday but not made public. Another, on Monday, was done by a military doctor as part of the Justice Department’s investigation.

On Sunday, at the request of Brown’s family, the body was examined by Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner.

The findings showed that he was shot six times in the front and that he did not appear to have been shot from very close range because no powder burns were found on his body. But that determination could change if burns were found on his clothing, which was not available for examination.

In a news conference Monday, family members and Baden said that the autopsy he performed confirmed witness accounts that Brown was trying to surrender when he was killed.

Forensic pathologist Shawn Parcells, who assisted Baden, said a bullet grazed Brown’s right arm. He said the wound indicates Brown may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position across his chest or face.

Daryl Parks, a lawyer for the family, said the autopsy proved that the officer should have been arrested. The bullet that killed Brown entered the top of his head and came out through the front at an angle that suggested he was facing downward when he was killed, Parks said.

What the autopsy did not show was what Brown was doing at that moment.

“Why would he be shot in the very top of his head, a 6-foot-4 man?” he said. “It makes no sense. And so that’s what we have. That’s why we believe that those two things alone are ample for this officer to be arrested.”

Piaget Crenshaw, who told reporters she witnessed Brown’s death from her apartment, seemed unsurprised by the eruptions of anger.

“This community had underlying problems way before this happened,” Crenshaw said. “And now the tension is finally broken.”",0,NA,NA,NA

Brown's relatives said no robbery would justify shooting the teen after he put his hands up. Family attorneys said Brown's parents were blindsided by the allegations and the release of a surveillance video from the convenience store.

""It appears to be him,"" attorney Daryl Parks said, referring to the footage, which he said was released without any advance notice from police.

The police chief described Wilson as ""a gentle, quiet man"" who had been ""an excellent officer."" He has been on the Ferguson force for four years and served prior to that in the neighboring community of Jennings.

Wilson, who was placed on administrative leave after the Aug. 9 shooting, ""never intended for any of this to happen,"" Jackson said.

According to police reports released Friday, authorities received a 911 call at 11:51 a.m. on the day of the shooting reporting a robbery at the Ferguson Market. An unidentified officer was dispatched to the store, arriving within three minutes. The officer interviewed an employee and customer, who gave a description of a man who stole the cigars and walked off with another man toward a QuikTrip store.

Descriptions were broadcast over the police radio. The officer did not find the suspects either on the street or at the QuikTrip, the reports said.

The robber took a box of Swisher Sweets, a brand of small, inexpensive cigars. The suspects were identified as 18-year-old Michael Brown and 22-year-old Dorian Johnson, according to the reports.

Separately, Wilson had been responding to a nearby call involving a sick 2-month child from 11:48 am until noon, when he left that place. A minute later, he encountered Michael Brown walking down Canfield Drive. The documents contained no description of what happened between Brown and Wilson.

Johnson has told reporters that the officer ordered him and Brown onto the sidewalk, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He said Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, noted that police did not release a photo of the officer but released images from the store's security video that they say show Brown grabbing a man inside the store. Crump said he had not seen the photos.

Police ""are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style"" killing, said Crump, who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.

The Aug. 9 video appears to show a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store's door. A police report alleges that Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and ""forcefully pushed him back"" into a display rack.

Johnson, Brown's friend, told investigators that Brown took cigarillos, his attorney, Freeman Bosley, told MSNBC. Bosley said he was aware of video but had not seen it.

Police have determined that Johnson was not involved in the robbery and will not seek charges against him, Jackson said.

Brown's uncle, Bernard Ewing, questioned whether Wilson really believed Brown was a suspect. He referred to Johnson's account that the officer's only command to the two young men was to get out of the street.

""If he's a robbery suspect, they would have had the lights on,"" Ewing said. ""If you rob somebody, you would tell them, `Get on the ground' or something, not, `Get off the sidewalk.'""

A robbery ""still doesn't justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,"" he added. ""You still don't shoot him in the face.""

Brown's death ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. The tension eased Thursday after the governor turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Within hours, the mood on the street lightened, with state troopers walking side-by-side with peaceful protesters and no hint of violence. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, pointing assault rifles at protesters and firing tear gas into crowds.

Friday's announcement by the police chief was met with disbelief and anger by several dozen Ferguson residents who also attended the news conference, which was hastily held at the QuikTrip, which was burned during a night of looting earlier in the week.

""He stopped the wrong one, bottom line,"" yelled Tatinisha Wheeler, a nurse's aide at the news conference.

A couple of dozen protesters began marching, chanting ""Hands up, don't shoot"" and ""What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!""

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spille",0,NA,NA,NA

“Uh, Chief, we had a shooting. The officer is OK, but it’s in Dixon Circle, and the suspect was unarmed. And he is black. And the officer is white. A crowd is gathering. We may have a riot on our hands. You might want to turn on your TV. The whole thing is live on the news. We are forming response teams of officers to help with crowd control. We don’t know any other details right now.”

That phone call came July 24, 2012. I was on vacation, relaxing at home, trying to unplug and refresh.

As I began putting on my uniform, for some strange reason, I flashed back — clear as day — to my initial interview to become a police officer.

“Why do you want to be a police officer?”

“I want to help people, sir. I want to serve my community. I want to make a difference.”

I said those words to a police department recruiter 31 years before I received that Dixon Circle call. On that summer day in 2012, I was going to get a powerful lesson on what serving my community meant.

There is no instruction book for what you do after you get a call like that one, nor is there someone to tell you what to do. People are waiting for you, the police chief, to give the instructions.

Now in the headlines is the story of a white police officer killing an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Mo. I don’t have all the facts about what happened in Ferguson, so I certainly can’t offer any advice or make official pronouncements. But the TV images I see out of this St. Louis suburb and the reports of arrests and violence are horrific.

Tragically, what is happening in Ferguson won’t be the last story of its kind. What I think is worth noting from the Dixon Circle incident is what we tried to do as quickly as possible:

We immediately informed the public in a news conference about all the facts as we knew them. We assured the public that a complete and thorough investigation would be done.

We released the name of the person we shot and the name of the officer.

We described the investigative process and the fact that a Dallas County grand jury would ultimately decide whether the shooting was justified.

We answered every question we could — both from the residents and from the media.

Perhaps most important, we drew down the number of officers that were in the neighborhood.

One poignant moment during this crisis involved a sergeant who was on the scene. He broke the police line to go into the gathering crowd and console someone he knew among the residents. That sergeant, like me, was born and raised in Dallas and plugged in to the community — in many ways part of the community.

That sergeant’s background, and his actions that day, made a big difference.

Our efforts in the areas of community policing and engagement and in social media build on the same foundation that was in place that day in Dixon Circle. We try our best to be transparent — and I can tell you that not all cops like it. It does open us up to criticism, threats and exposure of every mistake we make. But it’s the right thing to do.

In the Dixon Circle shooting, I supported the officer’s actions, given the facts and evidence. A grand jury later cleared the officer.

That day I was heralded by police union bosses. A year later, I terminated two of our officers in separate shootings; a grand jury indicted both of them. Of course, I wasn’t as popular internally that time.

We have had subsequent shootings involving police, and we have continued to share as much information with the public as we can without jeopardizing the investigative process.

We are by no means perfect; there is plenty of room for criticism. We continue to be open to changing policies, training and community engagement. My biggest hope is that I am holding true to what I told that police recruiter: “I want to serve the community, sir.”

My prayers go out to the folks in Ferguson.",0,NA,NA,NA

What’s more, Ferguson police have used armored vehicles to show force and control crowds. In one {photo,}<hyperlink=""http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8#ixzz3AD9HMciA""> riot gear-clad officers are standing in front of a mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle, barking commands and launching tear gas into groups of demonstrators and journalists.

This would be one thing if Ferguson were in a war zone, or if protesters were violent—although, it’s hard to imagine a situation in which American police would need a mine-resistant vehicle. But an episode of looting aside, Ferguson police aren’t dealing with any particular danger. Nonetheless, they’re treating demonstrators—and Ferguson residents writ large—as a population to occupy, not citizens to protect.

This is part of a broader problem.

In his book {The Rise of the Warrior Cop,}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1610394577/?tag=slatmaga-20""> journalist Radley Balko notes that since the 1960s, “law-enforcement agencies across the U.S., at every level of government, have been blurring the line between police officer and soldier. Driven by martial rhetoric and the availability of military-style equipment — from bayonets and M–16 rifles to armored personnel carriers — American police forces have often adopted a mind-set previously reserved for the battlefield.”

This process ramped up with the “war on drugs” in the 1980s and 1990s, as the federal government supplied local and state police forces with military-grade weaponry to clamp down on drug trafficking and other crime. And it accelerated again after the 9/11 attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, when the federal government had — and sent — billions in surplus military equipment to state and local governments.

Since 2006, according to an {analysis}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=1""> by the New York Times, police departments have acquired 435 armored vehicles, 533 planes, 93,763 machine guns, and 432 mine-resistant armored trucks. Overall, since Congress established its program to transfer military hardware, {local and state police departments}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf""> have received $4.3 billion worth of equipment. Accordingly, the value of military equipment used by these police agencies has increased from $1 million in 1990 to $324 million in 1995 (shortly after the program was established), to nearly $450 million in 2013.

At the same time as crime has fallen to its lowest levels in decades, police departments are acquiring more hardware and finding more reasons to use SWAT teams and other heavy-handed tactics, regardless of the situation. According to an American Civil Liberties Union {report}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf""> released this summer, 79 percent of SWAT deployments from 2011 to 2012 were for search warrants, a massive overreaction that can have disastrous consequences, including injury and death. That was the case for Aiyana Stanley-Jones, who was killed during a SWAT raid by the Detroit Police Department. Serving a search warrant for an occupant of the house, Detroit police rushed in with flash bangs and ballistic shields. When one resident tried to grab an officer’s gun, it fired, striking Aiyana. She was 7.

If you know anything about the racial disparities in the criminal justice system, then it also shouldn’t shock you to learn that SWAT deployments are used disproportionately in black and Latino neighborhoods. The ACLU finds that 50 percent of those impacted by SWAT deployments were black and Latino. Of these deployments, 68 percent were for drug searches. And a substantial number of drug searches — 60 percent — involved violent tactics to force entry, which lead predictably and avoidably to senseless injury and death.

The fact that police are eager to use their new weapons and vehicles isn’t a surprise. As the New York Times notes, “The ubiquity of SWAT teams has changed not only the way officers look, but also the way departments view themselves. Recruiting videos feature clips of officers storming into homes with smoke grenades and firing automatic weapons.” Put simply, when you give anyone toys, you have to expect they’ll play with them.

That is how we get images like the ones in Ferguson, where police officers brandish heavy weapons and act as an occupying force. We should expect as much when we give police departments military weapons. Already — when it comes to predominantly black and brown communities — there’s a long-standing culture of aggressive, punitive policing. Add assault weapons and armored vehicles, and you have a recipe for the repressive, violent reactions that we see in Ferguson, and that are likely inevitable in countless other poor American neighborhoods.",0,NA,NA,NA

Lieb,08/12/2014,02/29/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The Rev. Al Sharpton pressed police Tuesday to release the name of the officer who fatally shot an unarmed teenager in suburban St. Louis, and he pleaded for calm after two nights of violent protests over the young man’s death. 

Police said death threats prompted them to withhold the name of the officer, who was placed on administrative leave after fatally shooting 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, where the incident has stoked racial tension, rallies and a night of looting.

Investigators have released few details, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Brown and another teen to get out of the street. At some point, the officer’s weapon fired inside a patrol car, police said.

“The local authorities have put themselves in a position — hiding names and not being transparent — where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,” Sharpton during a news conference in St. Louis where he was joined by Brown’s parents.

He also echoed pleas for peaceful protests by the NAACP and Brown’s father, Michael Brown Sr., who told the crowd: “I need all of us to come together and do this right. … No violence.”

President Barack Obama also urged calm, saying people must comfort each other “in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.”

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said he had planned to release the officer’s name Tuesday but changed course after death threats were called into the police department and City Hall and posted on social media. Jackson said it could be weeks before he releases the name.

“If we come out and say, ‘It was this officer,’ then he immediately becomes a target,” Jackson said. “We’re taking the threats seriously.”

The officer had been with the force for about six years and was on a routine patrol when he encountered the two young men, Jackson said.

Police have not publicly disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. Brown was black.

The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of which are black. Jackson said the city has had trouble recruiting and retaining black officers.

More than three dozen people have been arrested in two nights of unrest in which crowds have burned stores, vandalized vehicles assaulted reporters and taunted officers.

“People are tired. They have reached the end of their rope,” Ruth Latchison Nichols said after a town meeting Monday night hosted by the NAACP. “Enough is enough. This is a state of emergency.”

The fullest account of Brown’s death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home from a convenience store with Brown when the two were approached by an officer in a squad car who, using expletives, ordered them to move to the sidewalk.

In the hours after the shooting, Johnson told news crews that he and Brown had kept walking and explained to the officer they were near their destination. The officer then reversed his car “to where it almost hit us.”

The officer, Johnson said, tried to open his door, but he was so close to the men that it “ricocheted” back, apparently upsetting the officer.

Johnson said the officer then reached through the window, “grabbed my friend around the neck” and tried to pull him into the car. The officer then reportedly pulled out his weapon and said, “‘I’ll shoot you,’ or ‘I’m going to shoot,“’ Johnson said.

When the officer opened fire, Brown was hit and started to bleed, Johnson said. Johnson ran to hide behind a car.

Brown “kept running, and he told me to keep running because he feared for me, too,” Johnson said.

Johnson said the officer pursued Brown with his weapon drawn and fired again.

When Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. But the officer kept firing, Johnson said.

“And my friend died. He didn’t say anything to him. He just stood over and he’s shooting.”

Authorities have not commented directly on Johnson’s account.

Another witness, Phillip Walker, told The Associated Press he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he saw a white officer with Brown, who was “giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued.”

Walker said the officer then “stood over him and shot him.”

Police have said there is no security or police video of the confrontation.

The family’s attorney, Benjamin Crump, has asked anyone with video of the shooting to come forward. Crump also represented relatives of Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder charges.

“I don’t want to sugarcoat it,” he said Monday. “(Brown) was executed in broad daylight.”

St. Louis County police are leading the investigation, and the Federal Aviation Administration agreed to order flight restrictions over Ferguson to give police helicopters unfettered access to that airspace.

DallasMorningNews,dallas13,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140811-fbi-steps-in-amid-unrest-after-police-kill-st.-louis-area-teen.ece,FBI steps in amid unrest after police kill St. Louis-area teen,Julie Bosman; Erica Goode,08/11/2014,02/29/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The FBI on Monday opened a civil rights inquiry into the fatal shooting by a police officer of an unarmed black teenager here as protests bubbled into a third night in this St. Louis suburb.

Officers donned riot gear and warily faced off against hundreds of people in response to looting and violence Sunday night that resulted in 32 arrests.

On Monday night, police officers using tear gas and rubber bullets tried to disperse the crowd of mostly African-Americans, who had been gathering through the day under the hot sun. Protesters covered their mouths with scarves and T-shirts to avoid the tear gas.

The standoff lasted for more than an hour, with about a dozen men approaching officers with their hands up saying, “Don’t shoot me.” At least 100 police officers were on the scene, shining bright lights into the crowd and telling people to return to their homes.

The protesters questioned the role that race — and simmering tensions between residents and the Police Department — may have played in the killing of Michael Brown, 18, who was to start college this week.

Officials have so far declined to identify the police officer who shot Brown or disclose his race. The officer was put on administrative leave.

“You have to begin with the frustration,” said one of the protesters, Wayne Bledsoe of St. Louis. “Treatment of these communities is not equal. In white communities, the police truly protect and serve. In black communities, that is not the case.”

Ferguson, a city of 21,000 northwest of St. Louis, has shifted substantially over the last decade, with blacks, once a minority, now making up two-thirds of the residents, after many white families moved out to surrounding suburbs. The town’s leadership and the police have remained predominantly white.

In 2013, the suspension of a black superintendent of schools by an all-white school board stirred protests. And the Justice Department has a continuing investigation into racial disparities in legal representation for juveniles in family court.

“The community is still highly segregated,” said Karen Knodt, interim pastor of the Immanuel United Church of Christ, whose congregation has 800 members, only four of which are black. “The institutions of power don’t yet reflect the changing demographics of the county.”

At a news conference Monday, Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief, who said his department was asked by the Ferguson police to take over the investigation of the shooting, pleaded for the public’s patience.

“I understand that the public has a right to be skeptical, and I appreciate that and I would expect that the public be skeptical oftentimes of government or some forms of it,” he said. “But I would also ask the public to be reasonable, because it takes a long time to make sure we do this investigation the right way.”

On social media, reaction to Brown’s killing was fierce, with many accusing the police of again shooting an unarmed black youth. It included a Twitter campaign called “IfTheyGunnedMeDown” prompted by a photograph of Brown that was used in some news stories about his killing. In the photo, Brown is shown with fingers of his right hand extended in what some considered a peace sign, while others called it a gang sign.

Brown’s parents said at a news conference that he was nonviolent and good-natured and would have objected to the looting. Their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, compared the case to another one in which he represented a family, that of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old black unarmed youth shot to death in Florida two years ago by a neighborhood watch coordinator.

“We need justice for our son,” said Brown’s father, Michael Brown, as his lawyer asked witnesses to step forward with testimony or videotape.

“If any of you have information, please give it to us,” Brown said. “We don’t want no violence.”

“Because Michael wouldn’t want no violence,” said Lesley McSpadden, his mother, weeping.

The circumstances of Brown’s death on Saturday afternoon as he and a friend walked from a convenience store were disputed. The police said he had hit the officer who shot him; his family and friends denied that.

In a local television interview, the friend who was walking with him, Dorian Johnson, said the officer opened fire when the young men refused to move from the middle of the street to the sidewalk. He said Brown’s hands were over his head. The autopsy showed Brown was shot a number of times.

The Ferguson police said they do not have videotapes running in their patrol cars. Residents of Ferguson said they were shaken by the unrest that swept the town Sunday night, bringing 500 officers to the streets.

One school district nearby canceled classes Monday, citing safety concerns. Many businesses refused to open or boarded up their windows as a protective measure.

“It was a miracle that no one was shot,” Belmar said of the looting.

Outside the police department, groups of residents criticized the police but also condemned the looting from the night before.

“We don’t want any more violence around here,” said Carolyn Teague, a nurse, as she wiped away tears. The tension, she said, had one source: “Prejudice in this town still lives on.”

Patrice McHaskell, a teacher at a nursery school, said that in a town where the police force is mostly white and residents are mostly black, police officers have acquired a reputation for frequently stopping young black men, often for trivial things.

The shooting, she said, has tapped into longstanding resentments: “They’re just outraged and they’re tired of the police messing with them. It brought out all the anger and tension that everybody’s been holding in.”

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. seemed to echo concerns from residents, saying in a statement Monday that the episode “deserves a fulsome review.”

He added, “Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”

The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department sometimes begins its own investigation into police departments that appear to show a pattern and practice of using excessive force, as it did this year in Albuquerque, New Mexico, after a series of shootings by the police involving people suffering from mental illness.

The shooting mobilized supporters, including Cornell Williams Brooks, the president of the NAACP, who flew into St. Louis on Monday. He said he was committed to seeking justice.

“Note that he was nonviolent,” he told reporters Monday. “If you want to honor his memory, honor his memory by seeking justice nonviolently.”

Charlie Dooley, the St. Louis County executive, cautioned that the local investigation would not come to a quick conclusion.

“This is a difficult and complex situation,” he said. “There are many sides to the story. There are many answers.”",0,NA,NA,NA
DallasMorningNews,dallas14,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140817-federal-autopsy-ordered-in-missouri-teen-s-death.ece,Federal autopsy ordered in Missouri teen's death,The Associated Press,08/17/2014,02/29/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo.  — U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on a black Missouri teenager whose fatal shooting by a white police officer has spurred a week of rancorous and sometimes violent protests in suburban St. Louis.

The “extraordinary circumstances” surrounding the case of 18-year-old Michael Brown, and a request by Brown’s family members, prompted the order, Department of Justice spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.

“This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,” Fallon said. “Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.”

The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation of the shooting. Officials said a day earlier that 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson, Missouri, neighborhood where an unarmed Brown was shot to death in the middle of the street on Aug. 9.

David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami’s U.S. Attorney’s office, said a federally conducted autopsy “more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises” might help that investigation, and that the move is “not that unusual.”

He also said federal authorities want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case.

President Barack Obama — who has been getting regular briefings on the situation in Ferguson while on vacation — also was to be briefed by Holder upon returning to the White House on Monday.

The Justice Department’s latest announcement followed the first night of a state-imposed curfew in Ferguson, which ended with tear gas and seven arrests after police dressed in riot gear used armored vehicles to disperse defiant protesters.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said protesters weren’t the reason for the escalated police reaction early Sunday morning after the midnight curfew took effect, but a report of people who had broken into a barbecue restaurant and taken to the roof, and a man who flashed a handgun in the street as armored vehicles approached the crowd of protesters.

Also overnight, a man was shot and critically wounded in the same area, but not by police; authorities were searching for the shooter. Someone also shot at a police car, officials said.

The protests have been going on since Brown’s death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Missouri’s governor to put the Highway Patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson Police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store before he was killed, though Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Gov. Jay Nixon, who imposed the curfew after declaring a state of emergency as protests turned violent to start the weekend, said Sunday morning on ABC’s “This Week” that he was not aware the police were going to release surveillance video from the store where Brown is alleged to have stolen a $49 box of cigars.

“It’s appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,” Nixon said.

Brown had been walking with a friend down when the officer who shot him told them to get out of the street. They kept walking. Police have said little about the encounter other than that a scuffle ensued, the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as Wilson fired multiple rounds.

“When you’re exhausted, when you’re out of resources, when you’re out of ammunition, you surrender,” Brown’s uncle, pastor Charles Ewing, told worshippers during a Sunday sermon at Jennings Mason Temple in Ferguson. “He surrendered, and yet he died.”

In announcing the standing curfew in Ferguson, Nixon said many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully but the state would not allow looters to endanger the community. Johnson, the Highway Patrol captain, had said police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas and would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave. Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.

As the curfew deadline arrived early Sunday, most protesters left the streets, but those who remained protesters refused to leave the area as officers spoke through a loudspeaker: “You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately.”

As officers put on gas masks, a chant from the distant crowd emerged: “We have the right to assemble peacefully.”

A moment later, police began firing canisters into the crowd. Highway Patrol Spokesman Lt. John Hotz initially said police only used smoke, but later told The Associated Press they also used tear gas canisters.

Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, has identified the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting and the department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.",0,NA,NA,NA

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who has been the public face of the city torn by Saturday’s death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, told reporters earlier in the day that the St. Louis County investigation of the shooting could take weeks to complete. In the meantime, he said, his department welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force’s 53 officers are white.

“Unfortunately, an undertow (of racial unrest) has bubbled to the surface,” said Jackson. “Race relations is the top priority right now.”

While Jackson said he wanted to mend fences with the community, protesters were on the streets of Ferguson again Wednesday, facing heavily armed police who at time trained weapons on them from an armored truck. Two reporters said they were detained by police while working at a McDonald’s in the area.

The situation became more tense after nightfall, with police ordering people to go home and then using smoke bombs and later tear gas after some people threw Molotov cocktails and other things at them. Most of the crowd then dispersed. Journalists who witnessed the events included an Associated Press photographer.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said he had no immediate information about the situation.

Earlier, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post said they were handcuffed and put into a police van after officers came in to quickly clear the fast-food restaurant where they were doing some work. The Washington Post reported that Lowery said he was slammed against a soda machine and plastic cuffs were put on his wrists. Reilly told MSNBC that an officer slammed his head against the glass “purposefully” on the way out of the restaurant “and then sarcastically apologized for it.” The reporters were subsequently released without any charges.

Martin D. Baron, The Washington Post’s executive editor, issued a statement saying “there was absolutely no justification” for Lowery’s arrest and said the organization was appalled by the officers’ conduct.

Ryan Grim, Washington, D.C., bureau chief for The Huffington Post, said in a statement that “compared to some others who have come into contact with the police department, they came out relatively unscathed, but that in no way excuses the false arrest or the militant aggression toward these journalists.”

Jackson did not immediately return a cellphone message Wednesday night from the AP seeking comment about the arrests.

Jackson has faced mounting demands from protesters, clergy and even hackers to reveal the identity of the officer who shot Brown. Jackson argues that revealing that detail could bring retribution to the officer.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer’s weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn’t specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.

Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it “ricocheted” back, apparently upsetting the officer. Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend’s neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.

Some protesters Wednesday raised their arms above their heads as they faced the police. Others held signs asking for answers about Brown’s death. The most popular chant has been, “Hands up! Don’t shoot!”

Brown’s body remained on the street for hours — a span Jackson deemed “uncomfortable” but justified, given that “you only get one chance at that crime scene” to process it correctly. Jackson said authorities also were concerned about gunfire they could hear in a nearby building.

In the shooting’s aftermath, the notorious hacking collective Anonymous has taken credit for burrowing into the city website and shutting it down for much of the day Monday. The group also released what it said were audio experts from St. Louis County dispatch on the day Brown was killed. Police declined to comment on the recordings.",0,NA,NA,NA
DallasMorningNews,dallas16,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140811-fbi-opens-investigation-into-st.-louis-shooting.ece,FBI opens investigation into St. Louis shooting,Jim Salter; Jim Suhr,08/11/2014,02/29/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The FBI opened an investigation Monday into the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager whose death stirred a night of unrest in a St. Louis suburb.

Many questions loomed over the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after an altercation with an officer in Ferguson.

It was unclear whether Brown or a man he was with was involved in the scuffle, and authorities were vague about what led an officer to open fire.

Dorian Johnson told WALB-TV that he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of his car.

Johnson said the officer fired, and he and Brown were scared and ran away.

“He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,” Johnson said. “But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.”

“We wasn’t causing harm to nobody,” Johnson told the television station. “We had no weapons on us at all.”

The race of the officer was not disclosed. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.

The St. Louis County Police Department refused to discuss Johnson’s remarks, citing the ongoing investigation. But Police Chief Jon Belmar previously said that an officer encountered Brown and another man outside a Ferguson apartment complex, and that one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled.

The FBI is looking into possible civil rights violations arising from the shooting, said Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI’s St. Louis field office. She said the FBI would be investigating regardless of the public attention surrounding the matter.

Nearly three dozen people were arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night after crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted officers who tried to block access to parts of the city.

Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used Brown’s death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.

“Most came here for a peaceful protest, but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. … I can understand the anger and unrest, but I can’t understand the violence and looting,” Trout said.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said 32 people were arrested for various offenses, including assault, burglary and theft. Two officers suffered minor injuries, and there were no reports of civilians hurt.

Several businesses were looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People also took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer and carted rims away from a tire store.

Some climbed atop police cars as the officers with riot shields and batons stood stoically nearby, trying to restrict access to the most endangered areas.

A spokeswoman for St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said tear gas had been used.

Mayor James Knowles said a small group of people was “creating a huge mess.”

The unrest, he added, was “only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.”

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV that there’s no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but has not yet put to use.

The second person has not been arrested or charged, and it was not clear if he was armed, Jackson said. Blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him for toxicology tests, which can take weeks to complete.

Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting “Don’t shoot me” while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase until the crowd eventually left. A similar protest that attracted about 250 people was held Monday morning.

Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she did not understand why police did not subdue her son with a club or stun gun. She said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

“I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,” she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

Brown’s family planned to speak later Monday at a news conference with their attorney, Benjamin Crump, who also represented Martin’s family.

John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP, said the group was “outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement.”

A spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said a grand jury planned to begin hearing evidence Wednesday in the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson police officer. It remained unclear whether Wilson would face charges in the Aug. 9 incident, which has triggered days of violent protest and dozens of arrests.

“We know this is of interest to a lot of people around the country,” said the spokesman, Edward Magee. “We’re going to do this fairly and also attempt to do it in a timely manner.”

In the nearby suburb of Clayton, a small group of demonstrators who had gathered across the street from McCulloch’s office grew in size and fervor Tuesday. Chanting “No justice, no peace, no racist police,” the crowd rushed to the glass-front atrium of the county office building and was met by a wall of heavily armed police officers. At least two people were arrested.

After sundown Tuesday, the streets of Ferguson filled once more with protesters who marched along the street in a large square-shaped pattern. Police stood by with batons and gas masks.

More than 78 people have been arrested in Ferguson since the protests began, according to St. Louis County police. About 40 of them were arrested on Monday night alone, as small groups of demonstrators faced off with officers firing tear gas.

Two people were shot in Ferguson during the chaotic night, apparently by others in the crowd. Police said no officers fired their weapons.

Prosecutor issue

The St. Louis county executive and other local black leaders have challenged McCulloch’s fitness to handle the case, in part because his father, a police officer, was killed in the line of duty when McCulloch was 12 years old. The man who shot his father was black.

The county executive, Charlie Dooley, has said he also feels that McCulloch acted inappropriately when he publicly criticized Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon’s decision to bring in the state highway patrol to lead efforts to quell the violent street protests that erupted after Brown’s death.

McCulloch has declined to step aside and has said his father’s death does not affect his judgment.

His investigation of Brown’s death is being monitored by the Justice Department and the FBI, which are also investigating the shooting in an expanding federal probe that has yielded more than 200 interviews. Holder will arrive in Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with federal prosecutors and agents.

In a statement Tuesday night, Gov. Jay Nixon expressed sympathy for the Brown family and praised residents for “standing against armed and violent instigators.” But he also said that “a vigorous prosecution must now be pursued.”

Officer’s account

The new developments came on a day in which the first public indications emerged of Wilson’s version of events on that fateful day. The officer, who is on paid administrative leave and whose whereabouts are unknown, has told investigators that he struggled with Brown in his police cruiser and opened fire out of fear for his life after Brown charged at him, according to people familiar with Wilson’s account.

Brown’s family has said their son was shot with his hands in the air in an execution-style slaying.

Although the state investigation is ongoing, McCulloch’s office confirmed Tuesday that it has been in contact with Wilson’s attorney and has obtained a full statement regarding the officer’s version of events. The prosecutors would not elaborate.

The Justice Department, which ordered its own autopsy of Brown’s body, has reached conclusions similar to those reached in two other autopsies, people familiar with the findings said Tuesday. Those autopsies, by the county medical examiner and by a medical examiner brought in by the teen’s family, concluded that Brown was shot six times.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown’s family, said the 18-year-old’s funeral and memorial service would be Monday, though the time and location haven’t been finalized.

Violence rages on

Earlier in the day, police said they had come under “heavy gunfire” Monday night during another night of violence in this battle-scarred community of 21,000 people.

At a news conference, Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said officers refrained from firing back at the protesters. Numerous fires were also set, he said.

Johnson said Monday night’s two shooting victims were both men, but he had no information on their condition or identities. He stressed that “not a single bullet was fired by officers.”

Standing in front of a table that displayed two handguns and a Molotov cocktail, Johnson said the weapons had been seized from “criminals” who were hiding behind those peacefully protesting.

“All of these criminals at night that are masking themselves and hiding themselves behind peace, let them come at night so we can identify them, so we can take them away from our community and put them away and make our streets clear,” Johnson said.",0,NA,NA,NA

Perhaps one of the most heartbreaking things about the situation in Ferguson, Mo., is the realization that it takes this kind of violence, protest and chaos for many Americans to begin to face the fact that racism is still alive and well.

The racial tension explicitly expressed by the protesters in Missouri seems to be bottled up inside many other Americans, both black and white, but only boils over when an act of blatant discrimination — in this case, alleged racially charged police brutality — is committed, and just happens to make national news.

I pray for a future where peaceful dialogue, justice and honesty are the way we as Americans, as humans, tackle these difficult yet unavoidable topics.

Military look of police

Re: {“Be wary of police? Didn’t think so until Ferguson” by Jacquielynn Floyd, Metro column.}<hyperlink=""http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/jacquielynn-floyd/20140815-be-wary-of-police-didnt-think-so-until-ferguson.ece>

The trend toward more militaristic-appearing community police forces has been growing for at least a decade.

Routinely we see police uniforms looking more and more like military costumes, rather than merely straightforward identifying dress. Neighborhood patrol cars look pricklier with authoritative appearing paraphernalia, and police units look like military special operations units.

Are we being dangerously desensitized to the presence of military authority that might eventually consume our democracy? Perhaps the trend toward military-looking community police mirrors a growing distrust of the public’s governing ability and yearning for more authoritarian governance. However, I believe few really want police states.

Certainly, there are those abhorring governance by the public with its annoying multiple personalities and complex, acrimonious tangle of interests, believing the public can’t and shouldn’t run anything.

But for those of us in love with democracy, militaristic appearing police symbolize antidemocratic forces and give us concern.

Tough to be a cop

It is really tough being a cop today. You have a split second to make a life or death decision. It seems like the majority of crime in the black community is black on black. Without law enforcement, how many more black youths would die?

President Barack Obama has told the community of Ferguson to stop the anarchy and warned law enforcement to back off the protesters. I believe this is not about the death of a black youth at the hands of law enforcement, but rather the lack of jobs and hope in the black community.

They carried objects that doubled as warnings: assault rifles and ammunition, slender black nightsticks and gas masks.

They were not just one police force but many, hailing from communities throughout north St. Louis County and loosely coordinated by the county police.

Their adversaries were a ragtag group of mostly unarmed neighborhood residents, hundreds of blacks whose pent-up fury at the police has sent them pouring onto streets and sidewalks in Ferguson, demanding justice for Michael Brown, the 18-year-old fatally shot by a police officer on Saturday.

When the protesters refused to retreat from the streets, threw firebombs or walked too close to a police officer, the response was swift and unrelenting: tear gas and rubber bullets.

To the rest of the world, the images of explosions, billowing tear gas and armored vehicles made this city look as if it belonged in a chaos-stricken corner of Eastern Europe, not the heart of the Midwest. As a result, a broad call has come from across the political spectrum for America’s police forces to be demilitarized.

“At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community,” Attorney General Eric Holder said, “I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.”

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voiced similar sentiments.

But such opposition amounts to a sharp change in tone in Washington, where the federal government has spent more than a decade paying for body armor, mine-resistant trucks and other military gear, all while putting few restrictions on its use.

Grant programs that, in the name of fighting terrorism, paid for some of the equipment being used in Ferguson have been consistently popular since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. If there has been any debate at all, it was over which departments deserved the most money.

Grant money

Department of Homeland Security grant money paid for the $360,000 Bearcat armored truck on patrol in Ferguson, said Nick Gragnani, executive director of St. Louis Area Regional Response System, which administers such grants for the St. Louis area.

Since 2003, the group has spent $9.4 million on equipment for the police in St. Louis County. That includes $3.6 million for two helicopters, plus the Bearcat, other vehicles and night vision equipment. Most of the body armor worn by officers responding to the Ferguson protests were paid for with federal money, Gragnani said.

“The focus is terrorism, but it’s allowed to do a crossover for other types of responses,” he said. “It’s for any type of civil unrest. We went by the grant guidance. There was no restriction put on that by the federal government.”

While the major Homeland Security grants do not pay for weapons, Justice Department grants do. That includes rubber bullets and tear gas, which the police use to disperse crowds. A Justice Department report last year said that nearly 400 local police departments and more than 100 state agencies had bought such less-lethal weapons using Justice Department grant money.

The grants also paid for body armor, vehicles and surveillance equipment. It was not clear if those grants paid for equipment being used in Ferguson.

The military also sent machine guns, armored trucks, aircraft and other surplus war equipment to local departments. Compared with other urban areas, St. Louis County has received relatively little surplus military equipment.

War on terrorism

All these programs began or were expanded in response to the Sept. 11 attacks, when the authorities in Washington declared that local police were on the front lines of a global war on terrorism. Terrorism is exceedingly rare, however, and the equipment and money far outpaced the threat.

“You couldn’t say that back then with as much certainty as you can say that now, though,” said Frank Cilluffo, director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University.

After Sept. 11, few people asked whether the police would use the equipment against protesters, Cilluffo said. “By and large, I don’t recall an outcry of any sort historically along these lines.”

In most instances, the government did not require training for police departments receiving military-style equipment, and few if any limitations were put on its use, he said.

The increase in military-style equipment has coincided with a significant rise in the number of police SWAT teams, which are being used for routine duties such as conducting liquor inspections and serving warrants.

For years, much of the equipment has gone unnoticed. But as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have drawn down, police departments have been receiving 30-ton, mine-resistant trucks from the military. That has caught the attention of the public and caused controversy in several towns.

‘Disperse!’

Nowhere has the deployment of military-style equipment been on starker display than this week in Ferguson.

During the confrontations, the police have made the same tactical move: When they determined that the protest was no longer peaceful, they used tear gas to force protesters off the main street and into the two residential neighborhoods on either side of it.

Once the protesters had been pushed onto side streets of small, one-story houses and low-slung apartment buildings, some of them said they were effectively trapped on the wrong side of Florissant.

“Disperse! Go back to your homes!” the police shouted, often from the top of armored vehicles, through megaphones whose orders echoed throughout the streets.

“We don’t live here!” several people shouted back.

Police officials have said over the last few days that they felt they had no choice but to use tear gas and rubber bullets. They could not allow looting to happen again, they said, and dispersing the crowds was the only way to stop it.

Chief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson police on Thursday defended the use of force against demonstrators.

“If the crowd is being violent,” he said, “and you don’t want to be violent, get out of the crowd.”",0,NA,NA,NA

Dallas Police Chief David Brown, Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins and Sheriff Lupe Valdez answered questions during an often-contentious town hall meeting Monday night about police shooting investigations.

The meeting at St. Paul United Methodist Church in downtown Dallas came as unrest continues in Ferguson, Mo., over the fatal shooting of an unarmed man.

Dallas County is weighing a proposal to add investigators to look into police shootings independently of the department.

Brown continued to offer support for the new district attorney’s unit, as he promoted his department’s community outreach programs.

“You can’t have enough oversight when it comes to police-officer-involved shootings in any city,” he said.

Watkins said he has been working to create the new unit for two years.

“What we’re saying is we need to restore the public’s trust,” Watkins said. “We need an independent voice.”

The trust problem manifested itself in outbursts from the dozens of people in the audience through the hourlong meeting. Some questioned whether the district attorney’s office could truly be independent from the police.

As frequent shouting matches broke out, officials tried to cool tempers.

“We’re here, we’re listening and we understand your pain,” Watkins said.

Collette Flanagan, whose son was killed by a Dallas officer last year, slammed Watkins for not winning more indictments against police. The officer who shot her son said he was being choked until he couldn’t breathe. He was cleared by a grand jury.

Watkins replied that Flanagan pickets outside his house too often and he can’t indict anyone — that is up to a grand jury.

Lawyer Daryl K. Washington, who often sues the Police Department, said he thought most of the scrutiny of Ferguson, Mo., was having a positive result.

“It has brought a lot of attention to a national issue we have,” he said. “I have represented too many mothers that have lost their kids and not gotten any answers.”

Watkins said he hoped his unit would be able to speed up investigations.

But Brown also cautioned that there is a “balancing act” in releasing information about an ongoing inquiry.

“We have to get it right,” he said.

Brown said the department isn’t perfect, but it’s open to making improvements.

He said he wants the department to rely more on alternatives to deadly force, such as stun guns.

“We are committed to all the tools that are in the law-enforcement toolbox,” he said.

The department also has 200 uniform-worn cameras on the way, which will help document police and suspects’ actions, he said.

Earlier Monday, the Dallas Police Association called for the department to equip all officers with the cameras as soon as possible.

Police officials have said they’d like to phase in the cameras for about 2,500 officers, which could cost millions of dollars.

The police association also called for wrapping the district attorney’s investigators into the department’s Special Investigation’s Unit, which handles shootings by police.

The association had previously opposed the plan altogether, and it expressed surprise when Brown publicly backed the idea.

The chief said he was pleased by the association’s about-face.

“It’s a pleasant surprise and will help us move forward together,” he said in an email.",0,NA,NA,NA

Nearly a week after 18-year-old Michael Brown’s death sparked days of protests, police identified the officer who killed him as Darren Wilson, 28, who has six years of service with no disciplinary record. But they provided virtually no information about the officer, instead focusing on linking Brown to the robbery of a convenience store just before the shooting.

At a tense early-morning news conference, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Brown had been the prime suspect in that robbery — in which several boxes of cigars were stolen — and that his description was broadcast over police frequencies just before his encounter with Wilson. Police dramatized the allegation, releasing security camera photos showing a person they identified as Brown towering over and menacing the store clerk, images that were circulated nationwide.

Yet, despite the implication that Brown had been stopped because of the robbery, Jackson later appeared to reverse himself, saying at a second news conference that the confrontation “was not related to the robbery.” Instead, he said, Brown was stopped because he and a friend were in the street.

Hours later, Jackson returned again to the robbery theme, telling the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the officer saw cigars in Brown’s hand and realized he might be the robber.

Family ‘flabbergasted’

The confusion not only did little to calm tensions roiling this community but also appeared to further inflame them. Scattered protests continued, and the police actions drew a rebuke from Brown’s family, which accused Jackson of deliberately besmirching the teen’s character.

Brown’s family members “feel it was aimed at denigrating their son. It was an attempt at character assassination,” said Anthony Gray, a lawyer for the family.

Added Eric Davis, a cousin of Brown’s mother: “It infuriated us.”

Another family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said the family was “flabbergasted” that police would release security images depicting Brown, but no photos of Wilson.

“The police are playing games here, and the parents are beyond incensed with the way that the police are handling the distribution of information,” Crump said. “The police are not being transparent.”

Meanwhile, there were signs Friday of a rift among state and local authorities involved in the case, only one day after political and community leaders mounted a renewed effort to tamp down the violence and find ways to prevent future outbreaks while multiple investigations of the shooting proceed.

In an unusual public disagreement, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson — newly in charge of security in the city— appeared to question the decision to name Brown as a robbery suspect.

“I would have liked to have been consulted,” Johnson said, adding that he would meet with Jackson to discuss “how that was released.”

Johnson, who is black and grew up in the Ferguson area, was put in charge of highway patrol security operations in Ferguson by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday after days of images of riot police and tear gas in the streets.

Law enforcement officials typically strive to present a united front, yet Nixon’s decision prompted an unusual public attack from St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, who was angered that control of the scene was taken away from St. Louis County authorities.

“For Nixon to never talk to the commanders in the field and come in here and take this action is disgraceful,” McCulloch told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “It’s shameful what he did.”

It’s McCulloch who would decide whether state charges are to be filed against the police officer. But St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said Friday he is leading an effort to remove the county prosecutor from the investigation because of bias.

FBI, Justice involved

It was not clear Friday whether the turf battles would hamper the state investigation of Brown’s shooting. The Justice Department and FBI, which are conducting a parallel investigation to determine whether Brown’s civil rights were violated, are deferring for now to state investigators but are also monitoring them.

The announcements from police identifying the officer and naming Brown as a robbery suspect came after the calmest night in Ferguson since Brown was killed. His death has sparked outrage and protests, with hundreds marching in the streets in the days that followed.

Jackson described Wilson, who was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, as a gentle man who is devastated by last weekend’s events. The officer “never intended for any of this to happen,” Jackson said.

The sequence of events in Brown’s shooting is still unclear. According to a friend who says he saw the encounter, Brown was walking along a Ferguson street when a police officer in a car ordered him to get on the sidewalk. Brown had his hands in the air to show he was unarmed when the officer shot him multiple times, the friend said.

Police say Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to grab his gun. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times, police have said.",0,NA,NA,NA

Cops deploy their training and their intuition creatively, and I wielded every trick in my arsenal, including verbal judo, humor, warnings and ostentatious displays of the lethal (and nonlethal) hardware resting in my duty belt.

Sometimes, though, no amount of persuasion or warnings works on a belligerent person; that’s when cops have to use force, and the results can be tragic. We are still learning what transpired between Officer Darren Wilson and Brown, but in most cases it’s less ambiguous — and officers are rarely at fault. When they use force, they are defending their, or the public’s, safety.

Even though it might sound harsh and impolitic, here is the bottom line: If you don’t want to get shot, tased, pepper-sprayed, struck with a baton or thrown to the ground, just do what I tell you. Don’t argue with me, don’t call me names, don’t tell me that I can’t stop you, don’t say I’m a racist pig. Don’t scream at me that you pay my salary, and don’t even think of aggressively walking toward me.

Most field stops are complete in minutes. How difficult is it to cooperate for that long?

I know it is scary for people to be stopped by cops. I also understand the anger and frustration if people believe they have been stopped unjustly. I am aware that corrupt and bully cops exist. When it comes to police misconduct, I side with the ACLU: Having worked as an internal affairs investigator, I know that some officers engage in unprofessional and arrogant behavior; sometimes they behave like criminals themselves.

And you don’t have to submit to an illegal stop or search. You can refuse consent to search your car or home if there’s no warrant (though a pat-down is still allowed if there is cause for suspicion). Always ask the officer whether you are under detention or are free to leave. Unless the officer has a legal basis to stop and search you, he or she must let you go. Finally, cops are legally prohibited from using excessive force: The moment a suspect submits and stops resisting, the officers must cease use of force.

But if you believe (or know) that the cop stopping you is violating your rights or is acting like a bully, I guarantee that the situation will not become easier if you show your anger and resentment. Worse, initiating a physical confrontation is a sure recipe for getting hurt. Police are legally permitted to use deadly force when they assess a serious threat to their or someone else’s life. Save your anger for later, and channel it appropriately. Do what the officer tells you to, and it will end safely for both of you.

We have a justice system in which you are presumed innocent; if a cop can do his or her job unmolested, that system can run its course. Later, you can ask for a supervisor, lodge a complaint or contact civil rights organizations if you believe your rights were violated.

Feel free to sue the police! Just don’t challenge a cop during a stop.",0,NA,NA,NA
DallasMorningNews,dallas24,http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20140812-black-kids-dont-have-to-be-college-bound-for-deaths-to-be-tragic.ece,Black kids don’t have to be college-bound for deaths to be tragic,Jasmine Banks,08/12/2014,03/02/2016,"The refrain has been repeated often in news reports about Michael Brown, the 18-year-old killed by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer Saturday: “Brown was supposed to start college on Monday.”

Social media posts use his planned next steps to underscore the tragedy of his life cut short. His educational status even makes its way into headlines: “Police Kill College-Bound Kid” and “Unarmed Teen Shot by Police Days Before He Was Scheduled to Leave for College.”

What if Monday was to have been his first day of standing on the corner not doing a darn thing? Would his death be less of a loss?

Unarmed college hopefuls don’t deserve to be shot. Unarmed kids heading to work or trade school don’t deserve to be shot. Unarmed kids floundering aimlessly through life don’t deserve to be shot. Unarmed kids who have been in trouble — even those who have been nothing but trouble — don’t deserve to be shot.

The act of pinning the tragedy of a dead black teen to his potential success, to his respectability, to his good-ness, is done with the best intentions. But if we read between the lines, are we saying that had he not been on his way to college, there would be less to mourn?

That’s dead wrong.

After reading the headlines, I logged on to social media and discovered a hashtag following this tragedy. #IfTheyGunnedMeDown had taken on a life of its own. Users frustrated by media portrayals of African-American victims that seem to intentionally make them appear unsavory to white audiences shared split-screen images of themselves to make a point: Here’s how I really am: Clean, professional, nonthreatening. Here’s the photo the media would dig up to make me look like a thug. Isn’t that terrible?

I’m sympathetic to that frustration. But what’s truly horrifying is that we, people of color, have been exposed to this “thugs deserve to die” narrative so frequently that some of us seem to have embraced it ourselves. Instead of arguing that nobody deserves to be shot, we tie ourselves up in knots making the case that the latest victim of a law enforcement officer’s bullet was a good kid or that the photo the news media selected wasn’t the most flattering depiction of him.

Mothers of black and brown children sob to the reporters, “He was an honor roll student! He wanted to go to college.” Even Brown’s grieving mom bought into this: “Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many,” she told local television news station KMOV.

She and so many of us are desperately parsing out parts of the narrative to appeal to the humanity of those who are detached from our stories. We are saying, “Look, that brown kid had a good heart. He didn’t deserve a bullet.” We are, as we always have been, fighting to get the majority to see our worth.

In essence, this emotional appeal is a loud cry that we are good enough and our lives have value.

The way that Mike Brown, Trayvon Martin and John Crawford lived is important to the full narratives surrounding their lives, but it should not define the conversations around the wrongfulness of their deaths.

We cannot and should not engage in discussions that look like black and brown people explaining that an unarmed person shouldn’t have been shot because they lived in a way of which we are proud.

I wouldn’t have cared if Mike, Trayvon and John all sagged their pants down to their ankles and if the only images of them depicted them smoking pot and throwing gang signs.

I wouldn’t have cared if they’d been high school dropouts who fought and tagged walls. Their lives would have been every bit as valuable, and their losses every bit as infuriating and sad.

So, after I absorb this latest news, I will teach my two brown sons that their skin makes others perceive them as dangerous and that fear can mean death. But what I refuse to teach them is that, unless they’re headed to college, the potential loss of their lives won’t be tragic.",0,NA,NA,NA
DallasMorningNews,dallas25,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140817-missouri-teen-was-shot-6-times-autopsy-shows.ece,"Missouri teen Michael Brown was shot 6 times, autopsy shows",Frances Robles; Julie Bosman,08/17/2014,03/02/2016,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager who was killed by a police officer, sparking protests around the nation, was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, a preliminary private autopsy performed Sunday found.

One of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury, according to Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for New York City, who flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family’s request to conduct the separate autopsy. It was likely the last of bullets to hit him, he said.

Brown, 18, was also shot four times in the right arm, he said, adding that all the bullets were fired into his front.

The bullets did not appear to have been shot from very close range because no gunshot powder was present on his body. However, that determination could change if it turns out that there is gunshot residue on Brown’s clothing, to which Baden did not have access.

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said Sunday that the Justice Department would conduct its own autopsy, in addition to the one performed by local officials and this private one because, a department spokesman said, of “the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family.”

The preliminary autopsy results are the first time that some of the critical information resulting in Brown’s death has been made public. Thousands of protesters demanding information and justice for what was widely viewed as a reckless shooting took to the streets here in rallies that ranged from peaceful to violent.

Brown died last week in a confrontation with a police officer in this suburb of St. Louis. The police department has come under harsh criticism for refusing to clarify the circumstances of the shooting and for responding to protests with military-style operational gear.

“People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day One,” Baden said in an interview after performing the autopsy. “They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.”

Baden said that while Brown was shot at least six times, only three bullets were recovered from his body. But he has not yet seen the X-rays showing where the bullets were found, which would clarify the autopsy results. Nor has he had access to witness and police statements.",0,NA,NA,NA

DallasMorningNews,dallas27,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140814-dallas-county-da-watkins-plans-police-shootings-unit.ece,Dallas County DA plans unit to investigate all shootings by police,Matthew Watkins,08/14/2014,03/04/2016,"Amid outcries over shootings involving police locally and nationwide, District Attorney Craig Watkins is planning to create a unit to independently investigate such cases in Dallas County.

Watkins said the two-person unit will go to the scene any time a shooting by police occurs. Its investigations will run concurrent with police inquiries. Prosecutors will no longer wait for police to bring cases to them, he said.

“I think it would be somewhat irresponsible if we didn’t address the fact that there is a lack of trust with the police,” Watkins said.

“This is 2014, and we need to change the mind-set and how we deal with certain things.”

In an email, Dallas Police Chief David Brown expressed support for Watkins’ effort, saying the new unit will “add another layer of oversight.”

“I believe it can only improve the public trust and confidence in the criminal justice system,” the chief said.

News of the district attorney’s plan comes as national attention has turned to Ferguson, Mo., where the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager Saturday has triggered riots. Meanwhile in Dallas, two people were killed by officers in separate shootings within a span of 24 hours this week.

Watkins’ plan was in the works well before those events unfolded. But he said the recent shootings highlight the need for his special unit.

“When you have a police department investigating themselves, obviously people don’t believe in that,” he said.

Funding for the unit has not been finalized. That will happen when the Commissioners Court signs off on the county budget in September. But Ryan Brown, the county budget officer, said commissioners have expressed support.

“We pretty much have it approved,” Watkins said.

The unit will cost about $200,000 annually. Two new hires are planned, a prosecutor and an investigator.

Currently, the DA’s public integrity unit handles shootings involving police. But Watkins said its members are too busy to devote the time needed to focus on just that one area.

The new unit will have the time, he said.

“If a shooting happens at 3 a.m., these people will be on call to start the investigation,” he said. “We don’t have to wait for the police department to call us and give us what they have done. We will start our own.”

This week’s two fatal shootings remain under investigation. The first happened Sunday on a street in north Oak Cliff, where an off-duty police corporal working security shot an unarmed 26-year-old. Police said the man tried to force his way into a passing vehicle, then charged the corporal.

The second shooting occurred Monday in northwest Dallas. Police said an 18-year-old was shot after he assaulted family members and brandished knives while approaching an officer.

Prosecutors recently won indictments against two Dallas officers, Amy Wilburn and Cardan Spencer, who were involved in nonfatal shootings last year.

They were both quickly fired after the shootings, which were captured on video. In the previous 40 years, no Dallas police officer had been indicted for a shooting.

After the shooting involving Spencer, the police chief announced that the Dallas department would consider attaching small cameras to officers’ uniforms. The devices are currently being field-tested. Chief Brown has said he hopes to get private money to buy 2,500 of them.

But Watkins said action is also needed outside the purview of the police. Residents will have more trust in the way shootings are investigated if there’s an outside review, he said.

Brown, Watkins and Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez are planning to host a town hall next week to discuss police shootings. The time and date have not been finalized, but an announcement is expected Friday.

Watkins can expect push-back from the Dallas Police Association. Bob Gorsky, a lawyer for the group, said it opposes the district attorney’s plan.

Gorsky said the Dallas Police Department’s special investigations unit “is fully capable of investigating officer-involved shootings.”

“We do not believe that a parallel investigation by the district attorney is needed, nor is it an effective use of taxpayer money,” he said.

Asked about the police chief’s support for Watkins’ initiative, Gorsky said: “He’s going to have to explain himself on that.”

Watkins said he anticipated resistance from the rank and file, but that the police association is on the “wrong side of history.”

“We are not here to disparage the police department,” the district attorney said. “We are here to have an independent eye.”",1,NA,NA,NA
DallasMorningNews,dallas28,http://popcultureblog.dallasnews.com/2014/08/showtimes-masters-of-sex-carries-eerie-parallels-to-racial-tension-in-missouri.html/,Showtime’s ‘Masters of Sex’ carries eerie parallels to racial tension in Missouri,Michael Granberry,08/18/2014,03/04/2016,"Pop culture often intersects reality in unexpected ways. The connection can be so eerily coincidental that, when it happens, it’s nothing less than extraordinary. My favorite example is the movie The China Syndrome, released on March 16, 1979. Starring Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon (each of whom received Oscar nominations), the film dealt powerfully with the cover-up of safety hazards at a nuclear power plant. Twelve days later, with the movie gathering commercial momentum, the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania suffered a partial nuclear meltdown, causing a national sensation. You can’t make this stuff up.

I couldn’t help but think of this last night as I was watching the latest episode of Masters of Sex on Showtime. It is, arguably, the best show on television. It involves the landmark sexual research conducted during the 1950s by Dr. William Masters (played by Michael Sheen) and Virginia Johnson (played by Lizzy Caplan). The series is set in the St. Louis, Mo., area, where Masters practiced medicine. Six episodes in, Season 2 delves deeply into racial issues, making its connection to the current events in the St. Louis County town of Ferguson, Mo., all the more prescient.

Ferguson, of course, is where Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old was fatally shot by a police officer on Aug. 9. The incident has sparked protests and vandalism in the St. Louis suburb.

Last night’s episode of Masters of Sex — and stop reading if you haven’t watched it yet — saw Masters getting fired from a black hospital where he had sought scientific refuge after problems at two previous hospitals. This season has examined the racist attitudes of Masters’ wife, Libby, who ends up firing her black nanny as the culmination of a series of conflicts. It’s obvious these episodes were filmed long before the racial tension in a St. Louis suburb unfolded, but they carry with them a kind of sadness. The grim parallels to the 1950s and 2014 are right there, for everyone to see.

Here is a YouTube preview of episode 6, “Blackbird,” which aired Sunday night:",0,NA,NA,"The article ends with a Youtube embedded link, but the video no more exists."
