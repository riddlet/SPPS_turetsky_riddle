BBC,bbc1,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28737025,Michael Brown shooting: Calm returns after rioting,NA,8/11/2014,10/27/2015,"Police in the US state of Missouri say they have arrested 32 people as calm returned after a night of rioting.
Unrest broke out on Sunday over the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer in Ferguson.
People looted shops, vandalised cars and stores, and set a building alight as police tried to block off access to several areas of the city.
Police say Michael Brown, 18, was shot on Saturday afternoon in the mainly black suburb of St Louis.
He was shot several times after a struggle in a police car, they said.
On Monday, dozens of residents marched through the streets demanding justice.
As residents began the task of cleaning up, some said they believed the violence was not over.
'Fighting back'
DeAndre Smith, 30, of Ferguson told the St Louis Post-Dispatch that the rioting reflected a sense of injustice in the community.
""I don't think it's over honestly,"" he said. ""I just think they got a taste of what fighting back means.""
St Louis County police say the FBI has now taken over the investigation into Mr Brown's death.
The rioting erupted late on Sunday after thousands of people attended a candlelight vigil for the slain man. 
County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after the officer encountered two men, including Mr Brown, on a street in Ferguson.
Mr Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began.
'Outrage'
At least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car, Mr Belmar said.
But authorities say they are still trying to clarify exactly what happened inside the vehicle.
The officer involved has been with the Ferguson police department for six years, and has been placed on paid administrative leave, Mr Belmar said.
Mayor James Knowles said he understood that people ""want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out"", but he added: ""We're going to obviously try to urge calm.""
Mr Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said her son had graduated from high school and planned to go to a local college.
The killing has drawn comparisons by some civil rights leaders with the 2012 killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighbourhood watch organiser who was acquitted of murder charges.
""We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,"" said John Gaskin, of the civil rights group NAACP.",NA,NA,NA,NA
BBC,bbc2,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28779241,Michael Brown shooting: Police will co-operate fully,NA,8/14/2014,10/28/2015,"Police in the US state of Missouri have said they will co-operate fully with investigations into the shooting of an unarmed black teenager that sparked days of outraged protests.
Michael Brown, 18, was shot by a police on Saturday in the suburb of Ferguson.
Eyewitnesses have said Mr Brown, who had just graduated from high school, put up his arms and tried to surrender before being killed.
President Barack Obama and civil rights activists have appealed for calm.
According to details released by the St Louis County Police Department, Mr Brown was shot after an officer on a routine patrol asked him and another teenager to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon.
There was a scuffle and at some point the officer fired his weapon inside the patrol car, said the police.
On Wednesday, Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer required treatment in hospital for a facial injury. 
In a statement, the Ferguson police department said it would help investigations into the incident being conducted by the county police department, the justice department and the FBI.
The department also asked protesters to demonstrate only in the daylight hours ""in an organised and respectful manner"", and to disperse ""well before the evening hours to ensure the safety of the participants and the safety of our community"". 
Among young and old, there is a sense of loss and injustice felt across the suburb of Ferguson.
People have decided now is the time to unite and show their disgust at the shooting, whether through church vigils or the poignant protests of young people raising their hands and walking towards police lines chanting ""don't shoot"".
The killing of Michael Brown has exposed deep-rooted racial issues here, between a predominantly African-American community and the largely white administration.
In spite of making up an estimated 67% of the population, black people are overwhelmingly under-represented in both local government and in the police force in Ferguson, which is being accused by many of inherent racism.
People have been demanding an investigation, but with the national spotlight on this community, they are also seizing the moment to demand more equality in the society in which they live.
The department's appeal comes after three nights of tense, often violent protests that have resulted in dozens of arrests, looting and the burning of a shop.
On Tuesday night, police fired tear gas into a small group of protesters who had confronted a line of officers, St Louis County Police Department spokesman Brian Schellman told the Reuters news agency.
Earlier, a far larger crowd had chanted ""hands up, don't shoot"" and ""no justice, no peace"" during a tense but non-violent stand-off with police near the site of Mr Brown's killing.
And in the early hours of Wednesday morning, police reported they shot and wounded a man near the site of protests in an apparently unrelated incident.
Officers said they responded to reports of four men wearing ski masks and holding shotguns. One man drew a handgun and fired and was shot by an officer, they said.
Civil rights activists and Mr Brown's family and friends have called for an end to violent clashes with the police, while also demanding the Ferguson police department release the name of the officer who shot and killed Mr Brown.
""To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant he was,"" the Reverend Al Sharpton said at a news conference on Tuesday.
President Barack Obama has promised a full investigation by the US Department of Justice into the teenager's death, and the FBI has launched its own inquiry.
""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but... I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" Mr Obama said in a statement.",NA,NA,NA,NA

But they said the robbery in a convenience store had nothing to do with the initial contact between Mr Brown and the officer who shot him.
Mr Brown's family have reacted angrily at what they see as a police attempt to ""justify the execution-style murder"".
The killing sparked days of angry clashes between police and protestors.
Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer who shot Michael Brown did not know that he had allegedly stolen goods from a nearby store.
""The initial contact between the officer and Michael Brown was not related to the robbery,"" he said.
Instead, he added, the reason for the stop was that Brown ""was walking down the middle of the street stopping traffic"".
Mr Jackson said he had released the footage of the crime only because he had been forced to do so because of numerous freedom of information requests from journalists.
He described the robbery at the convenience store as being committed without the use of a weapon.
CCTV pictures in a police report show a well-built black man intimidating a clerk in the store.
The police report identifies the man as Mr Brown, described as being 6ft 4in (193cm) and 292 pounds (132kg).
It says he ""grabbed a box of Swisher Sweet cigars"" and handed them to a second suspect identified as Mr Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson.
Since the shooting on Saturday, Mr Johnson has given a number of interviews in which he has said Mr Brown held up his hands in an act of surrender before being shot by the officer.
Also on Friday Mr Jackson revealed the name of the officer who shot and killed Mr Brown - Darren Wilson - and said he was injured in a struggle with Mr Brown.
Mr Wilson, is a six-year veteran of the police force with no disciplinary record, Mr Jackson said.
Mr Brown's family accused the police of being devious in their release of information.
""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution-style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender,"" said a statement.
Members of the majority black Ferguson community have also reacted angrily.
Ferguson resident Milton Jackson, 37, said: ""I don't believe what the officer did was called for. Even if there was a robbery, it was unnecessary force to shoot an unarmed black man.""
On Thursday night, tension seemed to ease, at least momentarily, as state police took charge of security after days of violent clashes between protesters and police.
There was no sign of the heavily armed police presence of previous nights.
US Attorney General Eric Holder said the use of military equipment and vehicles in Ferguson had sent a ""conflicting message"", while President Barack Obama said there was no excuse for police using ""excessive force"".

Organiser Feminista Jones says that the National Moment of Silence, known as {#NMOS14}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NMOS14""> on social media, was created in the wake of the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown and the police response to local protests.
With the shooting of Mike Brown, and now how Ferguson is being occupied by a military presence, people are upset and angry,"" Ms Jones told the BBC.
""I have a large platform so I knew I could reach people and make things happen.
Ms Jones, a feminist blogger and social worker, put a call out to {her 30,400 Twitter followers}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/FeministaJones""> the day after the shooting of Mr Brown, asking them to help her organise National Moment of Silence vigils across the nation.
Within just a few days, more than 50 vigils had been set up. Some city organisers were expecting more than a thousand participants on Thursday night.
To identify those who are participating in the movements and as a sign of solidarity, organisers have requested that participants wear a red ribbon, cloth or bandana on their arm.
The event in Washington DC was attended by hundreds of people in Malcolm X Park, many holding placards saying: ""Hands up. Don't shoot"". Protesters in the city later walked down a major street chanting the slogan.
Similar vigils were held in New York, Boston, Detroit, Chicago and many other cities.
For many organisers, this is their first time participating in a crowd-sourced event.
""It's amazing how everyone has come together on this by using hashtags and connecting on the social media websites,"" says Chicago organiser Kimberly Sewell.
Ms Sewell sees this as her personal responsibility.
""I was born in the Cabrini-Green housing projects and I was used to seeing heavy police presence in my neighbourhood as a young child,"" she said.
""I grew up hoping that we could lessen the police presence in communities like these. This is a time when we can say enough is enough.""
Other groups across the country have participated in social media protests in other ways.
Students from Howard University in Washington, DC, took a photo of hundreds of upperclassmen with their hands stretched in the air. The photo has been re-tweeted over 5,000 times.
""Mike Brown was supposed to start college on the Monday after the shooting. That could have been any one of us,"" said Howard University student Khalil Saadiq, who came up with the idea for the photo.
""If you had been in the auditorium, you would have felt the power of progress.""

""We're going to have to regain trust,"" he said.
Missouri Highway Patrol's Captain Ron Johnson, who grew up nearby, has taken charge of the operation.
He lost no time in making his presence felt, escorting a peaceful march through the streets of Ferguson on Thursday evening, shaking hands with protesters.

Shortly after Mr Wilson was identified as the officer involved in an apparent attempt to apprehend Mr Brown, the internet erupted in reaction - exposing a fault line in opinion that will be difficult to bridge.

""I am committed to ensuring the pain of last weekend's tragedy does not continue to be compounded by this ongoing crisis.""
At the scene - Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Ferguson
Of those young black men and women taking to the streets, many say they have no other outlet to show their objection - not just to the way Michael Brown died, but to the way the police treats them as a community - and that they will not stop protesting until they are listened to.
While demonstrations throughout have been vociferous, for the most part they have been peaceful. They were again during the day on Wednesday. But after dark, police seemed intent on enforcing what had earlier been a request that ""all those wishing to demonstrate, disperse well before the evening hours"".
Tear gas was used and police lines swept through roads in the suburb of Ferguson that have been the focus of the confrontations.
Requests for calm have come even from the White House, but there is a sense that the young people on the streets have the moral support of many among the older generations within their community here, who also see this as an opportunity for long overdue change.
The killing and the resulting protests have laid bare tension between Ferguson's majority black population and its overwhelmingly white police department, analysts say.
The town's population of 21,000 is two-thirds black, while only three of the local police force's 53 officers are black.
Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said his priority was improving race relations in the town.
On Wednesday, the Ferguson police department asked protesters to gather only in the daylight and to disperse ""well before the evening hours"" for safety reasons.
The plea came after three nights of tense, sometimes violent protests that resulted in dozens of arrests, looting and the burning of a shop.
Despite this appeal to stay away, and calls for calm from President Barack Obama, Mr Brown's parents and civil rights activist the Reverend Al Sharpton, the anger seemed as palpable as ever on the streets of Ferguson on Wednesday night.
Tear gas
Armoured vehicles blocked off streets and protesters linked arms defiantly as they were told through loudspeakers to leave the area or face arrest.
The demonstrators chanted: ""Hands up, don't shoot.""
Molotov cocktails were thrown at lines of police, who launched smoke bombs and fired tear gas.
Two journalists were briefly detained by police earlier on Wednesday while working inside a McDonald's restaurant.
One of them, Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, told BBC Outside Source an officer handcuffed him, applied force to his neck, and ""purposefully"" banged his head against a glass window and then ""sarcastically apologised"".
He and Welsey Lowery of the Washington Post were taken to the police station but soon released, apparently after a third reporter called the Ferguson police chief and asked for comment.
""The only reason we're out is because of the fact that we are reporters,"" Reilly said. ""If they treated a white reporter who was working on his laptop that way, I can't imagine how terribly they're treating other people.""
Lowery later tweeted: ""Apparently, in America, in 2014, police can manhandle you, take you into custody, put you in cell & then open the door like it didn't happen.""
Civil rights activists and Mr Brown's family and friends have called for an end to the clashes, while also demanding that police release the name of the officer who shot and killed Mr Brown.
The authorities have declined to release the name, citing concerns for his safety, a decision that has been criticised by protesters demanding more transparency.
The officer has been placed on administrative leave.

Now, black people across the US have taken to Twitter to protest the way he has been portrayed in the media.
By posting two pictures of themselves - one in a conventionally positive scenario, and another in a more negative light - hundreds of people have hit back at a form of stereotyping they feel is common in the media.
Michael Brown, 18, was shot and killed on Saturday {after a struggle with police}<hyperlink=”http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28737025"">, in a predominantly black suburb of St Louis. Riots broke out after a vigil held in his memory the following day.

Later, an alternative photo emerged of Brown wearing a sports vest and making a sign with his hand. At a glance, it could be seen as suggestive of gang culture, even if it was simply a light-hearted gesture. It was this image that became popular with media organisations and conservative bloggers, according to criminal defence lawyer CJ Lawrence.
Lawrence says he was frustrated by what he saw as an attempt to shift blame away from the police, and onto Brown. He posted dual images of himself on Twitter along with the hashtag {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IfTheyGunnedMeDown&src=tyah"">.
In the first, he is seen making a speech at his university graduation alongside guest speaker Bill Clinton. In the second, he is dressed as a rapper in a costume he wore to a Halloween party. The hashtag poses a rhetorical question, he says, ""but in reality it's something we ask ourselves every day as African Americans"".
Another set of photos was posted by a journalism student from Maryland, who only wanted to be known by his first name, Benjamin. In the first picture he is seen in his army reserve uniform, and in the second he is dressed as a gangster holding a toy gun.

BBC,bbc15,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28764278,Michael Brown shooting: Obama calls for calm,NA,8/13/2014,11/5/2015,"US President Barack Obama has appealed for calm in Ferguson, Missouri, after the shooting of a black teenager by police sparked two nights of violence.
He described the death on Saturday of Michael Brown as heartbreaking and added: ""Remember this young man through reflection and understanding.""
In two nights of unrest in the St Louis suburb, dozens were arrested, shops looted and tear gas fired by police.
On Tuesday night, anger had turned to reflection at a community forum.
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon told a packed crowd at Christ the King United Church of Christ that the shooting felt ""like an old wound torn fresh"".
Ferguson's mayor and police chief also attended the meeting and were greeted with applause.
Earlier, the Reverend Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist, appealed for peace.
""To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant he was,"" he said, flanked by Mr Brown's parents.
He said no-one had the right to take Michael Brown's name and ""drag it through the mud"".
Police say Brown was shot several times after a struggle in a police car, but witnesses have said the unarmed Brown was shot when he had his arms raised. 
Speaking after around 50 demonstrators marched on the police headquarters, Mr Sharpton joined others in demanding police reveal the name of the officer who shot and killed Mr Brown.
""The local authorities have put themselves in a position, hiding names, not being transparent, where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,"" Mr Sharpton said.
Police say death threats on social media have prevented them naming the officer, who has been placed on paid administrative leave.
Protests during the day on Tuesday were peaceful if tense, but they came after police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a large crowd in Ferguson the night before.
Police said the crowd threw rocks at officers and there was gunfire coming from the crowd.
Thirty-two people were arrested on Sunday night after people looted shops, vandalised cars and stores, and set a building alight.
The FBI is investigating the shooting and US Attorney General Eric Holder said the case deserved a ""fulsome review"".
The justice department has also sent its community relations team to the area.",NA,NA,NA,NA

There is, however, a growing chorus from the conservative movement's libertarian wing that connects the perceived overreaction by a militarised local law enforcement to their critique of the heavy-handed power of government.
""The state is big and powerful and violent and can hurt you, whether it's the FDA, the state prosecutor or the local police force,"" {writes}<hyperlink=""http://hotair.com/archives/2014/08/13/free-societies-require-more-of-police-than-turning-tough-situations-into-militarized-zones/""> Hot Air blog's Mary Katharine Ham, concisely summarising the gist of this libertarian argument.
Breitbart's John Nolte {puts it}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/NolteNC/status/499928067067113473""> a bit more sharply: ""The media hate police but without them, who will ultimately force us to buy ObamaCare and confiscate our guns?""
On Wednesday night Congressman Justin Amash, a libertarian-leaning Republican embraced by the grass-roots Tea Party movement, {tweeted}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/499740253633388546""> that the news from Ferguson was ""frightening"", asking: ""Is this a war zone or a US city? Gov't escalates tensions w/military equipment & tactics.""
One of the leading figures in today's libertarian movement, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, {offers his take}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> in an opinion piece for Time magazine on Thursday afternoon: 
""When you couple this militarisation of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury - national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture - we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands…
""Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.""
Reason magazine's Ed Krayewski {builds on this theme}<hyperlink=""https://reason.com/archives/2014/08/14/some-thoughts-on-ferguson-newark-state-v#.hog1myn:EXtC""> of a militarised police force as the spear-point of an intrusive government, causing more harm than good:
""What's happening in Ferguson certainly looks like a counter-insurgency,"" he writes. ""If cops keep it up long enough, some residents might respond with an insurgency. Around the world, insurgencies are fueled by unemployed young men with few prospects. It's the way things like this tend to work, actions and reactions, supply meeting demand, in this case residents filling roles cops seem to be waiting to have filled.""
He continues by noting that much of the criticism of law enforcement abuses are instigated by laws that intrude on individual rights.
""Whether they look like it or not, cops will be an occupying force seeking compliance from local residents on behalf of democratically elected central authorities,"" he writes.
Comments like these mark a sharp break from the previous conservative embrace of government authority when it comes to public safety issues.
""The modern GOP, the one that elected Richard Nixon and built its base in the South and the suburbs, established early on that it was the 'law and order' party,"" {writes}<hyperlink=”http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/08/14/law_and_order_vs_overkill_the_conservative_response_to_ferguson.html""> Slate's David Weigel. ""Only recently, as violent crime rates have tumbled, has the libertarian tendency of the GOP reasserted itself.""

He cited poll data showing young people embracing smaller, less intrusive government and concluded that the once sidelined ideology could be poised to take control of the Republican Party.
The piece started a debate over libertarianism's current influence within the conservative movement and was criticised from both {the right}<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/the-illusion-of-a-libertarian-moment/375844/""> and {the left}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/opinion/paul-krugman-the-libertarian-fantasy.html?""> for being an {“unsophisticated, laughable fantasy”}<hyperlink=”http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/an-opening-for-libertarians-to-be-a-significant-force-in-us-politics/375972/"">.

Police say they broke up the crowd of about 150 in the suburb of Ferguson after being called to the scene of a disturbance after the curfew started.
A police car reportedly came under fire and a person was hurt in an apparently unrelated shooting in the same area.
Black teenager Michael Brown was shot by a white policeman on 9 August.
The shooting of the 18-year-old as he walked down a street drew allegations of police brutality among people in the mainly black suburb of Ferguson.
A riot erupted on Friday night, with local stores targeted by looters, after police named the officer who shot Mr Brown and also released CCTV from a shop where he apparently stole a pack of cigars and intimidated the owner just before his death.
A five-hour curfew, running from midnight (05:00 GMT), was imposed in response.
US civil rights leader Al Sharpton has said a peaceful rally, led by Michael Brown's family, is planned for later on Sunday.

'Ready to die'
Seven arrests were made when police moved to break up the protest at a barbecue restaurant.
Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who was put in charge of bringing calm back to Ferguson, said police had moved in after receiving a report of people breaking into the restaurant and climbing on to the roof.
As police were nearing the restaurant, a man with a handgun went into the street but ran away, AP news agency reports.
Someone also shot at a police car but it was not clear if it had been hit.
In the same area, a person was shot and critically wounded and police were searching for the attacker.
Demonstrators complained that the curfew would make matters worse.
As police prepared to move on the protesters during the night, a chant of ""No justice! No curfew!"" could be heard from the crowd, followed by ""We have the right to assemble peacefully"".
Jayson Ross, who was leading the protesters toward the police before tear gas was fired, was quoted as saying by AP: ""They got guns. We got guns. We are ready.""
Local politician Antonio French, who was with the protesters, {tweeted}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench/status/500879644007333888""> to say: ""Too many young men talking about they're ready to die tonight.""
'The world is watching'
Governor Jay Nixon said he would not allow a handful of looters to endanger the community.
""This is a test,"" he said. ""The eyes of the world are watching. We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.""
The US justice department is investigating the shooting of Mr Brown, with 40 FBI agents dispatched to Ferguson to gather information.
Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson revealed on Friday that the officer who shot Mr Brown was Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran with no previous complaints against him.
Mr Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting.
Commenting on the CCTV footage that was released, Chief Jackson said that Mr Wilson had not known Mr Brown was a robbery suspect.
The policeman had reportedly stopped the teenager for walking in the street, disrupting traffic.
Mr Brown's family condemned the release of the footage as a police attempt to ""justify the execution-style murder"".",NA,NA,NA,NA

Governor Jay Nixon {signed an order}<hyperlink=”http://governor.mo.gov/sites/default/files/Executive%20Order%2014-09.pdf""> to ""help restore peace and order"".
An independent autopsy has found Michael Brown, 18, was shot by a Ferguson police officer six times, including twice in the head.
On Sunday evening police dispersed angry crowds shortly before a second consecutive night under curfew began.
The mother of Michael Brown has called for the arrest of the officer who killed her son on 9 August. He has been suspended pending a full investigation.
Officials last week confirmed that Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran with no previous complaints against him, has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting.
In an interview with US media, Mr Brown's mother said the only way to restore peace in Ferguson was by ""arresting [Mr Wilson] and making him accountable for his actions"".
A preliminary post-mortem examination by the St Louis County Medical Examiner's office on the day after Mr Brown's death found he had been shot, police said, without disclosing how many times.
But a preliminary private post-mortem report has since revealed that he was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, {the New York Times reports}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html"">.
The probable fatal shot entered the top of Mr Brown's head, forensic pathologist Michael Baden was quoted by the paper as saying.
What is the National Guard?
Reserve group organised by the US Army and US Air Force.
Every US state and territory has a National Guard.
Can be called on by state governors during emergencies including riots and natural disasters.
Guard units may also be ordered into active duty for up to two years by the US president during national emergency.
Enlistment is voluntary
{Missouri National Guard}<hyperlink=”http://www.moguard.com/"">
Gunpowder residue suggested he was not shot at close range, but that finding could change once Mr Baden has access to the clothes Mr Brown was wearing at the time of his death, the newspaper reported.
He flew to Missouri on Sunday to conduct a separate autopsy at the request of the family.
After dark on Sunday, police in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, said they came under attack and had no alternative but to respond.
Capt Ron Johnson said protesters had shot at officers and thrown petrol bombs and bottles before the five-hour curfew started at midnight local time (05:00 GMT).
He described the violence as ""premeditated criminal acts"" intended to provoke a reaction. A number of people were injured during the unrest, and police made several arrests.
No major incidents were reported during the curfew, which has now ended.
Missouri declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew on Saturday in response to the escalating violence.
'Disservice to community'
The killing of Mr Brown by a white policeman in a street has inflamed racial tensions in the largely black suburb.
Officer Darren Wilson shot the teenager after reportedly stopping him for walking in the street.
The governor of Missouri has criticised police for releasing CCTV footage which apparently shows Mr Brown stealing cigars from a local shop some hours before his death.
Mr Nixon said the release of the footage ""appeared to cast aspersions"" on the dead man, saying ""it made emotions raw"".
But he also condemned the protesters: ""These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served and to feel safe in their own homes.""

BBC,bbc19,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28855811,Ferguson unrest: Egypt urges US to show restraint,NA,8/19/2014,11/12/2015,"Egypt's government has called on US authorities to show restraint against protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.
It said it was ""closely following the escalation of protests"" after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white policeman on 9 August.
The statement echoes US President Barack Obama's comments during Egypt's crackdown on protesters in 2013.
Correspondents say the criticism is unusual since Egypt gets about $1.5bn (£1bn) in aid from the US every year.
President Obama is under increasing pressure to bring an end to the violent scenes in the St Louis suburb.
It is now 10 days since Michael Brown's death, which sparked mass demonstrations.
Jay Nixon, the governor of Missouri, has ordered the National Guard to support police operations, but violence flared again on Monday night, with law enforcement officers arresting 31 people.
The statement from Egypt's foreign ministry followed a similar call from United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon, who called on Missouri police to abide by ""US and international standards"".
Iran added its voice to the criticism, with Majid Takht-Ravanchi, the deputy foreign minister for European and American Affairs, saying the unrest was a sign of ""the phenomenon of racism"" in the West.
Meanwhile Chinese state news agency Xinhua said that despite the US playing the role of an international human rights defender, the clashes showed ""there is still much room for improvement at home"".
""Obviously, what the United States needs to do is to concentrate on solving its own problems rather than always pointing fingers at others,"" the Xinhua editorial added.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Unrest flared hours after President Obama called for calm following the fatal police shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown on 9 August.
The US attorney general is due to visit Ferguson on Wednesday to meet federal officials investigating the killing.
The National Guard has been deployed to support police operations.
On Tuesday, police shot and killed a knife-wielding man four miles (6.4km) from the site of Mr Brown's killing.
Local police said witnesses reported the man behaving erratically, and that the man had come at two officers with the knife.
""The suspect turned toward officers, pulled out knife in an overhand grip, told officers to 'shoot me now, kill me now,'"" said St Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson.
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon announced the National Guard deployment on Monday, in addition to lifting a night-time curfew imposed on the weekend.
The killing of Mr Brown by a white policeman in a street has inflamed racial tensions in the largely black community of Ferguson.
Officer Darren Wilson shot the teenager last week after reportedly stopping him for walking in the street.
'Violent agitators'
Police Capt Ron Johnson said officers were forced to use tear gas and stun grenades on Tuesday after they came under ""heavy gunfire"" and were attacked with petrol bombs and bottles.
He said two people were hit by gunfire from demonstrators, insisting that officers did not use their weapons.
Capt Johnson appealed to demonstrators to protest in the daytime to prevent a ""tiny minority of law breakers"" from deliberately sparking violence.
""Anyone who has been at these protests understands that there is a dangerous dynamic in the night: it allows a small number of violent agitators to hide in the crowd and then attempt to create chaos,"" he told journalists.
Those arrested include people from other states, including New York and California, Capt Johnson said. Correspondents say this suggests the protests are becoming more organised.
In an earlier statement, US Attorney General Eric Holder said he would ""personally travel"" to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet FBI investigators and prosecutors.
""I realise there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to Michael Brown's death, but I ask for the public patience as we conduct this investigation,"" Mr Holder said.
He added that the investigation into the shooting of 18-year-old Mr Brown was ""a critical step in restoring trust between law enforcement and the community, not just in Ferguson, but beyond"".
Separately, President Barack Obama said he understood the ""passions and anger"" provoked by the death of the teenager.
But he also stressed that giving into anger ""by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos"".
Mr Obama said he recognised that in many communities in the US a ""gulf of mistrust"" existed between local residents and law enforcement.
""In too many communities, too many young men of colour are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,"" he said.

Earlier, a former New York pathologist hired by Mr Brown's family performed an independent post-mortem examination.
Dr Michael Baden said on Monday he believed six bullets struck the teenager, two in the head.
""All of the gunshot wounds could have been survivable, except the one at the top of the head,"" he said.
Dr Baden said there were no signs of a struggle, as abrasions around the teenager's face were likely from falling to the pavement after being shot.
He also believed Mr Wilson did not shoot him at close range as there was no gunpowder residue on his body, suggesting the officer was more than 2ft (60cm) away.
Witnesses have said Mr Brown was shot as he held his hands up in a position of surrender, while the police and supporters of Mr Wilson have said he fired during a fight with Mr Brown.
The officer who shot Mr Brown, Darren Wilson, has been suspended with pay since the shooting. Mr Brown's family have called for his arrest.
A third post-mortem on Mr Brown was conducted by the US justice department on Tuesday, in addition to examinations by Dr Baden and St Louis county officials.

The BBC's {World Have Your Say}<hyperlink=”http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002w559""> is on the ground, speaking to locals about the conflict.
Relatives of Michael Brown, 18, said the community has come together to support them in their time of need.
An unidentified male cousin of Mr Brown's told the BBC, ""It's hard but we're trying to get through it with all the support.""
An unnamed female relative described Brown as ""respectful"" and ""humble, very shy"".
""The violence that they're doing right now messing our community up, he wouldn't have wanted,"" she added. ""We're just keeping faith. We've got to have hope and pray because if you don't have hope and if you don't have faith and if you don't pray, we're not going to get justice.""
'Overkill'
Earlier, following a rally organised by civil rights activist the Reverend Jesse Jackson, he described Mr Brown's death as part of ""a pattern around the country of a black man being shot by white police, [falsely] arrested, stop and frisk, excessive jailing.""
""This is a kind of lynching in 2014,"" Mr Jackson added.
Residents in Ferguson echoed Mr Jackson's frustration with the treatment of African Americans by police.
""[I have] been harassed by police so therefore I definitely know where a lot of people are coming from when they say police can stop you and just harass you and say, 'Where you coming from or where you been?', "" an unidentified male resident told the BBC.
""I'm a grown man so why do I have to answer that? I haven't [done] nothing. Do you see me running? Did anybody call in?""
""Police abuse their authority. Some think that they're bigger than the law... When they stop us, they feel they've got more power than us,"" an unnamed man in a crowd said.
""It's power. They have the power, they feel we don't. That's why they do the things that they do. What they did to young Michael Brown, that's unnecessary. That's overkill.""
One unidentified man said he feared for his family's safety from overzealous authorities.
""As men in America, we don't feel safe right now. We don't feel like we can protect our children,"" he said. ""I have a son that's driving right now and I'm worried about him when he's on these roads. I have a wife and I'm worried about her.""
'Disheartening'
More people said what had occurred in Ferguson represented a growing national problem.
""It's just disheartening to hear that the police had to shoot that young man so many times,"" one local resident said. ""It's just a case where we as a community don't feel safe right now, not only [in] St Louis but also any other major city in the United States.""
Shawn, also a Ferguson resident, said, ""These are our young black men that are being gunned down in the streets all over America.""
""The perpetrators seem to always get off. So it sends a message around the country and around the world that you can slay young black men at any point and as long as you're Caucasian... you can get away with it. Right now what's going on is a big fight from our African American people... We can't keep allowing these things to happen.""
Shenae, a resident of nearby Jennings, said authorities' efforts to break up protests were about maintaining not law and order, but the status quo.
""They are trying to silence our voice. It's not about trying to keep order or trying to keep safety. It's about trying to keep us quiet so there is no change, there is no progress,"" she said. ""So acts like what occurred to Mike Brown can continue to happen in our community. It's not the first time and it will not be the last.""
'Rollercoaster'
Meanwhile, some people who spoke with the BBC described the protests in Ferguson largely as peaceful and communal, with a shared sense of purpose.
Sarah from nearby University City has spent four days in Ferguson.
""What they're not showing in a lot of the media is how diverse these groups of people coming out are and how welcoming everybody is,"" she said. ""It's really wonderful to be in this community right now. There's so much love and support.""
Another man described efforts by young men to protect several local stores and the greater community from looters.
""People care about this community and the people who are looting are not necessary residents of Ferguson. They're opportunists,"" he said. ""It's really really sad to see that people still want to take advantage of the situation and feel that it's right to loot. But one sin is not greater than another and ignorance does not justify ignorance.""
Chris Philips called the days since Brown's death ""a really intense rollercoaster"".
""I've seen good peaceful protests but then I've also seen a lot of violence. I've seen a lot of anger and animosity toward the police on both sides,"" he said. ""I've sucked up that tear gas on two different occasions. It's been a really rough week and the way things have been going, I don't know when the end is going to come to it.
""And I think there's a lot of people like myself who are frustrated in this community and want to see justice done.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Eric Holder will go to the town on Wednesday to meet officials in charge of a federal investigation into the killing of Michael Brown on 9 August.
President Barack Obama urged the local community to ""try to unite each other"".
Police fired tear gas amid a tense stand-off with protesters.
Footage showed the police arresting several protesters, as lines of armed officers faced up to crowds of protesters.
A photographer working for Getty Images agency was among those arrested, though he was freed after a few hours.
The National Guard has been deployed to support police operations, and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon on Monday lifted a night-time curfew in the town.
Although the town appeared tense and there were localised flare-ups, the protests were generally peaceful.
'Critical step'
In a statement, Mr Holder said he would ""personally travel"" to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet FBI investigators and prosecutors.
""I realise there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to Michael Brown's death, but I ask for the public patience as we conduct this investigation,"" Mr Holder said.
And he stressed that the investigation into the shooting of 18-year-old Mr Brown was ""a critical step in restoring trust between law enforcement and the community, not just in Ferguson, but beyond"".
Separately, President Obama said he understood the ""passions and anger"" provoked by the death of the teenager.
But he said giving into anger ""by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos"".
""It undermines rather than advances justice,"" he said.
'Objects of fear'
Mr Obama said he recognised that in many communities in the US a ""gulf of mistrust"" existed between local residents and law enforcement.
""In too many communities, too many young men of colour are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,"" he said.
But he urged the community to look for understanding, and seek to heal.

Earlier, a former New York pathologist hired by Mr Brown's family to perform an independent autopsy into his shooting gave his findings.
Dr Michael Baden said he believed six bullets struck Mr Brown, two of which may have re-entered.
""All of the gunshot wounds could have been survivable, except the one at the top of the head,"" he said.
Position of surrender
Dr Baden said there were no signs of a struggle, as abrasions around the teenager's face were likely from falling to the pavement after being shot.
He also believed Mr Wilson did not shoot him at close range as there was no gunpowder residue on his body, suggesting the officer was at least 2ft away.
Witnesses have said Mr Brown was shot as he held his hands up in a position of surrender, while the police and supporters of Mr Wilson have said he fired during a fight with Mr Brown.
The officer who shot Mr Brown, Darren Wilson, has been suspended with pay since the shooting.
Mr Brown's family have called for the officer to be arrested and prosecuted.
Another autopsy on Mr Brown will be conducted by the US justice department, in addition to examinations by Dr Baden and St Louis county officials.

US Attorney General Eric Holder has ordered a federal post-mortem on the body of Michael Brown, 18, to take place ""as soon as possible"".
The bullets did not appear to have been shot from very close range due to the lack of gunpowder on the victim's body, forensic pathologist Michael Baden was quoted by the paper as saying.
He flew to Missouri on Sunday to conduct a separate autopsy at the request of the family.
At the scene: Ben James, BBC News, Ferguson
The Quick Trip is the convenience store on a petrol station forecourt in Ferguson, wrecked in violence a week ago. They call it the Ground Zero of the unrest in Ferguson.
Parked there after 21:00 on Sunday evening, we could see clouds rise up behind it as police began to disperse the protests on West Florissant Avenue, with a helicopter beaming down a spotlight.
We could also hear the sirens of the acoustic weapons used to clear people out.
When ""flash-bangs"" exploded on the forecourt, a bit like a ground-level firework display, designed to move people on, we drove down a side street as the crowd ran towards us.
Several of them were spluttering and pouring bottles of water into their eyes as they felt the effects of tear gas. We saw one young woman collapse to the floor as she struggled to breathe, although she recovered some time later.
Protesters around me at an intersection on the edge of the neighbourhood are asking why the police dispersed what they say was a peaceful protest, more than two hours before the scheduled curfew.
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has criticised police for releasing CCTV footage which apparently shows Michael Brown stealing some hours before he was shot.
He said the release of the footage ""appeared to cast aspersions"" on the dead man, who was not stopped by police on suspicion of robbery when he was shot.
""It made emotions raw,"" Mr Nixon told US broadcaster ABC on Sunday.
The killing of Mr Brown by a white policeman in a street on 9 August has inflamed racial tensions in the largely black suburb.
Demonstrators complained that the curfew would make matters worse.
Autopsy moves
The US justice department is investigating the shooting of Mr Brown, with 40 FBI agents dispatched to Ferguson to gather information.
A preliminary autopsy by the St Louis County Medical Examiner's office on the day after Mr Brown's death found he had been shot, police said, without disclosing how many times.
But in a private autopsy report, Dr Baden said Mr Brown was shot four times in his right arm and twice in his head, the New York Times reveals.
Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson confirmed on Friday that the officer who shot Mr Brown was Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran with no previous complaints against him.
Mr Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting.

The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown sparked often violent protests, looting and rioting across Ferguson, Missouri, over the past three days. Some commentators have now dubbed the suburb  {“Fergustan”}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/AnupKaphle”> on social media, suggesting the area now resembles a {“war zone”}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ferguson%20war%20zone&src=typd”>.
President Barack Obama said on Thursday that there was ""no excuse for excessive force"" by police, while also condemning violence against officers.
Eyewitnesses say Mr Brown raised his arms in an attempt to surrender before he was shot by an officer, but police say there was a struggle.
As local and county police have taken to the streets to contain the unrest, many have questioned whether their show of force has been too excessive.
In one photo, police officers are responding to the protests in armoured vehicles, initially developed to withstand improvised explosive devices.
Other photos show police wearing army green shirts and camouflage pants, similar to the uniforms of US marines, and {carrying guns}<hyperlink=""http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8”> based on the military-used M4 carbine.
Videos reveals smoke clouds of what appears to be tear gas, inundating empty streets that were at one point {filled with protesters}<hyperlink=""https://vine.co/v/MYZZnHvrlq6”>.
Images like these have led many commentators to question how the small suburb of Ferguson could have turned into a ""war zone"" overnight.
""Some of the images we're seeing are indiscriminate shows of force - the stopping of people and the pointing guns at people,"" says Radley Balko, who has written two books on the militarisation of US police.
""This is slowly becoming a default reaction in emergency situations - the only way to stop a situation is an overwhelming force and turning large sections of cities into martial law zones.""
Much of the military gear that police departments use is distributed by the Department of Defence at a small cost to police, says Balko. Local police departments only have to pay for the gear's transportation and upkeep.
he police in Ferguson have defended firing tear gas and rubber bullets, saying the crowds refused to disperse and some of the protesters were throwing rocks and firing guns.
At a press conference on Thursday police chief Thomas Jackson said the tactical units would be back on the streets tonight. ""It's a powder keg. We all recognise that.""
Norm Stamper, the police chief who led the much-criticised police response to the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle, believes there are times when the police need to militarise.
""For active shooter cases, hostage situations, and school shootings and so forth, you had better be ready to respond to all of that. It's irresponsible not to,"" he says.
But he does not think the disturbances in Ferguson justify it, because this type of force should be used in moderation and with the community in mind.
""That means [having an] open and honest forthright conversation that requires police to recognise their role as peacekeepers and peacemakers, rather than escalating their show of force.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

Today's must-read
There are sensible conservative responses to the ongoing violence in Ferguson, Missouri following the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Unfortunately, {writes}<hyperlink=""http://www.nationalreview.com/article/385162/rights-wrong-reaction-missouri-shooting-charles-c-w-cooke”> the National Review's Charles CW Cooke, many of his ideological brethren are going about choosing another route.
Instead of cautioning against a rush to judgment, denouncing the rioting as counterproductive or offering evidence that white-on-black violence is not prevalent, he writes, many seem eager to point out that black-on-black violence is the real problem.
""It is indisputably true that the United States has a problem with blacks killing blacks,"" Cooke writes. ""And yet this has absolutely nothing to do with the question at hand, which is: 'Did a police officer unjustifiably kill an unarmed black man in Missouri?'""
He continues:
""It is feasible, is it not, to be worried about the internecine violence in America's inner cities and to want to get to the bottom of an allegedly unwarranted shooting? So why the conflation? After all, whether or not it is intentional, reacting to a community's grief by raising an entirely separate topic smacks largely of distraction - of reflexively throwing up a roadblock to what is a legitimate line of inquiry in the hope that the subject might swiftly be changed.""
Police shootings like the one in Missouri ""open old and real wounds"", Cooke says. Conservatives should acknowledge that.
Moreover, he adds, police shootings have the ""imprimatur of the state"", which makes them more disturbing than civilian violence:
""Even if the United States did not boast a history in which blacks were routinely disfavoured, beaten, and even murdered by the governments that were ostensibly established to protect them, there would still be something distinct about being killed or hurt by a man in uniform.""
With Cooke's criticism in mind, then, consider the following passage from an on-the-scene in East St Louis, Illinois, {piece}<hyperlink=""https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/383587/where-sidewalk-ends”> by National Review's Kevin Williamson that also currently appears the magazine's website:
""'Hey, hey craaaaaacka! Cracka!White devil! F*** you, white devil!' The guy looks remarkably like Snoop Dogg: skinny enough for a Vogue advertisement, lean-faced with a wry expression, long braids. He glances slyly from side to side, making sure his audience is taking all this in, before raising his palms to his clavicles, elbows akimbo, in the universal gesture of primate territorial challenge. Luckily for me, he's more like a three-fifths-scale Snoop Dogg, a few inches shy of four feet high, probably about nine years old, and his mom - I assume she's his mom - is looking at me with an expression that is a complex blend of embarrassment, pity and amusement, as though to say: 'Kids say the darnedest things, do they not, white devil?'""

Since that time, supporters of the officer have made their presence known online and on the streets of St Louis.
Two Facebook groups boast thousands of members and a fundraiser in his name has brought in more than $10,000 (£5,980). Family members of the military and law enforcement officers have offered their support.
The initial reluctance to name Mr Wilson was a contributing factor to the growing unrest in Ferguson, where Governor Jay Nixon has called in the National Guard to help restore order.
Mr Wilson has allegedly left the area out of safety concerns and his home is being guarded by police.
After the shooting he was placed on administrative leave. His supporters say Mr Wilson was just doing a difficult job.
This weekend members of a Facebook group called I Support Officer Wilson held a silent protest outside a Missouri television station to draw attention to what they say is media bias in the case.
The page has become a place for supporters to share their opinions. On the site, administrators aim to be respectful and weed out racist comments, saying their aim is not denigrating Michael Brown and his family but supporting Mr Wilson and other law enforcement officers.
""As the police stand tall and strong while not wavering to the stress of not being able to express themselves we are here gathered to be a voice for them,"" the administrator of the Facebook page wrote when it received 7,000 likes.
Another Facebook group, Support Darren Wilson, also had about 25,000 followers before it went offline on Monday evening. That group started an online donation campaign, which is still ongoing, and is selling T-shirts to raise money for Mr Wilson.
""We stand behind Officer Darren Wilson and his family during this trying time in their lives. All proceeds will be sent directly to Darren Wilson and his family for any financial needs they may have including legal fees,"" reads the Go Fund Me page.
In St Louis, a local bar hosted a fundraiser for Mr Wilson over the weekend. Barney's Sports Pub offered free wings to supporters, who signed placards and made donations.
Other local organisations have turned out to support the Ferguson police.
A human rights charity has collected over $1,500 (£900) and a lorry full of food to help support the officers on the ground, who have been working long shifts with little downtime.
""They are charged with trying to keep peace amidst a really tenuous situation, but it's so easy to make them look like the bad guys,"" says Pat Bradley, founder of CrisisAid. He said before deciding to start the drive, his group discussed how they would be perceived.
Ultimately they decided it was a public service.

Several stores were looted and bottles thrown in the area of a convenience store, shown in CCTV footage released by police to demonstrate that Michael Brown, 18, was a robbery suspect.
The footage appears to show Mr Brown stealing and intimidating the owner.
The unrest came despite an appeal for calm by Mr Brown's family.
It said their son was not ""perfect"" but criticised what they see as a police attempt to ""justify the execution-style murder"".
""Stay with us, we don't want to see any violence on the streets. Please continue to peacefully protest,"" said Michael Brown's cousin, Eric Davis.
Police later said that the officer who shot Mr Brown did not know he was a robbery suspect.
Protests turn violent
The killing sparked days of angry clashes between police and protesters, but demonstrations on Friday had been mostly peaceful.
A few hundred people demonstrated quietly at a filling station. which was looted and burnt last weekend.
But after midnight on Saturday local time (0500 GMT) more than 100 protesters gathered on the street near the convenience store.
Reports say that some protesters broke into the store while others tried to block their way, apparently to prevent looting.
Riot police arrived on the scene calling for the crowd to disperse.
They were met with stones and bottles, and responded with tear gas and pepper spray.
Civil rights leader Al Sharpton says a peaceful rally, led by Michael Brown's family is planned for Sunday.
""The family have never said that Mike Brown was perfect,"" said a lawyer representing them.
Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer who shot Mr Brown did not know that he had allegedly stolen goods from a nearby store.
""The initial contact between the officer and Michael Brown was not related to the robbery,"" he said.
Instead, he added, the reason for the stop was that Mr Brown ""was walking down the middle of the street stopping traffic"".
Mr Jackson said he had released the footage of the crime only because he had been forced to do so because of numerous freedom of information requests from journalists.
He described the robbery at the convenience store as being committed without the use of a weapon.
CCTV pictures in a police report show a well-built black man intimidating a clerk in the store.
The police report identifies the man as Mr Brown, described as being 6ft 4in (193cm) and 292 pounds (132kg).
It says he ""grabbed a box of Swisher Sweet cigars"" and handed them to a second suspect identified as Mr Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson.
Since the shooting on Saturday, Mr Johnson has given a number of interviews in which he has said Mr Brown held up his hands in an act of surrender before being shot by the officer.
Also on Friday Mr Jackson revealed the name of the officer who shot and killed Mr Brown - Darren Wilson - and said he was injured in a struggle with Mr Brown.
Mr Wilson, is a six-year veteran of the police force with no disciplinary record, Mr Jackson said.
Members of the majority black Ferguson community have reacted angrily to the revelations.
Ferguson resident Milton Jackson, 37, said: ""I don't believe what the officer did was called for. Even if there was a robbery, it was unnecessary force to shoot an unarmed black man.""
US Attorney General Eric Holder said the use of military equipment and vehicles in Ferguson had sent a ""conflicting message"", while President Barack Obama said there was no excuse for police using ""excessive force"".

BBC,bbc44,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28801591,Teenagers and the news game,Rory Cellan-Jones,8/15/2014,12/3/2015,"Any parent of a teenager, particularly one of the male variety, will know that their conversation can be, well, limited. So my wife was surprised earlier this week when our 16-year-old son suddenly asked her what she thought about ""this terrible stuff that's been happening in Ferguson"".
There followed an apparently well informed account of events in the US town {where a young black man had been shot dead by police}<hyperlink=”http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28798951"">. She went on to discuss with him America's troubled past when it came to race relations, and more words came tumbling from this often monosyllabic young man.
Now, at the time of their discussion coverage in the UK mainstream media of the Ferguson story had been pretty sparse. In any case, our son watches barely any television and certainly does not read newspapers. Neither is he much of a user of social networks, having abandoned Facebook as ""boring"" and never joined Twitter. So where has he got his information?
""From friends in games, and from games forums,"" he explains. He does spend a lot of time online playing what seem to be very sociable games - League of Legends for instance - where live chat to other players is an important feature. He says many of his online friends are American and they have been talking about events in Ferguson. They share links to news stories and he has also found that gaming forums are full of chatter about it.
This all set me thinking about the fast changing landscape that often seems a threat to the future of journalism. This week, for instance, the viral news-and-cats site Buzzfeed {got a $50m investment}<hyperlink=”http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28747420""> from one of Silicon Valley's leading venture capital funds, and now has a valuation higher than old media giants like the Washington Post. (This, by the way is a subject we'll discuss on today's edition of {Tech Tent}<hyperlink=”http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01plr2p"">).
So is my anecdote good or bad news for the future of journalism? The positive side is that a 16-year-old - and many like him - is probably better informed this week about some global events than many older people who rely exclusively on the mainstream media.
But, I hear you ask, what is the quality of the news he is absorbing - isn't it just a load of ill-informed internet gossip and social media backchat? Drilling down into what he actually read about Ferguson, it appears that much of it was on good old-fashioned news sites and written by professional journalists, perhaps even those working for the Washington Post, whose reporter was arrested by police in Ferguson this week.
But how much longer will those journalists still be in jobs? The internet and indeed much of mainstream media is very good at opinion, instant analysis, and fast reports of breaking events. It is much less proficient in the often dull and expensive business of putting reporters on the ground everywhere from local council meetings to warzones to gather informed accounts of complex events.
New media platforms like Buzzfeed and Vice will protest - with some justification - that they are now investing in journalism rather than simply repackaging other people's work. But the scope of that investment still looks very limited. Will Buzzfeed keep a reporter in Gaza, in Ukraine, even in smalltown America for years on end?
Two conclusions then. Let's not be too depressed about teenagers and news because they are getting plenty of it, just via different means than their parents. But the challenge for journalists is to find new ways of reaching them while building a reputation as trusted guides to what is happening in the world. And, as we know, ""trust"" and ""journalist"" is not an obvious piece of word association for many people these days.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Mr Xi has pledged to build ""several new media groups that will be strong, influential and credible"".
Observers have noted that traditional media outlets including state-run papers and TV stations are losing their audience to new media platforms.
Several papers note that this is the first time Mr Xi has spoken about the integration of traditional and new media outlets.
""It is very significant that the president urged publicity officials to intensify their 'internet thinking'. Such remarks indicate that the top leaders are fully aware of new trends in the media industry,"" Chen Lidan, a journalism professor at Renmin University, tells the {China Daily}<hyperlink=""http://www.nationalreview.com/article/385162/rights-wrong-reaction-missouri-shooting-charles-c-w-cooke”>.
Ma Xiaolin, a veteran journalist and commentator in Beijing, adds that Mr Xi ""aims to set up an entirely connected media network that will be able to best serve the public interest"".
An article in the {Haiwai Net}<hyperlink=""http://opinion.haiwainet.cn/n/2014/0819/c456317-20982767.html”> noted that the announcement was not a ""sudden move"".
""Mr Xi's speech did not appear out of the blue. In the past 20 years, he has been writing on media issues,"" it says.
The commentary notes that the mainstream media have become marginalised and have not been able to steer public opinion.
""The current leadership has strengthened its supervision of traditional media. On the other hand, it is pinning down on illegal internet news and even set up new regulations to control information on new media tools such as WeChat messaging service. Hence, it is not difficult to understand the intention of the top leaders,"" says an article in the {Shanghai Securities Times}<hyperlink=""http://jrz.cnstock.com/yw/201408/3144939.htm”>.
The article predicts that more resources will be pumped into bigger state media outlets like Xinhua, CCTV and People's Daily, while other non-state new media groups will be encouraged to ""build closer relations"" with their state-run counterparts.
