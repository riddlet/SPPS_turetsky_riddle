Two officers on Thursday afternoon sat in the cab of an RV-style mobile command vehicle, ""Detroit Police Community Services"" decals on the side, at the corner of Berkshire and Nottingham where the incident unfolded.

They would not tell MLive Detroit why they were parked there.

Detroit Police Officer Jennifer Moreno of the Public Information Office said the police truck's presence was ""completely unrelated and separate"" to the officer shooting and conflict that arose afterward Wednesday.

Detroit police shot one of the two suspects involved in the alleged illegal gun transaction. He suffered a nonfatal injury and has since been released from the hospital and transferred to jail, Moreno told MLive Thursday.

Moreno said at about 5:30 p.m. Wednesday police attempted to arrest two suspects near Nottingham and Berkshire. When an officer exited his vehicle, the driver tried to run him over and sideswiped the police cruiser.

""The officer did fire shots and, I believe, struck the passenger,"" Moreno said. ""Both suspects got out and tried to run but were arrested.""

Police say onlookers became unruly during the investigation that followed.

""In light of several incidents taking place across the country, they were yelling different statements that the police department was not conducting a thorough investigation,"" Deputy Chief Rene Hall {told WXYZ, Channel 7 Action News.}<hyperlink=”http://www.wxyz.com/news/region/detroit/suspects-use-ak-47-to-shoot-at-detroit-police-two-in-custody”>  ""The crowd got rowdier and ... we had to call in additional units to assist us.""

At one point, police say a man crossed the police line marked with yellow caution tape and assaulted an officer. Police pepper-sprayed and arrested the man.

While police dealt with the heated Detroit crowd, officers in St. Louis and the suburb of Ferguson engaged in clashes with residents protesting the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed man, by Ferguson police on Aug. 9.

The death sparked violence Wednesday. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and other projectiles at police. Law enforcement launched tear gas and rubber bullets at residents.

“My view is to keep dialogue with the community open,” Police Chief James Craig {told Detroit News reporter George Hunter}<hyperlink=”http://www.detroitnews.com/errors/404/”> Thursday. “There may have been some upset over Ferguson and expressed their frustration during our investigation.”

Moreno said: ""I don't know if there was just hostility because of the police shooting or if it did have something to do with the abundance of media coverage on the"" Ferguson, Mo. incident.

Residents say the Detroit police command center vehicle had been parked at the intersection for at least two hours Thursday.

As many as a dozen people sat on a porch across the street. Most refused to comment, but 16-year-old Asia Kenney, who lives in the area, said she witnessed it all.

""There was one cop car, they didn't turn their sirens on, they didn't turn their lights on and they ran into his car ... and he ended up on the curb,"" she said. ""He came off the curb, and as soon as he came off the curb they started shooting at him.

""All I know is they ran into him, didn't give him a warning, a chance to stop or anything.""

She said kids were ""covering their ears, running up and down the block.""

""Everyone out here saw what happened and they felt like it was wrong,"" said Kenney.

She didn't remember anyone invoking the Michael Brown incident as tensions rose.

""One man, he was outside the tape and he went around it and they just beat him and maced him for nothing,"" said Kenney. ""They told him to turn around; he wouldn't turn around.”

He made the comments during a press conference outside a vandalized building on the city's west side, where five graffiti writers were chased and arrested last week.

A crowd of residents gathered and cheered police as they announced charges against the suspected vandals.

""You have community members standing here with the police today,"" said Craig, pointing to the crowd.

""This is the Detroit Police Department and community relationship. We have community police officers... I'm not going to let the media take this thing and spin it to suggest we're on the brink of civil unrest.""

The governor of Missouri on Monday called in the National Guard on Monday for assistance quelling unrest there after an unarmed black teenager was fatally shot by a white police officer Aug. 9.

""That tells me that there's been no relationship with the community,"" said Craig, who, before coming to Detroit last year, worked in Cincinnati and Los Angeles, two cities that have seen major riots over police using fatal force in the past.

""The underlying issues, there's no relationship between the police department and that community.""

Both men in the vehicle were suspects in an alleged illegal gun transaction.

A crowd gathered after the non-fatal shooting, some yelling at police, and one man crossed caution tape that surrounded the scene and was pepper-sprayed.

Additional police units had to be called to calm the situation.

But Craig said the majority of the crowd was supportive of police action in the neighborhood.

""Detroit is not the next Ferguson,"" he said.

Craig in response said he's repeatedly invited Scott to meet with him and present specific grievances and that an invitation stands for him to join a external advisory committee.

Police donning riot gear engaged with protestors, at times training weapons on them from atop military equipment in the streets, according to The Associated Press. Some demonstrators reportedly threw Molotov cocktails at the officers while tear gas aimed to dispel the crowd encompassed neighborhood blocks.

Two reporters working for The Washington Post and The Huffington Post say they were detained by police and assaulted because they did not leave a McDonald's fast enough.

Both were released shortly thereafter without charges.

Amash, a libertarian-leaning congressman, cited the local authorities' vigorous response and use of ""military tactics"" as cause of the escalating violence. [tweetbegin 499740253633388546 tweetend]

Watson, 21, and other HUSA members helped gather more than 200 students in the school’s Cramton Auditorium on Wednesday, Aug. 13, to shoot the photo. Fellow student Ikenna Ikeotuonye photographed the students with their hands up in the air to symbolize solidarity in the wake of Brown’s death. The hashtag “Don’t shoot,” accompanied the photo, which was the idea of HUSA member Khalil Saadiq. [tweetbegin 500025355860979712 tweetend] [tweetbegin 499742591832035330 tweetend]

Witnesses say an unarmed Brown, 18, raised his hands at the time of the Aug. 9 fatal shooting involving a Ferguson, Mo. Police officer – now identified as Darren Wilson.

Protesters have since taken to the streets with the message, “Hands up, don’t shoot.”

Shortly after the Howard University photo was taken, it was shared and re-tweeted thousands of times on social media. Since then, similar photos have popped up on {Twitter}<hyperlink=”https://twitter.com/54HUSA”>, {Facebook}<hyperlink=”https://www.facebook.com/howarduniversity”> and {Instagram}<hyperlink=”https://www.instagram.com/”>.

“I wanted to do something. The students here are not naïve. They wanted to do something,” Watson, a 2011 Lowell High School graduate, said during an interview with MLive and The Grand Rapids Press on Friday, Aug. 15. “But the photo itself doesn’t have a solution – it doesn’t push anything. It’s more about what we are going to do about this.”

Watson, who was not in the picture, and his student association staff also helped organize a community prayer vigil for the residents of Ferguson and the entire nation on Thursday, Aug. 14. They plan to participate in an exploratory economic committee during the Historically Black College and Universities Conference in September.

Watson has been discussing the Ferguson shooting with his father, Glenn Watson, a former Grand Rapids Police officer. He explained that a police monitoring program – where officers wear a camera on their person – could help resolve future incidents like the one that happened in Ferguson.

“It’s all about police accountability,” said Leighton Watson, who has been interviewed by CNN and NPR. “As an officer, you have to justify every single shot as far as being in imminent fear for life.”

The Howard University senior studying English and political science said he has been profiled numerous times by the police because of his race – black. While Watson was not necessarily surprised by the incident in Ferguson, he was surprised by the rallying support across the nation.

“It happens all too often,” he said. “In this case, the circumstances are so extreme that people are outraged by it.”

While details continue to emerge a week following the shooting, Watson hopes his and his fellow Howard University students’ efforts instigate a change in police department policies and cultures throughout the country.

“We can’t legislate people’s stereotypes and presumptions -- that’s where I think it has to be a cultural shift,” he said. “I think demonstrations are part of the solution. … But I don’t think there has to be a martyr in order for change to take place. I’m excited to see students willing to be part of the solution rather than reaction, and I think we’ll come up with a successful solution to this.”

Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by a police officer Saturday, Aug. 9, in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo.

Though there are differing accounts of the details that led to Brown's death, the event sparked looting, protests and accusations, and nationwide expressions of solidarity with those in Ferguson, Mo.

Lauren Whitmer of Jackson helped coordinate Jackson's vigil in Bucky Harris Park at the corner of N. Jackson Street and W. Michigan Avenue.

""I'm here as a human being saying, 'Hey, I don't suffer this and no one else should be either,'"" Whitmer said.

Dialogue about Brown's death has stirred many feelings, and often centers on race.

""We think things are better here than they are in Missouri, but we're still a city that's segregated in many ways,"" said the Rev. Cynthia Landrum of the Universalist Unitarian Church of East Liberty in Clarklake.

Anthony Coffie, a longtime resident of Jackson and a member of the Jackson Area Civil Rights Awareness Association, said many people become concerned about current events but fail to address the roots of the problem.

""I believe that we need to have education on both sides when it comes to the issue of police violence toward citizens,"" Coffie said.

Growing up in the city, Coffie said he never felt any undue pressure from the police.

Several vigils and protests in Missouri and elsewhere in the aftermath of Brown's death began peacefully but turned violent. Those in Jackson bore in mind the reason for their gathering and closed calmly with songs.

In a prayer, Landrum said, ""May there be peace, may there be justice, may there be freedom and equality in our time.""",130,71,NA,NA

Participants in a peaceful rally gathered at both Rosa Parks Circle and Calder Plaza at different times Saturday.

They prayed and at the end of the event at Rosa Parks, they began chanting ""Hands up means don't shoot.""

Tension in Ferguson, Mo., has escalated since 18-year-old Michael Brown, who is black, was shot by a white police officer a week ago.

By some accounts, Brown had his hands in the air when he was shot, possibly after a struggle with the officer.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew Saturday in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, because of looting that had occurred.

In Grand Rapids, rally organizer Duke Turley said he simply wanted to create awareness about cases of police brutality.

""I can't necessarily say it's a black and white issue. Police brutality can happen with both blacks and whites,"" he said.

""But how many times have you seen a black cop shoot a black kid down?"" he asked.

Rally participant Aarie Wade said she believes the strife in Ferguson is an ""important issue.""

""It's something people need to be made aware of,"" she said. ""We need to crack down on police actions on how they treat people. We need to stand up for all of our rights.""

""This rally is significant for our local and national community, as we denounce the militarization of our police forces across the country,"" event organizer and {Kalamazoo}<hyperlink=”http://topics.mlive.com/tag/Kalamazoo/”> resident Shannon Sykes, the mother of two African American male children, said.

The protest is set to occur at 2 p.m. Eastern time in response to a similar event scheduled to take place in Ferguson, Mo. at 1 p.m. Central time, Sykes said.

""The idea is that we will be standing in protest at the exact same time they are,"" she said.

In addition to the events in Missouri and Michigan, Sykes that there will be events across the country taking place simultaneously in an effort to address the same issue.

Fifty to 100 people are expected to attend the 30-45-minute event, which will feature speeches by Kalamazoo City Commissioner Stephanie Moore, Kalamazoo Gay and Lesbian Resource Center executive director Jay Maddock, 60th District House candidate Jon Hoadley and pastor Strick Strickland, Sykes said.

""This just another incident of police brutality,"" said Johnson, a Milwood neighborhood resident. ""The problem here is the officer stepped across the line. It sheds some light on gun violence. Guns in America create problems for Americans.""

The protest in {Kalamazoo}<hyperlink=”http://topics.mlive.com/tag/Kalamazoo/”> coincided with numerous others unfolding across the country in an effort to address peace and justice, the death of teenager Michael Brown in Missouri and the increased militarization of local police forces, event organizer Shannon Sykes said.

Pastor Strick Strickland, Kalamazoo Gay and Lesbian Resource Center executive director Jay Maddock, 60th District state House candidate Jon Hoadley and Kalamazoo City Commissioner Stephanie Moore all gave brief speeches during the protest.

""Hands up, don't shoot!"" commissioner Moore shouted repeatedly during her speech.  ""Today is a day that we stand together, not for revenge, but for justice. Today is the day we say we are sick and tired of being sick and tired.  Our lives have value, each and every one of us.""

""You can never take back the loss of life,"" Sykes said. ""I know that there are varying details about what occurred, what Michael Brown might have been involved with beforehand, but any time you have a young man surrender, it's time to put the guns down.""

""We're here because regardless of what the details are, a mother lost her son,"" said Sykes, a Kalamazoo resident and mother of two African-American sons.

It is important to erase stereotypes and overcome bias about individuals, regardless of their skin color, for society to move forward, she said.

""What I think happens is that we have our stereotypes about each other -- don't get me wrong, we all do it,"" Sykes said. ""I'm guilty of this. We tend to see skin color before we do humanity. So I think what happens is especially for young black men, we very often see their skin color and see them as a threat.""

Police brutality and the militarization of local police forces also needs to be addressed, Sykes said. While police should be equipped with guns and bullet proof vests, ""What we don't need is these vehicles that are set up to drive through Iraq, on our city streets,"" she said. ""So there's a point where you go too far. There is a difference between making sure we're protected and making sure we're effective.""

Hoadley said he think Kalamazoo residents would welcome chances to work with law enforcement and each other to create solutions to curb violence.

""I'm optimistic that when we work together, when the best of humans in our communities come together, we can solve really big problems including issues of bias and violence and anger,"" he said. ""But we have to be willing to all work together to get that done and support the people that are doing it.""

""The response (in Missouri), which has been so well documented and clear, has been excessive,"" he said. ""When we saw shooting into neighborhoods, when we saw tanks, these are the concerns that to me shows that there was not a thoughtful plan, there was not an active set of listening.""

The solution, Hoadley said, is not ""more violence for violence.""

Mlive,mlive9,http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2014/08/saginaw_county_sheriff_getting.html,Saginaw sheriff dumping military vehicle made fun of by HBO comedy show,Brad Devereaux,08/19/14,02/17/17,"The day after a national news show highlighted the Saginaw County Sheriff's Mine-Resistant Ambush Proof (MRAP) vehicle during coverage of citizen-police clashes in Ferguson, Missouri, Sheriff Bill Federspiel confirmed that plans had already been laid for the vehicle to leave the county for good.

The sheriff's 19-ton MRAP was shown during a Sunday, Aug. 17, segment of HBO's ""Last Week Tonight with John Oliver"" entitled, ""Ferguson, MO and Police Militarization."" The host mentions Saginaw County's vehicle about 7:45 into the clip. 

The vehicle that the Saginaw County Sheriff's Department {received free of charge}<hyperlink=”http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2014/04/prepared_for_disaster_mine-res.html”> earlier this year from the U.S. Army was shown in a motorist's March 2014 Youtube video driving on a Saginaw street. 

The clip shows something a Saginaw County resident will only see again if they catch the vehicle driving out of town, Saginaw County Sheriff William Federspiel said Monday, Aug. 18. 

""I made the decision about a month ago to decommission that vehicle,"" Federspiel said, noting he did it based on financial concerns due to unforeseen maintenance costs.

While the military was to provide any needed parts, Federspiel said he still had to pay for a specialized mechanic to install the parts, along with insurance and fuel for the vehicle. 

When Saginaw County Commissioners asked him to look for cost-saving measures before setting the budget in July, the MRAP was the first thing to go, he said. 

The decision also came because Federspiel decided to direct funds from drug forfeitures into the county's general fund, he said. He previously planned to use drug forfeiture funds to pay for any costs associated with the MRAP and did so during the installation of a new starter and a new locking mechanism for the door since the vehicle has been in Saginaw County. 

When drug forfeiture funding was put into the county's general fund, Federspiel said it created a situation in which taxpayers might have to fund some of the costs of the MRAP, which also prompted him to send it back to the Army. 

He said the idea to get the vehicle came from former undersheriff Robert Karl, who was recently fired. The sheriff said he was ""a little hesitant"" but he agreed to get the vehicle and see if it would be useful. 

Federspiel said he has since spoken with administrators of the Michigan State Police and now feels comfortable that similar vehicles could be made available to the department if needed. 

About a month ago, Federspiel said he had members of the department remove the striping from the vehicle ""so no one would be tempted to use it.""

""Once I made the decision to decommission it, that's it,"" he said, adding, ""We had it for six or eight months and didn't use it once. Why keep it around?""

During the several months the department had the vehicle, Federspiel said he has not heard anything from constituents in support of or against the vehicle. 

When questions of police militarization came into the national news spotlight because of clashes between citizens and police over the police shooting of a man in Ferguson, Federspiel said he was surprised no one asked him about the vehicle. 

He said when the department commissioned the vehicle, it was a tool he planned to use only in the case of a natural disaster or an emergency, like an armored gunman with high-powered weapons.
